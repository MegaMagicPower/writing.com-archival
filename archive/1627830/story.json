He was dressed only in a night shirt and underwear, but also wore an expression of raw defeat as he looked out over his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, buddy?\u201d Darwin asked, poking his head out from his fishbowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You think I\u2019m too young to go through a midlife crisis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but continue. It\u2019s healthy to get this stuff off your chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m just wondering if this is it.\u201d Gumball indicated his messy room. \u201cI wake up, eat breakfast, go to school, eat again, stay in school, try not to incur Ms. Simian\u2019s wrath, come home, eat dinner, and go right to bed. And also maybe the occasional wacky hijinks that seems to follow me around like some obsessive stalker, but that\u2019s beside the point. Is this all I have to look forward to in life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you might\u2019ve forgotten a few things in that list,\u201d observed Darwin. \u201cLike homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball crossed his arms defiantly. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t forget. I simply chose to leave it out. But if you insist, that makes things even worse. Minus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s hanging with our friends in school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball made a sound like a buzzer. \u201cMost of those guys have tried to kill me at least once. Minus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Penny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinite plus! Granted, she\u2019s also tried to kill me a few times, but she\u2019s cute when she\u2019s mad, so I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the family. Mr. Dad, Mrs. Mom, and Anais.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Mixed bag. Sure, the unconditional love is nice, but we\u2019ve also tried killing each other on several occasions. Hmm. Now that I think about it, it seems like everything and everyone has tried to kill us at some point. I\u2019m putting this one in the minus pile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s me, the best friend/brother who\u2019s stuck by you through thick and thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball pursed his lips. \u201cOkay, yeah. That\u2019s also a big plus, but not enough to counterbalance the fact that the world seems out to get me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were having a midlife crisis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did too, but suddenly I\u2019m paranoid about all the things that seem to want me dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn all fairness, most of those things didn\u2019t happen without provocation. Not that it\u2019s an excuse,\u201d Darwin argued, \u201cbut we <i>do</i> have a talent for pissing people off. Maybe if we didn\u2019t do that so much, we\u2019d have fewer brushes with death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball tapped his chin thoughtfully. \u201cI see. So what you\u2019re saying is\u2026 we need to create some big, elaborate spectacle to win the town over and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot do that,\u201d Darwin cut him off. \u201cThat\u2019s usually the sort of thing that upsets people to begin with. Instead, I propose we live our best lives and try to get along with everyone in the hopes that they\u2019ll respond in kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Sounds boring, which just brings us right back to the midlife crisis.\u201d Gumball huffed and fell back against his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarwin rolled his eyes so hard that he tumbled in his bowl. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just in a rut. Would some wacky hijinks make you feel better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball shrugged. \u201cI guess. What\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarwin hummed thoughtfully. \u201cIt should be something exciting enough to pull you out of your rut, but not so exciting that it gives others the urge to kill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d In the blink of an eye, Gumball leapt from his bed, across the room, and hopped onto his computer. He jumped online and started hunting around for his idea. \u201cI heard Penny mention this a while ago, but was distracted by the melodious blowing of some leaves and forgot. Sounded pretty interesting, though. Ah ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarwin walked up to Gumball\u2019s side and stared questioningly at the website. \u201cVore? What\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball scrolled down to find a wide gallery of pictures depicting various acts under the broad umbrella of vore. \u201cIt looks like people eating each other, most of them are naked, and they\u2019re all making some really weird faces.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose pictures make me feel funny,\u201d admitted Darwin as he covered his fishy privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball looked down at the bulge poking up in his underwear. \u201cMe too. Hmm. Usually that thing\u2019s gone down by now, but it feels different this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould it be the pictures?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be the logical explanation. Clearly we must investigate this matter further,\u201d avowed Gumball seriously. \u201cI guess we could see what all the internet has to teach us, then try it out with our family and friends without properly consulting any adults beforehand, and see what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the most responsible plan, but it does sound like the perfect setup for wacky hijinks. <b>Let\u2019s do it!</b>\u201d Darwin deepened his voice to sound extra serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the boys began their journey down the rabbit hole. Luckily it was a Saturday, so they could afford to be a little lazy. They read on forums and explored a vast gallery of pictures. They even found quite a few familiar faces. Masami the cloud girl was doing some weird things to her mom\u2019s swimsuit area, Mr. Small seemed to be sinking himself into the lower back area of Principal Brown\u2019s fur, Hector eating Doughnut Sheriff, and just about everyone else in Elmore. It seemed like everyone in town was in on this, leaving Gumball and Darwin out in the cold. Well that ended today. Feeling that they\u2019d learned enough, the boys got dressed, marched straight down stairs, and confronted the first person they saw.</span></div></div>",

The creature slowly stalked toward you and bared its cruel fangs. You had no weapons, so you decided to create as much ruckus as possible in hopes of scaring the beast away. You unleashed the most terrifying growl in your repertoire, but the wolf-monkey only barked harsh laughter, and began to charge you. Thinking quickly, you reached behind you to the salt rock, scratched away small crystals with your fingernails, and flung them into the aberration's eyes. The family of otters watched in horror and fascination as the wolf-monkey howled in anguish, and ran off into the forest. The otters ran to their fallen companion, and reared up on their hind legs in an effort to keep you away from the body. However, your plan was never to use the dead otter for a snack, you were simply defending a nice creature that had helped you when you needed it. You told the otters to back down, and that you meant them no harm, and in a strangely human manner, they nodded, as if they understood your words, and crawled away with sullen gaits.<br>\r\n       You carried the dead otter for hours until you found a spot you thought would be good to bury your fallen guide. The other otters still trailed, and you could feel their defeated spirit. You thought the otter that was killed may have been their father. With their help, you began to dig a small hole, and in a matter of minutes, a shallow grave was created. You gently placed the deceased otter inside, and listened to the chirps and growls of its family, singing their last words in a heartbreaking manner. You shoveled the dirt back over the body, and packed the earth with your bare feet. You turned  around to see two of the otters carrying a beautiful green pine-cone, and they pressed the seed into the top of the loosened soil. \"What is going on here?\" you asked, \"What was that thing? Where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n        The otters stood on their hind legs once more, lifted their little furry paws, and pointed behind you over the tree-line. You saw a large plume of unhealthy smoke, and heard a faint grinding of gears. You also heard the faint sound of human voices. You thanked the otters, and they scampered off, back into the water, and swam in the direction of the forest. One last otter was left behind, and it grabbed your leg, as if beckoning you to follow it.</span></div></div>",

Amongst the twigs, leaves, and brush there was a fairly thick, five foot long, white branch. He knelt down to examine it, gently caressing its rough surface with the tips of his fingers. Along its length, every few inches, he tested its strength by applying minor force to bend it. When at last he was satisfied with its strength, Joseph lifted his uncut spear and with the blunt end, he stabbed the ground as if posing for a painting. <br>\r\nThe gralder cried out again. Joseph couldn\u2019t tell if it was calling for help, begging for mercy, or just crying in pain. As Joseph approached for a closer look on the flailing yelping creature, he couldn\u2019t help but pity the poor thing. Trying to get closer proved too hazardous as the thing slashed its claws at him. Even injured the damn thing\u2019s dangerous, Joseph thought to himself. Well of course it is you moron. He rebuttled. Frightened animals are always dangerous. That\u2019s why venomous snakes strike things they can\u2019t eat.<br>\r\nPulling himself back to reality, Joseph realized that the tree wasn\u2019t that thick. And from what he could see, the gralder didn\u2019t appear that injured. It could limp away and hunt otters until it healed. However, left in its current state it would probably attract all manner of predators looking for an easy meal. Joseph met eyes with the creature and marveled at its defiance against certain death. <br>\r\nIt was decided. Joseph found a suitable rock and placed it beside the tree. Then, jamming the branch beneath the tree to use as a wedge, applied all his strength onto the branch, and finally forced the tree to move. </span></div></div>",

She rose to her maximum height and immediately noticed that her right leg had reflexively pulled itself up. Knowing that she needed to test the extent of her injuries, she swayed from side to side, and rolled her shoulders. These movements were done with such a surprising rhythm that it could easily have been mistaken for dancing. Finally, she decided it was time to test her leg. With the will of a coyote who chews off its own captured leg and the bravery of a child going in for their annual shot, she lowered her leg to the ground. Placing her weight over it for all of an instant, she immediately pulled the broken leg back into the air with a yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph, who had been watching amusedly as the wild animal did it\u2019s jig, couldn\u2019t help but give a light chuckle at this new development. Especially upon the discovery that the creature was in fact not an it, but a her; given that nothing shook between its legs as it danced. Not to mention the six nipples on her chest that never shows up on males.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This caused the gralder to look up at Joseph. Its face was blank as its eyes surveyed the man whom spared her. Her eyes darted between him and the tree branch that he held between them. She realized that even if she weren\u2019t hurt, this was not a beast that she could hunt. Confused that he had not yet attacked, and even more confused that he had saved her, she turned from him and began sniffing through the twigs and found her way to the place where the otter had dropped. Picking it up with her still firm jaws, she turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With seemingly intelligent and humble movements, she approached the large pink thing. Seeing the stick lower in his relaxing hands, she assumed that he had guessed her intentions. However, this did not mean that he had ever stopped aiming the sharper end of the stick at her. She continued her approach until she was mere inches outside of the stick\u2019s range. Opening her mouth slightly, she let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naked pink thing almost completely relaxed his stick. He was in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position, when the gralder did something to make them both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

She flinched at the sound of his voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept winning their little staring contest game.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At first she seemed to be offering the otter out of gratitude, or some manner of peace offering. If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. Joseph thought to himself. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. They were in each other\u2019s territory now; her within reach of his spear/club, and him within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph got his answer as the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If this weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With his spear still trained on her head, Joseph pondered this for a few moments. Finally, he decided to do the only practical thing he could think of. Very slowly, Joseph lowered his spear, its tip descending from her forehead to her nose, her throat, chest, stomach, and at last falling upon the long dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a single motion he jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back, ready to fight off the gralder should this all have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. Joseph took another step back then another. Once he had reached twelve foot distance, he decided that it was safe to turn his back. Almost immediately the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following him, limping the whole way. It didn\u2019t take long for Joseph to notice. When he stopped she did as well. When he turned around she bowed her head. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game of stop and go continued for almost an hour before Joseph decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. He slowed his pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. He found another berry bush, eating his fill and then some, since he was unable to carry any with him. Then, looking at the dead otter still in his hand he confessed \u201cI\u2019m gonna make you into a berry pack.\u201d Joseph walked far enough forward so that the gralder stood where he had squatted to eat the berries. He waited a moment to see if she would eat any. To his relief she did.  At last the house was in sight. Still walking, Joseph decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning his head to face her, he called out \u201cHurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That evening, Joseph patrolled the area around the house, collecting as much fire wood as he could. He even found an impressively strong vine and a stick that looked like it would make a suitable splint. Another stick looked like it would make a good spit. He also found stones that would make excellent spark rocks. After he completed his foraging outside, he pointed at Gimp, telling her \u201cGimp. Stay.\u201d Joseph then stepped inside to see if there was anything he could use that he had missed from this morning. To his great surprise, there was. At first figured that it would be fruitless to check the drawers a second time, but it was still a necessary precaution. But when the first drawer opened, he practically leapt for joy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Only a total of eight cabinets and drawers had opened across the house. This might have been disappointing, had it not been for the fact that almost everything he found was of use. Joseph\u2019s new treasures included four boxes of matches, eighteen kitchen knives and two that could be useful in a fight, a bag full of various medicines, rags, towels, twelve spoons, two tool belts with holsters, a sewing kit, an ax, and much more. The final treasure he discovered was book containing detailed illustrations on the plants, creatures, and minerals of the forest. The title was Survival in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Joseph had come down from his present high, he remembered that he was hungry. The growls of his stomach grew ever louder as he began his work. He started by designating a spot for the fire by setting a circle of rocks and filling it with most of the dried wood he had collected earlier, with the exception of the pieces he had labeled the spit, splint, and the support for the spit which he set on either side of the fire pit. To Joseph\u2019s immense pride, it only took him four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire. Following the fire, he bled the otter, followed by skinning it with one of the more peculiar shipped knives. Once the skin had been cleaned and the meat gutted, Joseph proceeded to jam the spit through the otter\u2019s mouth and out the other end. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gimp sat a few yards away from the fire, but with each gust wind she was reminded of the delicious smell of cooked meat and inched her way forward. Joseph noticed this and considered the ways he could hide the smell from any unwanted guests. Setting his spear on the ground next to him, Joseph picked up the book read to the fading light of the setting sun. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia were categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. Before reading up on the goodies of Naxia, he decided to first look up its dangers. There were few venomous plants or animals and no threatening aquatic creatures. The chapter on the otters described them as adequately nutritious. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The meat finally seemed ready. Placing the book down, Joseph grabbed one end of the spit and brought it to his mouth. \u201cDelicious!\u201d The book failed to describe how good they tasted. As Joseph finished off the last bit of flesh, he thought to himself that it could have use a tiny bit of salt, but that could be handled tomorrow. Joseph used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After wiping his hands on a towel, he poured dirt onto the fire, packed up his gear and made his way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. Joseph climbed into bed while Gimp curled up beside him and they both enjoyed a nice long sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just a lazy Wednesday at the home of the Crystal Gems and Steven, nothing to do but lay around and watch some tv. That\u2019s what Amethyst was doing on Steven\u2019s bed right now, just staring at the screen seemingly alone. However, if one were paying attention, you\u2019d notice a tiny head with bushy dark hair sticking out of her cleavage trying to watch the tv too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay in there, Steve-O? I can change into something a lot more low cut if my shirts too high, or I can just go topless if you want?\u201d Amethyst offered as she peered down at the only one in the temple smaller than her. Steven was nestled nicely between her breasts, the huge purple mounds holding him firmly in place. Amethyst was proud to be the only one in the temple that could give Steven a good cleavage ride. Pearl was too small, and Garnet was too big, which always led to Steven getting trapped between her big knockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, I even have something to eat,\u201d the currently two-inch-tall Steven said as he held up a piece of popcorn that had landed in the purple gem\u2019s cleavage earlier. He took a big bite of it, which still left most of it untouched. As he enjoyed the buttery treat, Amethyst reached for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair, that\u2019s mine,\u201d she complained when seeing Steven had stolen some crumbs from her last big snack. It didn\u2019t matter that it was nothing more than a single piece of popcorn, it was hers. With a big grin on his face, Steven dove down into the crevice he had been poking out from, vanishing between the breasts where he hoped to enjoy his snack. He didn\u2019t even get time to take another bite before the purple walls next to him closed in tightly and started crushing his puny form. Gasping as he was smothered in the soft and supple gem boob flesh, he wiggled franticly, trying to slide further down and escape through the bottom of Amethyst\u2019s top. Too bad the grip of the breasts was too tight, forcing him up instead of down. He popped back up out of the cleavage to see Amethyst was squishing her boobs together to wring Steven out from his hiding spot. She gave her bosom a final squeeze before reaching for the piece of popcorn still in Steven\u2019s hands.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s mine now,\u201d Steven shot back at his most immature paternal figure as she pinched the popcorn between her fingers and tried to pull it away from the tiny boy. Steven held on, getting carried out of the cleavage as Amethyst easily took her popcorn back. She held the tiny morsel before her round face as Steven dangled from it. The boy was just not letting it go. The mature thing would be to let him have it. Too bad Amethyst was far from mature. Instead, she opened her mouth and tossed both boy and popcorn into her wet, drooling maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d Steven said as he landed face-first onto the tongue, letting go of the popcorn and sending it tumbling to the back of the mouth. He watched it go over the edge of the tongue, vanishing down the throat without the gem even needing to swallow. Sulking slightly at losing his snack, Steven had more important things to focus on as the tongue surged up under him and started to throw him around. With a laugh he felt himself bounce around the dripping wet cavern, rolling along the tongue until it tilted forward and slammed him into the roof of the mouth. Amethyst started sucking on him, her massive tongue spasming as it slipped all over the tiny boy. Steven kept laughing until he accidentally choked on a bit of saliva. Coughing, he was still smiling as Amethyst wrapped her tongue around him to get even more personal with her mouth play. Then a voice shattered the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAMETHYST!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue went still under Steven, only moving to slowly push out of the mouth as Amethyst stuck it out on command from the most senior Crystal Gem. Steven was lying on top of the pink muscle as he came out to see Pearl looking at him with concern. He waved his tiny arm at her before she ever so gently plucked him up off the squishy surface he'd found himself on. Grimacing in disgust at the saliva, Pearl looked back at Amethyst angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? Undress Steven before he goes anywhere inside you. Do you know how hard it is to get saliva stains out?\u201d Pearl nagged. Having Steven in her mouth wasn\u2019t a problem, none of the Crystal Gems could resist playing with the boy when he was this small. That didn\u2019t excuse making a mess, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t be any harder than getting cum stains out,\u201d Amethyst added as she blew Steven a kiss. Her behavior made Steven giggle and Pearl roll her eyes. Calming down, Pearl put Steven down on the floor and stepped back to let him do his thing. Steven didn\u2019t even have to be told what to do as he willed himself to grow. What had once been a two-inch-tall boy was now a normal, if not slightly short boy; one covered head to toe in drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the drill, Steven. Off with the clothes,\u201d Pearl said, unable to keep herself from smiling slightly as Steven started to undress. Steven was unlike other humans. He was also unlike the Crystal Gems for several reasons; a major one being he could control his size. In the past, Steven\u2019s mother could grow to hundreds of feet tall, a literal giantess that could surpass any fusion in size. Steven never learned to increase his size, but he\u2019s always been able to decrease it. Growing up he could pick whether he was normal-sized Steven, doll Steven, toy Steven or even bug Steven. He loved being small and spent most of his time like that, even fighting gem monsters at a smaller size. Being different sizes was as much a part of Steven as his gem, and with it came a very unique relationship with the Crystal Gems. They loved seeing him small, and early on they all discovered just how deep and passionate that love could get. Steven was more than happy about that and got plenty of enjoyment out of it along with the others. It wasn\u2019t normal, but what part of his life was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven\u2026you really should put something on now,\u201d Pearl spoke up as she took the saliva covered clothes, leaving the boy standing there completely naked. Amethyst didn\u2019t seem to agree with Pearl as she shook her head behind the other gem\u2019s back. She\u2019d be happy if the kid went full nudist all the time. Smiling at them both, Steven went to get dressed. He never knew what to expect, but it would be nice to have at least some small shred of clothes on if trouble came.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven returned to Amethyst\u2019s side on the bed and snuggled up against her. The short gem gave no complaints as she held him close. Feeling playful, she also wedged his face against her right breast. He laughed as she struggled to pull free, but that just made the game more fun. In no time the pair were wrestling and rolling around on the bed. Their hands glided over one another\u2019s bodies. They\u2019d done so enough to memorize the other\u2019s sensitive areas, which they attacked without mercy, leading to even more uproarious cries of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, feeling his breathing run short, Steven suddenly stopped the rolling while he was on top of Amethyst. He slapped his hands to either side of her head before quickly tapping. \u201cOne-two-three.\u201d When Amethyst\u2019s eyes went wide with shock in realization at what happened, Steven beamed and threw up his hands in cheer. \u201cAnd the winner, is Steveeen! Haaa!\u201d He mimicked a cheering audience. \u201cAnd the crowds go wild. Haaa!\u201d Then he turned a triumphant look down on the purple woman. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach you to steal my popcorn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst snickered. \u201cSorry, Steve-o, but you\u2019ll have to do better than that if you want to teach <i>me</i> anything.\u201d She leaned back casually and rested her head in her hands, her expression silently daring Steven to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Well what if I do\u2026 this!?\u201d Steven pulled at the hem of Amethyst\u2019s pants and, with practiced ease, shrunk down to about ten inches as he slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGems didn\u2019t technically wear clothes. Their outer coverings were just an extension of their hard-light bodies. As such, it was no surprise that Amethyst hadn\u2019t manifested any panties. Steven sat upon the furry white bush of the purple woman\u2019s pubic hair and beheld the simple elegance of her purple slit. His smile devious, he used the strength of his greater size to fight against the constrictive pants and crawled the short distance to her pussy. However, just as he was about to reach it, a pair of fingers grabbed his ankle and yanked him right back out. Dangling upside down before Amethyst\u2019s lazy smirk, Steven crossed his arms in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally fair, dude. You chose to get small, so you chose to accept the consequences.\u201d Amethyst shook him around for emphasis. \u201cBesides, Pearl <i>just</i> said you need to get naked if you want to go inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s consternated frown shifted to confusion. \u201cSince when do you care about me being clean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI care because Pearl might make <i>me</i> do the washing. And,\u201d she snickered, \u201clet\u2019s be real. That ain\u2019t happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Steven huffed again and slipped his shirt off. \u201cI\u2019ll get naked, but then you put me right back, and play fair this time so I can beat you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst bit her lip to keep from busting a gut at how adorable Steven was. Being small always made him extra cute, but small <i>and</i> trying to be threatening was just too much. She decided to help him out of his bottoms and bubbled his clothes so they wouldn\u2019t be lost. Then she took another look at the boy in her hands. He was now what the gems referred to as toy sized. They all liked playing with him at any height, but this one had a particular function. \u201cYou want to play a game, Steve-o? Then how about\u2026 the quiet game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven gulped. The quiet game had a different context for the gems than it did for regular humans. The point was still to see who could go the longest without making noise, but the twist was that players would often do lewd things to sabotage the each other. Steven, to date, had never won the quiet game. However\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky! Bring it on, Amethyst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it, bud.\u201d Amethyst went over to the head of the bed and propped up some pillows for her back. She then willed away the crotch off of her pants in a flash of energy. Grinning toothily in a sinister smirk, the purple woman plunged Steven head first into her sopping sex. Immediately she slapped a hand over her mouth to keep from crying out. No matter his size, Steven always felt amazing down there. His wiggling body was the ultimate toy, which was actually to her disadvantage right now. She could feel him already touching around inside of her in search of her weak spots. So, being Amethyst, it was hardly a surprise that she manifested a zipper over her mouth and closed it shut. He need not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was panting heavily as the tight confines of the pussy undulated all around him. This, in turn, resulted in him inhaling a few mouthfuls of pussy juice. Although he liked the sweet yet earthy flavor, he still had to cough it back up. Luckily this didn\u2019t count as losing the game. The real problem was that Amethyst was thrusting his body in and out of hers, which felt great. He stifled his pleasured moan and tried to redouble his groping efforts. He\u2019d been in this pussy enough times that he could navigate it with his eyes closed and quickly located the spots he knew would make Amethyst go crazy. Her body certainly thrashed about when he pressed his face against and kissed one such spot, knowing that she\u2019d feel every detail of his lips against her moist walls, but he couldn\u2019t hear her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the worst was yet to come. Amethyst was increasing her rhythm of plunging him in and out, going deeper each time. It wouldn\u2019t be long before Steven\u2019s sensitive young teen penis made contact with her sensational pussy, and that would be the end. He\u2019d lose, just like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, for no particular reason, Garnet exited the temple to check on things in the house. Her keen ears immediately picked up the wet squelches of sex, but without the accompanying cries of ecstasy. Ascending the stairs, her hunch was confirmed when she caught Amethyst purple handed using shrunken Steven like a living dildo, but that wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was that they were clearly playing the quiet game, but Amethyst was cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst\u2019s eyes widened to the size of saucers when she saw the red woman. With the biggest breasts in the house, an ass that could deflect bullets, and thighs that once crushed a cannon ball, she was unquestionably the sexiest of the gems; at least now that Rose was \u2018gone\u2019. Her eyes were hidden behind her eye piece, but Amethyst could sense her silent, seething wrath. The purple woman tried motioning the unofficial leader to back away, but Garnet did just the opposite. She marched up to the bed and loomed menacingly for a few seconds. Then, just when Amethyst thought that things might be okay, the fusion reached out. Garnet slammed Steven all the way into Amethyst\u2019s twat while simultaneously ripping off the zipper like a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuuuck!\u201d Amethyst cried out in a mix of bliss and pain. The sudden insertion pushed her over the edge, as it did Steven. She came hard and forcibly ejected the boy from his fleshy prison. He laid panting in a pool of sex juices between Amethyst\u2019s legs as she looked up at the one responsible. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you did,\u201d Garnet said simply, her tone brokering no argument. She then picked up Steven and brought him up to her face. He groaned, clearly sore from his rough treatment, but he was a tough kid. He could take it. Besides, he smiled and waved when he saw the face of his tallest maternal figure. If she were organic and had a heart, this would be the part where it threatened to beat right out of her rib cage. But since that wasn\u2019t the case, she opted to slide Steven into her mouth. He tasted lovely, as always, but she moved him into her cheek to get the final word in. \u201cYou\u2019d better clean that up before Pearl sees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but this was <i>your</i> fault,\u201d Amethyst argued weakly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who made me cum so hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd <i>you\u2019re</i> the one who forgot to set up a towel. As such, this was the most probable outcome.\u201d Garnet adjusted her eye piece to indicate her future vision, forcing Amethyst to grumble her acceptance. \u201cGood girl. Stay good, and I\u2019ll talk to Pearl about giving you a treat.\u201d She then left without elaborating further. According to her vision, Steven had quite the interesting day that he needed to start on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Steven go?</span></div></div>",

However, the boy curled up on her tongue did. Opening wide, she stared into the mirror, seeing the tiny naked young man straddled on top of her tongue, looking as happy as could be. He\u2019d probably be happy if she just sucked on him all day. And while she had done that before, today wasn\u2019t about having her little Steven candy to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Steven, time to wash up. Saliva is great for getting cum off, but you still need a shower,\u201d Garnet said after plucking the boy up off her tongue and placing him in the bathtub. Instantly he was back to normal size and dripping wet, big globs of drool clinging to his face. While sticky Steven was okay around the temple, he couldn\u2019t be walking around Beach City like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Garnet,\u201d Steven said as he reached to turn on the water, but paused as he remembered something. He\u2019d beed taught that it was rude not to ask if someone wanted to join you. \u201cDo you want to join me for a shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet tilted her head slightly. While the gems didn\u2019t need to take showers, any reason to be naked around Steven was enjoyed. Garnet thought about it, using her ability to see where it would lead. \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019ll just wait until later to put you up my butt,\u201d she said as if it were obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Steven said, not understanding what Garnet was referring to. If only he knew all the sexual outcomes that Garnet saw every day, he\u2019d understand that her reddish complexion was probably there to hide her blushing cheeks from all the perverted things she witnessed. Leaving Steven alone, he shrugged and got on with his shower, scrubbing himself clean. He was a pro at this. The amount of stuff he found stuck to his body from his time having fun with the Crystal Gems was legendary. After he was finished, he dried off and left with a towel around his waist. He couldn\u2019t risk drawing one of the gems to him and getting dirty all over again. Changing into a clean set of clothes, he ran out of the temple and into town, knowing exactly what he needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne Big Mini Doughnut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven burst into the Big Doughnut crying out his order. He was hoping to see Sadie and Lars, but he only saw the diminutive but sweet Sadie manning the cash register. She looked bored until she saw Steven come in. That always put a smile on her face. Rushing up to the counter, Steven slapped down one dollar for his favorite doughnut at the store; one that Sadie always saved for him no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Steven. Great to see you. I got your mini doughnut right here,\u201d Sadie placed what looked like a third of a doughnut on the counter. It had started as an accident. One of the doughnuts broke apart and Lars threw it into the display because he didn\u2019t care. Seeing the undersized, ignored piece that would be thrown away at the end of the day had struck a chord in Steven\u2019s heart. He had to save it and have it for himself. Since that day, Sadie had always had a small misshapen piece for Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Sadie!\u201d Steven truthfully said as he jumped up onto the counter, shrinking at the same time so that when he landed, he was only three inches tall. The toy-sized boy scampered towards the now car-sized hunk of fried dough in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you think so. Lars has been complaining I\u2019m too needy lately,\u201d Sadie muttered, not realizing she had said that out loud until she noticed Steven wasn\u2019t eating his doughnut, and instead was looking at her. Blushing, she quickly ducked her face down and tried to save her pride. \u201cI mean, Lars has just been complaining I ask him too often to stay up all night\u2026 watching movies and playing video games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with staying up all night. That sounds fun,\u201d Steven said, missing the innuendo. Just because he knew more about how to pleasure a pussy than most men alive, that didn\u2019t mean he understood when people were trying to be coy about what they were saying. \u201cI can come next time and all three of us could stay up all night,\u201d Steven quickly suggested. He was trying to be helpful, but he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. To be fair, if he did understand, he\u2019d probably still volunteer to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Lars would like that,\u201d Sadie said, not saying that <i>she</i> would have a problem. The way she was blushing even harder and biting her lip, she was probably more than okay with both of the boys spending all night with her. Shaking that thought out of her head, Sadie just sighed and turned away. This was really not Steven\u2019s problem and she shouldn\u2019t be bothering him with it. She remembered the last time she\u2019d dragged Steven into her problems with Lars and her own needs. What happened then could never happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t anything I can do?\u201d Steven asked, honestly trying to help. Sadie looked at his big warm smile and his tiny adorable form and just felt her heart melt. She remembered last time all too well. She had felt so lonely and had gone on an early break to feel better, expecting Lars to watch everything. He had bailed, of course; also probably missing her innuendo. Then Steven wandered in and found her in the back, panties around her ankles and fingers about to go into herself. She barely remembered what happened next, only Steven offering to help, the most incredible pleasure, and then guilt. She had tried so hard to forget it, but it was hard with Steven always being there for her at her lowest. If he was just older or she was younger, things would be so very different and she wouldn\u2019t feel like the worst person ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to take a break. I\u2019ll be back in a couple of minutes.\u201d Sadie excused herself, leaving Steven to finish his tiny treat. Steven watched her go sadly, but he knew when someone wanted to be alone. Taking a few more bites of his doughnut, he decided to leave. Regrowing himself he left the Big Doughnut in search of something else to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven walked casually along the beach. He didn\u2019t really have a destination in mind. He just liked hearing the ocean and tasting the salty air. He wasn\u2019t shrunk, though. He\u2019d stopped doing that after the second seagull incident. The boy was just strutting along, humming a tune to himself, when he came to a dead halt. There she was; that girl whose name he didn\u2019t know. She wore an aqua sundress with a white top, had large glasses, long dark brown hair, slightly lighter brown skin, and quietly reading a book. She was the very picture of serenity and something about the light of the sun made her look almost majestic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily she hadn\u2019t seen him yet. Good. He didn\u2019t want to be seen. Okay. Now the question was how to get her to see him. He could just walk up, introduce himself, and ask to be friends. Wait\u2026 no. That\u2019d never work. She was reading. It\u2019d be rude to interrupt her like that. He could just walk really close, pretend to trip, and get her attention that way. Urgh! No! That would make him look clumsy and stupid. She\u2019d never want to talk to him after that. Maybe he could try going up to her shrunk? That\u2019d be a conversation starter\u2026 assuming she didn\u2019t freak out and run away. Beach City liked to claim to be a tourist town and a lot of the out-of-towners didn\u2019t react so well to the weirdness associated with the Crystal Gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before Steven realized what was happening, his feet were moving. They were taking him straight towards the girl. Traitors! Was this payback for all the times he\u2019d burned his soles on the hot sand?  Okay-okay. Don\u2019t panic. J-just say hi. Steer slightly to the side to avoid a collision and say hi. It would be like a hi-by. Nothing wrong with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just when Steven\u2019s mouth began to also move of its own accord, a distant shriek caused the ground to rumble. Up on the cliff just above the girl, a boulder carved into a rose began to crack. Gravity did its thing, and this time Steven\u2019s feet did exactly what he wanted them to do. He ran up to the girl at top speed and threw himself protectively over her, shouting \u201cHi, my name is Steven!\u201d He held onto her and braced for the worst, only for the gem in his belly to glow a bright shade of pink that encompassed them both. When the light faded, a large bubble shield had manifested around the pair. The boulder shattered on impact, leaving the children safe, isolated, and awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! How did I do that?\u201d He then looked at the awestruck girl as adrenaline gave him the courage to speak more openly. \u201cHi. My name is Steven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie,\u201d she said, adjusting her glasses. \u201cYou\u2019re, uh, kind of on top of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh-heh. Sorry.\u201d Steven got off and helped her up. \u201cConnie. That\u2019s a nice name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie tapped experimentally against the bubble. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m magic. Well, half magic on my mom\u2019s side,\u201d Steven replied, not sounding very confident. Admittedly the gems had been a little vague on teaching him about his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shrugged. \u201cApparently. I\u2019m a member of the Crystal Gems. We fight monsters and protect humanity.\u201d He set his hands on his hips for a heroic pose, but Connie was still too stunned to be impressed. An awkward silence followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 how long does it usually last?\u201d Connie asked while looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven tried to banish the bubble, tensing his body, but only came dangerously close to farting in a confined space. The bubble just didn\u2019t want to go away. So, as long as they were both trapped, Steven figured he might as well fill the silence. Connie said that her dad was a security guard who worked in several towns along the coast. She sometimes went along just to see the sights. Steven added that he also saw plenty of sights in his adventures with the Crystal Gems. Eventually they were able to figure out how to roll the bubble, but couldn\u2019t climb the sand hill to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Steven was confident that the gems would come out to help eventually, he might as well take her on a tour of the town. He took her to the Big Doughnut, where Sadie tried helping with a hammer. Then they went to the docks, where Connie was able to name all the different kinds of boats. \u201cYou sure know a lot about boats, huh,\u201d Steven commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you go to the beach all the time, but don\u2019t swim or have any friends.\u201d Connie trailed off awkwardly. \u201cYou look at boats\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an incident with the odd boy Onion and a harpoon gun, Steven\u2019s next idea was to try Fun Land. One of those rides would surely have enough force to break the bubble. Unfortunately, the roller coaster only managed to knock said bubble a good distance out to see where it sunk to the bottom of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact was soft, but the panic was getting harder for Connie to suppress. When her head stopped spinning, she looked around the dark, pink tinted depths of the sea. Visibility was low and she\u2019d completely lost her sense of direction. Worse, she was alone. \u201cSteven? Steven!? Where are you?\u201d Her answer came from a wiggling under her blouse. Tentatively she pulled her dress top open to find\u2026 \u201cSteven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe-hey,\u201d tiny Steven waved awkwardly while being pressed against the girl\u2019s chest. Seeing that Connie was starting to hyperventilate he tried to sooth her. \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He climbed up the inside of her blouse, paying no mind to how his back rubbed against her chest, hopped out, and returned to normal size. \u201cSee. I can change size, though I only know how to be this size and smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m actually more comfortable being small. When we fell, I guess I panicked and shrunk by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-if that\u2019s the case, why didn\u2019t you shrink when the rock fell?\u201d Connie asked, trying to use reasoning to distract herself from the terror of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still young, so I don\u2019t have full control of my powers. That\u2019s what the gems say, anyway.\u201d He tapped on the bubble. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing this is airtight, otherwise we might drown.\u201d His laugh was forced and went on for far too long, making Connie look more anxious by the minute. Stricken with guilt at seeing someone he cared about in distress, Steven resorted to his default and held out his arms. \u201cDo you want a hu-oof!?\u201d He didn\u2019t even finish before Connie ran up and tackled him against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she wept into his shirt. \u201cWhy is this happening? Now we\u2019re going to suffocate or starve at the bottom of the ocean and only my parents will notice because no one else cares about me!\u201d She barely noticed Steven tightening his grip on her back. \u201cI\u2019m going to disappear without ever making a single friend.\u201d As the tears started coming full force, she noticed the jostling as Steven moved their faces closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could be friends,\u201d he offered sincerely. \u201cI saw you at the boardwalk last year, but you disappeared before I could find you.\u201d Calling on his experience with the gems, he stroked Connie\u2019s hair like he would with Amethyst when she got in one of her moods. Connie seemed receptive, so Steven considered going further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\nThey just talk.<br>\r\nSteven tries more petting.<br>\r\nSteven shows off his shrinking.<br>\r\nThe gems turn up.<br>\r\nA monster appears.</span></div></div>",

The gems really like it and we always have fun. They especially like playing when they\u2019re stressed about stuff. Whenever they have a fight or something, we always play together and everyone feels better afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie sniffled and wiped a few tears from her eyes. \u201cThat sounds like exactly what I need right now.\u201d She laughed, but then looked around the bubble and the darkness beyond. \u201cCan we play in here, though? There\u2019s not a lot of room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s sincere grin turned coy as he finally released Connie. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t take much room,\u201d he boasted before shrinking down to 3 inches. It amused him how awed the girl was with his powers, but he couldn\u2019t wait to see how much happier she\u2019d be in just a few minutes. \u201cThis is called toy Steven, cuz I\u2019m the size of a toy. Basically you just have to play with me and we both have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, okay\u2026\u201d Curious, Connie tentatively reached down to the tiny boy. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if I hold you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded excitedly and beamed widely in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling, Connie scooped him up. \u201cWhoa, you really are toy sized,\u201d she marveled as she felt his weight and warmth. Experimentally she turned him around and over in her hand. \u201cHmm. A bit smaller than my old dolls, and a lot less stiff.\u201d She poked his soft side, making him squirm and cry out in a giggle fit. That brought a smile to Connie\u2019s face and she poked his back. Steven hummed contentedly. Her analytical brain kicking in, Connie continued experimenting with poking different parts of the tiny boy\u2019s body to see what reactions she got. Each one warmed her heart, especially when he saw her finger coming and leaned into her touch. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty trusting guy, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly with the people I trust,\u201d Steven replied plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie furrowed her brow. \u201cBut you don\u2019t even know me. For all you know, I might be some deranged axe murderer, an arsonist, or a deputy lawyer in training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stood in Connie\u2019s hand and posed with his hands on his hips. \u201cFigures. I had a feeling you were a good person. I\u2019m usually right about this stuff, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie giggled. \u201cWell, thanks for trusting me. It means a lot that you\u2019d let me do things with you at this size.\u201d The silence that followed was comfortable for Connie as she regarded Steven, but he was growing impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we\u2019ve barely started playing yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. What happens ne-?\u201d Connie\u2019s words caught in her throat when Steven began to undress. He showed no signs of embarrassment as he lifted his shirt to show off a pudge that Connie found oddly appealing. Then came the shoes and pants, making Connie\u2019s cheeks redden. Her heart began to pound when Steven turned around and dropped his undies. As a doctor\u2019s daughter, Connie had seen plenty of anatomy books, but they\u2019d never made her feel like this before. Her breaths grew heavy and her core was warming. And when Steven turned around, her eyes about popped out of her skull at the sight of his flaccid penis. She hadn\u2019t realized that she\u2019d licked her lips, but Steven did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s smile persisted at this rare opportunity to teach someone his favorite game. Anticipating her next question, he said that \u201cYou can do whatever you want. Poke me, pet me, hold me to your cheek, I like riding on shoulders or in chests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie snapped back to reality. \u201cCh-chests?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Amethyst especially like carrying me around in her chest. Garnet is a bit too big and I always end up getting squished inside; Pearl is too small, but both feel really good when I play with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Play\u2026 feel good\u2026 tiny boy\u2026 big chests\u2026</i> These and other disjointed words bounced around the Indian girl\u2019s head as she tried to process what all was being said to her. The deeper implications didn\u2019t quite click, however. The one thing keeping her grounded was that ever present smile that assured her that all would be well. Connie, against her better judgement, chose to return the boy\u2019s trust. \u201cS-so it feels good when you play with ch-chests?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded. \u201cYou can lie back or hold me under your shirt. Don\u2019t worry. The gems always love it when I do this stuff for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing audibly, Connie leaned back against the bubble and brought the boy up to her chest. Her hands went even further when one pulled the top of her dress open and the other slipped Steven inside. She watched his expression, suddenly fretful that he might be repulsed by her underage body. She didn\u2019t even have a training bra yet and Steven apparently knew someone whose chest was \u2018too big\u2019. Her fears proved baseless when Steven looked at her tiny dark nipple as one might a giant piece of candy. That analogy proved frighteningly accurate when Steven threw himself off her hand and onto her diminutive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie\u2019s back arched as lightning surged through her. The only person besides herself to ever touch there was her mother, and it had always been for clinical reasons. Steven was hugging her with his whole body, clinging to her like his life depended on it, and he was just so warm. When Connie finally calmed down, she looked at him and said, \u201cY-you\u2019re j-just like a little koala clinging to his mom, but somehow cuter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to let the baggage of his mommy issues interfere, Steven focused on making Connie feel good. Connie\u2019s body was at an angle so he didn\u2019t have to worry much about falling. Using his experience with Pearl as a reference, he began rotating his body all around the nipple to maximize stimulation. Her body jerked again, but Steven never stopped. The friction of her tiny nub against his body felt wonderful, especially how the tip would almost kiss his gem. His penis grew especially hard when the girl started moaning. He couldn\u2019t see much from within her dress, but he was pretty sure that the hand that wasn\u2019t cupping his back had moved down south. Good. That showed just how much she was relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie writhed and moaned within the bubble. She\u2019d never imagined that her body could feel so wonderful, and all at the behest of someone so small. How was he so good at this? The answer was probably experience with these gems he keeps going on about. They played this game all the time, apparently. Would she be invited to join future games? And when did her hand get down <i>there</i>? It was like her fingers had a mind of their own as they tried digging through her dress and into her sex. She\u2019d never touched there before, but right now it felt almost as amazing as the boy against her boob. Why had no one told her about these sensations before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie froze and snapped down to face the tiny boy in her dress. Her body was riddled with sticky sweat, it felt like she\u2019d wet her panties, but most intolerable of all was that Steven had done the unthinkable. \u201cWh-why did you stop?\u201d Her voice warbled as the tears threatened to return. How could he betray her like this, and why was he still smiling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven pointed at her other nipple. \u201cPearl likes it when I keep things even.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Relieved beyond words that her first friend hadn\u2019t betrayed her, Connie moved him to the other nipple. Even knowing what to expect, the sudden stimulation was no less powerful. Her moans grew louder and the wetness in her panties threatened to bleed onto her dress. Everything was so wonderful as her first friend made her feel better than her wildest imagination. She hoped that this moment would last forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a new surge of stimulation surged up Connie\u2019s spine. Her mouth opened wide in a loud scream that reverberated around the bubble as her mind went white hot with bliss. Steven was held tightly against her flat chest as her fingers dug as deep as they could into her sex through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie\u2019s grip was a little tight, but Steven didn\u2019t mind. He was just so happy that he\u2019d succeeded in making her feel good. Even his own diminutive orgasm against her nipple was merely a bonus compared to his good deed. Connie\u2019s chest rose and fell with her labored breathing and Steven had to resist the relaxing allure of her heartbeat. He couldn\u2019t sleep when he still had the energy to keep playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth play<br>\r\nPussy play<br>\r\nMore breast play<br>\r\nJust try relaxing<br>\r\nLet\u2019s get crazy</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the first things Steven learned when he started using his shrinking for fun games, besides where the clitoris and G-spot were, was the differences between humans and gems. When it came to sex gems had pretty much had an unlimited sex drive. They never needed five minutes to catch their breath, had to rehydrate, or got burned out. Gem sex could go on for days if not for the fact that they had responsibilities and shouldn\u2019t indulge themselves too much. Humans on the other hand didn\u2019t have the luxury of being sex machines. Pearl had embarrassedly confessed Rose and she discovered this when they started the rebellion and nearly killed a few humans while having fun with them. The humans hadn\u2019t seemed to mind dying that way, but it bothered the two gems. Since Steven was half gem, half-human he had half of the infinite stamina gems had, whatever that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay, Connie?\u201d Steven asked from her chest, looking up at his new friend with only concern even as his cock returned to full hardness. He was ready to dive into her soaked panties and give her an even bigger taste of what he had done to her nipple, but he knew to wait. Connie had barely caught her breath, was sweating heavily and seemed to be struggling to even move her head. He had to wait a few more seconds for her to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m great!\u201d Connie gasped out before sucking in a hasty breath. Her body was still tingling from the first orgasm of her young life. What Steven had done to her and blown her mind and she was craving more, but her body was still so sensitive from her climax, Steven wasn\u2019t even clinging to her nipple right now but just from him standing next to the stiff nub she was getting turned on. The rational part of her told her to catch her breath, the newly awoken hormonal monster inside her wanted her to beg Steven for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, I\u2019m glad I could help,\u201d Steven bashfully said with a big, goofy grin. He was glad to hear that Connie had enjoyed herself so much, he knew most of the women he did this with were very happy after he was done and often heaped praise on him. Hearing it from Connie somehow felt different, extra special. He wanted to hear more, but she was still recovering. Luckily, he knew plenty of small things that would make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help you feel even better,\u201d Steven told her as he moved closer to her nipple, the huge, dark brown pillar calling out for more of his love. He could see a tiny stream of cum dripping down to the base from earlier. Avoiding that, he lightly placed his hands on the circular tip and leaned his head in. Connie watched him closely, her heart hammering so hard in her chest she was surprised that Steven wasn\u2019t sent flying off her. The tiny boy placed a tiny peck of a kiss on the rubbery top of the nipple, and then another one and another. Soon he was peppering the nipple with soft, loving kisses. While not as intense as his full body rubbing, it still made Connie swoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven, that feels so nice,\u201d Connie sighed as she felt the heat between her legs flare up again. The tiny kisses felt so soft and affectionate against her sensitive nipple, it was like a small brush of pure love pressing into her naughty parts. It got more intense when Steven gave her nipple a lick, his tongue tracing along the bumpy surface and causing Connie to moan. Earlier it had felt like fireworks exploding inside her, now it was like a steady flame keeping her warm and fuzzy all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven!\u201d Connie moaned as her body arched and her hand trailed down to her soaking wet panties. Steven lost his balance and fell atop her nipple, grabbing hold and sending even more pleasure racing through his young friend. Connie\u2019s moans only grew, and she felt like she was almost ready for more. She wanted Steven to play with her body, explore every crevice, do all the naughty things she had never even dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something knocked several times against the side of the bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie froze and looked towards the noise, confused to what could possibly be out there at the bottom of the sea. Steven looked up at well, he wasn\u2019t confused as he jumped up off the nipple with his arms raised as he recognized a very familiar gem knocking against the bubble with her gloved hand, unbothered by the depth or lack of air under the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGarnet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back to regular size, Steven and a slightly blushing Connie were put down on the beach inside their bubble by Garnet in front of the rest of the Crystal Gems. Seeing the magical side of the family all there, Steven eagerly introduced Connie to them, unaware of her slight discomfort after being caught in the middle of their playtime and having her dress and panties be slightly disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! This is Connie! She\u2019s my new friend, she knows all about boats and lots of stuff! She likes books and travels a lot, so she has to know plenty of things! She\u2019s so smart, fun, and cool! She does this one thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven, I think you better stop,\u201d Garnet butted in before Steven could continue his ranting. Blinking, Steven looked at Connie to see her blushing harder than ever, but not out of embarrassment. She had no idea Steven thought so highly of her and was so excited to have her as a friend. The shrinking fun and all the praise were so new for the shy girl, she didn\u2019t know whether to run and hide or start hugging Steven. Who was she kidding, she wanted to hug Steven right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Steven meekly said to Connie before turning back to the gems. He was happy to be saved but he was also a bit confused. \u201cHow did you find us? We were pretty far from the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you didn\u2019t notice?\u201d Amethyst chuckled. \u201cYour bubble was glowing hot pink. You were bright enough that everyone can see your glow from Beach City.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were glowing?\u201d Steven asked, amazed to learn yet another thing about his strange, uncontrollable powers. It would help if the gems explained them more to him, but they just told him to wait as they develop. It sucked because Steven wanted to know everything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst only laughed even harder. \u201cOh yeah, the bubble lights up like a Christmas tree when you have an orgasm. Rose\u2019s bubble used to get so bright when she got freaky in her bubbles. Congratulations on not only making your first bubble but also busting your first nut in one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmethyst, there is no reason to be so crude,\u201d Pearl reprimanded the pint-sized gem before smiling encouragingly to Steven. \u201cBut she\u2019s right, congratulations Steven. You\u2019re becoming more like your mother every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thanks,\u201d Steven said, suddenly not feeling as happy as he\u2019d been a second ago. His mom was a strong, amazing leader so he should try to be like her, right? He knew that Pearl's words should make him feel good, but they only left a bitter taste in his mouth. As he started to dwell on it, Connie reached over and took his hand, squeezing it softly. Steven looked back at her and she gave him an encouraging smile that lifted his spirits. All that uncertainty about his mom was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPOP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And so was the bubble apparently. Steven and Connie fell onto the beach\u2019s sandy shore, free of their imprisonment and safe with the gems. Now they were both smiling, happy that ordeal was over, but even happier that the outcome of it was they both gained a very good friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The monster responsible for the quakes that started this whole mess appeared, only to be promptly dealt with. All the gems showed off their abilities, and even Steven got in a few hero moments when he defended Connie; as if she didn\u2019t have enough reason to like him already. When the moment passed and the monster\u2019s gem was bubbled, Connie was starting to have a grasp on the concept of overstimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you don\u2019t look so good,\u201d Steven observed of his panting friend. \u201cDo you want to come up to my house and have a sit? We have juice.\u201d He gestured with his thumb at the building just up the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 that would be good,\u201d Connie agreed, wondering why this felt like some kind of victory and missing the looks exchanged between the gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s house was very spacious and modestly furnished. The living area, kitchen, and loft were all one giant room with the bathroom and closets off to the sides. After escorting Connie to the couch, Steven rushed off to fetch some refreshments while she looked around. Connie\u2019s attention inevitably fell towards the back of the house where wood gave way to decorative stone material around an ornate door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere ya go!\u201d Steven announced cheerfully, holding a tray with two juice boxes and a plate of sandwiches cut into triangles. \u201cI hope you like PB&amp;J.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Connie seized a sandwich and scarfed it down, only now realizing just how hungry she\u2019d become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven laughed as he sat beside her. \u201cWow. I guess being stuck in a bubble all day works up an appetite, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Connie breathed after practically inhaling the sandwich, snatched a juice box, and squeezed out its liquid goodness like it was a\u2026 thing that got her feeling tingly again. <i>Topic change!</i> \u201cSo, where does that door lead?\u201d she pointed to the back of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s the temple. This place is my house,\u201d Steven gestured broadly, \u201cbut that\u2019s where the gems live. It\u2019s got their rooms, some halls, and all kinds of crazy stuff. I\u2019ve lived here my whole life and even I haven\u2019t seen all of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d Connie awed, suddenly confused why her hand was warm. She looked down to find that her palm was resting atop Steven\u2019s hand. When did that happen? Both children slowly faced one another, blinked, blushed, but did not pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh! What\u2019s goin\u2019 on here?\u201d Amethyst gushed after popping up from Connie\u2019s side of the couch, startling the girl to press herself against Steven. \u201cAww, you two having sandwiches? Can I have one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmethyst, these are for Connie,\u201d Steven chided. \u201cShe\u2019s been through a lot today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t mind sharing,\u201d Connie stuttered out, having not yet processed that she was practically wrapped around Steven. Without realizing it, she disentangled herself to better push the plate towards the purple woman. \u201cAmethyst, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d she boasted while scarfing down half the sandwiches without even bothering to chew. \u201cSo\u2026?\u201d she asked leadingly with a coy grin. \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was what like?\u201d Steven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour first orgasm in a bubble. C\u2019mon, little guy. Spill. What\u2019d you do?\u201d Amethyst got on her belly on the couch, legs kicking idly as her chin rested on her palms. Her attention turned to Connie. \u201cAnd you. What was it like for <i>you</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a veteran of this question, Steven decided to take the lead and show Connie what was expected. \u201cIt was a lot of fun. I shrunk down-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Amethyst snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and I went into Connie\u2019s shirt. Her chest was really smooth, but also bumpy around the nipples. They felt good to hug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet they did,\u201d Amethyst agreed with a lascivious smirk. \u201cAnd then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t do too much else. I was just trying to help Connie feel good in a pretty stressful situation.\u201d Steven took her hand again. \u201cShe needed a friend, so I was there for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie couldn\u2019t decide if she was feeling a greater heat in her core or her cheeks. The things Steven said made her heart go crazy. He was so open about topics that even her doctor mother was hesitant to discuss with her, but he was even more open with his affections. It was a couple of seconds before Connie realized that she was the center of attention and that she was expected to take her turn. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure what to say. So much happened so fast,\u201d she said down to her juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel ashamed or coerced,\u201d informed Pearl authoritatively. \u201cYou humans are quite squeamish over such matters. Which is rather silly, given that it\u2019s a biological imperative for you to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Pearl, Garnet cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I mean to say is that you should take your time. We don\u2019t adhere to human taboos here, so feel free to say what\u2019s in your heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right,\u201d Connie acknowledged. The words of this pale woman did make her feel better, even if they were a little on the condescending side. \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s like Steven said. He wanted to help me feel better, and so he did. It was pretty shocking when he first shrank. After I got over that, I still couldn\u2019t tear my eyes off him. He was just so,\u201d her blush intensified, \u201ccute. He looked so fragile, like a tiny porcelain doll. I-I wanted to hold him. So when he said he wanted to be against my chest\u2026 How could I refuse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Smart move,\u201d Amethyst offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I just let him do whatever he wanted and\u2026 and\u2026\u201d Connie\u2019s breathing grew raspy, evening out only when Steven tightened his grip on her hand. She gave him a look of silent gratitude for his support. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe it. I felt things that I\u2019ve only ever read in books.\u201d She shrunk down and sheepishly admitted, \u201cThe kind my mom doesn\u2019t know I read.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got the gems either cooing or snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I read those books, too?\u201d inquired Steven innocently. \u201cHey, how about the next time you come over, you bring one and we can read them together? That sounds like it\u2019d be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt s-sure does,\u201d Connie stammered. \u2018Fun\u2019 seemed like damnation through faint praise compared to what she\u2019d experienced. Between what she\u2019d heard these people say and her own imagination, it was clear that what had happened in the bubble was just the tip of the iceberg. Steven knew things about \u2018fun\u2019 that were leagues beyond her, yet she craved to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo was it really just her chest?\u201d Amethyst asked, somewhat disappointed. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. Steven feels super nice between my boobs, but that\u2019s pretty casual stuff. If you want some <i>real</i> fun, ya gotta get creative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie gulped. \u201cL-like what?\u201d she asked in a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to rush into things,\u201d Garnet finally spoke up. \u201cEverything will happen in its own time. For now, you should just focus on enjoying being friends. Watch movies, read, and also have responsible fun on the side. Steven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember that you have an endurance that most people don\u2019t. Don\u2019t wear her out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d he argued. \u201cBack in the bubble, after we both came, I was super gentle to help calm her down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent job, Steven.\u201d Pearl softly clapped her hands. \u201cIt seems that all of your lessons and practice are paying off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-practice?\u201d Connie stammered, her imagination running away with her. Expression blank, she brought the straw of the juice box up to her lips, only to find it empty. \u201cUm, may I have another?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do things go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven offers to practice with the gems while Connie watches?<br>\r\nSteven offers to practice with Connie while the gems watch?<br>\r\nSteven and Connie (try to) play video games?<br>\r\nAnother monster attacks?<br>\r\nConnie goes home?</span></div></div>",

The other gems were milling about, seemingly looking busy with eating, cleaning, or just standing around looking stoic and cool, but Connie had a feeling that they were just pretending. They were watching her. Even if they weren\u2019t looking her way, they were still waiting for her to make some kind of move, but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, want to see my room?\u201d offered Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d Connie sighed in relief. She followed him up the stairs, wondering if harnessing this boy\u2019s enthusiasm might solve the world\u2019s energy crisis. The loft was a pretty standard room in Connie\u2019s mind. There was a bed, shelves of toys and books, a TV, a gaming console, and various knickknacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to casa Steven,\u201d he beamed. \u201cWhat d\u2019ya think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Connie went over to examine his book collection. \u201cHmm. Do you read much? There isn\u2019t a lot here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like going to the library to read. It\u2019s more fun when there\u2019s people around. Plus I\u2019ve got to save my allowance for the essentials, like this baby!\u201d Steven produced a gaming cartridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, that looks ten years old. Did you get it at a bargain bin?\u201d Connie asked, hoping she didn\u2019t sound rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA garage sale, actually. I don\u2019t know why they wanted to get rid of it. This world is so pretty and the characters are real funny. Hey, want to play with me?\u201d Steven asked, looking ready to explode with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Connie agreed. Steven was just so genuine in his enthusiasm that denying him would feel like kicking a puppy. At his direction, she sat with her back against the foot of his bed while he got everything set up. The second controller was given to her and the game began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is great. The gems almost never want to play games with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a gamer, either. Is there a tutorial or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can start a new game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. That\u2019d be-\u201d Turning to face the boy beside her, Connie\u2019s voice caught in her throat. Her chin dropped all the way to her collar bone before she saw Steven again. \u201cOh, you\u2019re\u2026 tiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Steven almost sounded like he was bragging as he stood 3 inches high, only barely taller than the controller. \u201cI play easier this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 okay,\u201d Connie allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tutorial began and Connie quickly got the hang of the controls. Steven would periodically give her suggestions on moves to make. Watching him was like witnessing a one-man assembly line with how he quickly darted between the different parts of the controller to do what needed doing without stumbling once. It was impressive, but also distracting. Not even the games colorful world or witty one-liners could hold her attention when she had <i>that</i> nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Steven. There\u2019s, um, something I\u2019d like to try,\u201d Connie confessed, her mouth going dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Steven asked without breaking his stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it be okay if you played from m-my lap?\u201d Connie braced herself for the worst when Steven paused the game and looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. That sounds fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that word again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the controller like an ant lifts a twig; Steven scurried up Connie\u2019s thigh. She had a brief scare of where exactly he\u2019d go next, but gave a sigh of relief when he went to perch on her knee. His weight was marginal, but noticeable. The game resumed and Connie\u2019s performance could generously be called poor. Every time Steven shifted his weight or hopped down onto her knee, her body tensed. Things came to a head when one such tensing caused Connie\u2019s character to fall off a cliff and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, man. And we were doing so well,\u201d whined Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feeling alright?\u201d Not waiting for her to answer, Steven scurried up the girl\u2019s dress, stood atop her shoulder, and gestured for her to bring her forehead within his reach. \u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think you feel feverish. Do you want me to get you another juice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, how about I just h-hold you while you play?\u201d Again she tensed in anticipation of some rebuke for her strange request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, why didn\u2019t you say so from the start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie blinked, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gems don\u2019t play games, but they still like holding me while I play.\u201d Steven hopped off the girl, grew back to regular size to disconnect the controller, and returned to being tiny as he returned to her knee. \u201cIf you want, I can also be naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeS!\u201d Connie exclaimed with a wheeze before sheepishly shrinking down. \u201cI-I mean, i-if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it is. I like it when my friends hold me,\u201d Steven admitted as he casually discarded his clothes to the floor. He stood on Connie\u2019s knee, naked and proud as he elaborated. \u201cBeing small just makes the hugs feel so much better, ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to tear her eyes away, Connie didn\u2019t realize that she\u2019d licked her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t, but I\u2019d like to.\u201d Tentatively she reached out to the tiny naked boy. He was just the right size to fit in her palm. Her hand\u2019s approach was slow, giving him plenty of time to tell her to stop. Instead, Steven finally gave into impatience and jumped straight into her grasp. Her fingers closed on reflex as they sank into the tiny boy\u2019s pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Careful, I\u2019m ticklish,\u201d Steven giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, where the gems were eavesdropping, Pearl and Amethyst face-palmed while Garnet summed up the situation in a single word. \u201cMistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little imp that was Connie\u2019s emaciated mischievous side finally saw its chance to take hold. Twisting the girl\u2019s hesitant smile into a playful grin, it compelled her to find Steven\u2019s tickle spots. The boy was an anomaly, it rationalized, and he needed to be studied. For science!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven squirmed as Connie prodded under his armpits. His laughter was cute, as were his feeble attempts to push her finger away. She reasoned that if he really wanted her to stop, he could just grow. Taking his lack of size-changing as consent, she explored what other areas got reactions. Connie poked Steven\u2019s sides, around his gem, or under his feet to make him giggle. Stroking his back or petting his head made him purr like a kitten. Feeling bold, Connie next tried his butt. It was surprisingly firm, given the rest of his body. When she applied more pressure, he pushed back and gave an odd moan. Whatever it meant, Connie liked the sound of it and kept experimenting with different kinds of touches. She pinches his little cheeks together, squished them, and pulled them apart. Bringing the tiny boy up for a closer look, she stared at his tiny anus and rubbed her pinkie between his tiny buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh! Connie, that feels funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no. It\u2019s weird, but I like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie bit her bottom lip. There wasn\u2019t much else she could do with his butt at this size. Maybe if he were bigger\u2026 She violently shook her head. <i>No! Bad brain!</i> Playing with a naked boy while he was tiny was one thing. A naked regular-sized boy was\u2026 something else. Change of topic! Connie flipped Steven around to face her. Her attention immediately fell on his tiny penis, which she touched without thinking. Steven just squirmed like before, but didn\u2019t offer any sounds of protest, so she continued. It was hard to describe what she was feeling. Maybe a wart would be a good analogy with how it squished and moved around. But the more she touched, the stiffer it became. Steven was making sounds like he\u2019d done back in the bubble, and it was getting Connie all hot and bothered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Steven took action and grabbed Connie\u2019s finger, making her freeze. He smiled up at her and said, \u201cHey, if you want to play, we really should do it right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d Connie replied, unable to think of any argument to the contrary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetry breast play?<br>\r\nMouth play?<br>\r\nPussy play?<br>\r\nAss play?<br>\r\nThe gems have some ideas.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Connie licked her dry lips, now regretting not having another juice. \u201cWell, you\u2019re the expert, so how about you pick what we do?\u201d She swallowed as her free hand squeezed the side of her dress and wrinkled the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven hummed thoughtfully as he looked Connie over. She was new, very pretty, and so there were a lot of things he wanted to do with her. Her breasts were smaller than those he usually played with, but he also wondered how she might compare down below. No doubt she\u2019d be pretty, but the question of just how pretty her butt and kitty might be enticed him to seek an answer. However, with the way Connie had been looking at him, Steven surmised that there was something in particular that she wanted to try. He pointed up at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to go in your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her Indian descent, Connie still managed to go pale. \u201cI-in m-my mmmmm-mouth?\u201d she stammered, stressing every syllable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just nodded, ever the picture of youthful glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-is that s-safe. I mean, w-what if I s-swaaa\u2026\u201d Connie couldn\u2019t even finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven waved dismissively. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve been swallowed before and it always ends fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you don\u2019t d-digest?\u201d Connie asked, calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shook his head. \u201cNope. Though, we probably shouldn\u2019t do that right now. It\u2019s getting late, so you\u2019d have to throw me back up before you leave, which isn\u2019t fun, or you could carry me in your tummy \u2018til morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Connie acknowledged, deferring to the tiny boy\u2019s expertise on the matter. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie nodded and complied. Palm up, she pressed her wrist to her chin and took one last look at the boy. His smile was so care-free and reassuring. Choosing to trust in him, she opened her mouth as wide as she could, no longer able to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mouth looks really nice,\u201d Steven said as he stared into the cavern dripping with drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie blushed as she felt the boy\u2019s tiny feet trek across her palm and up to her lips. He took a giant step over to her teeth and rested his foot. A slew of horrible scenarios ran through Connie\u2019s mind of her suddenly losing control and chomping the adorable boy to bits. This was such a bad idea! Why did she agree to this? Then she felt Steven\u2019s hand on her upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the smile in Steven\u2019s tone, Connie felt humiliated. A tiny child was willfully stepping into her maw, ready to subject himself to her whims, and <i>he</i> was trying to reassure <i>her</i>? What kind of messed up, parallel world universe had she stumbled into? And how could she avoid going back? Connie blinked and wondered where that last thought came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalancing on the girl\u2019s teeth, Steven hopped the rest of the way in and did a belly-flop against the giant tongue. Connie\u2019s delighted moans reverberated all around the boy while he just laid there and basked in the vibrations and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no words to describe what Connie tasted. To call Steven \u2018good\u2019 would be the understatement of the century. His body was an explosion of flavors she\u2019d never experienced before, but even more than that was the texture. Steven\u2019s skin was so smooth, but she could also make out the outlines of his body. He was resting atop the tip of her tongue with his legs hanging off the edge. The side of his head was nuzzling into her oral appendage while his tiny pecker poked the tip. When had her tongue been able to make out this level of detail? Connie wasn\u2019t sure, but her jaw was starting to cramp from being open so long. She closed her mouth slightly, but not all the way. That seemed like a step too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can move if you want,\u201d Steven called. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun if you taste me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie briefly wondered if her onset willingness to do whatever this boy asked of her was indicative of some sort of psychological issue. Then she decided that the prospect of fun with the tiny boy invalidated all such concerns. Still not closing her mouth, Connie began by gently rolling the boy around. She licked at his face, which made him laugh. She licked along his sides and over his tush, which also made him laugh. Then, purely by accident, she licked his penis, and that made him moan. Connie froze, fearful that she\u2019d done something wrong, only for Steven to throw himself back onto the tongue and press his crotch into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Steven implored. Simply being tasted was all well and good, but it was infinitely better when the tongue played with his penis. As best he could, he tried to get some leverage on the tongue to coax it into licking him again. Connie must have gotten the hint as she pushed him to the floor of her mouth and began licking around his crotch. Steven moaned as the electrifying stimulation coursed through him. Connie lacked the dexterous expertise of the gems, but she was still doing great at exciting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie took Steven\u2019s attempt to hug her tongue as approval. Her lips had finally closed with no signs of protest as she continued her efforts. Steven\u2019s penis somehow tasted different than the rest of him. Richer in flavor, perhaps. All she knew for certain was that the tingle deep in her core was intensifying. Connie was semi-conscious of how her hand was migrating south. As if of its own volition, it pulled up her dress and reached down into her panties. Touching her slit was like a shock to her system, but quickly the sensation morphed into something less intense, but just as enticing. Her fingers seemed to know what they were doing as they probed into her adolescent sex and stirred around, all while the tiny boy assaulted her tongue with his amazing flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he felt himself about to burst, Steven tried to cry out in warning, only to get a mouthful of saliva. He erupted regardless. The mouth, pussy, or ass all had their pros and cons, but there was no denying in Steven\u2019s mind that his best orgasms were always inside of someone. And based on how much more urgently Connie was pressing into his crotch, Steven reasoned that she probably agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie suckled aggressively on her friend as he treated her while her fingers became just as forceful. She suckled and sucked with all her might to try and coax out more of Steven\u2019s delicious cream. Her mind was going hazy as all thoughts were consumed by the bliss of pleasure. Fortunately, she was still lucid enough to keep him towards the front of her mouth to avoid any risk of swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Steven\u2019s voice was muffled, it sounded like he\u2019d resumed laughing at his treatment, which only emboldened Connie further. Her mind had equated Steven feeling good to her feeling good, so the happier she made him, the happier she\u2019d be. It had worked out so far. She resumed tossing him around to explore every millimeter of his delectable body while he seemed to be having the time of his life. Sure enough, her hypothesis was proven when her body tensed as a wave of pleasure shot through her young pussy. Her body spasmed, unsure of what to do with itself. When it passed, Connie had fallen onto her side on the floor, feeling thoroughly drained. Steven, by contrast, was still romping around like her maw was his personal water park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the briefest moment, Connie hated him for embodying everything she\u2019d secretly wished she could be. In revenge, she\u2019d make him share his care-free spirit and fun-loving lifestyle with her, whether he liked it or not. Granted, he\u2019d probably like it, but it sound cooler in her head if there was an implicit threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids keep playing to see what else they can do with the remaining daylight.<br>\r\nSteven and Connie get cleaned up while her only clothes wash.<br>\r\nMaybe they should try some regular kid stuff again?<br>\r\nConnie has to leave.<br>\r\nGarnet gets an idea.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After who knows how long of sitting on the wood floor, Connie felt the contents of her mouth pushing her lips apart as Steven hopped out. His naked body glistened with saliva and he shivered in the open air. Still weak, Connie made the effort to try and grab the boy to warm him up, but her arm refused to cooperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d wear you out with just mouth stuff. I\u2019m sorry, Connie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \u201cHey, no sweat. It was my own fault. I got carried away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery true,\u201d agreed Garnet as she ascended the stairs. \u201cHopefully, you\u2019ll keep that in mind for next time. But speaking of sweat\u2026\u201d She paused to rethink her words. \u201cI could have phrased that better. The point is that you ought to get cleaned up before you head out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven threw his arms up in a cheer. \u201cHurray! Bath time!\u201d He laughed gleefully as he ran up onto Garnet\u2019s hand just as she leaned down. The tall red woman then scooped up Connie and carried her bridal style down to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait. I-I didn\u2019t bring any spare clothes,\u201d Connie informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. We just got a new washer that promises perfectly clean and dry clothes in less than 20 minutes,\u201d Pearl boasted as she walked alongside the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the bathroom, Connie was awed by the audacious and spacious room. It was an opulent setting with a tub that could hold 10 people, complete with a fountain in the middle. Connie was so taken aback by the rich layout that she failed to notice Garnet and Pearl stripping her until it was too late. She yelped as her hands reflexively moved to cover her privates. However, realizing that there were only women and the still tiny boy around, Connie reasoned that there was probably nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you stand?\u201d Garnet asked while gently setting the girl down on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie tentatively put pressure on her feet while Garnet held her waist. Her legs were a little wobbly, but stable enough. \u201cI think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light behind her caused Connie to turn around. Just above her face was a pair of crimson lips below a tuft of black hair. Garnet\u2019s thighs were enormous, but it was all muscle, at least from Connie\u2019s perspective. The red woman\u2019s ass was even more tremendous. It was the sort of booty that supermodels tortured themselves to attain, but came naturally to the perma-fusion. Connie\u2019s eyes trailed up, past the sculpted six-pack, until her vision was blocked by a pair of breasts larger than her head. What kind of top did Garnet wear to keep such grand chest pillows contained? Was there such a thing as industrial-strength bras? Speaking of which, where\u2019d her clothes go, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along. No dilly-dallying,\u201d Garnet chided gently as she escorted Connie to the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water\u2019s heat began as a bite on Connie\u2019s toes, but quickly melted into a pleasant kiss that climbed up her body. The girl heaved a sigh of relief as she sank into the water, only to find a seat built into the side; perfect for her size. With only her head above the water, Connie watched as Garnet slipped in after her. The girl was in awe of this amazon\u2019s amazing body, and also surprised that the only thing that remained of her clothes was her visor. Garnet\u2019s seat must have been lower since the water only barely came up over her nipples. Connie\u2019s awe became a smile when she saw Steven wave from Garnet\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Connie. How\u2019s the water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty great, like a hot tub. And are those jets against my back? Nnnf!\u201d Connie pressed herself against the wall. \u201cMy compliments to whoever made this thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let Pearl know,\u201d Garnet stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you guys built this?\u201d asked Connie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all pitched in, but Pearl was the architect. She went out and got a degree just so everything would be official. She can be rather anal-retentive about such things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! So you\u2019re monster fighters, <i>and</i> you\u2019ve got degrees? That\u2019s amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet allowed herself a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not half bad, yourself. A master swordsman, pilot of the first manned flight to Mars, and that\u2019s just the start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie blinked. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I\u2019ve never held a sword and I\u2019m not even old enough for a learner\u2019s permit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet adjusted her visor. \u201cGive it time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie, that\u2019s so amazing,\u201d Steven gushed. He jumped down into the water with a splash and swam over to her. Since her shoulder wasn\u2019t available, Connie let the naked boy sit in her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you do all that stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stuff? What about yours? Those were some pretty wild moves you used against that monster. And with these three,\u201d she gestured at Garnet, \u201cas your role models, I\u2019ll bet you do some pretty amazing things, too.\u201d Then Connie looked around. \u201cWhere are the others, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmethyst decided she doesn\u2019t like baths, for some reason,\u201d Steven explained uncertainly. \u201cWhich is sad, cuz baths are best with your best friends. Most things are, actually,\u201d he explained wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I keep telling Pearl that these machines are automated, but she\u2019s paranoid that if she doesn\u2019t monitor them, they\u2019ll sprout legs, hack the internet, and troll West Australia\u2026 again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I heard about that on the news,\u201d Connie realized. \u201cThat was you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on purpose,\u201d Steven asserted. \u201cA monster infected the fridge. At first, everything seemed fine, but then,\u201d he rolled his wrist and gestured at Garnet. \u201cI had to write an apology letter to the Australian Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen faced with such an admission, Connie couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. \u201cWow, you guys are just so\u2026 Wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why your doctorates are in the hard sciences and not language,\u201d Garnet remarked, making Connie blush. Garnet then placed a finger under the girl\u2019s chin to make her look up. \u201cHey, cheer up. You\u2019ve got an exciting future to look forward to, but don\u2019t forget to live in the moment. If there\u2019s one thing I know about Earth, it\u2019s that there are surprises waiting around every corner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d agreed Steven. \u201cJust imagine what kind of day you\u2019d have if you didn\u2019t decide to read on the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie\u2019s eyes became distant as she stared up at the ceiling. \u201cCompared to today, that would\u2019ve been hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t say that,\u201d Steven encouraged. He jumped from Connie\u2019s hand, swam up, and hugged her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and cupped her hand around his back. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you, but I mean it. If I had been anywhere else, we might not have met like we did. I wouldn\u2019t have been trapped with you and we wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 had the fun we did,\u201d she admitted with a blush. \u201cIt would have been just another boring, meaningless day like all the rest in my life. I wouldn\u2019t trade today for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea to have,\u201d affirmed Garnet. \u201cAnyway, we should probably get to cleaning.\u201d She held up her hand as a washcloth and soap bar dropped into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a guest in the house, Connie honored the customs of her hosts and helped in scrubbing one another. Steven was a wiggly one and seemed to treat being cleaned as just another game. When it was Connie\u2019s turn, Garnet insisted that the young girl sit in her lap. It was something else to have the amazon use her mighty hands to gently scrub the girl clean. Her touch was tender, but Connie had the feeling that if the mood struck her, Garnet could snap her like a twig. The thought was as terrifying as it was exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was Garnet\u2019s turn. Steven finally grew back to regular size to take on this herculean task. Lucky for Connie, Garnet saw fit to assign the kids to different sides of her body. Steven got the front and Connie got the ass-er-back. The miniature giant had to get out of the water and sit on a stool to grant the kids better access. As though he were still small, Steven threw himself bodily against Garnet and used his whole being to work up a lather against her giant boobies. Connie was far more conservative in her touches. Garnet\u2019s back was broad and beautiful, but her ass was so enormous that there were points where Connie swore that she could feel its gravity pulling on her. The great globes of each cheek were bigger than the girl\u2019s whole body, and the smell\u2026 The tingle had returned with a vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie might have blacked out at some point because the ordeal seemed to end in a flash. She was clean, got dressed in her freshly washed clothes, and everything had concluded. The sun was setting and there was no more time to dawdle. So she said her goodbyes to Steven and the gems, looking forward to the next time they could hangout.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Connie gone, Steven was left alone in Garnet\u2019s palm in the living room. Both were naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Garnet asked as Steven started chortling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnie didn\u2019t know that you guys don\u2019t get dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Our bodies are hard-light and can expel unwanted particles, but our gems,\u201d Garnet indicated the one beneath Steven\u2019s tiny feet, could stand to be polished now and then.\u201d At Steven\u2019s ongoing accusing look, Garnet buckled. \u201cOkay, so maybe it was a lie of omission, but it was still fun, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure was. Connie looked like she was really enjoying herself towards the end, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Garnet brought the tiny boy up to her face and applied a big red kiss that covered most of his body. \u201cDo you remember what I said this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven frowned thoughtfully as he recalled. A lot had been said a few hours ago, and a lot had happened since. \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet grinned. \u201cMaybe this will jog your memory.\u201d The Amazonian woman leaped up to the loft in a single bound before dropping Steven onto his bed. Turning around, she climbed up after him and squatted low on her knees. The lights were on, but they were eclipsed as Steven was cast in the shadow of her gargantuan ass. Garnet\u2019s ass was objectively the largest of the remaining gems with a plump shape and a firmness that you could bounce a quarter off of. From Steven\u2019s perspective, it looked like a big red heart was looming directly overhead. Peeking over her shoulder, Garnet reached back and pulled her cheeks apart to reveal an anus twitching with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Steven\u2019s cock rose to full mast from just the sight. It was almost like he was engaged in a staring contest with the twitching pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositioning herself so that her legs were to either side of the boy, Garnet spanked herself, sending ripples across her expansive butt cheeks. She moaned. Even after all these years, it still felt so lewd to do this. Rose\u2019s rebellion had learned much from human notions of lovemaking and her followers were all too happy to indulge. Young or old, man or woman, the humans were a precious source of heart-warming fun for gems accustomed to a life of planned monotony. While Garnet was the most independent of the Crystal Gems, she still loved loving humans, and that held especially true with Steven. Their relationship was special. He was Rose, but also not. It could be tricky sometimes, but Garnet was largely content to accept the simple truth that they loved one another. Steven had grown up surrounded by the love of the gems and emphatically returned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s mouth hung open in awe as the titanic ass wiggled overhead. Garnet bent low, like she was about to sit on the boy, only to swerve off at the last minute. When she did it again, Steven laughed at the apparent game. He ran around as if to dodge, but not too fast. \u201cYou won\u2019t catch me,\u201d he dared. Garnet\u2019s ass got closer with every lunge. Her rankness permeated Steven\u2019s nose and made his erection almost painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet looked down, past the valley of her cleavage and between her legs to the boy who\u2019d stopped running. They shared a smile before she bit her bottom lip and dropped down. \u201cAHH!\u201d she exclaimed. Steven\u2019s tiny body was pressed right against her ass hole and his wiggling sent lightning bolts of pleasure through her system. She ground her ass against the sheets and moved him around. He struggled, not to get away, but because he knew how much she loved it, which just made her even more turned on. Garnet reached back to knead her butt cheeks around the boy and increase the friction of his tiny body against her sensitive ass. Then she felt something slip into her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was granted a brief reprieve. He was hanging upside down with his lower half wedged up Garnet\u2019s anus. He recognized the feel of her anal walls gripping him so possessively. His grin widened, only for him to gasp when the world flipped itself around. When he\u2019d been righted, Steven was back in the light with gravity pulling him down. Garnet\u2019s huge ass cheeks rose like mountains to either side of him. To the front, past her gorgeous and glistening slit, Garnet was lying awkwardly on her back with her ass and legs propped up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun, Steven?\u201d Garnet pulled off her visor so that he could better see the love she bore in all three eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven nodded tiredly. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m just,\u201d he panted, \u201ca little tired. It\u2019s been a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet smiled, reached between her legs, and touched his cheek. \u201cIt certainly has. You did splendidly. I had a feeling you two might get along, but this is only the beginning. She called you her first friend, and that\u2019s something to be treasured. Make her feel special, Steven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will.\u201d Even enveloped up to his groin in her anus, Steven gave his body a twist that made Garnet shudder. \u201cI\u2019ll make her feel special, just like I do for all my friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh! That\u2019s what I like to hear,\u201d Garnet purred. She took two handfuls of her mighty posterior and pulled them apart while also clenching her anal walls. Steven was pulled in, only for the muscles to immediately relax. He laughed at the continuation of the game and tried pulling himself free. There were few things that got Garnet wetter than the sound of Steven being happy, so she repeated the process. She bit her lip as her beloved plaything tried climbing forward, just out of reach of touching her pussy. She was effectively teasing herself as much as him at this point as she gave her ass another flex. A hand was freed to start rubbing her clit, all while she held eye contact with Steven. She was getting herself off while sucking him into her ass, and she wanted him to know that. Steven gave her a look that said that he understood, and was happy to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last flex pulled Steven all the way into the gem\u2019s moist hole. Human women didn\u2019t have naturally lubricated anuses, which was just one more thing that he loved about the gems. With wet, squishy flesh compressing all around him and Garnet\u2019s moans reverberating through her body, Steven wasted no time in wiggling. He wormed his way downward in recollection of Garnet\u2019s most sensitive spots. She cried out and clenched even tighter around him. There came a shift around Steven\u2019s gut as the gem manifested a tiny mouth for his penis. It was Steven\u2019s turn to cry out in bliss as the toothless orifice sucked on his cock while a pair of tongues played with his balls. Garnet must have really liked the way this got Steven moving as more tiny tongues appeared around him. Steven laughed as he was assaulted on all fronts by the affectionate licks. His face, belly, feet, and even between his own butt cheeks. Nothing was spared as Garnet\u2019s real mouth moved from the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet\u2019s climax was like a fountain, gushing liquid orgasm up and all across her body. Her body seized up as the pressure on tiny Steven intensified. He also came, but less intense than she\u2019d have preferred. That was okay. Her orgasm had been satisfying to the both of them. The tiny tongues in her anus melted back into her inner walls to grant the boy some well-deserved rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting upright on the bed, Garnet\u2019s ecstasy built as her imagination took over. Rose had been more than just a brilliant tactician on the battlefield. She was also the most adventurous and creative when it came to fun and lovemaking. She would take basic ideas presented by the humans, and expand upon them beyond what any could have foreseen. It was like taking the human invention of the wheel and turning it into a locomotive. The parties she used to throw were the stuff of legend and myth. It was a legacy that Steven had inherited. And while he was still only a beginner, Garnet had the <i>feeling</i> that things would only improve from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do things go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s follow Garnet through her night routine.<br>\r\nSteven wakes up, but still in Garnet\u2019s ass.<br>\r\nSteven is let out and ready for the day to begin.<br>\r\nWhat are the other gems up to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI remember I had first awoken in, of all things a bed. A nice comfortable bed with 3 layers of blankets, 2 pillows, and a quilt on top.\u201d He did his best to recount as much detail as possible to keep the story going. \u201cRight away I knew that I had no idea where I was or who I was, so I pulled myself up. Once I saw that I wasn\u2019t wearing anything, I tried to cover myself up, but after a couple minutes of listening to the singing birds outside, I figured that there wasn\u2019t anyone around to see me. I knew that the first thing I needed was to get my bearings, so I surveyed the room for anything of interest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll in all, there was a dresser, three large empty book stands, a chair, desk, and two windows with their blinds shut. There are still a few contraptions in there that I haven\u2019t quite figured out yet. Maybe when you get better you could give them a look-see.\u201d Felecia drifted in and out of consciousness, but Joseph knew he could keep her with him with the sound of a familiar voice. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI noticed that there was some kind of switch on the wall to my left. I gave it a flip, but nothing happened. There were three doors, but only one was open. I got up to test the closed doors, but they were all locked. After trying the dresser and a few other cabinets around the room, I started thinking that maybe everything closed was also locked. Once I had finished a brief expedition of the hall way, living room and kitchen, I found that my theory was correct in every regard except one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe only other open door was to the forest. Looking through the glass windows, the word \u2018backyard\u2019 came to mind. Not sure why but it seemed appropriate. Despite sunlight shining through the blinds in all other windows, the backyard was surprisingly dark. I guess it\u2019s due to the thickness of the canopy. Anyway, since I had nothing better to do indoors, and a warm refreshing breeze was blowing in through a partially opened window, I figured I might as well go outside and enjoy the day. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAfter about fifty feet of what some might consider stalking, probably not you, I decided to look back at the place where I had woken. The house itself seemed fairly normal, but the really freaky thing was directly on top. An enormous metal wall with some kind of glowing array of opaque lights shooting out above it seemed to run right through the house. Seriously though, part of that damn Fence makes up a huge barren dead end of a wall. I swear it\u2019s like we\u2019re cut off from the other end of the house. But I digress, the Fence stretched out endlessly in either direction; or at least it would have if all the trees hadn\u2019t blocked my view.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRemember when you told me about the Fence?\u201d Joseph inquired while he set various items beside his patient as per the directions in the book. When Felecia didn\u2019t answer, Joseph just continued talking. \u201cYour right. I guess it\u2019s not really relevant to this part of the story anyway. You don\u2019t come in until much later. I\u2019m just letting you know that I haven\u2019t forgotten you.\"</span></div></div>",

The only thing to grab my attention was throat becoming quite dry. Finally I found myself some water at Gigigly. We\u2019ll get into how that place is relevant a bit later. Anyway, the Fence ran straight through clear sparkly pond. Regardless of whatever you might think, I am not now, nor was I ever <i>completely</i> devoid of common sense. I found a long stick and proceeded to poke into the water. I wasn\u2019t just testing the depth; I was also making sure that there wasn\u2019t anything lurking beneath the surface. Once I found a sufficiently shallow pool, I dipped my hands in for several refreshing gulps.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen a splash came from out in the pond, it made me jump back and fall on my butt.\u201d Joseph smiled to himself as he watched her eyes move beneath their lids, \u201cYou know, if you were awake right now you\u2019d be laughing too. Anyway, I scanned the surface of the water for any signs of movement. About half way across the lake, were four small heads poking out of the water and swimming towards land. I hid behind a tree until I saw that the creatures crawling out of the pond were some kind of green otters. They were really small, so I saw no harm in stalking them for a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI figured if critters that small were moving around in broad daylight, then surely it meant that there were no predators to worry about. It would be nice to bathe in the pond without any worries of being torn in half. With the stick still in hand, I followed the otters for most of the day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d Joseph began as he filled a syringe with a pink liquid \u201cfollowing a gaggle of otters through a forest, buck naked for several hours sounds pretty exciting. But after a while, I gave the otters a silent \u201cthank you.\u201d After all, they had taught me so much about the place I now call home. I got to see which berries were safe to eat. I saw some weird ants that apparently like fecal matter. At which I thought: <i>Nice. Now I don\u2019t have to worry about stepping in anyone\u2019s crap, especially my own.</i> I even saw a boar carcass, which was a lot more interesting than it sounds. Based on its flat teeth, I managed to deduce that I could hunt them if I managed to get a better stick. Don\u2019t get me wrong, but those things are pretty damn big. No offense.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Joseph injected the pink liquid into Felecia\u2019s forearm, he couldn\u2019t help but marvel at his own skills. It was as if his hands instinctively knew what to do, and were operating independent of his own mind. He had the hands of a forty year medical veteran even though stubble was just beginning to grow on his chin. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnyway, the remaining discoveries of the day included a patch of plants that the otters dug up. I gave em a try and they weren\u2019t too bad. There was also a rock that they licked. I used my finger to give it a taste. It had this really weird flavor. It was nowhere near as weird as what went on in my head. A moment after the stuff had dissolved in my mouth, I thought the word: salt. A flood of images then poured into my head, showing me things like how I could grind up the salt rocks and use them to preserve dead animals for later use. It was easily the trippiest moment of the day.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph followed the next few steps in the medicine book. He grabbed two small rags. The first he folded and maneuvered into her mouth. The second he soaked in alcohol.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI might have kept on following those cute little guys were it not for what happened next. A solitary predator about half the size of the pig, jumped out of the bushes, grabbed an otter and snapped its neck all in the blink of an eye. It had kind of a wolf\u2019s head, monkey\u2019s body, long arms with long claws, and fairly sharp teeth. As I sat there and watched the thing fling the corpse around, giving little roars of victory, I wondered what to do next. Should I avoid it and not make any enemies, or steal the dead otter for myself?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBy the way, I take no enjoyment in this whatsoever.\u201d Joseph concluded his speech as he gently placed the alcohol drenched rag against her wound. Felecia\u2019s eyes flew open, her screams muffled under the rag. Upon seeing such a powerful creature reduced to relying on his care, Joseph gave a quick snicker before continuing.</span></div></div>",

As her body slowly began to relax, her half closed eyes wandered the room before falling on Joseph. Upon seeing Joseph\u2019s face, she was greeted with a relieved smile. \u201cHey there sleepy head. Welcome back to the world of the living.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia moaned groggily and made muffled sounds through the rag that sounded vaguely like \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Her voice was deep and almost sensual. Taking into account the rag in her mouth and her severe loss of blood, her voice might as well have been a whisper compared to her usual volume.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Continuing to apply pressure against the rag on her side, Joseph asked \u201cWe\u2019re in my house.

Even if it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the most defendable of positions, especially in my present state.\u201d Felecia hissed as Joseph applied medicine soaked cotton balls against her various scratches. \u201cBesides, this is the most secure place I know of.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he asked, extending his arm in the direction of the living room. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wall that\u2019s made up of mostly glass.

It\u2019s likely that nothing short of a falling tree is capable of breaking through these walls.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026ok\u201d Joseph said.

Looking back he instructed \u201cjust keep putting pressure on that cloth and you should be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he walked out the archway to the room where the weakened Felecia still lay, Joseph began going over the configuration of the house in his mind. To his right was the room where he use to sleep. He gave a quick peek inside. Satisfied that there were no predators small enough to hide in there he turned his attention to the left. After seeing no immediate danger, Joseph made his way down the hall. At the other end of the hall was the living room and the only door in and out of the house. Between him and the door rested a large couch and two recliners. They would provide decent cover to approach the door unnoticed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The problem lay in uncertainty; the uncertainty as to whether or not the door was already locked, and the uncertainty about the condition of the blinds. Normally Joseph left the blinds open during the day to help warm the house. As per Felecia\u2019s advice, he started closing the blinds at night to keep his privacy. It was a new habit that had yet to completely sink in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally coming to the end of the hall, Joseph knew his next step would be to peek around the corner to check on the blinds and the door. If the blinds for the window wall were closed then he could probably head straight for the door without pause. Open blinds would call for a much more subtle approach, especially if there was movement outside. However, the biggest issue wasn\u2019t whether or not the door was locked, but whether or not it was closed. Even if it wasn\u2019t locked the only way to open it was to turn the handle and the only predators in Naxia with opposable thumbs were him and apparently Felecia. If he hadn\u2019t closed the door completely and it had been blown open by a gust of wind, then something may have already wandered in. something that Joseph wasn\u2019t confident he could take with just a spear and knife.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment of truth.</span></div></div>",

In this poor light, the door seemed as closed as it could get, but the blinds were open. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t move fast\u201d Joseph muttered to himself as he ducked down, ready to jump behind the couch. \u201cGotta be cautious.\u201d The storm continued to rage outside. The songs of nocturnal birds drowned out by the constant thud of raindrops and the occasional boom of thunder. The dangerous part was the lightening. If he peeked out during a flash then he might be able to see outside movement, but if anything was out there they\u2019d certainly be able to see him, flash or no flash. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Staying as low as possible, Joseph tucked and almost rolled behind the couch. Still in crouching position he moved swiftly behind the couch. Arriving at the edge, weapons still in hand, Joseph made another jump, this time for the first recliner. As he did so a flash of light filled the room. While taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph felt the rumble of thunder move through his entire body, accompanied, shortly after, by distant howls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With each breath, Joseph\u2019s heart seemed to beat faster. At this point he was actually to the right of the door. Directly in front of him was the brick and wood part of the wall. He continued to hide behind the recliners until he was completely against the wall. Pressing himself against it, Joseph made good time to the door. Confirming that it was indeed unlocked, he considered the next challenge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph still didn\u2019t know whether or not the predators were near yet, the door was half made of glass, and the door-knob. He would have to reach out across almost two feet of transparent glass, provoking anything within twenty meters to charge.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fearing that the sound of his racing heart could be heard over the sound of the storm, Joseph attempted to calm himself. \u201cThey\u2019re just dumb animals you moron. Even if they do see you they don\u2019t know how doors work.\u201d Starting to laugh a bit, Joseph continued muttering to himself. \u201cBesides, if the door\u2019s closed enough to endure the wind then it could probably take a direct hit from a charging rhino. Right?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making up his mind, Joseph discarded the notion of reaching slowly across the door. Instead he dropped his weapons and made one last jump in front of the door, turning the lock until he heard the click.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he stared outside, the constant splatter of drops continuing to bombard its glass, Joseph felt a wave of relief wash over him. Bursts of laughter were interrupted by brief but deep calming breaths. All was right in the world as lightning flashed again, illuminating the swaying brush outside and covering it in an instant with a mass of fur and teeth.</span></div></div>",

The giant wolf\u2019s body and face was covered in long black fur, a pair of horns as thick and long as a human arm protrude threateningly from its head and eyes, as bright and yellow as the sun, glared level with Joseph\u2019s. The monster\u2019s long fangs had such strength and sharpness that they made Joseph\u2019s spear the equivalent of a tooth-pick. This thought provoked a most unpleasant image in Joseph\u2019s mind. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The latest resident of Naxia might have gone on to examine other intimidating features of this vicious beast; he might even have noticed an entire pack pacing back and forth just behind it. However, Joseph was far too preoccupied with the rows of flesh rending teeth that were revealed by the drom\u2019s partially opened mouth. There were also the drom\u2019s eyes to consider; those deep golden eyes that seemed to consume all those who lost their way in them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Out of nowhere the beast moved, opening its mouth several inches before closing to its original position, almost like a silent bark. A startled Joseph took several steps backward. The scare tactic had effectively broken him out of thed trance. Able to think again, Joseph started remembering Felecia\u2019s teachings. The first was in regards to large predators and how to never look them in the eye. After that, the dam in his mind collapsed and al his lessons came rushing back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph recounted one of Felecia\u2019s earliest lessons. He remembered the way she would stare out across the forest as she lay sunning on one of the large rocks outside her cave, her cat like tail swaying from side to side. A gust of wind brought with it a flurry of pollen, causing Joseph periodic sneezes. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without even glancing at him, she said \u201cShow no fear. It is the defining feature of prey when they are afraid; especially in the minds of the scavengers. To show fear is to admit weakness to a harsh and unforgiving world. A beast may not have fang, claw, or horn to boast of, but if they are not afraid then they likely have just reason to be so. Be it out of ignorance or confidence, it is a dangerous gamble to charge the one who is not afraid.\u201d It was then that Felecia turned her head and looked him straight in the eye. \u201cProve yourself and do not blink\u201d she said as she continued staring right through him. \u201cShow no fear. Show no weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph had failed the first test, but after weeks of practice all his hard work seemed to have paid off. Just as Felecia told him, Joseph stood his ground, choosing to stare between the beast\u2019s eyes rather than into them. He crunched his brow, tensed his muscles threateningly, and bore his teeth with a low growl. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The drom attempted another bark, this one less silent. It took every ounce of Joseph\u2019s will power not to budge as he stared past the razor sharp teeth into the gaping maw that could swallow him whole.  The beast stared into Joseph\u2019s eyes in an effort to lock him in another trance, but to no avail. It could find no fear to latch on to, only courage. Slowly it began to dawn on the drom that perhaps the naked pink creature it stared at wasn\u2019t prey. No prey could stare into his eyes without shaking in fear. The over-fluffed puppy lowered its gaze as he cautiously backed away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Satisfied that both he and Felecia were safe, and that he had stood his ground, Joseph started to move again. Without ceasing to stare through the glass, Joseph collected his weapons, confirmed one last time that the door was locked and proceeded to close the blinds. With everything set and secure, Joseph used the remains of his strength to move himself out of the living room and into the hallway. There he collapsed, tears of fear flowing from his eyes. Joseph remained this way for several minutes.</span></div></div>",

As he fell to his knees by her side, Felecia looked up into his red watery eyes. Without needing to ask why, she reached out and touched Joseph\u2019s knee. \u201cNice job kid.\u201d Felecia said proudly, giving him the necessary strength he needed to continue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wiping away the remains of his tears, Joseph smiled back at Felecia. \u201cRight. Well, I hate to leave things unfinished, so why don\u2019t I pick up where we left off.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWonderful\u201d Felecia said rolling her eyes and pulling her hand back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trying to remember where he had last stopped, Joseph dived back into his tale. \u201cUm, this next part\u2019s a bit fuzzy, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Joseph said hesitantly. \u201cAs I weighed my options I noticed some mysterious crackling sound that seemed to reverberate throughout the woods. It grew louder and louder until it sounded like thunder, and I watched as one of the trees started to fall. It wasn\u2019t falling towards me and that was good, especially since I was so freaked that I couldn\u2019t move. The creature I was watching seemed to be in the same boat. The only difference was that the tree fell on her instead of me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis part is also a bit fuzzy. All I can really remember is this unbearable stabbing headache. I pressed my hands against my head for all the good it did me. The only other thing I remember before passing out was some kind of flash inside my mind; so many lights and shapes.\u201d Joseph had to look away for a moment. Every time he thought about his headaches, he seemed to cause them to come back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen I finally came to, I saw that the creature was writhing underneath the tree. I looked at her and immediately the word \u2018Gralder\u2019 came to mind.\u201d Joseph smiled exhaustively and shook his head. \u201cI started wondering how I suddenly knew what the gralder\u2019s name was when I hadn\u2019t a clue only a couple minutes ago. The only thing that really came to mind was that flash in my head. Thankfully before I could put in any serious thought and cause a relapse, the gralder decided to cry out and snap me back to my senses. I walked over to the squirming monkey-thing and noticed he saw that she had dropped the otter a few feet away. As I got closer, I met eyes with her and she stopped struggling. I can\u2019t really explain it, but I think we share a little moment of understanding. The gralder\u2019s back leg was being crushed beneath the tree and there was no way for her to escape. She was fully aware that I could find a large rock, smash her skull, and eat the remains. </span></div></div>",

And to make a long story short I broke off a thick branch from the fallen tree and used it as a lever to move the tree just enough for the gralder to escape. All the while a voice in the back of my head kept screaming at me, calling me an idiot. So you see, I really don\u2019t need your help in that regard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce she was free, I immediately took several steps back. She rose to her maximum height and started stretching her various extremities. For some reason she felt the need to start doing a little dance, it was like she was celebrating her survival. Eventually she decided to test her leg. She put her weight on it for barely an instant before immediately pulling her broken leg back into the air. She gave a light yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think I must have laughed or something, cause then the gralder looked at me. Her face was blank as her eyes seemed to survey me. I watched her eyes dart between me and the tree branch that I held between us. I guess she was confused at the fact that she was still alive, and more so that I had spared her. She turned away from me and buried her face in the brush on the ground, sniffing through the twigs until she found her way to where the otter had dropped. She picked it up with her jaws and turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.\u201d Joseph\u2019s eyes darted to Felecia\u2019s face. He could have sworn that she had just smiled, if only for a second. Joseph continued telling his story, confident that his words were indeed getting through to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith seemingly intelligent and humble movements, and the otter still in her mouth, the gralder started moving closer and closer to me. Guessing her intentions, I lowered my stick a bit as a sign of good will. But I never stopped aiming the sharp end at her. If it was a trick, I wasn\u2019t going to fall for it. She continued to approach until she was mere inches outside of my stick\u2019s range. She opened her mouth a bit and let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt could have ended there, but it didn\u2019t. I had almost completely relaxed my stick and everything. I was even in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position. That\u2019s when the gralder did something to make us both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

I even yelled \u2018Back\u2019!\u201d Joseph raised his voice a bit to try and match his original volume. \u201cShe flinched a bit at the sound of my voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept taking baby step after baby step.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI thought to myself: If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. We were in each other\u2019s territory then; her within reach of my spear, and me within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured, I said to myself. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI got my answer when the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I thought, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If that weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With my spear still trained on her head, I pondered this for a few moments. Finally, I decided on the only practical option available. Very slowly, I lowered my spear past her until it was pointing at the dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith a single motion I jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back. I was ready to fight off the gralder if it had turned out to have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. I kept moving back until I was about four meters away, and decided that it was safe to turn my back. The instant I did so the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following me. She limped the whole way. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was pretty weird. When I stopped she did as well. When I turned around she bowed her head. We played this game of stop and go for almost an hour before I decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. I slowed my pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. I found another berry bush and ate my fill since there was no way to carry any with me. I even let the gralder eat her fill after I had walked far enough forward. It was kind of relieving to see her eat. Once the house was finally in sight, I decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning around to face her, I called \u2018Hurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper\u2019.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I even found some material that looked like it would make a suitable splint for Gimp. I also found stones that made excellent spark rocks. Once I was done foraging outside, I told Gimp to stay put while I ventured inside to find anything of use that I might have missed earlier.

The title was Survival in Naxia.\u201d Pausing for a bit, \u201cYes I know, we\u2019ll be getting to the book in a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI finally remembered that I was hungry. The growls in my stomach were growing ever louder as I began my work. I started by designating a spot for the fire, setting the rocks in a circle, filling it with most of the dried wood I had collected earlier, and set the other pieces in their respective locations. It only took me about four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire; I was so proud. Then I bled, skinned, cleaned, gutted, and finally roasted the otter. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith Gimp sitting a few yards away from the fire, and my spear resting next to him, I picked up the book and read to the fading light of the setting sun. It was a very detailed book; with its categorizations and big words that I still don\u2019t fully understand. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia are categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. I didn\u2019t make it very far that night, but I did skim through some of the edible and poisonous plants. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce the meat seemed ready, I put the book down, grabbed one end of the spit and took a big bite.\u201d Joseph paused for a moment as he recounted that first bite. \u201cIt was freaking delicious. After I had my fill I used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After putting out the fire I packed up the gear and made my way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. I climbed into the old bed while Gimp curled up beside me and we both drifted off to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The drumbeat of my heart overwhelmed the songs of birds which had greeted me the previous day. I tried to recount exactly what had scared me so much; what my nightmare had been about.\u201d  Joseph began to shutter. It was like standing in front of that damn Drom all over again. Joseph was always a bit shaky when it came to thinking about sleep and dreams. \u201cBut as with most dreams, it quickly escaped me. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI felt a sudden pressure around my arm and jerked, only to see that it was a concerned Gimp.

Once my fingers came to a rest upon my lips, I noticed something was wrong with my face.

My amusement and laughter came from a gut feeling I had. A gut feeling that told me that I\u2019d likely spend every night this way for the rest of my life.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And once again, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRight. Now let\u2019s try and set the mood. The smell of fresh rain and blooming flowers permeated the air. Chirping insects, singing birds, and the occasional howl in the distance, gave the forest an overwhelming and almost soothing thrum. I could hardly keep his eyes open as I sat up against the red tree. I sat beneath an exceptionally large hole in the canopy, enjoying the feel of the warm sun against my wet skin. I had just finished a nice swim in the pond. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven the rumble of a nearby snoring Gimp was lulling me to sleep. She had been so relieved at having her cast removed that she wore herself out in celebration.\u201d Joseph smiled as he recounted how the fuzzy creature had galloped and bounded around the pond while he swam. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was on the verge of taking a nap, but I managed to pull myself out of it.\u201d Joseph shuddered. \u201cI had kinda made a commitment to sleep only as much as my body needed and not a second more. I looked around to find something to keep my mind occupied. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA newly carved and hardened spear lay by my side. It seemed to be waiting impatiently for the next hunt when it would again taste blood.\u201d Joseph smiled as he noticed the empathy in Felecia\u2019s expression. \u201cHanging from a nail directly overhead was my old pack holding a few pieces of red fruit, the guide book, a cutting knife, about 20ft of poorly crafted rope if I do say so myself, and a pair of trunks I had made from that first pig. I could have taken the trunks swimming with me, but they itched something awful. So they were left hanging while I got my bare ass dirty again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was about that time that I thought of the book.

He knew that he had power over her, at least in this particular situation, and he was going to milk it for all it was worth. Felecia averted her eyes, signaling that he had permission to go on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo. As I flipped through the pages of my personal bible, I recounted what a marvelous and useful tool it was. It had taught me what I could and couldn\u2019t eat, which things were poisonous, some crap about fertile soil, and a lot more stuff that even you can\u2019t tell me. The opening two pages held a detailed fold out map of all Naxia. As you might have already known, this land was shaped like a perfect square. I was able to make out where my house was in relation to trails, bodies of water and a suspicious labyrinth of stone in a place called Naxia\u2019s Teeth. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe bulk of the book seemed more like one giant glossary than a guide. It was divided into several volumes. Each detailed the different species in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHowever, amidst sea of words of the first few Volumes, I discovered some highly unusual marks. While the majority of the book was quite readable, every now and then a string of unfamiliar symbols would replace words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it cuz I was still shocked that I could even read. But these marks really got my attention when I noticed a substantial increase within the chapter on deadly diseases.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let it bother you too much\u201d Felecia comforted. \u201cI\u2019ve read that book and I\u2019ve seen those grey areas. Trust me that I can fill in most of those gaps through life experiences. After all, I\u2019ve been here a lot longer than you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes\u201d answered Joseph sarcastically. \u201cThe almighty Felecia rushes in yet again to save the day. Anyway, Volumes Three and Four described the fungus and plants of the forest. I skimmed through this section rather quickly, so the only things to catch my attention were a picture of a patch of long grass with a large rock resting behind its rows and an orange moss with the ability to decompose fecal matter. If I\u2019m using too many big words, it means that you can crap on it one day and come back the next to find a bigger clump of moss.\u201d Joseph laughed to himself as he remembered the first time he read this and how he had found a patch of moss near his house and tested it.</span></div></div>",

While they had neither teeth nor venom, they secreted hallucinogenic mucus from their skin when frightened. A quote from the author directly following this fact still confuses me. \u2018Don\u2019t even think about it.\u2019 Weird huh?\u201d Felecia chuckled to herself, gaining Joseph\u2019s attention. \u201cIs there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia shook her head. \u201cOf course there is.

Rather than do the same back to him, she merely gave him a look that said that she could but chose not to. Staring into her deep golden slit eyes, Joseph was the first to back down. \u201cJust don\u2019t go sticking the damn things in your mouth without cooking them first. You\u2019ll live longer.

I practically threw that book to the ground and screamed like a girl at the sight of those scaly heads. It took me a little while to recover, but I managed. I found the place where I left off and immediately folded the page over before continuing.\u201d Laughing to himself \u201cAnd I thought the nightmares were bad.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNext came the birds. While the beautiful and bizarre fouls of Section Four were pretty to look at, I was growing ever more fretful at the increasing frequency of the unreadable glyphs. It seemed that the closer I came to the end of the guide, the more they seemed to creep up on me. The other unnerving detail of this section was the final entry depicting a very large bird. The five foot Kresht had brownish green feathers for camouflage, could reach speeds that surpassed the any other land creature thus far. It could certainly give you a run for your money. And it had a sharp beak for rending the flesh from its prey. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReading that, I was so freaked out I had to put the book down for a sec and take a look around. When I was satisfied by the unbothered stir of the forest and the still resting Gimp, I pulled my spear in a bit closer and uneasily resumed reading to Section Five. Looking back, I guess I failed to consider the distant warning cry of the zimzim; easily the brightest and loudest bird in all Naxia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was almost laughable that something as dreadful as the kresht could be followed up by the most adorable little mouse anyone had ever seen. At the time, I thought it was some kind of positive omen for the rest of the volume. Or rather, I tried to think of it that way. As I read through the remaining creatures, a sense of unease was growing in my gut, almost like I could feel time was running out.</span></div></div>",

The first resembled a gralder, except this one was twice as large and had wings. Next came the Droms; aka, those giant dogs that I saved you from. The third and final beast was some manner of big cat with long fangs extending below the roof of its mouth. My heart might have exploded out of my chest were it not for the suspiciously glaring fact that all of these large predators were situated in and around Naxia\u2019s Teeth, all the way at the opposite end of the map.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph paused and looked up for a moment. \u201cIn fact, almost all of the larger animals seemed to make their home in the top two thirds of the map; a most puzzling phenomenon that I couldn\u2019t help but ponder.

Joseph decided not to push the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn-between the glyphs were all kinds of useless footnotes; a lot of which included it enormous size and weight. Apparently an Utek can stand about 3.5 meters tall with its head fully raised. Go figure, huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers talked about the fact that since the Utek seemed like such a freakishly powerful super predator that it probably originates somewhere other than Naxia. What do ya think of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia had been looking away from Joseph ever since he started this subject. Clearly it was making her uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember thinking to myself, it\u2019s like the damn books deliberately avoiding whether or not this \u201csuper predator\u201d eats humans. I was so wrapped up in my reading that I failed to notice the once distant warning cries of the birds grow ever closer before finally falling silent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he had regained Felecia\u2019s interest.</span></div></div>",

Low and behold all remaining text had been replaced with the glyphs. But I didn\u2019t notice this until much later. My attention was focused on the second appearance of a second picture in a single entry. Damn that thing was freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seemed like an unremarkable sketch of some kind of dark rock partially hidden behind layers of a familiar batch of long grass. After pondering this for a few seconds, I finally realized where I had seen it before and turned back to the Volume on plants. I skimmed through the pages a bit before finally finding it. It was little more than a photo of a common kind of grass called Emel. I was holding the pages with his left thumb and forefinger so I could hold my place. I flipped back and forth between them in an effort to compare the two images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe image in the plant Volume, like every other picture in the guide, was a photograph. While the Volume Five version was the one and only sketch, and a pretty well drawn sketch at that. As I continued to stare at the sketch trying to deduce its purpose, I gradually became aware of two small yellow blotches on the rock. Pulling the book closer, the blotches becoming ever clearer, I at last he noticed their symmetric positions and shapes. As I drew the book ever closer to my face, I was able to make out lines that seemed to take the shape of a nose. From there an image of a face was formed, followed soon after by teeth, a lower jaw and a crouching body. But always I kept going back to those yellow hypnotic cat eyes.\u201d Joseph\u2019s heart continued to race just as it had done that very day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sudden nearby rustle caused me to jump. I fumbled to recapture the loose book, but to no avail. Turning to the source of the sound, I saw that Gimp had woken from her nap. She was sitting up, her ears perked, fur standing on end, and eyes glued somewhere off in front of her and I. As I stared at her, at last it dawned on me that the forest was dead silent. Not a chirp, squawk, or squeak for miles. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTurning my head to face the same direction as Gimp, I immediately noticed a small rustle in a patch of Emel not 30 meters in front of me. And in that Emel were those same cold yellow eyes as depicted in the sketch.\u201d</span></div></div>",

How the hell would you have felt?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia crunched her brow. \u201cI felt scared. If you recall, I was no older than you are now when I first woke up in this place. My early years were filled with running, escaping, and glares from hungry predators. It wasn\u2019t until much later that I became strong enough not to run.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph calmed down and continued. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what I was looking at. But I wasn\u2019t exactly in a thinking state of mind. Those eyes\u2026 it felt like they were swallowing me alive. I might have stayed lost in those eyes if it weren\u2019t for Gimp. And you\u2019ll never guess what she did,\u201d Joseph said sarcastically. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh I don\u2019t know\u201d Felecia answered acerbically with a false smile. \u201cDid she do the only intelligent thing and run away?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah\u201d Joseph exhaled. \u201cI heard a rustle from where she was lying which broke me out of that trance. It took me a bit but the sound of claws scraping against wood forced me to look up. The bitch was half way up the damn tree by then. Course, in her position, guess I would\u2019 a done the same.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI quickly faced forward again to see if the Utek had come any closer. It hadn\u2019t. It just stayed in the long grass in what I assume was a crouching position, ready to spring up and pounce on me in a second. Fortunately, I knew better than to get myself trapped in its eyes again. I glanced down hastily and immediately remembered the spear. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe gears started winding in my head. The Utek outmatched me in strength, speed, and size, but there was a chance that I had a superior intellect. I could use my small size and low center of gravity to my advantage. If I could manage to get the spear in just the right position, then it might be possible to use the beast\u2019s own momentum against it; essentially I would make the Utek impale itself. It wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but I knew that it was my only chance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlacing my hand just over the spear, I looked back up and faced the Utek. I guess my expression gave away the fact that I had a plan, because it was then that the Utek decided to show herself. It wasn\u2019t her full height mind you, but the grass she stood in, the grass that could conceal my stomach, barely brushed her elbows. Disregarding this I grasped the spear in my hand and got to my feet. I turned backwards for all of a full second before I found a suitable notch in the tree in which I could use as leverage for the spear. As I turned to face forward again, a short, heavy, warm gust hit my face. A dark fuzzy wall eclipsed my view as the air around me suddenly reeked of fresh animal carcasses. And when I looked up, all I could see was that giant maw surrounded by teeth.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Although I was close.\u201d The two shared a brief laugh together before Joseph resumed his tale. \u201cMy eyes slowly fell from that great maw. The beast\u2019s body covered in that dark violet, almost black fur. Finally I saw my spear. The tip was barely an inch away from her fur, and I\u2019d guess two inches from her skin. It must have been about here,\u201d Joseph said while pressing against the soft gap at the front of his collar bone, \u201cjust below the voice box, where the neck meets the torso. In theory, it should count as a weak spot on most creatures. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI knew I had her,\u201d Joseph said, recalling his racing heartbeat and tensed muscles. \u201cI knew we were at a stale mate. If she made the slightest move then I\u2019d un-lodge the spear\u2019s base and pierce her windpipe. She\u2019d probably have strength enough to give me a good swipe and take my head off before she died, but there was no way she\u2019d be able to survive a wound like that. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when I looked back up, past the teeth, into the beast\u2019s eyes. I looked for any sign of fear or hesitation; anything that might indicate that we could both walk away from this. I might as well have been trying to spot birds under the dirt. I don\u2019t want to say they were empty, but they were deep; as deep as the deepest sea and just as full.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s a sea?\u201d Felecia interrupted. \u201cYou were on a roll there and I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I\u2019ve never heard that term before.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naturally, Joseph was upset that his chain of thought had been broken, but that didn\u2019t make her question any less valid. Once he began thinking deeper into what he said and how he had said it, he gave silent gratitude to the gods that the light was dim enough to hide his blushing cheeks. After pondering for a few seconds, finding the best combination of words, Joseph was satisfied that he could give an adequate answer.</span></div></div>",

Joseph knew it was a dangerous gamble to pressure her, but he was confident that Felecia would blink before him. He gained a further confidence boost<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cit would be nice to know the context of what you said. I mean, is a sea really that deep and full? And besides\u201d she whimpered, pushing her bottom lip out, \u201cI wanted to know.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph cursed Felecia.

How\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid reclined in her chair, feet on the counter, staring at her phone, and said, \u201cEh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO frowned. \u201cYou okay? That sounded more like a frustrated \u2018eh\u2019 than an I-don\u2019t-care \u2018eh\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid rolled her eyes. \u201cJust a dry spell that\u2019s gone on <i>way</i> too long. It\u2019s getting on my nerves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO tilted his head in confusion. \u201cBut it rained just last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven knowing that line was coming, Enid had to hold back her snicker. \u201cNot that kind of dry, brush head. I mean I haven\u2019t had any dates in, like, forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s weird. You\u2019re smart, pretty, and you\u2019re great at bossing people around. Who wouldn\u2019t want to date you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid looked up from her phone as the corners of her mouth threatened to curl up into a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet, KO. A shame you aren\u2019t older. I wouldn\u2019t mind having a fling with you,\u201d she said without thinking, making the boy\u2019s eyes sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO jumped on the counter and got frighteningly close to the girl. \u201cYou\u2019d want to date me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPursing her lips, Enid knew that she had to quickly back-peddle on this potential disaster. \u201cUh, sure, but as I said, you\u2019re too young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn this boy and his adorable naivet\u00e9.</i> \u201cBecause, uh, there are things that you\u2019re only supposed to do with two grownups. It wouldn\u2019t be right to rope a kid into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not just a kid anymore. I\u2019ve been fighting just as many bad guys as you and Rad. I can handle grownup stuff just fine. Besides, you look like you need help, and a true hero never leaves until the day is saved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Enid swore at KO\u2019s adorability. If only KO were older, she\u2019d at least be willing to give them a try. She needed to kill this conversation before it got any weirder. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not even really looking for a date right now. It\u2019d be nice, but I think I\u2019d settle for a, uh\u2026 meal!\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid laughed nervously. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m a pred and I like eating people. It\u2019s just, ya know, been a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO looked her up and down. \u201cBut you look pretty healthy,\u201d he observed casually. \u201cMy mom\u2019s a pred and she gets volunteers a few times a week. And like I said, you\u2019re really pretty. I have a hard time believing you can\u2019t find people who\u2019d want you to eat them.\u201d He knew from his mom what predators were meant to look like. They tended to be larger and more muscled than regular people due to their unique diet. His mom took in plenty of volunteers, only about half of whom he never saw again. Predators could choose whether or not to digest living prey. Everyone always looked so very happy going inside his mommy that KO couldn\u2019t help but view the whole process as beautiful. His mommy helped people fulfill their deepest wishes, just like he aspired to do every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO\u2019s sincerity was starting to get Enid all hot and bothered. She cursed herself for forgetting about Carol and how this had given the brush head an avenue to keep trying to help. Since she couldn\u2019t think of a way to dissuade him, she opted for an honest approach. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. See, most meals are what you might call one night stands. They happen, but then they don\u2019t happen again. Even if they\u2019re not digested, they get what they wanted and don\u2019t come back.\u201d Enid paused to check their surroundings to make sure that no one, especially not Rad, was eavesdropping. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve just been craving someone who\u2019d want to be eaten more than once, by me, and would keep coming back, ya know.\u201d She didn\u2019t know, nor was she sure if her words had even made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like being eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of shattering glass wasn\u2019t a spill in an aisle, but Enid\u2019s brain. \u201cSay what\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Mommy likes eating me all the time. I like being eaten, too,\u201d KO said like he was describing a trip to the amusement park. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big old hug wrapped all around me. Mommy\u2019s super soft and warm, and sometimes she sings me to sleep while I\u2019m in her belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid\u2019s brain hadn\u2019t quite caught up with KO\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just her belly. Mommy\u2019s butt is even softer. It might stink a little, but I can tell it makes her really happy to put me in there, which makes me happy, too!\u201d KO said with the biggest grin on his face. \u201cBut if someone\u2019s already in her belly, mommy also likes putting me in her vajayjay.\u201dHe ignored Enid\u2019s stifled laugh. \u201cI can tell she <i>really</i> likes when I go up in there. She makes all these really happy sounds that make my weewee feel all tingly, though,\u201d he finished a bit less enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid followed the boy\u2019s line of sight to find that he was pitching a tent, but no ordinary tent. She\u2019d seen her fair share of naked guys of all ages, so she knows that a kid like KO had no business sporting a log like <i>that</i>! Yet there it was. KO was sporting a third leg that made her mouth water just thinking about. The genitals of boys and girls were often the tastiest parts and Enid found herself craving that length of sausage like nothing before. She wanted to eat KO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid swallowed. \u201cHold on. Back up a sec. Just to make sure I got this right, you like being eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh. It\u2019s fun when mommy does it, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll like it with you, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid tensed. It was like KO\u2019s every line was one of Cupid\u2019s arrows. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re volunteering to let me eat you?\u201d Technically she didn\u2019t need his permission. Predators were immune from most laws that governed prey. And even though she was well within her rights to snatch the boy up and scarf him down right now, she liked KO too much to be so needlessly cruel. Besides, his pred mom was no slouch, and any harm done to her son would surely be repaid tenfold. Courtesy was just all around the safest course to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO nodded so hard it looked like his head might pop off. \u201cUh-huh. You said you wanted to eat someone who\u2019d come back. Even if we didn\u2019t work together, you\u2019re my friend, so I\u2019d always come back to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn your cuteness!\u201d Enid hissed under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. Say, just to be safe, how about I call your mom to make sure she\u2019s okay with this.\u201d After putting up her \u2018on break\u2019 sign, Enid zipped off into the bathroom and pulled out her phone. \u201cHey, uh, Carol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello Enid. How are things?\u201d asked the milf casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuper awkward, actually, which is why I\u2019m calling,\u201d Enid explained apprehensively. \u201cSee, KO and I were talking about\u2026 stuff, when the subject of vore came up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol laughed. \u201cLet me guess. He told you how much he loves it when I eat him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with that? He\u2019s my son and vore is one of the ways I show my love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no. I get that part, but that\u2019s not the issue. See, KO kinda, sorta, maybe\u2026 volunteered to let me eat him.\u201d A pregnant pause followed as Enid wondered if she had enough time to start running. She hadn\u2019t expected Carol to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, my peanut is such a sweetheart,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he saw you were having a bad day and wanted to cheer you up. Is that about right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, but not quite. Thing is\u2026 he wants me to eat him\u2026 regularly,\u201d Enid squeaked the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Carol replied, understanding the severity of the issue. Her thinking was almost audible over the phone as she considered things. Enid was basically asking to be friends-with-benefits with her underage son. As a fellow pred, there wasn\u2019t anything inherently objectionable about Enid doing such things with anyone, but this was still <i>her</i> son. \u201cWell, I can certainly appreciate you bringing this to me instead of gobbling him up on the spot. You haven\u2019t, have you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No, absolutely not! KO\u2019s my friend and I\u2019d never disrespect you or him like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell.\u201d Carol\u2019s smile was evident in her words. \u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\nCarol approves of Enid and KO being friends with vore benefits.<br>\r\nCarol needs to talk to Enid in person to be sure.<br>\r\nCarol refuses outright.<br>\r\nSomeone interrupts.</span></div></div>",

I expect him to come home with me every day at the usual time, and that you\u2019ll inform me if anything goes awry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d Enid avowed, suddenly empathizing with guys who dated girls whose fathers liked to show off their shotguns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny other kind of fun is fine. My peanut is used to it. Just stick to the curfew and digestion rules and we\u2019re golden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Carol. I promise to take good care of him.\u201d Enid beamed and hung up. She\u2019d just been given blanket permission to do <i>anything</i> with KO, even grownup stuff. She wasn\u2019t bothered by the implication that he\u2019d had experience with such things with his mom. Carol was a pred, which made things like that okay. And now they\u2019d be okay with her and KO as well. Speaking of which\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid hurried out of the bathroom and grabbed KO\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re mom said it\u2019s okay.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for him to reply before running to the break room, the boy flying behind her as she went. Enid closed and locked the door before setting the boy down in a chair. He looked confused, a little dizzy, cute, and oh so yummy. She licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO looked around after his head stopped spinning. \u201cYou want to eat me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid nodded, afraid that opening her mouth would unleash a waterfall of drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll help.\u201d Chipper as ever, KO stood in the chair and began to undress. He removed his vest and shirt before folding them neatly and setting them on the nearby table. Clearly he\u2019d had practice with this. His pants dropped next, revealing undies that appeared strained to their limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on!\u201d Enid blurted as she grabbed his hands. \u201cLet me.\u201d She pulled on the hem of his underwear, slowly to draw out the tension, as more of his impressive length became visible. Finally, she\u2019d gone too low and his member flicked her right in the nose, sending his musk straight up her nostrils. The little boy was even bigger than Rad, and she wanted to eat him in every sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid lunged and pulled the boy\u2019s meat into her mouth. It was like an explosion of flavor across her taste buds as she hungrily slurped. KO squirmed and moaned in approval. He even set his hands on her head to try to force her down. It was cute that he thought he had any control other than what she allowed him. Enid went down at her own pace, loving how the thick meat pushed into her throat and began to stretch it out. She couldn\u2019t even remember the last time a dick made her feel like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Enid,\u201d KO whimpered helplessly. He\u2019d thrown herself onto her head to support himself as her hot mouth filled him with amazing feelings. \u201cI l-love th-that,\u201d he gasped. He tried to hump into her face, but she held him by the hips. His mommy did that to let him know that this was about <i>her</i> pleasure. She needed her fill to satisfy her body\u2019s great cravings. Being considerate, KO allowed this by saying, \u201cH-have a-all you w-want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid smiled around her mouthful after kissing the base of his cock. His masculine musk was fantastic and it made her head all swimmy. Her hands migrated so that one cupped under his big, full balls while the other grabbed a handful of his boyish yet plump rump. She even teased a finger against his anus to really get him wiggling and making the cutest whines. Enid felt KO\u2019s length swell as his back arched. She pulled off of him just enough so that only his head was left inside. His delicious seed erupted all over her tongue and she moaned while eagerly gobbling it all up. She slammed her lips back down onto the base, swallowing around the head as the rest of his cum poured directly down her throat. When the boy\u2019s orgasm finally ended, she sucked off the last of his salty-sweet treat before opening her mouth with a wet pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, brush head. You\u2019ve got one of the tastiest dicks I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting limply in the chair, KO just laughed weakly at her praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. You look like you could use a rest,\u201d Enid cooed. \u201cI\u2019ve got just the place for you.\u201d She grabbed under KO\u2019s pits and lifted him high overhead before opening her mouth wide. His dangling toes were the first to slip between her lips. When he started laughing, her tongue assaulted his ticklish tootsies without mercy. Enid slurped in his feet and lowered him down to his knees. Each swallow brought more of his body into her as he began stretching her throat out. He wasn\u2019t the biggest person she\u2019d ever eaten, but the way her throat pulled tight around his form felt exquisite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid pulled in KO\u2019s waist and resumed her oral assault on his groin, but also his little bottom. Every part of the boy tasted amazing. It was like his innocence made him extra sweet. His cock was twitching back to life, but she lacked the patience to get another orgasm out of him just now. So she weaved her tongue across and between his butt cheeks before swallowing again. KO was pretty well built for his age and Enid had fun exploring his young body with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO could only moan his contentment as his naked body was pelted by the exploratory appendage. Enid tasting his butt and peepee was different than how mommy did it, but it still felt great. He loved seeing the look of bliss on his friend\u2019s face. She loved eating him almost as much as he loved being eaten. When her lips reached his chest, he decided to make things easier by slipping his arms into the constrictive embrace, only to laugh when his consideration was rewarded with another tickle attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, Enid\u2019s fingers had found their way into her pants. As if giving this little kid a blowjob wasn\u2019t hot enough, now he was actively feeding himself to her. Willing meals were a dime a dozen, but it was rare that Enid got to enjoy someone considerate enough to help out their predator instead of just sitting back and letting them do all the work. KO really was a special kind of guy; the sort she\u2019d be thinking about the next time she masturbated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with Carol\u2019s permission, she had the liberty to get up to all sorts of fun with the little tyke at her leisure. Gar probably wouldn\u2019t say anything. She was just a pred doing pred things with a volunteer. That sort of thing might even be good at attracting business to the bodega. Whatever people might say, Enid knew that they were all secret vorephiles. They\u2019d love to see her scarfing down this little boy, or just dominating him however she liked. If she played her cards right, she might even be able to justify hiking up the prices for those who watched her little show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid was broken from her reverie when her lips closed around KO\u2019s chin. His pelvis was down her throat and all she had access to were his upper back and above. She locked eyes with the boy about to go into her belly. He smiled a mix of acceptance at his fate, but also a little anticipation urging her to hurry it up. He wanted to be inside her so badly. How could she say no to <i>that</i> face? She couldn\u2019t. With a few more mighty swallows, Enid pulled KO the rest of the way inside and finally closed her lips over his brush head. One last gulp and he began his final descent. Gasping for breath, Enid fell back onto her butt as she felt gravity and her muscles work to pull the boy down. He left a noticeable bulge down her gullet and all the way into her gut. She felt the way he settled into her belly and began tenderly stroking the bulge he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, brush head. I\u2019ve had plenty of meals that were bigger, maybe even better tasting, but you\u2019re easily the most satisfying meal I\u2019ve had in ages,\u201d she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Thanks, Enid. Your mouth was a lot of fun and your tummy\u2019s super cozy.\u201d KO wiggled to get comfy. \u201cI hope we get to have a lot more fun in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid chuckled and let out a thunderous belch. \u201cMe too, KO. Me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do things go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow Enid\u2019s day as she carries KO.<br>\r\nEnid spits KO out for more fun.<br>\r\nCarol pays a visit to check on things.<br>\r\nBox attack!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Returning to the main floor of the bodega, Enid\u2019s mood had picked up at least three levels. KO\u2019s stuff had been stored in her locker while her hand refused to stop stroking her pregnant-looking belly. The boy inside wasn\u2019t too heavy, but his weight was pleasantly noticeable as he stretched her insides and hung over her shorts. His slightest movements sent spikes of pleasure through her system and just the act of walking was getting her wet. \u201cYa know, I said you were my most satisfying meal in a while,\u201d she said to her stomach, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this\u2026\u201d Mindful of heads turning in her direction, Enid lowered her voice. \u201cAroused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. I\u2019m not sure what that is, but mommy sometimes says it when I make her feel good. Is that what\u2019s happening right now? Am I making you feel good, Enid?\u201d KO asked sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid laughed and gave her stomach\u2019s side a playful shove. \u201cYeah, brush head. It is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. Sup, Enid,\u201d greeted one of the store\u2019s regulars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid froze briefly, but quickly righted herself to act cool. \u201cHey, Red. Eh. Not much,\u201d she nonchalantly said while still rubbing her stomach. \u201cThough I\u2019m kinda on babysitting duty for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Action snickered. \u201cNot really sitting if he\u2019s not under you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Ha. Ha. Ha,\u201d Enid laughed awkwardly, trying to show that she was as cool as the hero from the future. \u201cSo what about you? Anything new goin\u2019 on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. I just got back from the Danger Zone. Fought off an armored dinosaur wielding a machine gun that also breathed fire. No big,\u201d Red finished dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Enid awed. \u201cWait, was it the dinosaur or the machine gun that breathed fire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling confidently, Red took a second before answering. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid bit her lower lip, barely able to stand even hearing about the cool girl\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about,\u201d Red said, closing the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, s-sure. Whatever it is, I-I\u2019ll help,\u201d Enid agreed with a squeak at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about this.\u201d Red pointed at Enid\u2019s stomach. \u201cWe don\u2019t have too many preds in my time. Can you really eat whoever you want, whenever you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, well\u2026 Technically. I mean, I\u2019ve got limits. Mr. Gar is probably out of my league.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so what about me? Could you eat me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid licked her lips as her eyes crawled up and down the future hero, admiring her body through her\u2026 suit. \u201cSure, but I\u2019m not really a fan of the armor. It\u2019s too pointy. Plus artificial stuff is just plain nasty. Bleh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. So, you\u2019d need me to strip down first. I-I mean hypothetically,\u201d Red hurriedly amended. \u201cThis is purely a hypothetical discussion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right. Of c-course it is,\u201d Enid laughed nervously. \u201cBut yeah. It\u2019s common courtesy for volunteer meals to strip naked before being eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. That\u2019s so retro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure that word applies here, but sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd is it just like in the videos? Do you\u2026 lick people all over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid rubbed the back of her head, wondering why she was feeling so self-conscious about something so normal. \u201cNot <i>all</i> over. Some parts of the body taste better than others. Hands are better than arms. The back isn\u2019t as good as the ch-chest,\u201d she wheezed. \u201cThings like that. Not to mention it\u2019s fun to make my meals squirm. Heh-heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClean up in aisle 12!\u201d Gar\u2019s voice blared over the speakers with such force that both women were sent flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid got up in a slight daze, wondering what she was sitting on that felt so good. A second later, she recognized the outline of a face and quickly got off of Red. \u201cOh my gosh! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d She leaned down to help the hero up. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed\u2019s blush leaked through her mask of unflappable cool. \u201cHey, no sweat. It wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Enid\u2019s earlier anxiety was slowly being replaced with something else. Red\u2019s body language was showing signs that the pred had come to associate with willing meals. Instincts kicking in, she adopted a more confident grin and swaggered up to the other girl. \u201cNot so bad, huh? Well, maybe-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said cleanup on aisle 12!\u201d Gar shouted again, but more irately this time. \u201cSomeone had better clean it up before I have to start breaking bones!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood running cold, Enid hurriedly looked around. Normally, KO handled this stuff. However, since he was indisposed, either she or Rad needed to deal with it. Enid smiled flatly when she looked at the sign directly overhead. 12. Then she looked forward where she and Red had been talking. There was a sizable puddle of what she deduced to be drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, boss man. I got this!\u201d Enid declared as she pulled out one of the emergency cleaning kits hidden in a trapdoor on the floor for just such occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Enid,\u201d KO called from his fleshy apartment. \u201cI know I said you could eat me, but let me handle this. It sounded like you were having fun talking with Red Action, so just-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHACK!* Enid slapped her hand over where she thought KO\u2019s mouth was. \u201cShut it, you goob!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw. That was my butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed started snickering. The sound was as endearing as it was mortifying to the ninja. \u201cYa know what, I think I\u2019ll take a rain check on the whole\u2026 eating thing. I\u2019ll catch ya around sometime.\u201d Red waved as she turned to leave. \u201cLater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid\u2019s slump of disappointment was short lived. She\u2019d lost the moment with Red, but she could still avoid provoking her boss\u2019 wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Enid,\u201d begged KO. \u201cThere\u2019s still time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you to offer, kiddo, but I\u2019m afraid not. Besides, this mess is mine to clean up. It\u2019s my duty as a hero. Besides, Rad would never let me hear the end of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d KO agreed solemnly. His world was dark, but he could still hear and feel pretty well. Even if Enid was doing the responsibly heroic thing by cleaning up her own mess, it still didn\u2019t sit right with KO that he couldn\u2019t help. \u201cHey, is there something I can do from in here? I don\u2019t like just sitting around while other people do all the work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid snorted a laugh at the almost alien concept. \u201cYeah, sure thing.\u201d Heaving a sigh, she thought about his words. \u201cWell, so long as you\u2019re offering, you could always wiggle some more. Jump around, try to stretch out, and just get mah belly shakin\u2019.\u201d She deepened her voice in imitation of a hillbilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan do.\u201d KO gave a salute before he started wiggling. Like with everything else he did, KO\u2019s terrific work ethic shined through as Enid\u2019s belly started to really bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Enid, she was tough enough to not be thrown off by such small prey. However, with how good it felt to have him move around like that, the only problem now was the risk of her arousal adding to the mess on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid tries to continue here day as normal.<br>\r\nThe Box bots attack.<br>\r\nHow\u2019s Rad doing?<br>\r\nCarol turns up.</span></div></div>",

Enid and Rad rushed out the front doors and took up their positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where\u2019s KO? He never misses a Box,\u201d wondered the blue alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s, uh, preoccupied,\u201d Enid admitted hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Rad turned to face the ninja and ask what she meant, only for his eyes to bulge as big as Enid\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 I did.\u201d Enid couldn\u2019t stand Rad staring at her like that. \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry. I was in a bad mood and KO volunteered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that much I figured. KO\u2019s a cool guy like that. But you ate him <i>before</i> the daily Box attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds parted and the Boxman brand Box fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I was sorry. How was I supposed to know Boxman would attack today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Box opened with a blast to reveal its delivery. \u201cBehold, Lakewood losers. \u2018Tis I, Shannon, here to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRad suffered a momentary mental bluescreen. \u201cUh, because it\u2019s his <i>daily</i> attack! He attacks once a day, every day, at least.\u201d Rad rolled his eyes. \u201cTypical. Now we\u2019re a man down because you couldn\u2019t keep your stupid mouth shut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon blinked. \u201cL-like I was saying. I\u2019m here to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>my</i> stupid mouth? That\u2019s real rich coming from you, especially after last week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d bring that up, especially when it was your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, guys,\u201d KO spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon could hardly believe what was happening right now. \u201cAm\u2026 am I being ignored?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just typical,\u201d groaned Enid. \u201cI try to do you a favor, then you get all crazy with your dumb finger rays, and then you won\u2019t even take responsibility for it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to talk about responsibility? None of that would have happened if you hadn\u2019t used teeth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious to see what might happen, Shannon extended a laser gun from her head and fired in a random direction, blowing up someone\u2019s vehicle, and getting no reaction from the bodega\u2019s defenders. \u201cYa know, they say that irresponsible heroes do worse damage than us villains. I\u2019ve always hated that saying cuz it diminishes the hard work people like me put in to ruin everyone else\u2019s day, which is why I\u2019m getting pissed off at you for proving it right. Now fight me!\u201d Shannon extended two more lasers and continued firing in random directions. She\u2019d actually intended to attack the heroes, but her burning anger had fried her targeting chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys!\u201d KO shouted, finally breaking through the bickering. \u201cIt sounds like Shannon is attacking the Plaza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 whoops,\u201d the pair said as one after finally noticing the carnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s say we put this discussion on hold,\u201d suggested Rad as he retook his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me. Now let\u2019s spank this bot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair charged into the fray. Rad used his telekinetic beams to hurl debris at Shannon, but she just used her buzz saw hands to slice it into harmless chunks. Enid took advantage of the distraction, sneaking up within the bot\u2019s shadow, and threw knives into the backs of Shannon\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! Hey, who did that?\u201d Shannon spun around on her waist to behold her attacker with confusion. \u201cUh, did you get knocked up since the last time we fought, or are you just fat? It\u2019s so hard to tell with you flesh creatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid looked like she was trying very hard to develop heat vision to burn the robot with her hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can\u2019t say that about Enid!\u201d asserted KO\u2019s muffled voice. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the prettiest girls at the bodega. Plus she makes these really cute sounds when she wraps her mouth around my-\u201d WHACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid had slapped her hand to her stomach again. \u201cStop saying these embarrassing things to people, you goofus,\u201d she said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwey! That was my butt again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon restrained herself only a second before she threw her head back in uproarious laughter. Rad joined her soon after as both started rolling on the ground. Enid was mortified beyond words and quietly prayed to Cob above to end her miserable existence. Cob didn\u2019t, because he\u2019s a dick who gets off on the suffering of mortals. Case in point, Shannon switched off her humor circuits and delivered a rocket kick straight into Enid\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a drawn-out slow-motion sequence of Enid\u2019s belly rippling from the impact while also being compressed. KO was squished between a robot\u2019s foot and a hard place, and with only two possible avenues for escape. Like any zit, enough pressure was going to cause something to pop. With all his might, KO tried to wiggle himself upward. KO imagined that if he could leave through Enid\u2019s mouth, he\u2019d be in a prime position to deliver a surprise attack on Shannon. He could fly out like a mouth missile and punch Shannon right in the face. However, because Cob almighty was feeling especially dickish today, a slight twitch in Shannon\u2019s foot sent KO downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slow-motion ended as KO rocketed through Enid\u2019s intestines at break-neck speeds. His bouncing through her body could be seen from the outside as Enid was subjected to the aggressively alien sensations. This part of eating people had always been slow and gentle, so she had no way to know how to feel about a kid bouncing through her intestines like a Ping-Pong ball. The whole thing lasted only a couple of seconds before Enid lurched forward and braced her hands on her knees in preparation for the worst-case scenario. It wasn\u2019t a pop, so much as the bone-shaking thunder of tank fire. Regardless of the sound, KO shot right out of Enid\u2019s ass, tearing a hole in her shorts, and kept going like a bullet for a short distance until his face made friends with a light pole, denting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether from embarrassment or pain, Enid couldn\u2019t move. Rad was laughing so hard that he feared he might suffocate. Shannon, feeling cruel, reactivated her humor circuits to mock her hated foe. KO groaned in pain, but not as much as the light pole did. The metal whined as it bent. The strain built until someone ought to have called \u2018timber\u2019. The pole fell, cracking Enid on the head, and dropping the broken light fixture onto Shannon. The robot\u2019s remaining circuits were fried and the day was saved. But at what cost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDignity. Everyone\u2019s dignity was the price of the day\u2019s victory. Gar and Boxman quickly got onto the scene and agreed to a truce, on the condition that all video evidence of the incident be erased. If word got out to the greater hero or villain communities, they\u2019d both be laughing stocks. So the other Box bots helped to clean up. Gar found KO naked, gooey, and with his ass in the air. Rad had passed out from laughing too much, and also had peed his pants. Enid, despite also being unconscious from her explosive yet solid diarrhea, was clenching her ass tight enough to crush coal into diamond. The bodega men were discretely taken back to the employee lounge\u2026 which is what Gar told Carol instead of him hurling the three like javelins into the air, only to have them fly through the skylight he\u2019d installed for just such occasions and land on a pile of pillows\u2026 that Rad had forgotten to change out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOops. Also, ouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio were granted time to recover, though the blows to their respective egos would take a lot longer to heal. Everyone got a change of clothes, but still had to be picked up by their parents. None were ready to face the world just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Mondays went, this one was slightly above average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we go after that kind of madness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe could follow Carol giving KO some TLC.<br>\r\nEnid\u2019s parents could try to cheer her up.<br>\r\nRad\u2019s parents could do\u2026 whatever it is they do.<br>\r\nMaybe we should put this all behind us and just skip to the next day?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carol drove home with KO curled up in her lap as she rubbed his head. Since he\u2019d started working for Gar, she\u2019d gotten used to him coming home with scrapes and bruises. It was hard to deal with at first, but as a former hero, she knew that such things were just a work hazard and would be necessary for KO to fulfill his dream. Even so, he was her special little man, making it her proud duty to care for him whenever he felt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how was your day, peanut? Did ya have fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO laughed weakly. \u201cGetting eaten by Enid was nice. She was real soft and warm. She also sucked on my pee-pee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Well wasn\u2019t that nice of her,\u201d Carol cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh. She said I had one of the tastiest d-pee-pees she\u2019d ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she ain\u2019t wrong.\u201d The hand that had been stroking her son migrated down his body, over his change of clothes, and rubbed against his package. \u201cYou\u2019re a real yummy boy, KO, but your penis is especially delicious. Coffee is fine, but there\u2019s nothing that gives me a good pick-me-up in the morning like blowing my sweet little man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, mommy. Why is it called blowing? What you and Enid did felt more like sucking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Ya know, I never really thought about it,\u201d remarked Carol as she entered their neighborhood. \u201cI guess blowjob just sounds better than suck-job. Anyway, you should be proud of yourself, kiddo. I can\u2019t speak for Enid\u2019s experience, but that\u2019s quite the compliment from a pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mommy. I thought you said that it was polite for preds to complement their prey\u2019s taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Carol pulled into her driveway and stepped out of the car, KO cradled in one arm and a travel bag hanging from the other. \u201cBut being compared to other prey like that is something else. Most preds wouldn\u2019t needlessly flatter their meals like that unless they really meant it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO\u2019s eyes sparkled in awe. \u201cWhoa! Does having a better taste make me a better hero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol chuckled at her son\u2019s adorable innocence. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it makes you a level up in my book, my snuggle muffin.\u201d She leaned down and blew raspberries over KO\u2019s stomach. Entering their house, she set her son down on the couch, put her supplies away, and shimmied out of her pants. \u201cI know you\u2019ve had a rough day, sweetie, but hearing that your friend swallowed you got mommy all hot and bothered.\u201d Carol\u2019s purple pants dropped to her ankles, leaving only a pair of lacey white panties containing her impressive ass and soaking sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO smiled and found the energy to sit up. \u201cMy day wasn\u2019t all bad. It was nice that I got to help Enid. Just, maybe I shouldn\u2019t be inside her the next time Boxman attacks,\u201d he added apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Probably for the best.\u201d Carol plopped herself beside her son and pulled him onto her lap. She relieved him of his clothes, sparing no opportunity to tickle him. Once he\u2019d been stripped, Carol was pleased to see KO\u2019s rock hard erection ready for work. \u201cAww. Is that for me?\u201d She poked at the head and flicked it around. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I should. I love it when you play with my pee-pee, mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I do too, sweetie.\u201d Carol pulled the hem of her panties out, showing her son the familiar sight of her sex and trimmed pubic hair. She then inserted the boy into her panties, having his belly touch hers as his legs slipped through the holes. Given that her panties were able to contain her naturally bodacious booty, they were more than enough to handle the added weight of her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, mommy,\u201d KO said as he pressed himself against her stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm and soft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too soft, I hope. I wouldn\u2019t make a good gym instructor if I got all flabby,\u201d Carol joked. KO was secure, but his burning rod was only rubbing against her needy sex. She still had to push him back enough to get everything lined up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO smiled contentedly as he was manhandled. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, mommy. You\u2019d be super popular and pretty no matter what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. Careful, kiddo. You don\u2019t want me getting <i>too</i> turned on.\u201d The tip of KO\u2019s cock kissed her pussy lips, forcing Carol to suck in a breath through her teeth. Her groan was prolonged as she slowly inserted him inside her. \u201cMmm. Never gets old,\u201d she cooed. For a six to eleven-year-old, KO had one of the biggest cocks around, second only to his father. Mother and son groaned as his member spread her sex apart. \u201cMommy\u2019s pussy loves you, baby. Whether it\u2019s just your cock or all of you, I love taking you inside me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I love you, too,\u201d KO whimpered. He was experienced enough to control his breathing, but his mommy\u2019s sex was still a lot to handle. Her wet lips gripped him with a possessive need that compelled him to go deeper. The wet squelching sounds of his insertion was complemented by the woman\u2019s racing heart. KO tried to look up, but saw nothing over his mom\u2019s mountainous boobs. Still, he knew by her breathing that she loved this as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fuck yes!\u201d Carol cried out when she\u2019d finally taken her son to the base. It never felt any less lewd or exciting to do this with her son. \u201cKO, you\u2019ve always been my special little man, perfect for my needs as a mother, pred, and a woman.\u201d A hand grabbed his tiny boy butt and began rotating him around. The strokes of his cock through her pussy were shallow, but the friction was amazing. Although being a pred gave her the freedom to do almost anything, it still gave her a perverse thrill to think about using her son like this. He was so innocent, did whatever he thought would make her happy, and she loved him to bits for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO\u2019s pleasured moan turned into a giggle when his mommy started pinching his butt through her panties. Her middle finger slipped down into his ass crack and prodded teasingly at his little anus. \u201cTh-that tickles, mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Carol stood. Her hand continued groping her son as she walked them both into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m gonna make spaghetti tonight. Be a dear and help mommy cum a few times before it\u2019s ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye-aye!\u201d KO saluted as he started humping his mom\u2019s hot cunt. Adolescent grunts, slutty moans, and lewd squelches filled the air as KO pounded away. He couldn\u2019t get much leverage from his position, but it still felt amazing to slide in and out of her cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol\u2019s gentle humming was interrupted with bursts \u201cNnnf!\u201d and \u201cOh, fuck yeah!\u201d as she cooked. At some point, she\u2019d started prepping the kitchen with only one hand while the other to work her boy harder into her pussy. \u201cBaby, you feel so gooood! Mommy\u2019s so close. Cum. Cum for mommy!\u201d In answer, KO groaned as he erupted his seed into her love tunnel. Carol had to catch herself on the counter to keep from falling. Strength quickly returned to her legs even as her own orgasm gushed out over KO\u2019s groin. The smell of sex permeated the air as love juices dripped onto the floor. Carol\u2019s breaths were heavy, but she managed to resume her cooking. Her son softened inside her while his thick seed squelched around and made her feel so wonderfully warm. \u201cGood boy,\u201d she praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO tried to keep going, even despite his lack of energy. It felt good to make his mommy feel good, but his limbs were turning to jelly and it was getting harder to catch his breath. Even the juice box she gave him wasn\u2019t enough to replenish his batteries. He hated disappointing his loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was pretty good, peanut. You\u2019re getting a lot better at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure are,\u201d Carol cheered. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that you\u2019d be passed out from a day like this, but you\u2019re still up. That\u2019s some solid progress you\u2019ve made, sweetie.\u201d Feeling KO smile against her stomach made Carol feel a different kind of inner warmth as she cooked. She let her son rest until it was time to eat, which they both did buck naked. Then it was time for a shower and off to bed, where KO had a comfortable rest inside of his beloved mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good ending to a good day.</span></div></div>",

He was born a minizora, meaning that at four and a half inches tall, he was already pretty big for someone his age. It was a condition that affected just under 5% of the population, inhibiting people from ever growing taller than five inches. With him being so small, some might think that his dream of becoming a hero was unachievable, but KO begged to differ. He liked looking on the bright side of things. For instance, he was super durable. He could take hits that would knock most big heroes flat. Plus the training with his mommy had done wonders for his endurance and general strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s is a good mood this morning,\u201d observed his luscious mom as she drove. Carol wasn\u2019t one of those jerk faces who viewed minizora as lesser. She adored her son to bits, finding his small size to be part of his charm. It also came in handy when he offered to help with the daily chores. \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo occasion, mommy. I\u2019m just super exited for to be working at the Bodega.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol chuckled. \u201cWow. If only we could all be so happy with our work. By the way, how are your friends doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRad and Enid. They\u2019re great. Yesterday we had to fend off two Boxmore attacks. Two! It was great. I wonder if today he\u2019ll send three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol sighed lovingly. \u201cNever lose that positivity, KO. You make the world a brighter place just by living in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO beamed proudly as his mother patted his head with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair arrived and split up for their respective jobs. KO could run as quickly as most could casually walk, but it was still an impressive feat. Once inside, he hopped up to the counter where Enid was pretending not to play on her phone. \u201cHi, Enid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there you are, KO,\u201d she said, brightening up just a bit. \u201cYou\u2019re a couple minutes later than usual. I was getting a little worried there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPshh. There\u2019s no need to worry about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere actually is, brush head,\u201d she intoned seriously. \u201cMinizora who aren\u2019t careful tend to get kidnapped by creepoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What!? Why would anyone want to kidnap minizora? That\u2019s just bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid stared flatly down at the tiny boy. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re, what, six to eleven and you don\u2019t know what people do with minizora?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO shook his head. \u201cUh uh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. You\u2019re one sheltered kid. Though I guess that\u2019s to Carol\u2019s credit, but she really ought to teach you this stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d KO inquired, eager to learn. \u201cIs this some deep lesson about the world that\u2019ll make me a better hero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery possible,\u201d Enid admitted. \u201cWell, when some folks get their hands on a minizora, especially a cute one like you, they like to use them for, um\u2026 personal gratification.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWazzat mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid rubbed the back of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re too pure for this world, KO. I almost hate to ruin that.\u201d Looking down at him, with those big puppydog eyes and that sickeningly sweet smile, Enid caught herself rubbing her thighs together as her loins began to heat. It was all she could do not to snatch him up right there and give him a personal demonstration.</span></div></div>",

Like a tool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s like, uh, you know how you use a bar of soap to wash your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, some folks like to do stuff like that with minizora.\u201d Enid beamed, proud of herself for explaining things in a way that wouldn\u2019t compromise KO\u2019s innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean like mommy does with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a shattering of glass that was Enid\u2019s perception of the world. \u201cUh, say what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mommy. Sometimes she rubs me on her body like soap. She also does things I\u2019ve never seen her do with soap, though. Is that a bad example?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said a customer. \u201cI was wondering if you knew where the-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsle 12. Kay-thanks-bye!\u201d she shouted desperately, tossing the poor customer like a javelin. \u201cKO, you need to tell me EXACTLY what your mommy does with you. Uh, so that I can see how it compares to what the bad people might do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d KO cheered, ever the picture of enthusiasm. \u201cLet me see. Well, in the morning mommy and I get cleaned up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Enid replied, nodding along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s a shower, but mostly a bath. We get naked and she watches me swim around. Sometimes we play sea monster with me on a toy boat and her pretending to eat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll bet she does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we eat breakfast. Mommy\u2019s a great cook. When I still went with her to work, she\u2019d keep me in her clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnid cleared her throat. \u201cThat\u2019s, erhem. I mean, lots of folks like keeping minizora in their clothes. Keeps \u2018em from getting stepped on. Uh, which clothes does she keep you in, exactly?\u201d Enid asked, fearing that she already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes her panties, but mostly I sit in her boobies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I figured.\u201d In imagining KO being confined within Carol\u2019s underwear as she worked up a sweat from a hard day\u2019s workout, Enid couldn\u2019t help but feel a little jealous. \u201cWhat else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, after we get home, mommy usually strips naked again. She doesn\u2019t like to wear clothes at home. She\u2019ll usually wear panties, but only if I\u2019m in them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFront or b-back?\u201d stammered Enid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see how that\u2019s relevant, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty even where she puts me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d Enid felt disgusted with herself, but these were her honest feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we play games, watch movies, and eat dinner. Oh, and sometimes at night, she likes rubbing me against her no-no places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-no places?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what she calls her lady peepee and her bottom. She rubs me against her, and sometimes shoves me inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, okay. And, uh, how do you feel about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKO shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Mommy\u2019s really soft and warm. Plus she likes it a whole lot, and you know me. I\u2019m always ready to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you\u2026 you really are, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Enid marveled. In all honesty, she couldn\u2019t blame Carol for using her own son like that. Given some of the stories she\u2019d heard, it\u2019d be weirder if the mother didn\u2019t exploit her son for sexual gratification. That\u2019s just how it went for minizora. And for the most part, it was fine. Most people were cool and didn\u2019t abuse them, even if the word \u2018slave\u2019 was thrown around an awful lot. The little guys and gals certainly got a kick out of it. Now that she really thought about it, Enid started to wonder if there\u2019d be anything wrong with doing to KO what his mom did. He was so na\u00efve that it wouldn\u2019t be hard to convince him. And it wasn\u2019t like she wanted to hurt him. He was a minizora and they were friends. Really, this was just part of how these kinds of friendships worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Enid do?</span></div></div>",

They're durable enough to be stepped on and even survive stomach acid, but not invincible. Based on the story by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2198917-Minizora-Mayhem\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper had had an eventful last few hours to say the least. After being dropped off by their folks in this tourist trap town, he and his sister Mabel had a bit of an incident. And by incident, he\u2019s obviously referring to Mabel being kidnapped and almost forced into marriage with 1,000 gnomes, followed by an epic chase in a golf cart from a composite gnome monster, and ending with the defeat of said monster with a leaf blower. However, now that the adrenaline had fallen and they were up in the attic for the evening, Dipper took greater interest with his initial big discovery: a mysterious journal with a six fingered hand on the cover. Of particular interest to the three inch tall boy was that the book was sized to minizora like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ch\u2019ya readin\u2019 there, bro-bro?\u201d asked Mabel. The regular sized twelve year old was hanging upside down off the edge of her bed. She wore her usual purple sleeping sweater as her feet kicked idly in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe journal about the mysteries of Gravity Falls,\u201d Dipper explained. \u201cYou know, the one I showed you a few hours ago back when I thought the gnomes were actually a zombie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gave a snorting laugh. \u201cYeah. Great job being the smart twin. Can\u2019t even tell the difference between gnomes and zombies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper narrowed his eyes on his sister. \u201cOh yeah? Well you followed a strange guy you\u2019d only just met out into the woods where anything could have happened! Honestly, it turning out to be gnomes was pretty lucky on your end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault! I thought he was a vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that makes it better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel folded her arms and turned away in a huff, still upside-down. \u201cI won\u2019t even dignify that with a response.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been out in the sun all day wearing only a hoodie,\u201d reminded Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe could be using super vampire sunblock. You don\u2019t know,\u201d Mabel whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, that makes literally no sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it does. In fact, I know how to settle this. You\u2019ve got a journal full of weird stuff, right? Go ahead and check.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gave a soft chuckle as he flipped through the pages. \u201cYou know, that was a lot more mature than what I was expecting from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean? I\u2019m super mature! I\u2019m the most maturest mature person to ever\u2026 mature! Also I\u2019m a girl, and everyone knows girls mature faster than boys,\u201d she finished with a dignified huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cRiiight. Mabel is sooo mature. She shops for teddy bear undies in the big girl isle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheeks flushed, Mabel\u2019s hands shot down (relative to her perspective) to cover her sweater over her unmentionables. \u201cYou saw nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Dipper said with a dismissive wave. \u201cYou and your\u2026 wait a minute.\u201d He stopped flipping through pages and brought the book up to his face. \u201cI found it! The section on vampires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me!\u201d Mabel tried to stand, but only managed to flip onto her face with a thud. \u201cOw. Ugh. Just read it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Well I\u2019ll be. It says here that vampires do sometimes use a super sunblock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ha!\u201d Mabel shot a fist up in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuut,\u201d Dipper continued, \u201cit\u2019s made of ingredients considered repugnant by vampires. If a vampire were actually using the stuff, they\u2019d also have to wear nose plugs so they don\u2019t gag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s arm fell limp. \u201cAh poo.\u201d Once she grew bored of lying on the floor, Mabel sat up and walked across the room to the side of Dipper\u2019s regular sized bed and planted her chin on the sheets. She looked down at him with curious and thoughtful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel,\u201d Dipper said warily as the big face loomed over him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing. Just thinking how lucky I am to have a little,\u201d she snickered, \u201cbrother like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ha-ha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it. You\u2019re so tiny, but you still came after me even when you thought I was about to be eaten by a zombie. You also drove a golf cart like a total pro. How\u2019d you do that again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecially modified for minizora drivers,\u201d Dipper explained, trying to focus on his reading. Now that he\u2019d started, there were just so many interesting factoids about vampires he\u2019d never considered before. \u201cBesides, you\u2019d have done the same for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell duh! But that\u2019s different. You were in, like, way more danger than me back there. What if one of those creepy gnomes stepped on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been stepped on before. Not that big a deal,\u201d Dipper explained dismissively. \u201cAlso, I wasn\u2019t the target for what I assume to have been an attempted gang bang by said creepy gnomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel pouted cutely. \u201cYou\u2019re making it really hard to give a heartfelt thank you for saving my life, you know. You put your life on the line for me when you didn\u2019t have to, and that means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper finally closed the book. \u201cActually, I did have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when someone\u2019s driving and a rabbit runs out in the middle of the road. Technically they don\u2019t <i>have</i> to slow down and let the fluffy adorable critters live, but if they don\u2019t slow down, then they just end up feeling awful all day. I wasn\u2019t about to spend the rest of the summer feeling awful about myself, so there really wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes shimmering, Mabel shot out a giant hand and snatched up her diminutive brother and pressed him firmly against her cheek in her closest approximation of a hug. \u201cI love you Dipper. You\u2019re the best brother ever! I don\u2019t ever want to let you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a tapping from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, keep it down up there!\u201d groused the gruff voice of their Grunkle Stan. \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear what a couple of preteens are doing so late at night alone in their room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, gross!\u201d growled Mabel as she stomped the floor in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper began to laugh as Mabel continued to hold him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a half bad sister, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch it, bro-bro.\u201d Suddenly serious, Mabel pointed an accusing finger at Dipper. \u201cIf you make me mad, then I\u2019ll show you just how immature I can really be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Dipper asked in taunting. \u201cWell that would certainly be a change of pace.\u201d Even as Mabel fumed, Dipper couldn\u2019t help himself and laughed at her expense. As her brother, he had a moral imperative to tease her at every opportunity, regardless of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! If you like my teddy bear panties so much, then maybe you\u2019d like to get acquainted for the rest of the night,\u201d she warned, giving him a chance to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s eyebrow climbed up his forehead. \u201cYou realize that\u2019d just prove Grunkle Stan right, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIre gone, Mabel blinked like a deer caught in the headlights. \u201cShoot!\u201d She kicked impotently at the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s no fair. How can I be a good big sister and keep my little brother in line if I can\u2019t use my go-to for punishment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cAre you actually asking, or are you just thinking out loud? Because if the latter, can I get the journal back?\u201d He pointed back down at the bed. \u201cI dropped it when you grabbed me.\u201d When he caught a devious glint in his sister\u2019s eye, Dipper knew he had to act quickly. \u201cKeep in mind that this journal has all kinds of information regarding the dangerous secrets of this town. If it weren\u2019t for that thing, I might not have gone after you in the first place. If anything bad happens to that book, I might not be able to save you next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel deflated and blew a raspberry. \u201cDouble poo.\u201d She turned a longing eye on the mini boy in her hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything I can do to punish you?\u201d she pleaded pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re seriously asking <i>me</i> that?\u201d Were this anyone but Mabel, Dipper would be floored by the audacity of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019ve got some pretty good ideas sometimes. What\u2019s something I can do to assert myself as the dominant twin that doesn\u2019t cross the line into, you know, weirdness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s never bothered you before. I think I\u2019ve completed, like, half my homework while stuffed in your clothes somewhere.\u201d He gestured up and down her body. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s not even really a punishment. More like my second room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleaaase!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine. Let me think.\u201d Dipper tapped his chin in thought, silently cursing himself for being unable to resist his sister\u2019s cute antics. \u201cHmm. I guess we could\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After settling into this den of weirdness, Dipper and Mabel were in the Mystery Shack\u2019s dining room having just completed an epic syrup race. Mabel had won, much to her regret, and Dipper was reading the towns\u2019 newspaper; scaled down for minizora of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mabel. Look at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger \u2013 but not older \u2013 sibling peered down at the tiny article. \u201cHuman sized hamster ball. Wait a minute\u2026 I\u2019m human sized!\u201d She sucked in a shocked breath. \u201cAnd so are you! But with a regular hamster ball. We can be hamster ball twins!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes and pointed to what he actually wanted to show her. It was a contest for photos of monsters. The winner got $1000. \u201cWe see weirder stuff than that every day. Did we get any photos of those gnomes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Just memories.\u201d Mabel waited a second before holding up a tuft of white hair. \u201cAnd this beard hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you save that?\u201d asked Dipper, backing away in revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of revulsion, that was when Grunkle Stan came in dressed in a pair of boxers and a night shirt with stains that were better left not thought about. The old man wanted to close the shop early and have a bonding day with the family. He promised that this would be nothing like the last time in which they made counterfeit money, which was followed up by a trip to the freezing county jail. With assurances like that, how could they refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a harrowing blindfolded drive across town, the twins were finally allowed to uncover their eyes and behold the lake, where apparently fishing season had opened. Said lake was positively lousy with the town\u2019s colorful denizens doing all sorts of wacky antics. Watching some of the rougher antics led to Mabel grabbing Dipper and setting him on her shoulder for safe keeping. But just as Grunkle Stan was finishing his less than stellar sales pitch for fishing for the next ten hours, that\u2019s when another old man started going off about some monster called the Gobblewonker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Mabel cooed. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a happy jig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when old man McGucket grabbed her shoulders and started screaming. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a jig of grave danger!\u201d warned the guy who had earned the title of town kook. He gave a far more convincing pitch for why the gobblewonker was real, pointing a boat that looked to have been bitten in half and offering a pretty detailed description of the creature. Alas, everyone else was entirely dismissive of his claims and soon the crowd dispersed, including his own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, did you hear what he said?\u201d Dipper asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, donkey spittle,\u201d she said in approximation of the old man\u2019s funny way of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the other thing. The monster. If we can snag a photo, we can split the prize fifty-fifty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s two fifties!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine what you could do with $500,\u201d Dipper encouraged, not bothering to correct her math. He then sat back as his sister\u2019s pupils went wide. Clearly she\u2019d been kidnapped by her own imagination again and it was just a matter of waiting for her to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper. I am one million percent on board with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Grunkle Stan delivered an inferior sales pitch for fishing, although this time he lost to Soos who\u2019d just driven up in a far superior boat. It wasn\u2019t a hard choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna find that gobblewonker!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna win that prize!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the excitement tempered a bit, the team of a pair of twins and the pair shaped chipmunk faced guy set about their plan. They\u2019d gone and bought an excessive amount of disposable cameras, which made a lot of sense given that none of them wanted to risk their expensive phones. As the boat neared Scuttlebutt Island, an ominous fog descended upon them. The island itself was just as creepy, but spirits were still high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you carry him around with you everywhere?\u201d Soos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel shrugged. \u201cNot everywhere. Just most wheres. Hehe. Saves him the trouble of getting lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, lost? You once got lost on the way to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is that it\u2019s just easier this way,\u201d Mabel insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s like a knight riding atop his elegant and beautiful steed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d agreed Dipper. \u201cThe real steed\u2019s at the shop for repairs, so they gave me this,\u201d he gestured with his thumb, \u201ccheap rental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. Good one, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheap? I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m about to be a five hundred-naire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well so am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy to tag along,\u201d Soos offered. \u201cSpeaking of tagging, I\u2019ve never really known a minizora before. What\u2019s it like being so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible. No matter what I do, I can always look up people\u2019s noses and see the horrors that lie within.\u201d That got everyone chuckling. \u201cBut seriously, it\u2019s not too bad. It doesn\u2019t hurt that I\u2019ve got a nice steed to take me places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee. He admits I\u2019m a steed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just easier than saying rented mule-ow!\u201d Dipper groaned as his head was pinched. \u201cSomebody help! A pair of sausage fingers are crushing my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure that\u2019s safe, dude?\u201d Soos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he\u2019s fine,\u201d assured Mabel. \u201cFirst day here that lumberjack guy stepped on him and he just walked it off. This,\u201d she tightened her pinch, \u201cis nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper finally stopped yelling, showing that he was just putting on a show. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s right. There\u2019s a reason so many stunt men are minizora, you know. We can handle just about anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything,\u201d Dipper affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much can you bench-press?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI once saw him lift up a whole pizza crust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, dude. You\u2019re like a super hero. Got the proportionate strength of an ant, only you\u2019re already pretty small, so it\u2019s not that impressive, but it\u2019s still pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Thanks a lot, Soos,\u201d Dipper said, feeling genuinely moved. Part of why he was the bookish type was because most kids his own age just made fun of him for being small. It was a refreshing change of pace to actually hear praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel grinned from ear-to-ear. She\u2019d already liked Soos. They got each other\u2019s humor. But in seeing how nice he was to Dipper, Mabel knew she\u2019d made a new friend for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a roar echoed through the woods. Birds were sent cawing in terror as the team finally had a direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it. This is it!\u201d Dipper said in whispered excitement. Still sitting on his sister\u2019s shoulder, he kicked at her through her sweater and urged her onward. \u201cYa, mule! Ya-ya, mule!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude. That\u2019d be so offensive\u2026 if it weren\u2019t so hilariously accurate,\u201d commented Soos as he grabbed a long and sharp stick. Perfect for stabbing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, it all turned out to be a false alarm. What looked like the gobblewonker through the fog was really just a derelict rotted out boat covered in cute beavers. And what sounded like the gobblewonker was actually an old chainsaw engine being messed with by a beaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 I was so sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there, little bro,\u201d consoled Mabel, petting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. At least we got to see a beaver with a chainsaw. That\u2019s pretty sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that old guy was crazy after all.\u201d Dipper slumped on his slumping seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did use the word \u2018scrap-doodle\u2019,\u201d Mabel agreed, just as despondent. While Soos was preoccupied with the beaver, the preteen girl decided to make some distance to give her brother some \u2018alone\u2019 time; which of course meant that she stuck nearby at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sucks. We didn\u2019t find the gobblewonker, and what are we gonna say to Grunkle Stan? We ditched him over nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s pretty bad,\u201d agreed Mabel. \u201cHe seemed really excited just to hang out with us and we left him high and dry\u2026 in that dinky little boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel. Did you feel-whoa!\u201d Dipper slipped, but thankfully caught himself on Mabel\u2019s lifejacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Mabel screamed, pointing out into the water where something big was swimming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d cheered Dipper, pulling out one of their last few cameras. \u201cI just have to-agh. Mabel, hold still. I can\u2019t get a good shot with you moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, dude,\u201d intoned Soos worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the few seconds since Dipper had taken his eyes off the lake, the gobblewonker had come up to the shore, rose it\u2019s long neck out of the water, and loomed menacingly over the trio. And then, just as Dipper turned back around, it roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuuun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn complete disregard to logic, the aquatic gobblewonker flopped its mighty frame onto land and used its flippers to give chase after the trio. Dipper couldn\u2019t run on his own, but he could stare into the jaws of death and warn the others where and when trees were falling on them. And while Soos was able to get them to the boat, the gobblewonker just hopped back in the water, where it was significantly faster. What followed was an exciting chase across the lake, overturning many boats and causing general mayhem. Grunkle Stan would have found it hilarious, were he not on the business end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! Beavers!\u201d cried Mabel as beavers began raining down on the boat. With their home just destroyed, the little fuzz balls were understandably agitated and were biting at anything they could reach. \u201cAhh! My brother!\u201d Before one of the overgrown rats could chomp the little guy, Mabel beat him to it and stuffed Dipper in her mouth for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hardly a new experience for Dipper. He\u2019d been eaten by his sister more times than he could count, though usually it was under less life threatening circumstances. The air was humid, Mabel had apparently forgotten to brush this morning, and saliva was creeping into his clothes. Keeping her lips shut, Mabel was still screaming as Dipper bounced around on the soft tongue. In a brief respite, he caught himself thinking that this wouldn\u2019t be so bad if only he weren\u2019t wearing sticky clingy clothes, but that was neither here nor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a flashlight, Dipper opened the journal and quickly searched for anything related to the gobblewonker, but instead found a very interesting map of the lake. He tapped at Mabel\u2019s teeth and signaled her to open her mouth. She did, screaming as she\u2019d taken over the steering after Soos had been incapacitated by a beaver. \u201cHead for the waterfall!\u201d Dipper instructed as he clung to the tongue for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel did, and everyone braced themselves for the worst. Fortunately, the journal proved true. There was a cave on the other side. Even better, it was too small for the gobblewonker, rendering it stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s stuck!\u201d Dipper cheered, patting himself down within his sister\u2019s maw. \u201cWait, I don\u2019t have any more cameras!\u201d he exclaimed in a sudden panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah.\u201d Mabel extended her tongue with her brother upon it and removed his hat, where he still had one tiny camera left. How lucky were they to find a place that sold tiny cameras? \u201cZare,\u201d she said helpfully with her tongue still occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed with elation, Dipper danced around on the tongue as he ran through the entire roll of film. \u201cThis is it! We finally got the picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Mabel also cheered, ignoring the taste of fabric. It was more fun to play with a naked brother in her mouth than a clothed one. This would be important information to consider for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while everyone was cheering, the gobblewonker\u2019s flailing caused a light cave in, leading to a large rock crushing its head and making some odd metallic sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d Mabel started to ask. \u201cAhh, Dipper!\u201d She reached out, but the little guy was already hopping down the cliff with the speed of a goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Quick little dude, ain\u2019t he,\u201d observed Soos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Mabel grumbled irritably. She hated when Dipper ran away from her, especially towards something so obviously dangerous. Her own efforts to follow were slower and more careful. Oh, Dipper was going to pay for making her worry like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, come check this out,\u201d Dipper called from atop the creatures back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they\u2019d arrived, they found one of those spinning door cranks. It was on Mabel and Soos to open it up, revealing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld man McGucket!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town kook was at some kind of control panel. It was defunct now, but clearly he\u2019d been piloting the gobblewonker. As it turned out, he\u2019d built this behemoth killing machine because he felt neglected and wanted some attention, especially from his family. While even he admitted that it was pretty contrived, his story did move the kids to sympathy for their own old person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, they all decided to make up with and spend the rest of the day with their favorite Grunkle. Fishing turned out to be a lot of fun. Even fleeing the lake police was enjoyable. All was well, except that there was an old man in a cave with a history of building death machines and the stated intent of making a death ray. Not to mention that Dipper never finished reading the lake segment of the journal, which had a good many pages devoted to the real life gobblewonker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun set and the day concluded, the Pines family and Soos departed the lake for their respective homes. Mabel held Dipper in her lap all the while, wondering how she was going to deal with her brother\u2019s reckless behavior.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following dinner at the Mystery Shack, Dipper and Mabel decided to wash up before heading to bed; especially Dipper who was all too eager to discard his saliva drenched clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mabel, could you get a cup of water or something?\u201d asked the naked twelve year old of his undressing twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Standing in the bathroom, Mabel was down to just a pair of blue panties. She stared at her tiny naked brother, free of any sense of shame. They\u2019d been bathing together since they were born, so the sight of the other\u2019s naked body was nothing new to either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just I don\u2019t want these,\u201d Dipper gestured to the clothes in his arms, \u201cto dry and get all crusty before they can get washed. You know what crusty clothes are like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Only cuz you won\u2019t shut up about it,\u201d grumbled Mabel as she picked up the pile of garments and reached over the sink to ready a glass of water. This brought her bare and underdeveloped chest awfully close to her brother, but Dipper\u2019s eyes were on something more important than her little nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong, Mabel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. Of course not!\u201d She kicked at the carpet. \u201cWhy would you think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper cringed. \u201cOh, you know, no reason. Just being a concerned brother is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConcerned brother, huh? Is that what you call it when you leave me behind and run straight towards a giant monster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, give me a break. I was curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurious, huh? Curiosity killed the cat, Dipper!\u201d she said like it was some scathing accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my defense, a giant rock just fell on the thing\u2019s head. It was either dead or concussed. Either way, I\u2019m too small to be looked at as prey. I was perfectly safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing safe about giant sea monsters, <i>little</i> Dipper. You could have been hurt. Do you have any idea how worried I was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was taken aback when he caught his sister sniffling. Her eyes glistened before she turned her back on him. He reached out for her. \u201cMabel\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a shower,\u201d she huffed, slipping off her panties and discarding them to the side. Her immense hair shielded the back of her body as she marched off to the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh, Dipper turned back to the sink. He\u2019d have preferred to shower with his sister like usual, but there were accommodations in the nozzles for a minizora to handle, so at least he could pour himself a steamy bath. The little boy dove in like it was a pool and swam around idly. Every now and then he\u2019d turn to the silhouette of his sister in the shower, but she said nothing. She wasn\u2019t even singing the latest awful boyband hit, but the only thing more awful than that was the ongoing silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Mabel,\u201d Dipper called, but got no answer. He heaved a sigh. \u201cLook Mabel, I\u2019m sorry I made you worry, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being very fair right now. We were <i>both</i> in danger you know. How do you think I felt with everyone running for their lives and me being able to do nothing to help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Mabel tossed the shower curtain aside and turned the water off. \u201cThat\u2019s not your job, Dipper. I\u2019m the <i>big</i> sister, so that means I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, right there!\u201d Dipper accused. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s not fair. We\u2019re twins, but you\u2019re always putting it on yourself to protect me even though I\u2019m just as worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept it is. That whole gnome debacle could have been avoided if you\u2019d just listened to me from the start. I tried letting you do things on your own, and look where that got us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel scoffed in disbelief. \u201cSo what? You want to be the big sibling and look after me from now on? Ha! I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s unfair of you to think you\u2019re the only one that gets worried. You\u2019re my sister and I want to see you safe, but I still let you go out and make your own mistakes. I don\u2019t smother you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blinked. Dripping naked, she stepped out of the shower and over to the sink. \u201cIs that how you feel about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sheepish, Dipper grabbed his arm and averted his gaze. \u201cSometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess it was kind of unfair of me to forget that you get just as worried as I do,\u201d Mabel conceded. \u201cAnd maaaybe I overreacted just a tad this time with the gobblewonker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot during the attack, though. Only after,\u201d Dipper corrected. \u201cWhen that thing was after us, you actually listened to me. You trusted me to make the right call and that\u2019s what pulled us through.\u201d He reached out and motioned for Mabel to come down to his level. She did, lowering her chin to the counter and extending a hand; whichever he\u2019d prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper went for Mabel\u2019s cheek and gave it an affectionate pat. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that you trust me a bit more. Trust me like I trust you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sniffled and stroked a finger down Dipper\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m still going to be worried about you, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I could stop you,\u201d chuckled Dipper. \u201cHey, you forgot to tell Soos the whole story with the lumberjack guy. You know, where you started attacking him like you had rabies or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled. \u201cHey, I was just trying to teach him a lesson about watching his step.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnimal control was called and the guy\u2019s shoes were ruined,\u201d Dipper deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sighed fondly. \u201cYeah. I think I hate the taste of shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone does, Mabel. But you\u2019re one of the few people who takes the time to make sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming contentedly, Mabel picked her little brother up and carried him to the shower. \u201cWant to join me?\u201d she asked while stepping back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Though Dipper just expected their typical mutual wash, his sister had something else in mind as she casually tossed him in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh yesh,\u201d Mabel said through her mouthful. Naked Dipper was so much better than clothed Dipper. She couldn\u2019t quite put a name on his flavor. She\u2019d licked skin before, her own and that of others, but in those cases it had been tasteless at best and gag inducing at normal. But with Dipper, there was just some intangible quality that made him absolutely delicious. She was content to just chalk it up to being another minizora thing and leave it at that, but for right now she had the more pressing priority of running her tongue over every square inch of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel licked over Dipper\u2019s face, feeling him smile. She licked under his armpits, which made him thrash about from being tickled. Over his butt got a similar result, but by far the most exquisite part of her brother\u2019s body was his groin. Somehow that tiny penis and pair of balls had the strongest flavor of any part of him. And when she devoted special attention there, she giggled at how he grew erect. She loved how she could do this to him. For all their talk of trust and respect, Mabel would never relinquish the power of being the <i>big</i> sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the moist maw, Dipper was moaning as he was pelted on all sides by soft flesh. When it was just his bare skin, the stickiness didn\u2019t bother him as much. In fact, he rather enjoyed being in his sister\u2019s mouth. He enjoyed being played with, of being tossed around and toyed with. Mabel knew all the right ways to touch him that just felt so incredible. And now that she was focusing on his penis, the little boy cried out in rapture as he bucked his hips into the slimy organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel continued her affectionate tongue bath until she\u2019d achieved her reward. A tiny but potent sprits of sweet and sour flavoring. It was the perfect dessert after a long day of monster hunting, a treasure that was hers alone to enjoy. She hummed, continuing to toss her brother around her mouth until finally that extra special flavor disappeared and she spat him back out. \u201cHave fun?\u201d she beamed, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting from his ordeal in Mabel\u2019s hands, Dipper looked up and gave a weak-armed thumbs up. This was their way of saying that all was forgiven. From there they got cleaned up properly, dressed for the night, and went to bed. All was as it should be, with not a care in the world devoted to the old man and his death ray, nor the mysterious triangular constellation that briefly appeared in the night\u2019s sky.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s easier to find clues when you\u2019re that close to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking from experience?\u201d teased Mabel as she poked him in the gut. \u201cLike you could actually outwit Ducktective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I have very keen powers of observation,\u201d Dipper boasted. \u201cFor example: Just from smelling your breath, I know that you\u2019ve been eating\u2026 an entire tube of toothpaste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was so sparkly,\u201d Mabel confessed, sounding just a bit sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dudes. You\u2019ll never guess what I just found!\u201d declared Soos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBur-\u201d Dipper was silenced by a finger over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuried treasure!\u201d exclaimed Mabel. \u201cHa. I win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the \u2018buried treasure\u2019 was a secret door hidden behind the wallpaper. Within was a room filled with wax dummies of various historical figures. Grunkle Stan told the story of how he\u2019d \u2018purchased\u2019 the figures years ago, but then locked them in here after the wax museum stopped being profitable, and also he\u2019d just forgotten about them. When it was discovered that wax Abraham Lincoln had melted, Mabel had jumped at the chance to remake it into something new. When being offered free labor to resurrect an old and potentially profitable attraction, Stan was all too happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Dipper was enjoying a rare instance of independence without being carried around by Mabel. It felt good to stretch his legs and do little things like get his own soda. Walking down the hall, he was enjoying a few sips when Mabel sprung out of nowhere, causing him to drop his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, I have to show you my ideas.\u201d She held up a sketchbook. \u201cShe\u2019s part fairy princess, and part horse fairy princess,\u201d she described of the abominable centaur monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmaybe you should carve something from real life,\u201d Dipper suggested, not wanting to crush his sister\u2019s artistic dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of trial and error, but eventually Mabel settled on sculpting a very special member of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, dude. Your sister\u2019s, like, really good at this,\u201d Soos commented from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Once she gets in one of these artsy moods, basically nothing can stop her.\u201d Then Dipper got an idea. \u201cHey, Soos. I\u2019ll pay you five bucks to go in there and tell her to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoos glowered down at the little dude. \u201cDude, I\u2019m no Albert Einstein, but I\u2019m not stupid. I heard the full story of what happened to Manly Dan and there ain\u2019t no way I\u2019m sticking my hand in a fish tank filled with piranha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper chuckled. \u201cYeah, fair point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater still, there was a big ceremony for the reopening of the wax museum. At the ticket booth, Dipper sat alongside Wendy. She was the fifteen year old ginger who worked the Shack\u2019s counter most days. Her body was leanly built with well-defined muscle, a modest chest for her age, and a rump that was nothing to scoff at. She had a fondness for flannel shirts and wore a fur hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was pretending not to notice the afore mentioned details as he sat in a tiny chair on the table. Technically his job was to guard the money jar, but he had the feeling that he was actually being used as just another oddity to attract customers. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how many people showed up for this. It looks like half the town is here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right,\u201d agreed Wendy in her usual laidback demeanor. She was also pretending not to notice Dipper. She\u2019d never seen a minizora before and there was something about this little cutie that kept drawing her eye. \u201cFolks around here must be super bored. Either that or Stan bribed them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper unfurled a green bill from his jacket. \u201cHe bribed me.\u201d Wendy pulled out her own bill and they shared a laugh. This was nice. Aside from his mother and sister, Dipper had never really hung out with a girl before, especially not one this pretty. It wasn\u2019t weird that he thought she was pretty, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the unveiling finally got underway, it was tragically met with a lukewarm response from the audience. Fortunately, Mabel was not so easily deterred. \u201cThank you all for coming. I made this sculpture with my own two hands. It\u2019s covered in my blood, sweat, tears, and other fluids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the audience gagged at the implications, Wendy stole a wary glance at Dipper. Reluctantly, the minizora nodded that this was the case, to which Wendy commented, \u201cHehe, gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will now take questions!\u201d Mabel announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld man McGucket. Local kook,\u201d he introduced himself. \u201cAre the wax figures alive and \u2013 follow-up question \u2013 can I survive the wax man uprising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 yes! Next question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more questions followed before Shandra Jimenez spoke up. In this one horse town, she was considered the only \u2018real\u2019 reporter. She was Hispanic with dark skin, high cheek bones, and one of the finest bodies in all of Gravity Falls. \u201cYour flyer promised free pizza with admission to this event. Is this true?\u201d Despite her dispassionate tone, this questions seemed to wake the audience up as everyone was up in arms. Literally. Some people had actually brought pickaxes and pitchforks to a wax museum opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis probably isn\u2019t good,\u201d Wendy observed, bracing herself to run. She then remembered her table companion and suddenly felt awkward. Was it okay to pick up a minizora without asking, even in an emergency? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Stan dismissed what had apparently been the primary interest of the audience and attempted to flee with the money. This in turn led to a small riot in which chairs were thrown and poles were punched. Wendy, ever a girl of action, snatched Dipper off the table, stowed him in her breast pocket, and ferried him out of the danger zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper wasn\u2019t too worried about his predicament. He\u2019d been picked up by strangers before, but Wendy wasn\u2019t exactly a stranger. She\u2019d never been overtly hostile and generally treated him with better courtesy than she did most patrons of the Shack. The inside of her breast pocket was hot and the fabric was a little itchy. It also smelled. Dipper knew that there was only one thing he could be smelling at this time and wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! No punching the banner poles!\u201d Mabel snapped, pointing at Manly Dan the lumberjack. As soon as the pair\u2019s eye\u2019s met, the man who resembled a shaved red yeti decided to be anywhere but near that sack of adorable crazy. Once the audience dispersed, Mabel casually walked over to Wendy and with her eternal cheerfulness, held out her hand in a gi-me gesture. Wendy obliged and surrendered the tiny twin. \u201cI think that went well,\u201d Mabel commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yeah,\u201d agreed Wendy. \u201cCompared to how these things usually go, there\u2019s almost no damage. Oh, and sorry little dude,\u201d she said to Dipper. \u201cFor picking you up without asking, I mean. It was kind of a spur of the moment thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey,\u201d Dipper laughed nervously. \u201cIt was no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot big, but adequate sized,\u201d Mabel commented to the confusion of the others. \u201cYou acted quick and decisive, prioritizing safety over personal autonomy. And for that, you have my respect.\u201d She extended her other hand, which Wendy happily shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s\u2026 unsettlingly authoritarian, but whatever.\u201d The red head shrugged. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want the little guy hurt is all. Oh well.\u201d She set her hands on her hips and surveyed the mess. \u201cLooks like a lot of work to do. Think I\u2019ll clock out early.\u201d And she beat a lazy retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel grinned as she watched the taller girl go. \u201cI like her.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, Dipper and Mabel were upstairs brushing their teeth. Mabel had just suggested a tooth brush race when they heard the cries of horror from downstairs. Being a couple of twelve year olds who\u2019d already faced down two horrifying monsters in less than a week, they decided to run towards the sound of danger. That\u2019s where they found the source of the commotion. Wax Stan had been murdered via decapitation and his head was nowhere to be found. It was so gruesome that Mabel fainted; (accidentally) crushing Dipper under her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police arrived in short order, given that this was probably the biggest criminal activity they\u2019d seen in weeks. Even so, the sheriff seemed reluctant to even do minimal investigation, so Dipper volunteered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Dipper,\u201d squeed Mabel, hugging him to her cheek. \u201cI knew I could count on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well would you look at what we got in here,\u201d taunted Sheriff Blubs. \u201cCity boy gonna solve the mystery with his fancy computer phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCity boooy!\u201d called the deputy. \u201cCity boooy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are adorable,\u201d Blubs added, leading the both of them to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdorable?\u201d Dipper asked. He\u2019d been called a lot of names over his life and had learned to shrug off most of them, but for some reason this one really dug under his skin. When the cops left, Dipper was filled with righteous indignation. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Mabel, you and me are going to find out who did this and get back that head. Then they\u2019ll see who\u2019s adorable,\u201d he snarled, trying to look as tough as possible. Then he sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. You sneeze like a kitten,\u201d Mabel cooed, finding his wrathful glare all the more endearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the investigation was underway. The twins were taking photos for evidence, compiling a list of suspects, and consulting the journal for anything supernatural that might be related. Yet it was Mabel who found the first clue in the form of shoeprints in the shag carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang. How did I miss that?\u201d Dipper grumbled. \u201cSo much for being closer to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome things you can only see from high up,\u201d Mabel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. The point is that these shoeprints have a hole in the left shoe. That\u2019s pretty unusual. And they lead to\u2026\u201d An axe was found just behind the chair. Dipper just glowered at the axe for a solid few seconds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here literally five minutes and already found the murder weapon, but a couple of \u2018professional\u2019 cops didn\u2019t do jack,\u201d Dipper ranted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, maybe they were tired,\u201d Mabel excused. \u201cOr, you know, I hear towns like these include playing FPS games as part of their police exams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned. \u201cNow it feels like I\u2019m racing against someone without arms or legs.\u201d He then slapped himself for daring to pity the enemy. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve still got a mystery to solve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter conversing with Soos, the axe was connected to Manly Dan, who frequented an intense biker joint downtown. Soos also tried coining the term \u2018mystery twins\u2019, but Dipper was in no mood for cute names. Grunkle Stan, upon seeing the kids with an axe and plans on confronting the possible murderer, cheered them on to \u201cAvenge meee!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was suffering an increasingly low opinion of the town\u2019s collective IQ after Mabel\u2019s fake IDs actually got them into the bar. Inside there were all manner of ruffians punching one another for no discernable reason. Still the picture of perkiness, Mabel deposited Dipper in her sweater collar and attempted to hold him close. However, much to her consternation, he wiggled free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mabel. We talked about this already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow? You want to go off and do your own thing <i>here</i> of all places?\u201d When Dipper just crossed his arms and impatiently tapped his foot, Mabel gave a conceding groan. \u201cOkay, fine. But if you get stepped or sat on, that\u2019s on you.\u201d And they split up. Dipper went straight for Manly Dan while Mabel decided to destress by chatting up a very tattooed and burly man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cManly Dan, just the guy I wanted to see,\u201d Dipper greeted, trying to look tough as he stood on the arm wrestling machine Dan was playing. \u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPunching the clock,\u201d growled the lumberjack, sounding like he was perpetually on the verge of going into a blood rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were at work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was punching that clock.\u201d He pointed out the window to a clock atop a crooked post. \u201cIt offended me with its incessant ticking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen o\u2019 clock, the time of the murder,\u201d Dipper mumbled. He then regretted not bringing Mabel along as he dragged the axe over for inspection. \u201cSo I guess you\u2019ve never seen this before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here, little girl,\u201d Dan barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, actually-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t pick my teeth with that axe. It\u2019s left handed. I only use my right hand.\u201d He demonstrated this by ripping the arm off of the machine. \u201cThe MANLY hand!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Manly Dan proceeded to beat the snot out of what remained of the machine, Dipper backed away, feeling that he\u2019d been sufficiently emasculated for one day. He caught up with Mabel doing some weird school yard fortune telling thing and gave her the update. They just had to run through the list of suspects and see who was left handed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that proved easier said than done. One montage later and it turned out that there wasn\u2019t a single leftie in the whole town. Even when the twins thought they\u2019d cornered someone, they learned far more than they ever wanted about Toby Determined. They did get an extra clue that the axe had no prints at all, but that just deepened the mystery. Worse, the cops laughed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, the twins returned to the Mystery Shack to attend the funeral of Wax Stan. It was a tasteful ceremony held in the wax figures\u2019 old room with all of their lifeless forms in attendance. To Soos and Stan it looked like the twins were down about the murder, but they were mourning another loss as the adults left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose cops were right about me,\u201d Dipper grumbled in Mabel\u2019s lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Dipper,\u201d Mabel encouraged, petting Dipper with one hand and holding the axe in another. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far. We can\u2019t give up now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed, hopped down to the floor, and headed for the casket. \u201cBut I considered everything. The weapon, the motive, the clues\u2026\u201d He climbed up to get one last look at the dearly departed, where he noticed something odd. \u201cHmm. Wax Stan\u2019s shoe has a hole in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the wax guys have that,\u201d Mabel explained plainly. \u201cIt\u2019s where the pole thingy attaches to their stand dealies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat has holes in its shoes and no finger prints?\u201d It didn\u2019t take much before Dipper\u2019s eyes went wide and his pulse quickened. \u201cUh, Mabel!\u201d he whispered in alarm. \u201cI think the murderers are-\u201d</span></div></div>",

Naturally, Mabel responded by immediately pulling her brother close for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations my two amateur sleuths. You uncovered the truth,\u201d patronized the detective. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re going to bury you.\u201d He pointed his magnifying glass like a weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 how is this possible? You\u2019re made of wax,\u201d asserted Dipper in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 magic?\u201d asked Mabel, giving in to her girlish wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic. She wants to know if we\u2019re magic?\u201d mocked Wax Sherlock before slamming his fist on the casket. \u201cWe\u2019re cursed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCursed!\u201d echoed the other figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCursed to come to life whenever the moon is waxing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry to interrupt, but that doesn\u2019t sound like a curse,\u201d Dipper piped up. \u201cCurses have more of a negative implication. Like if you were the real guys who were turned into wax. That\u2019d be a curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d agreed Mabel. \u201cBeing able to come to life sounds like a blessing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock, unable to think up a counterargument, decided to tell their backstory. After they were stolen from their previous owner, they were set up here for the wax museum. By day they were overpriced attractions, but at night they were free to do as they pleased. It was a pleasant life, all things considered, right up until the money stopped coming in and they were locked in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just say one more thing?\u201d asked Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine. Go ahead,\u201d allowed an annoyed Wax Sherlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora pointed at Wax Lizzie. \u201cYou have an axe. If you didn\u2019t like being locked up, you could have just broken out at any night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd go where, hmm? You want us to be caught out in the sunlight just like Wax Lincoln?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m also not seeing how the wax museum stopped making money,\u201d Mabel added. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t take much to maintain you guys. Stan would have just had to do a minimal cleaning, like, once a week, which isn\u2019t that expensive. You\u2019ve been locked up for years and you all look in pretty good shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Wax Shakespeare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 I really don\u2019t see why you guys would be locked up in the first place. At the very least you\u2019d be making enough money to cover the cost of cleaning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s because your uncle is a big fat jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranted,\u201d allowed Dipper. \u201cHold on. You guys ever see Night at the Museum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI loved that movie,\u201d gushed Mabel. \u201cRobin Williams makes everything good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this movie about museum exhibits that also come to life at night,\u201d Dipper explained to the intrigue of the figures. \u201cThe museum was about to be shut down, so they solved the problem by the end by opening the museum to night guests. That way it\u2019s like there\u2019s a big animatronic t-rex skeleton in the front lobby and a Wax Teddy Roosevelt who can talk with people about the real Roosevelt\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPipe in one hand and Wax Stan\u2019s head in the other, Sherlock\u2019s brow made a climb up his forehead. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you guys could do the same. Show Grunkle Stan that you\u2019re really alive. We can basically employ you guys and extend the Shack\u2019s open hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, yeah!\u201d cheered Mabel. \u201cYou can be the evening crew. Give tours, talk about yourselves, and jack up prices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you guys would be able to walk free at night, and the Mystery Shack would make more money. Everyone wins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hold that thought.\u201d Sherlock motioned for the other wax figures to all gather at the far end of the room while they discussed this alternative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll buy it?\u201d Mabel whispered through a forced grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo clue, but try scooching closer to the fire,\u201d urged Dipper. \u201cTheir wax, so we can just melt them if things get bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea.\u201d And she discretely shuffled her way over to the fireplace to await the figures\u2019 verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They refuse and things go mostly like in the episode.<br>\r\n2. They agree and become integrated into the Shack</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wax conference concluded as the figures approached the twins. \u201cSorry kids, but no dice. We\u2019ve been waiting ten years to get our revenge,\u201d he flipped the Wax Stan head around in his hand, \u201cand next time we won\u2019t miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were trying to murder Grunkle Stan for real?\u201d asked Dipper in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, you little pipsqueaks! Now that you know our secret. You must die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou first!\u201d Mabel then wielded a fire poker like a javelin, hurling it at Wax John Wilks Booth\u2019s head and spearing it to the wall. \u201cHaha, got\u2019ch\u2019ya!\u201d Her cheer was short lived when the body kept moving and the remaining wax figures just looked peeved. \u201cOops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe candles!\u201d Dipper pointed over to where Grunkle Stan had set up a refreshment table, including a pair of electric candles. Mabel wielded hers like a sword easily enough. Dipper, through much effort, wielded his like a human trying to manage an artillery cannon without wheels. \u201cGet back or we\u2019ll melt you into candles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDecorative candles,\u201d Mabel added threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wax figures were intimidated at first, but then they remembered that they had the advantage in both size and numbers. \u201cYou really think you can defeat us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Worth a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo be it. Attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first casualty of the battle was Dipper\u2019s footing as the weight of the candle threw him off balance and he fell to the floor. When Mabel turned to retrieve him, she accidentally severed Shakespeare\u2019s arms. Dipper recovered to find the wax figures closing in on Mabel from all sides, clearly judging her to be the bigger threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever underestimate the little guy,\u201d Dipper muttered before rolling his candle with all due haste, melting a good many feet all the way up to the ankle. In one case, Wax Robin Hood tripped and knocked Wax Larry King over, who then fell neck first onto the candle and was subsequently decapitated. \u201cHa! Interview that, Larry King! You alright Mabel?\u201d He turned to his sister, and were they not in mortal danger, he would have burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel was using the severed Coolio\u2019s head like a mace, swinging it by the hair to bludgeon the other figures, knocking them back while she retrieved her candle. With her primary weapon retrieved, the little girl made a lunge for Wax Lizzie, but came up short and only tore her dress open. The adrenaline evaporated almost instantly as everyone paused to gawk. \u201cUh\u2026 wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Lizzie\u2019s hands shot down to cover her exposed groin. \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026 damn. I knew shaving down there was kind of a more recent thing but\u2026 wow. You\u2019d need a freaking lawnmower to trim that bush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-shut up!\u201d cried the wax woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned that someone took the time to sculpt her that way,\u201d commented Dipper. \u201cAll these other guys have their clothes as part of their bodies, but her\u2026\u201d He gestured. \u201cSomeone sculpted her to not only go commando, but also have a bush big enough to hide a whole person. Someone fetishized an axe murderer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other wax figures began snickering at Lizzie\u2019s plight, her cheeks began to burn from embarrassment. They burned so hot that she ended up melting herself. Once everyone got the giggles out of their system, the fight resumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock finally did something smart by tossing the Stan head aside and grabbing a real sword off the wall. Dipper\u2019s candle was smashed in short order. In response, Mabel found a broken sliver of metal near the fire place and threw it to Dipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hot on both ends, but not enough to harm minizora skin. \u201cUh, thanks, but how do I fight a sword with a toothpick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigure it out,\u201d Mabel urged, once more being swarmed by the remaining figures. \u201cDie Nixon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Wax Sherlock in pursuit, Dipper could only avoid and evade his strikes. Thankfully he had a lifetime of experience to help him through, but he was ever on the retreat. He knew there was only one chance. The minizora dove out the window and began ascending the Mystery Shack\u2019s roof, once more demonstrating the climbing skills of a mountain goat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can outwit me, boy? I\u2019m Sherlock-bleeding-Holmes! Have you seen my magnifying glass? It\u2019s enormous,\u201d ranted the wax man as he haphazardly swung his sword around and dislodged the big S from the sign. Eventually he cornered Dipper, pinning him to the shingled roof with his shoe. Wax Sherlock tried increasing the pressure to crush the boy like a bug, but the minizora only laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat the best you got?\u201d he wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrr. So be it.\u201d Wax Sherlock raised his sword high. \u201cAny last words?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, actually. Got any sunblock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any-?\u201d Wax Sherlock was cut off by the drip-drop of wax dripping onto his nose. His hands were liquefying and he lost his grip on the sword. He then turned and beheld the golden glow of the sun peeking over the forested horizon. \u201c\u2026 no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLetting me lead you to the roof? Yeah, probably not your sharpest decision,\u201d Dipper taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutsmarted by a child in short pants, and a minizora at that. Nooo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny second thoughts Dipper might have had for killing a person were rendered null at that moment. \u201cSucks to be you, buddy. All my life guys like you have been looking down on me. But in just another minute, <i>I\u2019ll</i> be looking down on <i>you</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, with each passing second, Wax Sherlock lost more and more height, along with facial features. And then, just as the wax man was finally shorter than the minizora and Dipper was about to deliver the last word, he sneezed. \u201cHa-ha-ha. you sneeze like a kitten,\u201d ranted the wax puddle in a mad delirium. \u201cThose policemen were right. You\u2019re adorable. Adorablllllle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Splat*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thunder stolen, Dipper heaved a sigh and returned to the wax room. Mabel was just finishing up with chucking severed wax limbs into the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, you\u2019re okay!\u201d Mabel rushed over and scooped him up, holding him tight to her cheek. \u201cYou solved the mystery after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I told you I can handle myself,\u201d he strained to say. Mabel\u2019s grip was more constraining than Wax Sherlock\u2019s shoe, so he tapped her cheek to signal her to loosen up. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t have done it without my sidekick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled and picked up the Wax Stan head from the floor. \u201cNo offense Dipper, but you\u2019re the sidekick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Says who? Are-are people saying that? Who\u2019s saying that?\u201d Dipper asked self-consciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t be down. You\u2019re still the best sidekick a hero like me could ever want.\u201d And she gave him a big wet kiss that encompassed most of his head. \u201cEw. You taste like wax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grunkle Stan came in to the warzone of a room, he was immediately placated with the presentation of his missing head. His reward was some affectionate noogying. That was nice, but far more gratifying was when the police pulled up and the twins had evidence of having solved the case. It didn\u2019t matter that no one believed them about the wax people. What mattered was the hilarious sight of two cops spitting scalding hot coffee in one another\u2019s faces.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early morning in the Mystery Shack when Soos was on break and decided to join Dipper and Mabel in the TV room. Mabel held her brother in her lap as her fingers idly fiddled with his tiny form. So long as his vision was unobstructed, he made no complaint, not even when she poked his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s that commercial I was telling you guys about,\u201d Soos informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid commercial was for some self-proclaimed psychic over at the Tent of Telepathy. That there was an unflattering video of Grunkle Stan towards the end only confirmed that these people were his direct competition for, as their dear old Grunkle would so eloquently say: \u201cFleecing roobs.\u201d And when Stan forbid them from going to the show that evening, their childish rebellion left them with no choice but to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing better to do while they waited for the evening, the twins went up to their room to relax. After the door was locked and blinds closed, Mabel removed her sweater to give her chest some open air. \u201cAhh, much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? As far as summer days go, this one\u2019s pretty mild.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m just,\u201d Mabel tittered, \u201cone hot mamma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019ve heard worse,\u201d Dipper allowed as he opened up the journal. He didn\u2019t even make it to the second line before being picked up by his shirt. \u201cHey, what gives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust giving you an extra special study spot, bro-bro,\u201d Mabel graciously said as she laid on her back and rested her brother down atop her chest. \u201cHehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, uh, sure, I guess,\u201d Dipper accepted of his sister\u2019s silliness. Mabel\u2019s breasts weren\u2019t anything to write home about, but they weren\u2019t <i>completely</i> flat. There was enough there for Dipper to rest his head on like a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Comfy?\u201d she asked, using her elbows to try and press her breasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough,\u201d answered Dipper distractedly, trying to ignore the way Mabel pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph. I bet you\u2019d notice if Shandra Jimenez put you on her chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, she\u2019s like in her late thirties. Plus I\u2019d bet those things are plastic. There\u2019s no need to get-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you say it!\u201d Mabel accused, her finger pointed like a deadly weapon at the boy resting against her tiny boob. \u201cI am not jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if anyone around here is going to be insecure about their size, it\u2019s going to be me. Got that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel huffed and turned away. \u201cAt least you could show me a little affection now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow and then? Mabel, I was literally in your mouth this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was <i>me</i> showing <i>you</i> affection. I\u2019m always the one doing the petting, the hugging, the licking, and all that stuff. Maybe you could throw a little sugar my way once in a while.\u201d Her tone was pleading and her eyes were doing that shimmery thing that she knew Dipper couldn\u2019t resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine,\u201d Dipper surrendered, closing the book as he was clearly not going to get any reading done until Mabel was satisfied. \u201cFirst, put this up so it won\u2019t get damaged.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel happily obliged and set the book on her dresser. As she did, her frown started to turn upside down as Dipper undressed. She clapped her hands and kicked her legs in anticipation of the fun that was coming. \u201cEe-he-he! Naked Dipper is best Dipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Sure,\u201d Dipper agreed dispassionately as he threw his underwear off to the side. Standing there in the buff atop his bare-chested sister, the minizora was still as soft as a noodle. Just being naked and looking at his half naked sister did nothing for him. It\u2019d take some serious stimulation to give Mabel what she wanted, but that got Dipper to thinking. \u201cSo if you want me to show some affection for a change, then you\u2019re gonna have to commit to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you gotta sit on your hands. Literally. If we\u2019re doing this, then I\u2019m in charge. You can\u2019t do anything. For once, you\u2019re the one who just has to sit back and let your twin have their way with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow. So forceful,\u201d giggled Mabel as she slid her hands under her bottom. \u201cI like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gave a curt nod. \u201cGood. Now, let\u2019s see here.\u201d After a second of surveying the smooth landscape beneath his feet, deciding a course of action, the minizora returned to his sister\u2019s chest lumps and climbed up onto the nipple. Mabel moaned quietly, but that was just a taste of what he had planned. Dipper dropped down onto his belly, pressing his limp dick against the little girl\u2019s nipple. \u201cOhhhh,\u201d he shuddered, having not expected it to feel that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel it,\u201d Mabel moaned. \u201cI feel your itty bitty weewee against my nippy. Tee-hee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby talk only makes this weirder,\u201d Dipper informed as he began experimentally grinding himself against the nub. He rotated his hips around in circles, trying to cover as much surface area as possible with his crotch. The texture of her nipple skin was different than her hands in a way that Dipper couldn\u2019t put into words. It felt amazing, though. Mabel moaned all the louder as she fought to keep her body still. A grin grew across Dipper\u2019s face as he came to terms with the control he now exerted over his sister. \u201cWow. So this is what it\u2019s like to be in charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty great, huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d he agreed while pressing his erection into her hardened nub. The friction of foreign skin against his sensitive prick combined with the knowledge of who he was humping; all added up for some pretty amazing stimulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dipper,\u201d moaned Mabel. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in my mouth, and I make you cum with my tongue, you taste sooo gooood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 figured,\u201d Dipper panted, now getting into the swing of things. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your tongue, though. I think every part of you is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?\u201d Mabel had never done much with her flat chest before, having always dismissed it as too underdeveloped to play with. However, as Dipper was demonstrating, she was a lot more sensitive around there than she\u2019d initially believed. \u201cC-can I play with the other one?\u201d she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora shook his head. \u201cUh-uh. This isn\u2019t about you feeling good. This is about me showing my sister some affection, remember. I\u2019m showing you what a minizora can do, and you\u2019re gonna sit back and take it,\u201d he growled, trying to channel some of Manly Dan\u2019s authority. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-harder!\u201d Mabel begged. With Dipper\u2019s stupid rule in place, she was powerless to do much. However, with him preoccupied with her chest, she was able to arch her back just enough to slip both hands beneath her skirt. The angle wasn\u2019t ideal for doing much and still maintain discretion, but it would have to do. Unable to think clearly, Mabel attacked both her ass and pussy, make believing that her fingers were Dipper. Lots of little Dippers, all rubbing and humping to their little hearts\u2019 content, and all at her command. They were doing this for her. The little Dippers were rubbing their little bodies against her most sensitive parts because she wanted them to, because they loved her and wanted to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHegakurgurk!\u201d Dipper gasped, his ejaculation jumping out at him like a snake. His body spasamed and he lost his grip, collapsing onto the erect nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Mabel was able to feel that tiny splash of liquid onto her nub. That combined with the stimulation from her hands to push her over the edge. Reflexively, she broke the rule by bringing the hand from her ass up and clamping it over her mouth to keep herself silent. It was a habit born out of having done this so many times at their parents\u2019 home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings, naked and half naked, laying atop the other and the bed respectively, panted. Their chests rose and fell with labored breaths, their bodies were all sweaty, and their groins were especially sticky. Dipper, to the surprise of no one, called upon his minizora endurance to recover first and stand. Hands on his hips and cock contentedly soft, he proudly surveyed his good work before smirking up at Mabel\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cheated,\u201d he playfully pointed out, indicating her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel, still recovering, scowled down at the minizora. Through her fingers she said, \u201cScrew off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper scratched his chin, pretending to think. \u201cHmm. Sure.\u201d And he began walking off. \u201cI need a shower anyway.\u201d But before he could jump from the little girl\u2019s body, a hand snatched him up and brought him to the little girl\u2019s big glowering face. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to be a sore loser about this,\u201d he said with a punchable smirk. \u201cFair\u2019s fair. You agreed to the rules, so that means-agh!\u201d His lecture was cut short after being tossed in his sister\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNom!\u201d Mabel pushed him into her cheek like a chipmunk storing food, not really up to a proper taste session. She just casually licked and sucked as strength returned to her body. When feeling returned to her legs, she headed for the bathroom and poured herself a glass of water. With Dipper secured by her tongue, she drank around him in an effort to punish him. Now internally refreshed, she looked herself in the mirror and did her best to speak around her mouthful. \u201cYou\u2019re the best brother ever, and I hate you for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible for Dipper not to grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the twins cleaned up and the adults none the wiser, Dipper, Mabel, and Soos paid their visit to the Tent of Telepathy. At the entrance there was a man named Bud Gleeful. A portly man in a Hawaiian shirt, he was holding out a bag to accept \u2018donations\u2019 into what he called Gideon\u2019s Psychic Sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think he knows what that sounds like?\u201d Mabel whispered to her shoulder rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiven what we\u2019ve seen so far from this town, I have no idea.\u201d Dipper looked around the tent. \u201cThis whole place is like a bizarro version of the Mystery Shack. They even have their own Soos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the audience was seated, the lights dimmed and the curtains rose. The person at the center of all this hype was just a pale freckled kid. He\u2019d be only half as tall without his hair and there was something off about how he would bat his eyelashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Stan\u2019s mortal enemy?\u201d Dipper said in disbelief, suddenly having a far lower opinion of the old man for considering this kid a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s so\u2026 little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle by big people standards,\u201d assured Mabel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper continued to be unimpressed as Gideon went through his performance, discerning \u2018secrets\u2019 about his audience members that were obvious to anyone who wasn\u2019t blind. \u201cHow are these people buying this? He\u2019s just doing cold reading. It\u2019s literally the oldest trick in the book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d he do that?\u201d Mabel awed after Gideon had guessed her name to the beat of an annoyingly catchy song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally written on your shirt,\u201d griped Dipper. He did not care for how his sister was looking at this chubby kid like he was made of glitter. The minizora was all too glad when the show finally ended. \u201cMan, that kid\u2019s an even bigger fraud than Stan. No wonder our uncle\u2019s jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. His dance moves were adorable. And did you see his hair? It was like\u2026 whoosh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re too easily impressed.\u201d The twins then descended into a poking war, laughing as they left through the parking lot and completely unaware that they were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Mabel was feeling a little glum. She\u2019d just bedazzled her face and Dipper didn\u2019t seem the least bit impressed. Then when there was a knock at the door, she decided to cheer herself up by talking to a potential stranger. \u201cAhh! It\u2019s wittle old you!\u201d she gasped at the sight of Gideon\u2019s hair, followed by Gideon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh-heh. Yeah, mah song\u2019s quite catchy,\u201d Gideon laughed a bit apprehensively. \u201cAh know we haven\u2019t formally met, but after yesterday\u2019s performance, Ah jus\u2019 couldn\u2019t get yer laugh out \u2018f mah head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean this one? Ah-ha-hahahaaa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a delight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their little back and forth, mostly about their mutual appreciation for sparkly things. Mabel even covered for him when Stan asked who was at the door. And then Gideon invited her over to visit his dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne sec.\u201d Mabel ran back to the dining room. \u201cHey Dipper. Gideon just invited me to his dressing room to play dress up. You wanna-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, would you look at the time,\u201d Dipper said, pointing to his nonexistent watch. \u201cI have to be\u2026 somewhere!\u201d And he made himself scarce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that Dipper would be safe enough at the Shack, Mabel accompanied Gideon for a few hours of dress up. All the while she remained utterly oblivious to the subtle and less-than-subtle hints the short stack kept dropping. When she returned, showing off her new do, she was once more confronted by an unimpressed Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, I don\u2019t trust anyone whose hair is bigger than their head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh leave him alone,\u201d Mabel snapped. \u201cYou never want to do girly stuff with me. You and Soos get to do boy stuff all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? We did that\u2026 thing, yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a minizora twin thing, not a girly thing.\u201d In no mood to argue, Mabel returned to Gideon for some quality feminine hanging out time. They\u2019d found a nice roof high up on a cliff that provided a great view of the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know Mabel, when Ah\u2019m up here lookin\u2019 down on all them little ol\u2019 people, Ah feel like Ah\u2019m king \u2018f all Ah survey,\u201d he whispered in a low menace. \u201cAh guess that makes you mah queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaat? You are being so nice to me right now,\u201d Mabel gushed. She slapped him in the gut and said, \u201cQuit it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh can\u2019t quit it, Mabel. Ah\u2019m speakin\u2019 from the heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the where now?\u201d Mabel asked, finally noticing the red flags. Sixty third one\u2019s the charm, as they say. But alas, she was unable to get out of his invitation to a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Shack, Mabel was trying to get her mind off the not-date with some video games. \u201cIt\u2019s not a date-date. It\u2019s just, you know, I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings, so I figured I\u2019d throw him a bone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, guys don\u2019t work that way,\u201d informed the wise tiny on her shoulder. \u201cThis is called \u2018leading a guy on\u2019. You\u2019re building his hopes up, despite having no real intention of getting serious. I know I\u2019d be pretty mad if a girl did that to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel scoffed. \u201cOh what do you know? Not like you\u2019ve ever dated anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not, but you know all those times you stuffed me in your underwear with nothing to do but read those minizora cutouts from your girly magazines? Well those things are mostly trash and even they agree that what you\u2019re doing is, at best, a dick move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dick move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doorbell rang, Mabel set Dipper aside to open it, expecting Gideon. She was right, but she hadn\u2019t been expecting him to be on a horse, or to call her mi\u2019lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer the not-date at the second fanciest restaurant in town went on, the harder it was for Mabel to convince herself that this wasn\u2019t a real date. There was an indoor fountain, aromatic flowers, more utensils than she knew what to do with, French stuff, and an overall creepy vibe as everyone \u2013 even the other guests \u2013 seemed to bend over backwards for Gideon. Was he some kind of cult leader or something? Mabel asked herself this after that one couple begged Gideon to bless their newborn baby. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon learning that that \u2018little gremlin\u2019 was dating his great niece, Grunkle Stan stomped right out of the shack to put a stop to this once and for all. He drove up to Gideon\u2019s less-than-humble abode, fully prepared to curb stomp the little piglet, and maybe his stupid faced father while he was at it. Bud, however, proved his smooth talking prowess and quickly diffused the situation. And even as committed as Grunkle Stan was at the start, once the prospect of making more money was brought up, he was putty in Bud\u2019s hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Shack, Dipper was sitting on the store counter while Wendy \u2013 without customers or Stan around \u2013 wasn\u2019t even pretending to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem down, squirt. Wanna talk about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Mabel being on a date is just kind of weird for me. Does that make sense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, totally. First time my brother brought home a girl, my first instinct was to kick that little bitch\u2019s teeth in. It\u2019s perfectly normal, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed nervously. \u201cDid you\u2026 do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, man. Go around kicking little kids in the teeth? That\u2019s how cops get called and you\u2019re sent off to juvi for, like, ever. The trick is to play nice at the start. Smile, get to know \u2018em, learn their weaknesses,\u201d she added darkly. \u201cThat way, if it turns out they\u2019re jerks, you can just blackmail them into breaking up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed more sincerely this time. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s super sweet or super creepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts family,\u201d Wendy stated plainly while opening a soda. \u201cThey\u2019re all a bunch of idiots, so you gotta do what you gotta do to keep \u2018em safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. You are really smart.\u201d <i>And pretty.</i> Dipper looked around, wondering who\u2019d just said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. My mom told me that. She\u2019s good with this kind of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you came from her, so you\u2019ve gotta have some of her smarts too, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you to say, but I\u2019m pretty tame compared to my folks. People think my dad is intense, but mom can be a demon when she gets upset. This one time I brought a guy home, I\u2019d left him in the living room to powder my nose. Anyway, just as I come back out, the window breaks. The dude actually jumped out the closed window to get away. Dad was sweatin\u2019 bullets while mom\u2026\u201d Wendy trailed off, laughing nervously. \u201cAnyway, the point is that it\u2019s perfectly natural to not trust your family\u2019s dates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a date,\u201d Dipper insisted. \u201cWell, Mabel says it isn\u2019t. Her words were \u2018throw him a bone\u2019,\u201d he said with air quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sucked in a breath like she\u2019d stubbed her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right.\u201d Dipper fell back on the counter and stared up at the ceiling. \u201cIf I were there I could help. I could be a little shoulder angel and whisper what she should do to break things off as quickly and painlessly as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled kindly. \u201cMabel\u2019s lucky to have a brother like you.\u201d She tapped at the table as a thought occurred. \u201cUm, this might sound weird, but would it be okay if I\u2026 pet you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned thoughtfully. \u201cHuh. I think that might be the first time someone\u2019s ever asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is it weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, only if we make it. Mabel and my parents just do whatever they want. Whenever some stranger tried reaching for me, Mabel would just bite their fingers. But if you\u2019re going to ask, then sure. Go right ahead.\u201d Dipper laid himself flat on the counter, suddenly feeling far more vulnerable than a few seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her bottom lip and with much trepidation, Wendy reached out with a single digit extended and touched Dipper\u2019s chest. Nothing happened, but she still exhaled her relief. She didn\u2019t know what she was expecting. She\u2019d played with dolls before, but that didn\u2019t seem like an adequate comparison. This was a minizora. His chest rose and fell with his breathing and he was warm to the touch. Wendy\u2019s instincts told her that this was a fragile creature that needed protecting, but common sense suggested otherwise. Minizora were tough, people said. They could handle all kinds of things that would kill a regular person. And yet this knowledge contradicted so starkly with what she was feeling right now. At that moment, she wanted nothing more than to hold this little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, meanwhile, was in a similarly perplexing predicament. A stranger was touching him, and he was okay with that. She was petting him, showing the same sort of everyday affection he was accustomed to from family. Much to his own surprise, he was totally relaxed, not even feeling the usual tension of going to the doctor. Did he trust Wendy that much? How far did that trust go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the doorbell jingled, startling the counter people to straighten up and attempt to look as innocent as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, h-hey Mabel,\u201d Dipper strained to say. \u201cHow did the\u2026 what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gave a long and drawn out groan, not even looking up as she trudged into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, dude. Normally I\u2019d think she\u2019d just broken up, but you said she didn\u2019t even want to date him,\u201d Wendy observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d Full of purpose, Dipper hopped down the makeshift staircase from the counter and scurried off after Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled as she watched him go and rested her chin on her hand. \u201cThere goes a pretty cool brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dipper finally caught up with Mabel, he found her having already withdrawn her limbs and retreated into her sweater like a turtle. \u201cMabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel\u2019s not here. She\u2019s in sweater town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to come out of sweater town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel whimpered and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second\u2019s thought, Mabel stuck her hand out of the bottom and motioned him forward. Dipper climbed on and let himself be pulled up to his dower sister\u2019s face. Everything was cast in shadow, but the minizora kept his eyes on what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow bad was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agreed to a second date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Dipper asked incredulously, his tone just making Mabel feel worse. \u201cI mean, you had a plan. Say you just want to be friends, and then be friends. No more dates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. He had a talking bird, and the rainbow machine, and this one lady said she\u2019d die of sadness if I didn\u2019t say yes. She even had a doctor confirm it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper suddenly became less sympathetic. \u201cSo someone you never met just happens to be so invested in you dating Gideon that they\u2019d die otherwise? And they just <i>happen</i> to have a doctor there to make sure you\u2019re manipulated into doing what Gideon wants?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, he\u2019s just like Grunkle Stan: a showman and a con artist. I\u2019d bet anything that those people were just actors planted to guilt you into dating Gideon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on a second. He\u2019s not\u2026 that controlling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! You hesitated,\u201d Dipper pointed out. \u201cSo you <i>do</i> think he\u2019s that controlling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat news, Mabel,\u201d announced Grunkle Stan with a beaming grin and a \u2018Team Gideon\u2019 shirt. \u201cYou have to marry Gideon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d the twins exclaimed together, both poking their heads out of the sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my long-term plan with Buddy Gleeful. There\u2019s a lot of cash tied up in this thing. I even got this shirt.\u201d Then he wandered off, muttering about how bodies change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it!\u201d Dipper stomped his foot on Mabel\u2019s palm. \u201cEnough is enough. If you can\u2019t break up with Gideon, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will?\u201d awed Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, remember that talk about the rabbits and feeling lousy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank-you-thank-you-thank-you,\u201d Mabel gushed, pelting Dipper\u2019s body in grateful kisses while he offered up only a token resistance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, while Mabel stayed home to avoid the paparazzi, Dipper grabbed a ride from Soos to pay Gideon a visit. He entered the first fanciest establishment in Gravity Falls and it certainly fit the title. Seriously, how does a place like this stay open when the number of locals who can afford to eat here can be counted on one hand? Anyway, the minizora held his head high and strutted inside like he belonged there. Although he did find it odd that a place this expensive didn\u2019t have some kind of security to keep people like him out.<br>\r\nUpon arriving at Gideon\u2019s private booth, Dipper ascended the table cloth and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Dipper Pines. How are you? You look good, you look good.\u201d Gideon\u2019s greeting sounded like he\u2019d been rehearsing for a school play. \u201cYou know Mabel has told me quite a lot about you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s all lies.\u201d Dipper strained to smile at his bad joke.<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Because whenever the topic of you came up, it was often accompanied with words like reliable, dedicated, fun, and various synonyms that made mah beloved ever so happy.\u201d He laughed that cutesy laugh of his before shifting to a whispered intensity. \u201cShe seems quite fond of you.\u201d<br>\r\nMore and more Dipper was having a hard time understanding why Mabel couldn\u2019t say no to this guy. If he\u2019d been in her position, he\u2019d have thrown himself out the window and booked it like Wendy\u2019s old boyfriend by now. \u201cLook buddy. We\u2019ve got to talk. Mabel isn\u2019t going to join you tonight. She, uh, doesn\u2019t want to see you anymore,\u201d he laughed uncomfortably. \u201cSh-she\u2019s kind of weirded out by you. No offense.\u201d<br>\r\nGideon just kept on smiling that serene, creepy smile of his. The only indicator that he wasn\u2019t the picture of happiness was the twitching in his left eye. \u201cSo, what yer saying is, you\u2019ve come between us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook man, some people just don\u2019t click. It\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s fault, except maybe yours. Uh, you\u2019re not going to freak out or anything, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Gideon tittered like a little schoolgirl. \u201cThese things happen. Bygones and all that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay cool. Sorry again man, but I, uh, gotta go,\u201d explained Dipper as he backed away, unwilling to turn his back on the giant shorty.<br>\r\nWhen Dipper made it back to Mabel and gave her the news, her hug about crushed the life out of him.<br>\r\nThe next day, while everything seemed back to normal, Toby Determined called wanting to interview Dipper about the unusual happenings he\u2019d seen in town. The minizora was all too excited, right up until he was given the time and place for the meeting.<br>\r\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d Mabel asked.<br>\r\n\u201cToby Determined. He wants to interview me, alone, after dark, in an abandoned building on the outskirts of town.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s literally the opening scene of the horror movie we watched last night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPretty generic, if you ask me,\u201d Dipper agreed nonchalantly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously I have to. If someone\u2019s going through the trouble of setting a trap, I\u2019d like to know who they are so we can keep an eye out for next time.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel did not care for this answer and not-so-gently grabbed her brother. \u201cBut what if you get hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no big deal. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going alone.\u201d He bounced his eyebrows suggestively and gave a winning smile.<br>\r\n\u201cWha? Oh. Ohhh! Hehe, good thinking.\u201d<br>\r\nEntering the old warehouse at the appointed time, Dipper was greeted only by darkness. Was this actually just a prank and not a trap? The light at the far end of the room ominously shining onto a swivel chair suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cHello friend,\u201d greeted Gideon, spinning around in his chair and, in place of a super villain\u2019s cat, petting a little doll of himself.<br>\r\nDipper blinked. \u201cSomehow this is way creepier than the horror movie.\u201d It was honestly rather impressive.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me tell you, boy. This town has secrets you can\u2019t begin to comprehend,\u201d Gideon threatened, shaking his fist.<br>\r\n\u201cThe only secret here is how you can delude yourself like this. I told you, Mabel\u2019s not into you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou liar!\u201d Gideon screamed shrilly. As he hopped off the chair and began marching toward the minizora, his hand gripped tightly on the green amulet on his shirt collar. \u201cYou turned her against me. She was my peach dumplin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAaare you okay man?\u201d Dipper asked, fighting his tiny instincts to run. Running just made the bullies want to give chase. Besides, he was confident he could take any blows this pipsqueak could dish out. And when his body was encased in a green aura that matched Gideon\u2019s amulet, followed by being hurled across the room into the brick wall, Dipper had second thoughts about running. \u201cOh crap!\u201d<br>\r\nOutside the warehouse, hidden behind a tree, Mabel was left to stew in her own thoughts as she searched for any signs of danger. In hindsight, that first date really had been a dick move, but letting Dipper break up for her had been an even bigger dick move. Gideon might have his\u2026 quirks, but he at least deserved an honest break up. As soon as this hole trap thing was sorted out, she\u2019d march over to his house and do things right.<br>\r\nInside the warehouse\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhh!\u201d Dipper was getting more exercise in the last few minutes than the last couple years. Everywhere he turned there was something floating, flying at him, dropping on him, or maybe gravity would just have a hiccup and he\u2019d be the one sent flying. There just comes a point in a young man\u2019s life when he can\u2019t help but think that a bully giving swirlies is the lesser evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce yer out \u2018f the way, Mabel will be all mine! Mwahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are insane,\u201d Dipper spat as he was lifted high in the air. \u201cIf anything happens to me, she\u2019ll know who to blame. She\u2019ll hate you forever.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ah don\u2019t think so,\u201d tittered Gideon as he levitated a pair of scissors up to the minizora. \u201cYou underestimate just how persuasive Ah can be. Tee-hee.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel threw the doors open. \u201cGideon, we have to talk,\u201d she stated with calm firmness.<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mabel? My marshmallow. Wh-what are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d asked Gideon in a rare moment of uncertainty. He knew things looked bad, and so quickly discarded the scissors in the hopes that Mabel hadn\u2019t seen them yet.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gideon, but I can\u2019t be your marshmallow,\u201d Mabel answered calmly, not even paying Dipper a glance. \u201cAnd I need to be honest and tell you that myself.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter all of his denial, Gideon finally looked crestfallen. \u201cA-Ah don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\nWith an inviting smile, Mabel approached with hands outstretched in friendship. \u201cHey, we can still be makeover buddies, right. Wouldn\u2019t you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Gideon hopefully, only for that hope to be snatched right off his neck.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really!\u201d snarled Mabel, the magic amulet in hand and out of Gideon\u2019s reach. The magic faded and Dipper dropped to the ground. \u201cYou were attacking my brother. What the hell?\u201d And she slapped him across the face with a thunderous thwack.<br>\r\n\u201cN-now Mabel, Ah can explain.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Fuck your explanations!\u201d She slapped him every other word. \u201cFuck you! Fuck you forever! Go fuck yourself! You fuck!\u201d<br>\r\nEvery f bomb was like a stab into Gideon\u2019s heart. How could his sweet peach suddenly grow so sour? Then the amulet started glowing again, only this time its glow encompassed Gideon\u2019s body and he floated helplessly before Mabel.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me make this as clear as possible,\u201d Mabel hissed. \u201cI will never date you. You crossed a line and now I will never even like you.\u201d She then spent about a minute experimenting with the durability of Gideon\u2019s face vs. the floor and walls. \u201cIf you ever come near me or my family again, I will end you!\u201d Teeth bared, she crushed the amulet in her bare hand, ending its power forever and dropping Gideon. \u201cNow get out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine. Ah\u2019ll leave,\u201d Gideon conceded, backing away with a limp and clothes in tatters. \u201cBut Ah promise. This isn\u2019t the last you\u2019ve seen of Wittle. Ol\u2019. M-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! Ah\u2019m gettin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\nDipper waited until things quieted down. \u201cW-wow Mabel. I-I\u2019ve never seen that side of you be-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWha-ha-ha!\u201d Mabel cried as she flung herself onto Dipper, tears gushing from her eyes and onto his clothes. \u201cYou idiot! You stupid, stupid idiot! You knew it was a trap, but you still went anyway. That shit almost cut you with scissors. You can\u2019t handle scissors!\u201d<br>\r\nDipper opened his mouth, but didn\u2019t know what to say. He could point out that there were factors that couldn\u2019t have been accounted for, that he\u2019s withstood worse and maybe could have handled the scissors, or that Mabel had agreed to this whole plan, but he couldn\u2019t see any of those arguments ending well for him. And with the tears of his beloved sister ripping his heart out, he finally settled on something to say. \u201cYou protected me.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel took a break from her constricting embrace and pulled back enough to look Dipper in the eye. She was ugly crying and hated that he was seeing her like this. However, there was something about his smile that lifted her spirits just a tad.<br>\r\n\u201cI knew I\u2019d be fine, because you protected me like you always do.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel fell right back to bawling, but with most of the fear and anger removed. Now there was only relief mixed with a bit of joy that everything was alright. No more words were exchanged as the pair sat there in the warehouse, holding one another for comfort.<br>\r\nWhen Gideon finally made it back home, the first thing he did was have Stanford Pines tossed out. The merger of their families was off. As far as he was concerned, this was a full and proper feud. It hardly mattered that Stan stole an expensive painting on the way out. Oh, there would be recompense and it would go far beyond petty thievery. This, Gideon knew with absolute certainty. He knew it because in a secret compartment at his desk, there was a book; an itty bitty minizora book. It bore no title. Just a little six fingered hand and the number 2 on the cover.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next couple of days, Mabel was being especially clingy with Dipper, which he wasn\u2019t too bothered by. They\u2019d both gone through some pretty heavy stuff: him almost dying and her having to watch her most favorite person suffer. They were each other\u2019s comfort object. Ever since they were little, their default response to any kind of stress had always been to seek out the other. That was the case now, with Dipper offering no complaint even when Mabel insisted on escorting or being escorted by him to the bathroom. And right now, the twins were undertaking a heavy emotional ordeal. They were going to be within two feet of one another, but not actually touch. This was an important step in their recovery process.<br>\r\nAt the entrance to the gift shop, Mabel was sitting on a spinning globe. \u201cHehe. My butt is crushing Canada.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, do you believe in ghosts?\u201d Dipper asked while flipping through the journal.<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that you\u2019re a big dork. Haha.\u201d For her impudence, Dipper pressed a pencil into the globe, bringing it to an abrupt halt and sending his sister flying. \u201cOw.\u201d<br>\r\nThe bell rung and Stan poked his head in the door. \u201cSoos. Wendy. I\u2019m headin\u2019 out. You two are going to wash the bathrooms, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d they answered respectively, each with a firm salute.<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. You stay out of trouble.\u201d With his old man scowl delivered, Stan departed for parts unknown and deeds most likely of the extra-legal variety. <br>\r\n\u201cHey guys. What\u2019s this?\u201d Wendy called, gesturing over to a mysterious curtain in the corner. \u201cIs it a secret ladder to the roof?\u201d Pulling back the curtain, she revealed that it was just that.<br>\r\nSoos was reluctant, but the teen was easily able to bring the preteens onboard. She even showed them to her secret cot and cooler.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, did you put all this up here?\u201d awed Dipper. \u201cHuh. Funny I didn\u2019t notice any of this when Sherloc-er, never mind.\u201d<br>\r\nWendy gave her hair a casual flip. \u201cI may or may not sneak up here during work\u2026 all the time, every day.\u201d She then grabbed a pinecone from a bucket and tossed it across the lot and hit a target that had been strapped to the plastic tiki tower. \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh I want to try,\u201d squealed Mabel as she grabbed an armful and began chucking the things, each round coming up short.<br>\r\nNot wanting to be left out, Dipper figured he might as well try. His pinecone hit someone\u2019s car and set off the alarm. At first his gut sank in fear that he\u2019d just royally screwed up, but Wendy\u2019s laugh said otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha-ha, jackpot!\u201d Bending down with one hand on her knee, she extended her other palm down to Dipper\u2019s level. \u201cHigh five.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper suffered a momentary mental blue screen. The hand of someone other than a relative was reaching out for him in\u2026 comradery? What\u2019s more, that hand was attached to a young woman with cute freckles and a lovely shade of red hair that was being picked up just right by the wind. And her smile\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me hangin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper snapped out of it and delivered the high five. It was oddly exhilarating. <br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, it\u2019s my friends,\u201d Wendy said as a car pulled up. She then looked apprehensively at the twins. \u201cUh, you guys aren\u2019t going to tell Stan, are you?\u201d<br>\r\nWith a resolute smile, Dipper made a zipping motion over his mouth and threw away the key, which Wendy mirrored. The teen then said \u201cLater dorks,\u201d before descending down some nearby trees with a level of prowess rarely seen outside of professional acrobats, or minizora. <br>\r\n\u201cLater Wendy,\u201d Dipper called after they\u2019d already driven off. His laugh was forced and his waving was frantic. \u201cHaaa, good times.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh,\u201d beamed Mabel, not so oblivious when it came to other people\u2019s relationships.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s got a cru-hush,\u201d she sang, poking him in the cheek.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. I just think Wendy\u2019s cool is all. It\u2019s not like I lay awake at night thinking about her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? So when I catch you staring blankly up at the ceiling at night, who <i>are</i> you thinking about?\u201d inquired Mabel, continuing her poking assault.<br>\r\n\u201cHer name\u2019s Business. First name None-Ya.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me. I know when my little brother\u2019s crushing on someone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? So if I were to, say, offer you this handkerchief that Wendy used to wipe her chest earlier,\u201d Mabel said while producing said fabric from her pocket, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be interested?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow much?\u201d Dipper\u2019s mouth said before his filter could switch on.<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s smirk was downright devilish. She had him cornered and they both knew it. \u201cIt\u2019s actually clean,\u201d she said before returning the white cloth to her pocket. \u201cSo, got a thing for red heads, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I mean, I don\u2019t know. Just\u2026 this one, I guess,\u201d he admitted apprehensively. \u201cC-can we just drop this, please?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Whatever you say, bro-bro. Just know that I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready to talk. In fact\u2026\u201d Mabel then unceremoniously snatched up Dipper and stuffed him down the back of her underwear.<br>\r\nWedged between her soft cheeks, Dipper was left to consider how surprisingly mature that response was, at least by Mabel standards. Still, with nothing better to do today, he decided to make himself comfy in the warm softness, pull out his flashlight and journal, and get some reading done.<br>\r\nThe next day, Mabel seemed to have fully returned to her usual chipper self, as indicated by the \u201cRandom dance party for no reason!\u201d<br>\r\nAs she and Wendy got their groove on, Dipper pretended to read, all while peeking over the top of the journal. He was starting to notice things about the red head. Her dancing really showed off how nice her hips were. While she lacked the perpetual sugar rush that was Mabel\u2019s energy, her moves had a more mature elegance. That one move resembled a pelvic thrust, which set the minizora\u2019s imagination into overdrive.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Dipper. You gonna get in on this?\u201d Wendy called.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I, uh, don\u2019t really dance,\u201d Dipper dodged with a blush, only to spy the sadistic gleam in Mabel\u2019s eye. She was about to do her sisterly duty and embarrass him for her own amusement.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, ya do.\u201d She turned to Wendy. \u201cMom used to dress him up in a lamb costume and make him do\u2026 the Lamby Dance,\u201d she said as if imparting some ancient and holy secret.<br>\r\n\u201cNow is not the time to talk about the Lamby Dance,\u201d Dipper said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, lamb costume?\u201d Wendy chuckled. \u201cIs there, like, little ears and a tail, or-?\u201d<br>\r\nMabel immediately produced a picture for Wendy. \u201cHe used to be so cute. He\u2019d prance around and sing a song about grazing,\u201d she laughed with nostalgic fondness.<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow.\u201d Wendy covered a hand over her mouth to stifle her giggles. She understood how embarrassing this was, but couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away. \u201cJust look at him. Aww, he\u2019s so sweet I think I just got diabetes.\u201d While the ladies laughed, Dipper was left to seethe in silent humiliation.<br>\r\nThen the clock chimed.<br>\r\n\u201cOp. Quitin\u2019 time.\u201d Wendy pocketed her name tag and made for the door.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hey wait,\u201d Dipper called. \u201cMaybe I-er-we could come with you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I don\u2019t know. My friends are pre-tty intense. How old did you guys say you are?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, we\u2019re thirteen, so technically teens,\u201d Dipper lied.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I like your moxy, kid. Let me get my stuff.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel picked Dipper up and tutted her disappointment. \u201cLying to a girl just to hang out. Oh Dipper. I thought I taught you better.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taught me literally nothing about dating\u2026 which this isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just one group of friends hanging out with another group of friends, all connected through one mutual friend. It\u2019s all very friendly, and nothing else.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Yeah. Sure,\u201d Mabel teased.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, quick question. Um, why are you being so cool about this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike, I\u2019m not saying I like Wendy or anything, but if I did, I kind of expected you to be a little more, you know\u2026\u201d He gestured vaguely.<br>\r\n\u201cFinger bitey.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way of putting it.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel laughed and shook her head at her pitiable little brother. \u201cBecause I realized something, Dipper. You and me, we kind of, how do I put this? Suck. Yeah. When it comes to love, we kind of have sucky tastes in picking people to crush on.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper scowled. \u201cThat sounds like the worst revelation ever.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBuuut, we don\u2019t suck at judging the <i>other\u2019s</i> love interests.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not following.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a twin thing. We started out as the same cell, but then we became two. I think it\u2019s like we\u2019ve got one whole person\u2019s worth of common sense between us. I tend to miss a lot of stuff that\u2019s obvious to you, but you\u2019re basically blind to stuff I can\u2019t not see. So whenever one of us finds someone we like, we should trust the other twin\u2019s judgement instead of our own. That way we can avoid the awkwardness of gang banging gnomes, magic creepoids, or that one girl with chronic diarrhea.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper shuddered with revulsion. He\u2019d have been happy to never think about Patty ever again. But in thinking of her now, Mabel had warned him beforehand. \u201cHmm. You know, that\u2019s not the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHigh praise.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if I\u2019m following, does this mean you approve of Wendy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she still have all her fingers?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen yeah. I like her fine.\u201d Mabel emphasized by clicking her teeth together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The meeting with Wendy\u2019s friends went less than ideal. Nothing Dipper did impressed anyone and he kind of pissed off Robbie by calling his drawing of an explosion a muffin. The rest of the guys were pretty rough with one another and prone to frequent punching. The only other girl, Tambry, was so glued to her phone that it was a miracle she could walk. Since the twins didn\u2019t take up much space, they were made to sit in the back of Thompson\u2019s mom\u2019s van with Tambry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, you like spending time on your phone, huh?\u201d Dipper asked awkwardly, trying to break the ice while sitting in Mabel\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry finally paused in her texting to give the pair a once over. \u201cSo you\u2019re, like, twins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yup. Sure are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you, like, identical?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel and Dipper shared a look. It was the look of people who\u2019d been asked a particular question so often that they\u2019d put serious thought into starting a petition to get that particular string of words criminalized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not identical,\u201d Dipper said as politely as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re a boy and a girl, not to mention the whole height thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Plus I\u2019m the cute one,\u201d Mabel added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry hummed thoughtfully. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve never seen a minizora before. What\u2019s that like? Do you, like, get stepped on a lot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of, but almost never twice by the same person.\u201d Dipper then gestured up at Mabel. \u201cGuess why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. I saw a photo of that on BookFace.\u201d Tambry flipped through her timeline and turned her phone towards the twins. Sure enough, there was a photo of Mabel frothing at the mouth and biting into Manly Dan\u2019s ankle while he wore an expression of abject horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was actually whipped cream, but I think it sent the right message,\u201d Mabel added, almost bragging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry finally smiled. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t half bad.\u201d And she went back to texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van finally pulled up at their destination and they all disembarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is, fellas. The condemned Dust 2 Dawn,\u201d Wendy ominously announced to the awe of the others. The building had been fenced off and looked like it hadn\u2019t seen human activity in decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d they shut it down?\u201d Dipper asked, not wanting to show his anxiety at entering another abandoned building. \u201cSome kind of health code violation or\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry murder,\u201d said one of the guys whose name Dipper had already forgotten. \u201cSome folks died in there. The place has been haunted ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis town has such a colorful history,\u201d Mabel cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wha? A-are you guys serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChill out, man,\u201d Wendy said before poking his arm, what she felt to be an appropriate equivalent of a friendly punch. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone else had to climb the fence, Dipper was able to just walk between the holes. Unfortunately, the doors were locked, but then Dipper got an idea. \u201cHey, let me take a crack at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie scoffed. \u201cYeah right. I can\u2019t get in, but itty bitty pipsqueak is gonna break it down like-Agh!\u201d He winced as a can hit him in the face. \u201cWho threw that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one gave any response; least of all Mabel who was innocently whistling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, leave him alone,\u201d Wendy pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s just a little kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s expression of hurt quickly morphed into determination and he snapped his fingers. \u201cMabel.\u201d She manifested behind him. \u201cRoof me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide grin at the chance to show off their twin skills, Mabel picked up her brother. With him curled up in a ball, she took aim at what looked like a vent and tossed him. Everyone else was gob smacked, unable to believe what they were seeing as the little fella climbed. Mabel had only thrown him half way up, meaning he\u2019d have to make the rest of the ascension on his own while the others watched. He disappeared. There was a commotion on the roof, like metal being punched, and then came silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie scoffed and turned to the others. \u201cWho wants to bet he doesn\u2019t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c$100!\u201d Mabel shouted urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. Like he\u2019ll actually-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the door unlocked from the inside, Dipper was able to push it open and motion the others to enter. While the others congratulated the minizora, even giving him the nickname Dr. Funtimes, Mabel stuck by Robbie\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can discuss a payment plan later. I\u2019d prefer cash, but I\u2019m willing to settle for the equivalent in fingers and toes.\u201d Her ultimatum delivered, she merrily skipped on into the haunted shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man. It\u2019s even creepier than I imagined,\u201d commented Wendy as the group split up to explore the dark isles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was covered in dust and there were more than a few bugs scurrying about. The whole experience of a convenience store at night was pretty novel for all of them. It wasn\u2019t long before Wendy found the light switches and, much to everyone\u2019s surprise, they still worked. With that set, the games were on. They had a food war with expired pastries, dropped mints in soda bottles just because, and did pretty much whatever else they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mabel squealed. \u201cOh my gosh, Smile Dip! I thought this stuff was banned in America.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they had a good reason,\u201d Dipper observed responsibly. All the tape wrapped around the display saying \u2018Do Not Sell\u2019 seemed to predate the store\u2019s closing. But the cheering of the teens throwing liquefied food at one another called him back to the fun, leaving Mabel to her own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on one of the isle shelves, Dipper and Wendy were enjoying some (miraculously) still frozen ice cream sticks. After an initial period of awkwardness, Dipper agreed to sit on her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. Dipper, this night is, like, legendary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look around. The guys are bonding.\u201d She pointed to where they were pouring ice into Thompson\u2019s pants. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen Tambry look up from her phone this long.\u201d Tambry just looked up to check on the shelf sitters, but looked away the moment their eyes locked. \u201cAnd your sister seems to be going nuts for that Smile Dip.\u201d Pink sugary stuff stained Mabel\u2019s hair and clothes. Her eyes looked glazed over as she seemed to be imagining eating something very large. It was unsettling to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Dipper. I wasn\u2019t sure if you could hang out with our crew at first, but you\u2019re surprisingly mature for your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Yes I am, though that\u2019s probably just cuz I\u2019m a minizora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. I think I heard that somewhere. You little guys mature, like, super quick or something.\u201d That was the SFW version, though. When Wendy had read about this online, there had been lots of comments talking about the sexual side of things. Something about them evolving to develop early to ensure survival. There\u2019d been a lot of talk about hormones, or maybe it was pheromones. Lots of people were arguing on the particulars. The overall conclusion was that even if a minizora kid looked like any regular kid on the outside, on the inside they were, like, twice as old. In that sense, depending on how you looked at it, Dipper was kind of like an adult in a little kid\u2019s body. Wendy wondered if this new info made her feelings towards the little dude less or more awkward. Probably the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Dipper agreed, oblivious to Wendy\u2019s inner turmoil. He was glad that from his position, he could sneak glances of her chest without her noticing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dipper had gone to fetch some more ice cream for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame this place shut down,\u201d he said to himself as he opened the freezer door. \u201cNot many places are this minizora friendly. I wonder if-\u201d His train of thought was broken when he beheld a floating brain. The nervous system floated beneath it like the tendrils of a jelly fish, along with a gurgling mouth and a pair of eyes that got way too close. Naturally, Dipper screamed and shut the door before anything else could happen. <br>\r\nThen the teens all came over to investigate. \u201cWhat was that? I thought I heard some lady screaming back here.\u201d Said one of the no-names. \u201cYou freaking out kid?\u201d asked the other no-name.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m fine. Everything\u2019s fine over here. Um, how are you?\u201d Dipper\u2019s eyes nervously darted about in search of some sort of distraction. \u201cHey look. Dancy Pants Revolution, the game that tricks people into exercising.\u201d That worked and the teens all rushed over to play. After taking one last look inside the freezer and finding it empty, Dipper decided that it had just been some trick of the light and rejoined the teens.<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s smile was forced as he tried to play it cool. Then he looked at the reflective glass and saw everyone \u2013 including himself \u2013 as skeletons. He then slapped himself and the reflections went back to normal. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He tried to phone Grunkle Stan. The good news was that it was minizora accessible. The bad news was that no one was picking up.<br>\r\nDipper then returned to Mabel. He climbed on her palm and her fingers reflexively curled around him in a protective embrace. \u201cMabel, I need your help. I think this store really is haunted, I can\u2019t get ahold of Grunkle Stan, and if I say anything to these guys,\u201d he gestured to the teens, \u201cthen they\u2019ll just think I\u2019m a scared little kid or something. Uh, Mabel?\u201d Her only answer was a low gurgle as pink foam poured from her lips. Dipper then climbed up to her shoulder and started slapping her cheek. \u201cMabel, how many of these did you eat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEleven\u2026 teeeeen. Blagh!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh man-oh man-oh man!\u201d Dipper shook his hands as his body felt hot and cold all at once. They were in danger and his other half was in a sugar induced coma. How could things get worse?<br>\r\nRobbie then called everyone over behind the counter. There were a couple of chalk outlines of where the bodies had fallen. Everyone was impressed and, in typical teen fashion, decided to prove their bravery by getting inside the lines.<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Dipper urged, positioning himself between the teens and what was definitely a bad idea. \u201cMaybe let\u2019s not do that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh-heh. This guy\u2019s scared.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is: Why tempt the fates? I mean, what if this place really is\u2026 haunted?\u201d The fallout was as bad as he\u2019d feared. Everyone was booing, his nickname was changed to Captain Buzzkill, and worst of all, Wendy looked disappointed with him.<br>\r\nTambry just kept texting. \u201cStatus update. Trapped in convenience store with insane 9 year old.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not 9!\u201d Dipper stomped his foot like a petulant child and, also like a child, surrendered to peer pressure by laying down in the chalk outline. \u201cI\u2019m 13. Technically a teen.\u201d<br>\r\nWith his announcement made, it was like the whole store gave a groan. The lights turned an eerie green and the chalk outline began to glow. The change in scenery caused Tambry to look up from her phone just in time to vanish in a blinding flash. <br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, what the hell?\u201d<br>\r\nDipper ran over and checked her phone. \u201cStatus update. Ahhh,\u201d he read. Then the security camera flipped on with the girl inside and trying to break out of the glass. Everyone had the appropriate reaction of screaming like a bunch of sissies. <br>\r\nThompson, who was still playing on the machine, was the next to vanish. He reappeared within the game screen and was pummeled by arrows. With nowhere to run, he curled up in a ball and started to cry. Tension only escalated when the doors closed on their own and no amount of force could break through.<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody wait,\u201d Dipper called, pulling out the journal and flipping to the ghost section. \u201cWhatever is doing this has to have some kind of reason. If we can figure out what it is, thennn maybe they\u2019ll let us go.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen the white no-name made a sarcastic remark, his reward was to be transported within the art of a cereal box where the bird mascot tried to eat him.<br>\r\nThen, just as everyone was onboard with the only actual plan, Mabel floated about six feet above the ground. She had no pupils, her body glowed, and she spoke with a deep masculine voice. \u201cWel-commme.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey got Mabel!\u201d Dipper cried.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to your graves, young trespassers. Mwahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re super sorry for hanging out in your store,\u201d Wendy pleaded.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Can\u2019t we just go now and leave forever?\u201d begged Dipper.<br>\r\nThe ghost possessing Mabel hummed. \u201cHmm. Okay, you\u2019re free to go.\u201d The doors opened. However, just as the guys tried to run, they were sealed shut all over again. \u201cHa! Just kidding.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou creepy freak! Just let us out already,\u201d demanded the black no-name.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, loser,\u201d Robbie agreed.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like your tone.\u201d The ghost snapped Mabel\u2019s fingers, turning the disrespectful teens into hot dogs and putting them on the rollers to cook. \u201cIt begins.\u201d Gravity decided to take the day off as everything fell to the ceiling.<br>\r\nWendy winced in pain. \u201cAgh! Dipper. Dipper, where\u2019d you go?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn here,\u201d called a voice from within her shirt. In the fall, Dipper had somehow been wedged waste deep between Wendy\u2019s boobs. Were they not in such great peril, they\u2019d have both been more embarrassed. With the items of the store now swirling in a whirlwind, Dipper directed Wendy to run into an empty soda machine for safety.<br>\r\nSecure inside, Wendy caught her breath with her hand against her chest, along with the boy. Ever since meeting Dipper, she\u2019d been secretly fantasizing about this exact thing happening; only in the fantasy she\u2019d been a lot cooler and able to enjoy the moment without ghosts trying to kill them. \u201cWhat do they want from us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRevenge, I guess,\u201d Dipper suggested while he tried to wiggle free. Wendy\u2019s breasts were a lot bigger than they appeared through her casual clothes, and the way she was lying down squished them together pretty tightly. The rapid rise and fall of her chest made it hard for the little guy to keep his balance and he kept having to brace himself on his hands. He was touching her boobs, and they were warm.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did we do?\u201d Wendy demanded of her boob sitter. Despite her panic, the little guy\u2019s struggling against her sensitive area was causing her body to react very unfortunately. Her only hope was that he didn\u2019t notice and think she was some kind of pervert.<br>\r\nThe two had a back and forth until Dipper figured out the pattern. Everyone had been taken after doing \u2018normal teen things\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Stay here until I get back.\u201d Before she could stop him, he\u2019d already hopped out of her shirt and hurried out onto the main floor/ceiling. \u201cHey ghost! I\u2019ve got something to tell you,\u201d he declared even as he was lifted up into the air. This whole thing was giving him some seriously bad flashbacks, but he still had a mission to complete and a sister to save. \u201cI\u2019m not a teenager!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the magic faded. The ceiling was still the new floor, but everything still dropped, including him and Mabel. Then a couple of ghosts \u2013 a man and woman in their late eighties \u2013 manifested. Were they not transparent and floating, their smiles would be quite charming.<br>\r\n\u201cWell why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d asked the man with a good-natured laugh. \u201cHow old did you say you were?\u201d<br>\r\nMindful of Wendy\u2019s eyes upon him, Dipper sucked in a breath. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 twelve. Technically not a teen.\u201d<br>\r\nThe ghosts then told their backstory. They hated how teens behaved in their store, eventually getting so fed up that they banned them all. In retaliation, the teens had some kind of rap battle dance off in the parking lot. The lyrics were so \u2018hateful\u2019 and \u2018shocking\u2019 that the pair were stricken with double heart attacks. It was the most tragically hilarious thing the minizora had ever heard.<br>\r\n\u201cBut, they\u2019re my friends. Isn\u2019t there anything I can do to help them?\u201d pleaded Dipper.<br>\r\nIn fact, there was. These ghosts wanted to see a minizora do a funny dance. When Dipper let slip that he knew one, they were even generous enough to provide him a lamb costume. As the minizora swallowed his dignity and humiliated himself before these strangers, Wendy was enduring her own brand of suffering. Seeing such a cute boy in such a silly costume was unbearable to behold, but she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away. She had to resort to biting her arm until blood was drawn to keep her imagination from wandering. She\u2019d think about it later, though.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was some fine girly dancing,\u201d congratulated the ghost. \u201cYour friends are free.\u201d <br>\r\nThe lights returned to normal, as did gravity. Everything fell back to the old floor and the formerly captive teens crawled out of the wreckage, all suffering the spectral equivalent of a hangover.<br>\r\n\u201cEvil,\u201d Mabel burbled, her stomach expressing its hatred for her as she stared at a pink package. \u201cEeeviiil.\u201d<br>\r\nWith everyone still disoriented, Wendy saw fit to tell the story. Once the ghosts appeared, Dipper MacGuivered an array of slingshots that propelled him all around the room. He was like the world\u2019s deadliest pinball and battered the ghosts until they ran away crying. While everyone was in awe, Wendy turned back to Dipper and made the zipping motion, which he returned.<br>\r\nOn the ride back, Mabel was amazingly able to keep from spewing. Dipper, meanwhile, was thinking of Wendy. She\u2019d been impressed by him, covered for him, expressed an interest in hanging out further, and her chest had been so soft. So\u2026 soft. All in all, he\u2019d had worse nights.</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re huuungryyy,\u201d Mabel pleaded, pinching her stomach and shaking it. Soon dipper started doing the same as both made sounds like they were dying. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get something in my tummy quick, I might have to eat Dipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t bluffing, man,\u201d deadpanned the minizora. Mabel had only ever swallowed Dipper by accident. The exception being that first time back when they were three and she was trying to get him away from some bullies. Later, after he\u2019d been spit up and cleaned, she\u2019d apologized until she lost her voice. Even so, it was fun to freak people out with the threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan agreed, leaving the idiot locked in the gift shop. Greasy\u2019s Diner was a local joint with a lot of character, which was a nice way of saying it wasn\u2019t up to code. There were even woodpeckers and beavers chewing on the wood. Their server was Lazy Susan, a woman about Stan\u2019s age with a dysfunctional left eyelid. After some rather forced banter, Stan ordered the cheapest item on the menu for himself and leftovers for Dipper and Mabel to split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Grunkle Stan, I want pancakes,\u201d whined Mabel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man was as stingy as ever, but then Dipper saw his chance to shine. At the far end of the room was a machine called Test Your Manliness, with the promise of free pancakes for winners. Cracking his knuckles, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry guys. Pancakes are on me. I\u2019ll win us some by beating that manliness tester.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second of disbelief, both Mabel and Stan burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s so funny? It\u2019s got a setting for minizora, so I can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Dipper, but you\u2019re not exactly Manly Manington,\u201d cackled Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. I am so Manly\u2026 Many or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFace the music, kid,\u201d Stan lectured. \u201cEven by tiny people standards you\u2019ve got no muscle, you smell like baby wipes,\u201d he didn\u2019t notice Mabel\u2019s eyes guiltily darting around, \u201cand let\u2019s not forget last Tuesday\u2019s\u2026 incident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Baba is awesome, but that doesn\u2019t matter. Come on, guys. I\u2019m plenty masculine. Look at this chest hair.\u201d He pulled down his shirt, catching the mid-morning light just right and magnifying it back at his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! My eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt burrrns!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Dipper decided that he was getting nowhere with just words. \u201cFine, oh family of little faith. Get ready to eat those words, with a side of pancakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper hopped down and marched over to the machine, climbing the little staircase on the side to the minizora setting. It had a scaled down handle and everything. Channeling the strength that had defeated gnomes, wax dummies, and a small army of bugs across the years, Dipper grabbed that handle and squeezed with all his might. The bottommost bulb blinked and the machine spat out a card, which Dipper thoughtlessly read aloud. \u201cCutie patootie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel screamed, burying her face in her sleeve and banging on the table as tears poured from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManly Dan, in a rare moment of sympathy for the pipsqueak, decided to do the poor kid a favor. After gently setting him down on the ground, careful not to provoke the wrath of the minizora\u2019s rabid guard dog, the man ape pushed his pinkie against the lever. The machine overloaded and pancakes were flung out to every plate in the diner. \u201cPancakes for everyone!\u201d While everyone cheered at his display, Manly Dan checked on the person he actually wanted to impress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gestured for him to move along, so he did; but only because it was his decision, dammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper just sat on the floor, picking up the pieces of his shattered masculinity, when a red head showed up. She wasn\u2019t the one from the Shack, though. This lady was much older, maybe early thirties. She looked like a super model with an hourglass figure, tremendous tits, and a luscious ass that Dipper wouldn\u2019t mind sitting on him. <i>Who just thought that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squatted down closer to Dipper\u2019s level, thankfully wearing pants. \u201cHey there, sugar. Don\u2019t let yourself get down, none.\u201d Her voice was like honey. \u201cSay, yer that Dipper kid Wendy told me about,\u201d she inquired, reaching down with her thumb and trigger finger to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper swallowed what felt like a lung and accepted the offer. \u201cOh, uh, Wendy t-told you about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sure did. Mah little girl said you were quite the hero the other night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re Wendy\u2019s mom.\u201d Dipper forced a smile, remembering that this was the woman with the power to make guys fling themselves out of closed windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind mah husband, none. He\u2019s just got his own special way of showin\u2019 he cares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s, aha, nice to hear, but doesn\u2019t help much.\u201d Dipper gestured up at the machine. \u201cEven by tiny standards, I\u2019m a wimp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Corduroy smiled flatly. \u201cYa really shouldn\u2019t listen to what some dumb machine has to say. There are lots of ways to be a real man, even for a minizora. Ya just have to find the one that fits yer style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate that. I really do, but I think I just need some alone time to figure things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, suit yerself.\u201d She stood and was about to walk away, but stopped herself. \u201cJust one more thing. If ya happen on some still water \u2018n\u2019 see yer reflection in it, don\u2019t sing. Only princesses do that, \u2018n\u2019 that\u2019s about as far from manly as anyone can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed, once more thanking the woman for her kindness, and departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunkle Stan turned to Mabel. \u201cYou just gonna let him go like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019d just tell me not to follow,\u201d Mabel sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to be more independent and I\u2019m trying to let him. Our therapist said it\u2019d be healthier for both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEgh. Head doctors are all quacks if you ask me, though I guess this one\u2019s not totally wrong. A lucky minizora has family that\u2019ll look after them, but things can sometimes go overboard. Ya get overprotective, smothering, and worry yourself sick. A little distance here and there really is for the best for all sides. Gives them some independence from feeling stifled and gives you a break from worrying.\u201d Grunkle Stan then took a sip of his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s almost exactly what our therapist said.\u201d Mabel\u2019s awe then turned to suspicion. \u201cHow do you know so much about minizora?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan averted his gaze. \u201cOh, you know. A guy my age hears things. No big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense to me,\u201d allowed Mabel, fully accepting of this explanation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trudging down the sidewalk in a funk, Dipper had gotten careless and been stepped on quite a bit. Nothing was broken, but what hurt more was how most of the people didn\u2019t even pay him a second glance as they kept on walking. Deciding he needed to be away from people, Dipper ran out into the woods. There he found some suitable twigs to practice bench pressing. He only made it to 4 before calling it quits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on his back, he asked of the sky, \u201cIs it physical? Is it mental? What\u2019s the secret?\u201d Figuring that he had nothing better to do than drown his sorrows in food, Dipper pulled out a tiny bag of beef jerky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a second later, the ground began to rumble as a distant creature roared. Animals of all sorts fled as if from a natural disaster and even Manly Dan was there. \u201cFor the love of all that\u2019s holy. Ruuun!\u201d And he did, the dumbass not even noticing the tiny person near the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora tried to flee, but the shaking of the ground somehow caused some trees to fall and block his path. Dipper narrowly avoided being crushed as the thunder of footsteps approached. He smelled the creature before he saw it: a putrid combination of B.O., salt, and dried sex fluids. It was big, maybe ten feet tall, with the horns and face of a bull, the body of a man, muscles for days, a blessed skirt mercifully wrapped around the waist, and enough chest and back hair that he could probably survive a collision with a truck, even without the muscles. And to top it off, the thing grabbed a male deer from a bush and used it\u2019s antlers to scratch his ass before tossing the buck aside. Then the thing looked at Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me,\u201d Dipper begged. \u201cI haven\u2019t showered in a week. And I\u2019m, like, all elbows. Elbows and gristle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou,\u201d the creature boomed, pointing a finger accusingly at the tiny. \u201cGonna finish that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper looked down and saw that he was still holding the bag of jerky and quickly threw it towards the creature. \u201cBy all means. Go ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature introduced itself as a manotaur named Chutzpar. Chutzpar proceeded through a sequence of manly displays by punching trees and head butting rocks. He then demonstrated the ability to smell emotional issues, prompting Dipper to tell his story. Despite first impressions, the manotaur proved to be a very good listener and showed quite a bit of sympathy for Dipper\u2019s struggles with the little guy\u2019s perception of himself as a man. Ultimately, the manotaur agreed to Dipper\u2019s request for pointers on manliness, but only if the minizora climbed his back hair and held on all the way to his lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lair pretty much embodied everything one would expect from a stereotypical man cave, which, coincidently, was the place\u2019s name. There were weights for lifting, foosball, mini-fridges overflowing with beer, and broken controllers piled so high that they reached the ceiling right alongside a game station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChutzpar picked up a bone to ring a gong. \u201cFellow manotaurs. I bring you a tiny hairless child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2019up,\u201d Dipper squeaked. With all the other manoutaurs having such manly names, he introduced himself as \u201cDipper the destructor,\u201d which they found adequate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChutzpar rang the gong again. \u201cDipper the destructor wants us to teach him the secrets of our manliness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other manotaurs deliberated on this, which is to say things broke out into a fist fight for no discernable reason. In the end they chose to deny his request. But Dipper, having just seen one of these guys punch himself in the face, decided to exploit their apparent weakness for his own advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDenied? Okay fine. Obviously you guys think it\u2019d be too tough to train me. Maybe\u2026 you\u2019re not man enough to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a collective sucking of air that actually pulled Dipper forward just a tad. His tapping into their insecurities had convinced them. And so the training began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing a man is about conquering your fears. So your first test is to stick your hand into the pain hole.\u201d This announcement made the other manotaurs wince. The otherwise innocuous hole in the ground had a little sign and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to back down on the first trial, Dipper sucked in a breath, got on his knees, and plunged his fist into the hole. At first, nothing happened. \u201cUm, okay. So is there going to be a-ow! Hey, what the-ow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manotaurs collectively flinched, but quickly came out of it when they noticed the hairless child\u2019s cries weren\u2019t in agony, but annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is in here?\u201d Dipper hissed. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, really itchy or something. Was there a time limit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany jaws dropped. \u201cItchy? The last guy to stick his fist in the pain hole screamed for three straight days,\u201d Chutzpar informed in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I have to stay like this for three-ow!-days?\u201d Dipper demanded irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no that\u2019s fine. You can stop now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining trials were just as awkward for all involved. The manotaurs again showed remarkable consideration by scaling everything down for Dipper. Instead of pulling a cart full of manotaurs, it was a tiny cart full of mice. Instead of walking across the heads of crocodiles in a lake, he had to walk across the heads of snakes. And on it went. After a good few hours of montage training, Dipper was allowed to relax in the Man Cave\u2019s natural hot springs. There he beheld the most frightening ordeal yet: naked manotaurs. The less said about what lay under their manly skirts the better, although Dipper was certain he\u2019d be seeing those\u2026 things in his nightmares for the rest of his life. Then again, this did prompt his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot for taking me under your wing, guys. Though I\u2019ve been wondering something. Are there, like, fem-o-taurs or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat set them to uproarious laughter. \u201cOf course not, Destructor,\u201d Chutzpar said. \u201cWe manotaurs are the greatest force of masculine energy in the known universe. We don\u2019t even have X chromosomes,\u201d he said as though it were obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Okay. So then\u2026 how do you reproduce?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe butt fuck. MANFULLY do we butt fuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long and terrible silence followed. Dipper stared up at the ceiling and questioned every life decision that had led him to this awful reality in which he was imagining\u2026 that. After spending so much time with the manotaurs, he\u2019d absorbed a bit of their culture. So it seemed like a perfectly sensible idea to punch himself in the face in the hopes of giving himself amnesia. Then he remembered how often the manotaurs liked to hit their heads against things, and suddenly had a lot more sympathy for their awful plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper muttered under his breath. \u201cThis is proof that there is a god\u2026 and that he hates us.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the 49 trials before, there was still one last challenge, and it was the deadliest of them all. The first step was a ceremony in which Dipper was stripped down to a loincloth and covered in manly removable tattoos. The permanent ones would come later. Dipper was then introduced to Leaderaur, a great black manotaur roughly 40 feet tall whose lower half was smaller than his fists. With those fists he reached into his chest and ripped out one of his own ribs, which had already been fashioned into a spear. Dipper\u2019s task was to do a heroic act. He had to go up to the highest mountain and bring back the head of the manotaurs\u2019 mortal enemy, the Multibear. By conquering him, Dipper\u2019s manformation would be complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the spear had been trimmed down so that Dipper could actually wield it, the mission was on. After everything he\u2019d already endured, a perilous trek across the wilderness was practically a pleasant stroll through the park in comparison. Whatever else could be said about the manotaurs, they sure knew how to set up a solid workout routine. The burn in his muscles as he ran was amazing. And with the loincloth covering practically nothing while he moved, the breeze across his privates was also refreshing. He moved with confidence, free of fear of being stepped on or carried off by wild animals. Such liberation was exhilarating. When he stopped at a stream for water, he even shared a knowing nod with a wolf. It was the most amazing thing ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he tried to focus on the trial, planning out strategies for taking down a creature that was tough enough to challenge the manotaurs, Dipper\u2019s mind kept wandering back to home. He thought of Mabel; cute and well-meaning, but often overbearing. Had she come with him, he\u2019d have never been allowed to make it this far, yet he did. This was his accomplishment. A skinny, noodle armed minizora was actually scaling a literal mountain like it was a jungle gym. Body pumping full of adrenaline, Dipper really hoped that his erection would go down before he made it to the top. Luckily, the sight of so many bones littering the cave\u2019s floor managed to do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpear at the ready, Dipper entered into the black abyss. Examining the bones, he discerned that they were mostly deer and other moderate to large sized animals. \u201cSo this thing is at least as big as a manotaur. Hmm. I probably should have asked what a Multibear was before coming up-\u201d *Grrr* \u201c-here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it revealed itself. The beast resembled a chimera, the mythical creature that was a combination of multiple animals, only in this case they were all bears. It was like someone hacked the creature creator in Spore and just kept adding bear parts. It had bear bodies for limbs, heads and regular limbs seemingly for decoration, and three asses in back. Probably best not to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBear heads, silence!\u201d declared the eloquent central head while smacking one of the lesser growling heads. \u201cChild, why have you come here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMultibear, I seek your head,\u201d Dipper declared. \u201cOr, at least one of them. Any chance you could just give me a spare?\u201d Alas, negotiations broke down, and the fight commenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a harrowing ordeal. Dipper had never before faced that many claws or teeth all at once. Overpowering his foe was out of the question, but Dipper knew he had other strengths. The Multibear was unaccustomed to fighting a foe so tiny, so his blows were awkward. In observing its movements, Dipper further discerned that the many bear heads were not in complete harmony and could be provoked into independent action. Diving into the creatures thickly matted hair, he began a mosquito strategy of stabbing somewhere sensitive, and then running before the Multibear could smack itself. This was repeated everywhere that looked sensitive, driving bear paws to smack several bear heads unconscious. The finishing blow came after the enemy kneed itself in the fourth groin and it fell with a calamitous crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper ascended to the central head and took aim at the throat. \u201cA real man shows no mercy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Multibear conceded his defeat with surprising grace. His last request was to die listening to his favorite music. After turning on the old cassette player, it turned out that the song was Disco Girl by Baba, the same one that Dipper had been mocked for liking earlier. The two got to talking. When the manotaurs said that the Multibear was their mortal enemy, they\u2019d actually meant that he was just some guy who kept to himself and listened to music they didn\u2019t like. The truth revealed, Dipper could not bring himself to harm a kindred spirit, and marched his barely covered ass back to the Man Cave and threw down his spear before Leaderaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna do it,\u201d Dipper announced to the shock of the manotaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaderaur was angry, or possibly indifferent. He kind of only had the one expression and tone, so it was hard to tell. \u201cYou were told the price of manhood is the Multibear\u2019s head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, screw that. You keep saying that being a man is all about being tough and agro all the time, but I think that\u2019s bull! I may not have muscles, or hair in certain places, but the Multibear is just a nice guy who doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone. What about cutting off his head is even remotely heroic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaderaur hopped down from his stone throne and backhanded it into oblivion. Yup, definitely mad. \u201cKill the Multibear or never be a man!\u201d he roared in Dipper\u2019s face, but the tiny stood his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll never be a man.\u201d His mind made up, Dipper allowed himself to be booed off the stage and left the Man Cave. After making a pit stop at the Shack to wash off the tattoos and get a new change of clothes, he tracked Mabel and Stan back to the diner, where apparently Mabel had been trying to ship Grunkle Stan with Lazy Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper! Bro-bro, where ya been? I-\u201d Mabel\u2019s peppiness evaporated as she looked over his bruises and her demeanor turned dark. \u201cDoes someone need to die? You can tell me if someone needs to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Dipper glumly dissuaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Stan said between bites of pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just these half man half bull humanoids were hanging out with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go,\u201d Stan added dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then they wanted me to do this really horrible thing, but it just wasn\u2019t right. So I said no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention primarily on the pie, Grunkle Stan said, \u201cYou were your own man and you stood up for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did what was right even though no one agreed with ya?\u201d Stan said around his mouthful. \u201cSounds pretty manly to me, but what do I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper beamed. Maybe there was hope for him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel, meanwhile, was studying the minizora more intently. \u201cIs it me, or did you get a little bit of muscle in the last few hours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I did just climb a literal mountain and defeated a composite bear monster, so I\u2019d hope so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d Mabel handed Dipper a fork, which he easily lifted over his head. Curious, Mabel just kept adding on more silverware, making it six pieces before it was too much and Dipper dropped them. \u201cOh my gosh, this is amazing! You used to only be able to hold up three. My little brother is so strong now.\u201d She sucked in a gasp and dropped her chin to the table. \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d she asked with a breathy undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk on his face and hands uncaringly in his pockets, Dipper gave Mabel a knowing look. \u201cOh, you know, probably nothing special.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Originally by chaos)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Wendy\u2019s room, the red head had invited her friend Tambry for a little girl\u2019s night. Lately that just meant that Tambry would be on her phone all night while Wendy watched cheesy horror movies. Mostly they ignored one another, but this night would soon take an interesting turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Wendy, come check what I found.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy scooted over across the bed to investigate what had provoked Tambry to speak. Whatever it was, it had held the girl\u2019s attention a lot more than normal, so Wendy was at least curious. She was almost disappointed when she saw the black woman. She was in her early thirties with her huge tits hanging out and staring excitedly at the viewer. \u201cYou\u2019re watching porn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I was expecting something a little\u2026 more. You seen one porn video, you\u2019ve seen \u2018em all,\u201d Wendy said disinterestedly, noting the odd way Tambry was smiling. \u201cHold on, what kind of porn is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinizora porn.\u201d As soon as the words left Tambry\u2019s lips, the black woman pulled out and held up a large dildo to the camera. A minizora was sitting on the tip of the sex toy, smiling excitedly and waving to the camera. The little guy was Caucasian, maybe late teens, and not bad on the eyes. The volume was off, but the two appeared to be introducing themselves and exchanging playful banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wendy even knew what had happened, her jaw had dropped in astonishment as she found herself unable to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry giggled and paused the video just as everything was getting lined up. \u201cThat Dipper\u2019s pretty cute, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cAfter he saved us from those ghosts, I got to thinking. He deserves an award for being so brave, if you know what I mean.\u201d Tambry motioned like she was giving a blowjob and made gagging sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy rolled her eyes. She knew of her friend\u2019s promiscuous side, but it had never been an issue until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut since Dipper\u2019s too small for the regular way, I figured I\u2019d do a bit of research,\u201d Tambry explained, licking her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty amazing the kinds of stuff you can do with minizora. And all of it is super hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou slut,\u201d Wendy chided good-naturedly with a friendly shove. \u201cYou\u2019d do anything, or anyone, just to kill time in this boring town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t?\u201d challenged Tambry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had to avert her gaze. She\u2019d had rolls in the hay with guys before. While she didn\u2019t see herself as being as bad as Tambry, she was far from a prude. However, Dipper was different. He was more than just a random fling. He was a friend, and one that she suddenly felt uneasy about letting Tambry near. \u201cYou know he\u2019s only twelve, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? He\u2019s a minizora. I\u2019ve seen videos with them as young as eight, and its all perfectly legal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy blinked, gob smacked by this revelation. She knew her friend didn\u2019t have much in the way of standards, especially given the selection in this town. However, Wendy\u2019s building frustration asserted that Dipper was still different, no matter what the laws or her friend said. Her mental image of Dipper depicted a young boy too sweet and innocent for the corrupting likes of Tambry. But at the same time, her mind couldn\u2019t help but wander. Dipper was awful cute, after all. She liked him as a friend, a good friend, but couldn\u2019t stand the idea of frightening him off with her stupid mixed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can hold off on this whole \u2018reward\u2019 thing?\u201d implored Wendy. \u201cConsider it a favor to me, for that thing I helped you with.\u201d Not willing to say the words out loud, Wendy set a hand on Tambry\u2019s, hoping the connection would help her friend see reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry\u2019s eyes widened and her smile grew wide as she finally set her phone down. \u201cOh, I see what\u2019s going on here.\u201d Her eyebrows bounced suggestively, making Wendy fear for the worst. \u201cYou want the first shot at him.\u201d Tambry continued before Wendy could sputter a coherent denial. \u201cFine. I\u2019m cool with that, but don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get away without spilling the details.\u201d She slid off the bed and made for the door. \u201cThink I\u2019ll go get some more snacks. Don\u2019t run off and fuck the little dude without me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna fuck the little dude!\u201d Wendy shouted after Tambry, throwing a pillow just as she turned the corner. Incensed, the red head snatched up a handful of popcorn and angrily chomped it. \u201cGreat. Now she\u2019s gonna start nagging about it,\u201d she grumbled, already imagining Tambry asking if she\u2019d \u2018popped her minizora cherry\u2019. That would be just like Tambry. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get it. He\u2019s just a good friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what\u2019s this Ah hear \u2018bout ya fuckin\u2019 a li\u2019l dude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s heart sank as things went from bad to worse. There in the doorway stood her mother. Sheela wore tight daisy duke shorts and a crop top that accentuated her voluptuous figure. With no means of escape, Wendy grabbed another pillow, slammed her face into it, and screamed in anticipation of the inevitable headache. \u201cI didn\u2019t say nothing, ma. Please drop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela gave a kind but knowing smile; her default expression. \u201cYa sure there ain\u2019t somethin\u2019 botherin\u2019 ya, baby girl? No pint-sized boy stole yer heart, did they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy groaned even louder into the pillow. Her mom had a way of digging right to the core issue. Somehow, much to her daughter\u2019s consternation, she always seemed to know when her \u2018baby girl\u2019 was having issues. Whether it be a fight with a boy or teenage angst, Sheela knew. She knew and always made it a point to be there to offer motherly advice, whether Wendy liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a friend,\u201d Wendy asserted her exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela gave a smile that seemed to ask \u2018Are you trying to convince me, or yourself?\u2019 \u201cA friend\u2019s jus\u2019 a friend \u2018til ya get too friendly, baby girl. Don\u2019t get all hung up on the petty details. If ya like a guy, put yerself out there \u2018n\u2019 take the risk. It\u2019s what makes life worth livin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s mouth twisted as she tried to form some rebuttal, but her mom\u2019s words had the insufferable power of asserting themselves in her brain. Theoretically, purely hypothetically, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to see if Dipper was interested. More than once she\u2019d caught him staring at her, though that might have just been him being wary of being squished. If she was careful, she could discern if there was something there without jeopardizing their friendship, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest make up yer mind quick, baby girl. If Ah were you, Ah\u2019d grab that boy, take \u2018im home, \u2018n\u2019 introduce \u2018im ta every inch \u2018f mah naked body,\u201d Sheela purred, miming as if she were holding something small and stroking it across her body like a bar of soap. She squealed happily like she\u2019d just eaten something especially delicious. \u201cThe things Ah\u2019d do with a man that small. Mmmh! Ah bet them tiny hands could reach <i>all</i> kinds \u2018f places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus God, ma! Why?\u201d Wendy whimpered helplessly, wishing for the first time that she was at work right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her message delivered, and giving one last self-satisfied smirk, Sheela made her departure. She felt no shame about sharing her more perverse thoughts with her daughter. As a mother, she saw it as her duty to impart her baby girl with all her wisdom, especially about the bedroom. Her daughter would thank her someday, especially if this boy turned out even half as good as her gut suggested.</span></div></div>",

He kept a low profile, hand on the ground in search of tracks, wielding a weapon, and was back to only wearing his loincloth. The time was night and there were only a few patches of light to illuminate his way. \u201cThe tracks are fresh. I must be getting close.\u201d He ran up ahead a short ways, only to stop and duck behind some cover before scanning the area. \u201cThough focused on his prey, the hunter must also be mindful of his surroundings. For in this vast, untamed wilderness, there could be competition. Or worse\u2026 predators.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe-he.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes and set a hand to his ear. \u201cHark, what\u2019s that? Could it be the wind, or some foul creature with really bad teeth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, the hunter must be on guard.\u201d Dipper ran out into the open, weapon at the ready, and charged for his next hiding spot. \u201cThe hunter feel\u2019s wary. He\u2019s certain that he\u2019s being stalked, but from where?\u201d As he scanned his surroundings, he scratched under his loincloth, turning around so that any potential \u2018predators\u2019 could see what he was doing. Again he chose to ignore the giggling. \u201cHmm. The brave hunter knows of only one type of beast in this area that could be hunting him, but where is it? The beast is known for its less-than-graceful movements, big feet, and general lack of any kind of stealth ability, so how could it be hiding?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrr!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smirked at this reaction, though his pulse did race. He heard movement behind him and spun around. \u201cThough the hunter is brave and fierce, being tiny, in the dark, and knowing that some terrible creature is hunting you can make anyone nervous. Ahh! There it is again.\u201d He spun, this time following the movement in the dark for a short ways before losing track. Then it spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFee, fi, foe, fum! I smell the flesh of a yummy minizoram,\u201d boomed the beast in a low yet feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d Dipper nodded respectfully. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to do better if you wish to best me, monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMwahahaha! Tiny fool. You dare come into my territory and think that you\u2019ll walk out alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the general idea. Yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell too bad. Cuz I crave minizora flesh, and you, ain\u2019t goin\u2019, no-where. Haha-hahaaa!\u201d She sang in reference to one of her favorite movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was growing more anxious by the minute. The beast was moving more now, hopping from place to dark place. He held his weapon close as his vision could only reach so far, yet he couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face. \u201cTh-the hunter is not afraid. H-he will best you, vile demon. He will claim what is his and return triumphant to his sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a sister?\u201d said the beast, intrigued. \u201cMy yummy morsel has a sister? Heheheee. Tell me about her. Is she cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper wobbled his hand uncertainly while wearing a shit-eating-grin. \u201cEh. She\u2019s alright.\u201d He then felt a mighty thud just behind him, followed by a gust of hot air on his back. Knowing what was coming, he spun around to behold his doom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaaah! The giant face of the monstrous Mabel!\u201d Chin to the ground, her face was illuminated by one of the few lamps in the room, which casted some extra menacing shadows. Her eyes were wide with anticipation and her grin was fighting against her malicious persona. And Dipper knew, just beyond where he couldn\u2019t see, she most likely wasn\u2019t wearing anything more than underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for din-din.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster opened its mouth and stuck out its tongue, but Dipper wasn\u2019t having it. Spoon at the ready, he swatted the slimy appendage away and took advantage of the distraction to flee. \u201cNot tonight, big head.\u201d But as he turned to face ahead, he saw movement incoming through the darkness. \u201cOh no!\u201d He knew what it was and tried to duck by rolling underneath. It worked and the hand past right over him. Those agility tests were already paying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no fair!\u201d whined the monster. \u201cGet in my mouth.\u201d She stood tall and surveyed the area. In the attic, the space between the beds was littered with obstacles like stacks of books, discarded clothes, that one overturned nightstand, and anything else that gave her prey ample places to hide. \u201cGrr. I\u2019ll find you eventually, you little sweetie. Then we\u2019ll see who has the big head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll still be you,\u201d Dipper called from his hiding spot, immediately regretting his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning wide, her braces gleaming in the florescent light, Mabel stomped through the obstacles, but not so hard to disturb those down stairs. Breaking character, she casually observed, \u201cIt was nice of Grunkle Stan to install that extra insulation. Gives us more privacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially with how cheap he is,\u201d agreed Dipper. \u201cSay, why do you think the Shack is so Minizora accessible, anyway?\u201d He dared peek out of his book tent, finding Mabel\u2019s bent over backside wiggling in the air as she investigated somewhere else. Her panties were pink and frilly. And, from experience, he knew this pair to be especially soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. You should ask him some time.\u201d She lifted her head high and made a show of sniffing. \u201cI smell *sniff-sniff* minizora sweat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper lifted his arm and sniffed under his pit, but didn\u2019t smell anything. He might have said as much, if his cover hadn\u2019t been swiped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ha!\u201d Mabel lunged down for another grab, but a spoon smack to the knuckle made her retreat. \u201cEe! Ow, not so hard,\u201d she hissed while rubbing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you should be. With how strong you\u2019ve gotten, I might get nerve damage.\u201d She sucked in a shocked breath. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll have to get my finger amputated!\u201d With Dipper\u2019s deadpan upon her, she added in even greater distress, \u201cThen how am I gonna poke your tummy like the Burypills Flour Boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith nine other fingers, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Joke\u2019s on you. I only have seven other fingers. The thumbs don\u2019t count.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, that\u2019s pedantic even for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so does this mean I\u2019ve out-Dippered Dipper?\u201d she asked elatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cNo, but it does mean you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot\u2019ch\u2019ya!\u201d Again Mabel lunged, but this time she succeeded in scooping up the tiny boy. Beaming in triumph, she brought him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s cheating! We were in timeout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. I never called timeout, so it\u2019s fair play.\u201d Mabel waved dismissively as she opened her fingers, allowing Dipper to stand freely on her palm. It also let her more easily admire his barely clothed form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were hurt. That\u2019s an automatic timeout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh. That rule is only if <i>you</i> get hurt. I could break all my arms and legs and we\u2019d still be playing.\u201d She sounded almost bragging. \u201cUnless, of course, you chickened out and surrendered.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at her in defiance, Dipper\u2019s spoon was propped up by his side like a spear. He looked quite regal, and even a little photogenic. Careful not to disturb him, Mabel held her hand steady as she reached for her phone and took a picture. \u201cOh yeah. Very cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cI still say this win is illegitimate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got you now, so I don\u2019t really care,\u201d Mabel giggled cutely. \u201cSo then, <i>brave hunter</i>,\u201d she tittered again, \u201cwhat do you think I should do with you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Satisfied that the door was locked so that no one could intrude on their fun, Mabel decided to hold off on <i>devouring</i> her prey right away. Once they\u2019d cleaned up enough to avoid any nasty surprises in the morning, Mabel leaned back in bed and dropped Dipper on her sternum between her flat breasts, petting him gently as she hummed a soft tune to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, but this isn\u2019t exactly what I was expecting,\u201d Dipper thought aloud, risking ending this relaxing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it, I\u2019m cute, kittens are cute, and since kittens like to play with their food, I figure I should try doing the same. I\u2019ll push you around a little before I\u2019m ready for the real fun. It\u2019s like foreplay, only better because you\u2019re also small and cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting logic,\u201d Dipper observed as she started poking around his loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you went on that whole big adventure without me. You must\u2019ve been so scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first, yeah. The manotaurs made Manly Dan run away screaming. But once you stop and talk to them, they\u2019re really not all that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept with the Multibear,\u201d Mabel reminded coldly. In her mind, all bullies were undeserving of any respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. They were bullies, but other than that, they were alright. Pretty easy to manage once you know how to manipulate them.\u201d Dipper lifted his hand and grabbed Mabel\u2019s finger. She stopped immediately, likely expecting him to say he wanted to get up or something. Instead, he just ran his hand along her digit, petting her in return as they both stared up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is nice, just the two of us,\u201d Mabel hummed contentedly. \u201cSo did you really talk to a wolf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a talk. More like a moment of shared understanding. I can\u2019t really explain it, though. We just sort of\u2026 clicked, and then went our separate ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blew a raspberry. \u201cBoo. I would have pet it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I got to go on the big adventure of self-discovery in nature while you got to stay home and ship Stan. Did that actually work out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so, but it was still fun.\u201d Then Mabel recalled something. \u201cYou know, Stan said some things about minizora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Dipper asked, bracing himself for something stupid, offensive, or both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He said that when minizora have loving families, they tend to get overprotective, which just stresses them out a lot. He said that a little distance can be good for both of us, making you feel less stifled and me less worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper craned his neck to look up at Mabel, awed by such insightful words from the con man. \u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \u201cAt first I was just doing stuff with Stan to take my mind off you. He kept saying you\u2019d be fine and I believed him. Honestly, it was kind of nice being able to do stuff without you for a change.\u201d It sounded like a hard confession. Mabel lifted her head to look down at the boy on her chest, eyes apologetic. \u201cAnd you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it was kind of the same for me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever run so far on my own in my life. It was freaky at first, not having you as my safety net, but then it got exciting. I did all that amazing stuff on my own. I proved I could, and now I feel a lot tougher for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel then poked under his armpit, making him giggle. \u201cYou\u2019re still a scrawny minizora, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being allowed to push her finger away and getting his laughter under control, Dipper sighed. \u201cI still missed you, though. It was nice doing stuff by myself, but the whole time I kept thinking about you. What you\u2019d say if you saw me doing that stuff. How the manotaurs would try to stop you from stopping me.\u201d He snickered and rested his head back on her chest. \u201cMabel vs. a pack of thirty manotaurs. Seems like an even fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m glad to have you back, too. I\u2019m also glad you kept your new underwear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a loincloth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cute and makes you look like an authentic jungle boy. Now if we could only get you a tan so you\u2019re not so pasty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s your fault. You\u2019re the one always covering me up whenever it gets too hot out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. Old habits are hard to break, especially for a big sister looking after her baby brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle,\u201d Dipper asserted flatly. \u201cI tolerate being called little, but I draw the line at baby. I was born first, remember. So technically-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Mabel cut in authoritatively, \u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> the big sister. Always will be. And you\u2019ll always be my adorable itty bitty wittle bwo-bwo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep up the baby talk, and I\u2019ll go find the spoon and smack you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel laughed. \u201cSure. Go ahead. I\u2019ll wait, wittle bwo-bwo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cEh, too tired. Bed\u2019s too soft.\u201d He yawned. \u201cRemind me to do it tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel yawned as well and flipped off the last light. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grunkle Stan had cleared out the big room over on the side of the Mystery Shack to get things ready for the party. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s birthday or anything. Stan just hoped that presenting himself as a fun loving guy would make him look more trustworthy, which in turn would make it easier for him to con people. Once the old man got sick of the kids just fooling around with silly string, he sent them to his personal copy machine to print out some flyers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel threw the tarp off the old machine. When Stan had said that he\u2019d \u201cfixed it up,\u201d he apparently meant that he\u2019d slapped some duct tape in random places and didn\u2019t even bother to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is a fire hazard just waiting to happen,\u201d Dipper commented as parts sparked. \u201cDoes it even work?\u201d Clambering up to the controls, he tried messing with the buttons while Mabel rested her arm on the scanner. The machine roared to life and scanned the arm. And after belching out a cloud of black smoke, a sheet of paper was produced with the arm on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, success,\u201d Mabel cheered, holding the paper in one hand and a cup of soda in the other. \u201cHey, want to copy our butts next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gave his sister a no-nonsense scowl and crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with you, Mabel.\u201d Then, just as her smile started to fall, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s like asking if I want to breathe. Of course we\u2019re copying our butts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s joy was short lived as the paper began to move on its own and crumbled. She dropped it and backed up to a safe distance, grabbing Dipper along the way. The paper continued to shimmer, wrinkle, and flatten itself on the floor until the black-and-white image became colored. The arm swelled until it popped right off the paper, now three dimensional and capable of autonomous movement. Reaching out as though in silent pain, it started to crawl towards the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, stay back,\u201d cried Dipper, jumping out of Mabel\u2019s hand and positioning himself between her and the arm. There was something almost poetic about his enemy being a copy of the very thing that had always brought him such comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack you fiend!\u201d Not knowing what else to do, Mabel splashed her drink onto the arm. It sizzled, bubbled, and then dissolved completely, leaving nothing behind but a puddle of soda mixed with liquefied paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh! Mabel, I think this copier can copy human beings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sucked in a breath and got down to her brother\u2019s level. \u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d But before he could answer, she sprayed him with silly string. \u201cHe-he, you let your guard down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper waved his arms frantically as he dug his way out of the pink substance. \u201cCome on, Mabel. This is serious. This is like, like an actual cloning machine. It just did your arm, and it moved on its own. Severed arms aren\u2019t supposed to move on their own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re right.\u201d Then Mabel looked thoughtful; a dangerous expression on such a cute face. \u201cSo does this mean we\u2019re not going to copy our butts anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know.\u201d Dipper admitted. \u201cHmm. Let\u2019s think about this for a second. This isn\u2019t some wild animal or sapient phenomenon like the last few times. This is just a machine. It can\u2019t do anything without someone to turn it on. It copies people, but since Grunkle Stan\u2019s had it for years and never noticed anything weird, it must also work on paper just fine. And apparently things supernaturally copied can be destroyed with just a bit of soda, so as long as we keep some nearby, we can keep things under control. If this were an SCP, it\u2019d probably be considered safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hearing a no~ho,\u201d Mabel sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that brings up the ethical questions,\u201d Dipper continued, starting to hyperventilate. \u201cAre these things alive? Do they feel pain? If I copy my face, is that a person? Did I just create a person without a body? How long could something like that survive? There\u2019s just so much we need to consider before-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late!\u201d Mabel was sitting on the copier, skirt up and panties around her ankles. The machine buzzed to life, but at least produced a copy without any black smoke this time. As before, the paper crumbled and shimmered until the copied part popped right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. That\u2019s your butt alright,\u201d deadpanned Dipper. He\u2019d recognize that thing anywhere, though it was more than just her butt. It was Mabel\u2019s cheeks, taint, slit, a couple of flailing stumps where the legs should be, it went up about an inch past her hips, and all encased in her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this is amazing,\u201d Mabel awed, picking up her own bottom. *Pfft* \u201cEw, it farted on me, hehe,\u201d she was having too much fun to be grossed out as she started dancing with her disembodied pelvis. \u201cOh wait, no. I farted on me, haha. This is great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is wrong on so many levels. I don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d Dipper grumbled. \u201cDoes that thing even have a stomach? Where did the gas come from for the fart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, Mabel wasn\u2019t listening. She\u2019d taken to feeling up her clone segment, which was apparently very interesting. \u201cOooh! I\u2019m so soft and squishy. Hmm. A bit too squishy right here. Dipper, am I fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all the running from monsters we\u2019ve done, I don\u2019t think we could be out of shape if we tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good. But what\u2019s with this smell?\u201d She pressed her nose in between the stumps. \u201cIs that how my kitty always smells? Here, you check.\u201d Whether deliberate or by accident, Mabel dropped the clone ass right on top of her tiny brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just discovered cloning and you want me to smell your clone\u2019s butt?\u201d Dipper asked incredulously as he was pinned down by the familiar set of soft, warm cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot my butt, my kitty. I want to make sure it doesn\u2019t smell weird. You know, for hygiene purposes,\u201d she added bashfully. \u201cYou smell me all the time, so you\u2019d know what\u2019s different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes and took a nasal inhale. \u201cIt smells fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just like it always does, which I\u2019m pretty sure just raises more questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Mabel agreed. \u201cFor example: if I wanted to go out and make sure you weren\u2019t kidnapped by crazy bull monsters with weird penises, would this make a good cage?\u201d she asked while patting the clone\u2019s butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, I wasn\u2019t kidnapped. It was voluntary. Secondly, we both know you\u2019d sooner shove me in your own underwear before using\u2026 whatever that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. True.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thirdly, how are you being so calm about this!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you're overthinking things, which leads to stress. While I go with the flow,\u201d Mabel bragged, \u201cwhich leads to sunshine and peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s eye began to twitch. He hated when Mabel used actual logic against him instead of Mabel logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnore the printer and party?<br>\r\nKeep playing with the printer?<br>\r\nTake a break to 'destress'? *hint-hint*</span></div></div>",

They\u2019d wait until things were less busy around here so that they could \u2018experiment\u2019 in peace. In the meantime, Stan was giving out tasks for the party. Soos was the DJ and, because Mabel wanted to try and make some new friends, Dipper volunteered to man the ticket booth with Wendy. And given that they\u2019d have to stay there, together, all night, it was the best possible scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dog, you,\u201d Mabel teased when they were back up in the attic, poking Dipper\u2019s shoulder as he straightened his bowtie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, you obviously have a thing for Wendy. You couldn\u2019t have been more desperate when you agreed to be with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Whatever. But I\u2019ll have you know that I have a plan to make sure my night with Wendy goes perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlan?\u201d Mabel whined her disappointment. \u201cYou\u2019re not making one of those overcomplicated listy things, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say overcomplicated, but I say thorough.\u201d Dipper extracted a piece of paper from his vest and unfolded it until it was three times his size. \u201cStep one: get to know each other with playful banter. Banter is like talking, but smarter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo smart it loops right back around to being stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, see, this isn\u2019t banter. This is what I\u2019d like to avoid with Wendy. The last step will be asking her to dance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, you and me talk like regular people, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to avoid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, little brother.\u201d Mabel shook her head, sat down, and gently set him on her knee. \u201cAllow me to impart my wisdom. You see, back before I learned that Gideon was a horrible, horrible monster who deserves to suffer and die alone,\u201d she explained cheerfully, \u201cwe would just talk and do things we both liked. I\u2019d say whatever came to mind, he\u2019d comment, and we just went back and forth like that. That\u2019s what I liked about him. He was easy to talk to. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be looking for tonight with friend making; people I can talk with. Whatever happens with Wendy, I guarantee the real first step isn\u2019t banter, it\u2019s talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was speechless. What could he say after a lecture like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased by his reaction, Mabel touched under his chin to close his jaw. \u201cRemember we agreed to trust each other with our love lives? I\u2019ve done my part and given my opinion. It\u2019s up to you to make the final choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the party finally got underway, things went about as well as could be expected. Soos was goofing up picking the right sound effects, Stan was charging an exit fee, Mabel was optimistic as ever, Dipper was mortified that his sweaty pits would stain his shirt, and Wendy played it cool despite having similar worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ticket stand was surprisingly packed, keeping the two pretty busy. Telling himself that Wendy was less scary than the Multibear, Dipper decided it was on him to break the ice. \u201cSo, uh\u2026\u201d His mind blanked. Crap-crap-crap! He had to say something. Anything! \u201cUh\u2026 have you ever heard of a Multibear before?\u201d <i>Why!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, did my dad tell you that one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He\u2019s got all kinds of stories about the stuff he claims to see out in the woods.\u201d Wendy tapped her fingers as she listed them off. \u201cThe Multibear, gnomes, tiny deer, a magic mailbox\u2026 Oh, my favorite is the Hide Behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper touched his chin in thought. \u201cThat sounds familiar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s this thing dad\u2019s never actually seen. No one has, because it always hides behind stuff whenever people look its way. The only proof that it\u2019s even there are its weird footprints and this buzzing sound it makes as it follows you,\u201d Wendy laughed. \u201cCan you believe that? It\u2019s a monster that just trolls people, following them and freaking them out. Man, if I were a monster, that\u2019s what I\u2019d want to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting. You wouldn\u2019t want to be, like, a mermaid or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, dude. Mermaids live in the ocean, which is, like, half fish piss. That\u2019s gross,\u201d she snickered as Dipper did the same. \u201cBesides, the only thing they wear is seashell bikinis, and I don\u2019t really have the figure for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you do,\u201d blurted the tiny before he could stop himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-ho, no. You\u2019re not getting out of this that easily.\u201d Her attention fully on Dipper, Wendy still managed to trade tickets for money and count the change. \u201cYou definitely said something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prove that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy glowered, trying to look menacing as she loomed over the puny child. With Dipper unflinching, her fa\u00e7ade lasted a whopping couple of seconds before she descended into giggles. \u201cWow, dude. You\u2019re really something, ya know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I mean, if I were your size, and someone this big was trying to push me around,\u201d she gestured to herself, \u201cI\u2019d probably start squealing inside an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. You\u2019re way tougher than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You could easily go an hour and a half.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to let such impudence stand, Wendy set her fingers in prime flicking position right beside Dipper. She waited, giving him a chance to tell her that this wasn\u2019t okay. With his defiance holding fast, she carefully delivered a flick to the back of Dipper\u2019s head, which he laughed off. \u201cWatch that mouth of yours, little man. You never know what kind of mess it might get you into.\u201d She got back to work, not hating it nearly as much as she\u2019d expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her attention back on the customers, Dipper allowed his eyes to crawl up and down the red head\u2019s body, focusing on a couple potential messes he wouldn\u2019t mind getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the party hall, Mabel was taking a break after shaking what her momma gave her. Upon seeing something interesting, she took her own advice and said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve got an animal on your body! I\u2019m Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrenda was a big girl. Not fat, as it was clearly all muscle. Her arms were about as thick as Mabel\u2019s torso and she was about a head and a half taller to boot. She was also a bit more developed chest wise. Her voice was pretty deep, but Mabel found it cute. Beside her was Candy. She was tiny, Korean, and had an even cuter voice, which for some reason Mabel pictured coming out of an elongated rainbow horse thingy. She had a bunch of forks strapped to her fingers which she used to eat popcorn. \u201cImprovement of human being,\u201d she\u2019d called it. And just like that, Mabel knew she\u2019d found her people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Soos made an announcement of a party crown award, for some reason bad girl music started playing. Coincidentally, a blonde girl and her cohorts approached the stage. She wore hoop earrings and mostly purple attire, her hair was teen pageant huge, and Mabel\u2019s eye twitched when she saw the size of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe most popular girl in town, Pacifica Northwest,\u201d informed Candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always feel bad about myself around her,\u201d Grenda added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifica was demanding that the crown simply be given to her, but Soos insisted that it be a competition. \u201cHa, who\u2019s going to compete against me, Pacifica?\u201d she asked, taking a microphone and gesturing into the audience. \u201cFork girl? Thunder thighs?\u201d She and her cronies laughed, although they were the only ones. Everyone else just stood by, looking helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ll compete!\u201d Mabel exclaimed, ever the picture of glee, although internally was a different matter. She\u2019d just decided to like Candy and Grenda, which made Pacifica\u2019s comments unacceptable. However, she was still willing to give the bleach blonde a chance and offered the hand of friendship. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifica looked at the offered hand like it had just come out of the sewer. \u201cHa, that sounds like a fat old lady\u2019s name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI choose to take that as a compliment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifica\u2019s grin grew smug. She knew she had this in the bag. \u201cMay the best partier win.\u201d Then she and her cronies danced a retreat into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel waved goodbye. \u201cNice meeting you\u2026 dead girl,\u201d she added under her breath, much to the approval of her new friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNo way. You\u2019re full of it,\u201d Wendy waved dismissively, showing excellent multitasking by taking people\u2019s money while finding the time to talk to Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not. I could totally take the Multibear,\u201d asserted the minizora. At his size, he had to run around the table to get the tickets and the money where it needed to go. This was probably a job one big person could do by themselves, but he was content just being on support if it meant talking to Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right. Dad said he once saw the thing use deer antlers to pick its teeth. How would you deal with something like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smirked. \u201cEasy. See, the Multibear\u2019s weakness is its many heads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, like a hydra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. See, all the heads share control over all the limbs. Normally they\u2019re mostly in harmony, but distract them with enough pain, like by kicking it in the balls, and you can trick the lesser heads into beating themselves up for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man!\u201d Wendy laughed, wiping tears from her eyes. \u201cYou are too much, little man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I\u2019ve always thought of myself as just the right amount.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Dipper, Wendy\u2019s filter was working perfectly fine, which she used to stop herself from making an age inappropriate joke. Not for his sake, but there were some little kids and their parents buying tickets, and she\u2019d have preferred to avoid a lecture. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had this much fun while on the clock and not ditching. All in all, everything was going perfectly fine, which was why things had to go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie showed up. With his usual aloof attitude, he said, \u201cHey Wendy. So there\u2019s this lame dance going on. Care to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gee, Robbie, I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019ve kinda got a job to do out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie scoffed. \u201cSince when do you care about work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know.\u201d It was a fair question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, babe.\u201d He extended his hand. \u201cShorty here can take on ghosts. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine by himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know. Dipper?\u201d She turned to the minizora, eyes full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been the easiest thing in the world. Easier than failing to fly. Dipper need only say that he needed Wendy\u2019s help, or that he wanted her to stay. Both were good, though the former was less embarrassing. He just had to give some indicator that he didn\u2019t want Wendy to go, and she wouldn\u2019t. Easiest thing ever. \u201cNah, I\u2019m good. If you want to dance, then go for it.\u201d In his head, Dipper proceeded to scream every expletive in the English language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he\u2019s sure,\u201d assured Robbie before pulling Wendy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dipper swore at himself, he paused in selling tickets long enough to climb up the wall and peek through the window. Wendy looked to be having fun, dancing with Robbie. The minizora returned down to the table about a second before Wendy turned a concerned look back towards the window, her dance moves less energetic than usual. Had their eyes met, maybe they\u2019d have realized a thing or two. But since that didn\u2019t happen, things inevitably got crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take Dipper long to reach the (il)logical conclusion. Grunkle Stan wouldn\u2019t allow him to back out on his promise, but he was allowed bathroom breaks. He took advantage of this loophole to make for the copier and laid himself on the scanner. The clone was almost completely identical in both behavior and appearance. The only obvious difference was that his colors seemed slightly muted and his hat lacked a pine tree. They even thought alike, agreeing to the name Tyrone after Dipper drew a 2 on the clone\u2019s hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after agreeing to the plan that Dipper remembered that he\u2019d seen this clich\u00e9 before and how it always went sideways. \u201cHey, we\u2019re not gonna get jealous and turn on each other like the clones in the movies, are we?\u201d But Tyrone assured him that Dipper could trust himself, and also that he could just be disintegrated with soda, demonstrating a terrifying lack of self-preservation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever. With Tyrone manning the ticket stand, Dipper was free to enter the dance floor. He was immediately reminded why he generally hated dancing. The music was so loud that it drowned his voice out and people were so focused on wild movements that they ignored anything or anyone that might be underfoot. In under a minute, he\u2019d suffered 17 encounters with shoes, scuffing his vest. He only barely made it to the chairs for cover when his phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey buddy. It\u2019s me, you,\u201d Tyrone said. \u201cI just now remembered why we hate dancing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s terrible. I can\u2019t even get near Wendy and Robbie\u2019s showing off his guitar. Ahh! Now they\u2019re sitting on the couch. We\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d That\u2019s when he noticed a bicycle. \u201cI just got an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got the same one, but we\u2019re gonna need help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, how are you calling me?\u201d Dipper asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the same phone, so shouldn\u2019t it have the same number?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea, man. Might want to tell Grunkle Stan about it, though. Selling clone machines for cheap could bring in some extra money, so long as he\u2019s honest about them dissolving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dipper was spiraling with the clones, Mabel was dealing with her own challenge. It had come to the singing part of the competition and Pacifica had just delivered a beautiful solo. Mabel might have been moved to tears, if the blonde bitch hadn\u2019t just said more mean things about her new friends. Her counterattack involved the eightiesest, crowd pleasingest, rock balladest song at Soos\u2019 disposal. And with the passion she put into those words, the crowd had no choice but to love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Dipper set his plan in motion, having several of his clones steal Robbie\u2019s bike and having the stupid emo wannabe give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, that sucks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper!?\u201d Wendy asked in alarm of the minizora on the couch arm. She couldn\u2019t see too well in the dim light, but it looked like his vest had been scuffed. Did he seriously risk getting stepped on just to bail on selling tickets? More so, Wendy felt a knot form deep down in her gut. She\u2019d just left the little guy alone with all those strangers. Who knows what could have happened. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got someone to cover me. It\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, okay,\u201d she agreed uncertainly. Wendy chose to trust Dipper\u2019s judgement. He knew more about being a minizora than she did, so if he thought he was alright in here, then she had no room to argue. The music then shifted to something soft and smooth, perfect for romantic dancing. \u201cOh man, I love this song.\u201d Still sitting, Wendy swayed to the beat, trying to focus on relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, goofus,\u201d Mabel greeted. The competition was on hold, so she decided that her services as a big sister were needed. \u201cNow\u2019s your chance to ask-mmm.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper needed to use both hands to seal his sister\u2019s lips shut. He then allowed himself to be carried out of earshot before releasing his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s responsible for this?\u201d Tone dangerous, Mabel pointed to the scuff marks around his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one. I, uh, didn\u2019t see their faces.\u201d Dipper waved his hand, wanting to hurry things along. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to make a scene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, whatever. But this is your chance to ask Wendy to dance. Come on. Gooo!\u201d Whisper cheering, Mabel set her brother back down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right,\u201d Dipper agreed. Being set back down, he started marching forward like a malfunctioning robot. What happened to the easy talking he\u2019d been doing earlier? <i>Dammit!</i> Fortunately, the teeny actually managed to make it back to the couch. Unfortunately, thinking that he was still with Mabel, Wendy got up and went elsewhere. <i>Double dammit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his plans falling apart all around him, Dipper proceeded to spiral further out of control with his clones. There were clones to manage the music, to keep an eye out for Robbie, and in general take control of all factors on the dance floor to ensure optimal dancing conditions. And as the old saying goes, the more complicated something is, the easier it is to break.</span></div></div>",

With everything set exactly as he believed it should be, Dipper headed for his own position, only to run into\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy? Wh-what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust waiting for the bathroom, dude.\u201d Leaning casually against the wall, she then got a wicked idea and adopted a playful smirk. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to try sneaking a peek under the door, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wh-what!? N-no! No, I would never do anything like that to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to me, huh? So other girls, then? Am I not good enough for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands balled into fists, Dipper\u2019s whole body began to shake as he turned redder than a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey. Chill, little dude.\u201d She knelt down on one knee and began stroking his back as she\u2019d seen Mabel do. \u201cI was just kidding around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s breathing evened out and he returned to his regular color. \u201cYou know I\u2019d never do that though, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, man. I know you\u2019re better than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good as that was to hear, Dipper still found himself staring at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s smile also fell as it finally clicked. \u201cSomeone told lies about you, didn\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper adjusted his hat so that his face was hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving a sigh, Wendy sat herself down beside the little man. \u201cMa always told me to never listen to what dumb-asses had to say. If they can\u2019t see how great you are, then just let \u2018em stew in their own misery, because that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. They\u2019re just a bunch of miserable losers with nothing going for \u2018em except bringing others down to their level. Don\u2019t let \u2018em, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would you know about it?\u201d Dipper grumbled, suddenly not so enthused about dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was a little upset by his tone, but decided to let it slide. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to have my head shoved in a toilet, for one. I also know what it\u2019s like to have a bunch of scum bags talk behind my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rubbing his arm against his eyes, Dipper finally lifted his hat to look up at Wendy. \u201cYou?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she laughed uncomfortably. \u201cBelieve it or not, grade school was pretty much hell for me. Every day it was some new rumor, pushing in the hallway, stealing my homework, you name it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. My dad could beat up any other dad in town and ma could\u2026 Uh, the point is that I didn\u2019t want to bother them. My folks were my heroes and I didn\u2019t want to let them down by looking weak.\u201d As Wendy explained, indulging in memories she\u2019d tried to bury, she felt her own eyes start to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only thing I could do.\u201d Windy downed half of her drink. \u201cI found someone weaker than me, and then I beat the shit out of the shits who were beating him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s cheeks swelled like a frog\u2019s as he contained his surprised laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was the damndest thing. For some reason I could never stand up for myself, but it turned out a lot easier to stand up for others. I started fighting back and, of course, only then did the school take notice. My folks were called, but I never got it too bad. Pretty sure they suspected what was going on, but were letting me handle things my way.\u201d Wendy chuckled quietly to herself. \u201cSo I kept getting into fights until the bullies got the message and backed off. That\u2019s actually how I met the crew. We were all getting pushed around, but together we were able to start pushing back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, you\u2019re\u2026 amazing,\u201d Dipper said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, dude. You\u2019re amazing. You stood up to a pair of ghosts while I was cowering in a soda machine. You really think those shitty people who lied about you could do better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAverting his gaze, Dipper started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo keep that in mind the next time people start talking shit about ya.\u201d With her fist, Wendy gently pushed against Dipper\u2019s side. \u201cDon\u2019t let the bullies bring you down to their level, man. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll really lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last the bathroom door opened and out stomped a very irate blonde girl in purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeesh, finally! Been holding it in for ages.\u201d Wendy set down her drink, stood, and entered, but paused before closing the door. \u201cOh, and Dipper. Just so we\u2019re clear, if I catch you peeking, I\u2019m flushing you.\u201d They shared one more laugh before she departed. In truth, she had no idea what she\u2019d do. Would she just pretend not to notice? If she did catch him\u2026 She\u2019d overheard Mabel talk about punishing him more than once. Maybe, with Mabel\u2019s permission, she could-<i>No! Nope! Bad brain. Don\u2019t go there!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Dipper felt like a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He and Wendy had just made a real connection. Nothing could ruin this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Dipper,\u201d snapped Tyrone. He was being flanked by several other clones, all looking most displeased. \u201cWhat are you doing here? We\u2019re already 42 seconds behind schedule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, the most amazing thing happened. I ran into Wendy by accident and we\u2026 we made a connection!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but not the plan,\u201d Tyrone dismissed, pulling out the list and reciting the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, is that what I sound like? Uh, guys, maybe we don\u2019t need the plan anymore. Maybe I can just talk to Wendy like a normal person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shut your whore mouth!\u201d accused 6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not going to stick to the plan, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be the Dipper who dances with Wendy,\u201d 5 suggested to the agreement of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, we said we weren\u2019t going to turn on each other,\u201d Dipper intoned, bracing himself to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we all knew we were lying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper held out his hands. \u201cHold on a second. Before this gets nasty, can I just say one thing?\u201d The clones seemed reluctant, but gave their permission. Dipper urgently pointed behind them and shouted, \u201cOh my god, a naked manotaur!\u201d As the clones screamed in horror, Dipper tried to make a break for it, but the others quickly caught up and overpowered him, dragging him off to be detained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alliance between the clones inevitably broke down as they began fighting for dominance. No one knew what to do anymore and some clones along the outskirts were still doing their jobs. Dipper, meanwhile, was able to take advantage of the confusion and herd almost all of the clones back to the bathroom hall. There he found and spilled Wendy\u2019s discarded drink, finally putting an end to 90% of his mess\u2026 by watching himself melt and cry out in mildly bummed pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am going to make my therapist a fortune.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The final break came as Mabel and Pacifica were awaiting the final song before the judging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPacifica, I just want to say that whoever wins, it\u2019s been a super fun party.\u201d Again Mabel offered the hand of friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, it thinks it\u2019s gonna win,\u201d condescended Pacifica. \u201cHey, you hear people clapping for the weird girl? Yeah, me neither.\u201d And she walked away, strutting like she owned the place, right out of Mabel\u2019s reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just made some new friends, Mabel was in an extra good mood. She didn\u2019t even really care about winning. What mattered was watching her friends smile as she stood up for them. Speaking of support, she just spied her oldest and most favoritest supporter of all time on the dance floor. \u201cHey! Hey, Dipper,\u201d she called, cup of soda in one hand and the other waving frantically as she ran over. Something looked weird about him. He seemed unusually stressed and maybe a bit off color. Did he bomb with Wendy? And why was he putting himself in needless danger out in the middle of the dance floor? \u201cWhat are you doing here without W-whoop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller twin tripped and fell with a low thud. No big deal. Dipper wasn\u2019t the only tough twin around and she\u2019d dealt with worse in just the last few weeks. Except down here on the ground, she was given front row seats to where her soda spilled. Her eyes went wide as the thing\u2019s form lost its cohesion quickly; its cries were more annoyed than pained. It was all over in just a few seconds and no one else saw a thing. Someone distracted by dancing even callously stepped in the puddle of remains like it was nothing. The thing that used to look like Dipper had been reduced to goop. Then there came a snapping sound as Mabel felt her smile grow wide. It was so big that it threatened to split her face in half. If it weren\u2019t for her eye twitching, Mabel would have looked like the happiest girl in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked herself up and brushed herself off. No big deal. She turned bodily towards the copier. There was something important that she needed to deal with, but no big deal. Mabel maneuvered her way through the crowd, not offering her usual words of encouragement as her eyes never strayed from her target. It was no big deal. Then, as music and general noise blared all around her, someone stepped right in her path. Okay, possible big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where do you think you\u2019re going, weirdy?\u201d demanded Pacifica haughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust got something to take care of. It\u2019s no big deal,\u201d Mabel answered, sounding distant. She tried to move around, but her path was blocked yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, I knew it. Weird girl knows she can\u2019t win, so she\u2019s chickening out before she can suffer a humiliating defeat. I don\u2019t blame you, really,\u201d Pacifica said while examining her nails. \u201cIt\u2019s to be expected when you go up against\u2026 Hey, get back here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust gotta take care of something,\u201d Mabel said, still smiling and distant. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifica snapped her fingers and her cronies blocked Mabel\u2019s path. \u201cNo one turns their back on Pacifica. Do you have any idea who I am?\u201d Then something extra unsettling happened. \u201cHey, why are you laughing?\u201d Mabel was chuckling under her breath. It was a low and sinister sound. The cronies could see her face, and so backed away. With her allies beating a slow retreat, the rich girl started to think that she\u2019d made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mabel giggled. \u201cI have no idea. Before today, I\u2019d never even heard your name. But let me tell you something about me.\u201d Mabel spun around, turning the full force of her glower on Pacifica, making the blonde pee a little. \u201cMy second week here, I killed, like, ten people. I threw a fire poker through a man\u2019s eye and tossed another man\u2019s sonnet spewing head into the fire. And as I watched him burn, you want to know what I felt? Nothing!\u201d Mabel\u2019s laugh was growing just a bit maniacal. \u201cI was content, because I cared nothing for those people. They got in my way and threatened my happiness, so I gave them what they deserved.\u201d She stepped into Pacifica\u2019s personal space; almost nose-to-nose and forcing the other girl to lean back. \u201cGuess who\u2019s standing in my way now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe,\u201d Pacifica squeaked like her lungs were full of helium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a smart bitch. And they say blondes are stupid. Hehe. So what do you think you should do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifica\u2019s answer was to fall backwards with a suspiciously heavy thud, eyes open but otherwise unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice.\u201d And Mabel turned back around. Except instead of resuming her mission, she looked into her new friends\u2019 eyes and felt her conviction waver. She\u2019d just shown the ugliest side of herself. Would they hate her for it? That was about the second or third most awful thing that could happen right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. My. Gosh! That was amazing!\u201d Grenda boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are everything I want to beee,\u201d Candy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s smiled remained, but softened a bit as she felt 20 lbs. lighter. \u201cThanks guys. I really needed to hear that right now. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, there\u2019s a thing I need to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, can we come with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Share with us your secrets,\u201d Candy begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be delighted. It\u2019s always better to do things with friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Dipper was feeling a little down on himself. In all the commotion with the clones, he\u2019d lost track of Wendy. When he\u2019d found her again, she was talking and laughing with Robbie, seemingly having a really nice time. But as down as he felt, there was still a spark of hope deep down. He hadn\u2019t actually lost Wendy. She was still very much his friend. They\u2019d had a real talk, just as Mabel had said, and right now that was enough to satisfy him. Dipper decided that it would probably be a good idea to unplug the copier to avoid any future temptation. When he arrived, he was greeted with the most interesting sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDie! Die! Die!\u201d Mabel was standing on top of the machine, going nuts with a golf club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaa!\u201d Some big girl was absolutely waling on the poor contraption with her bare fists, ripping it to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe-hehehe!\u201d A Korean girl had burst out from one of the side compartments like a gleeful chest burster, miscellaneous wires in hand and laughing hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, even more frighteningly, all three girls came to a dead silence after Dipper sneezed. They all froze and stared at one another for a good long while. Dipper blinked and, in classic Weeping Angel fashion, all three girls manifested directly before him, chins on the ground, rears in the air, and staring transfixed at his tiny form. Their collective breath was hot and smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel broke the silence and pulled out a cup of soda. \u201cDipper, I swear to god, if you melt, I\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wha-ahh!\u201d The contents of the cup were dumped on the mini. \u201cHey, what was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <i>know</i> what,\u201d Mabel replied, eyes narrowing dangerously. Dipper didn\u2019t need to inquire further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. My. Gosh. He\u2019s so cute!\u201d Grenda gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to pick him up and keep him in my purse like a celebrity dog,\u201d Candy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst things first, girls. Dipper, these are my new girlfriends. Candy and Grenda.\u201d Mabel gestured to each of them. \u201cSecond things first. Are there anymore?\u201d Her tone grew low and dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Uh, no. No I got them all. At least\u2026 hold on.\u201d Dipper counted on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipperrr,\u201d Mabel growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, there\u2019s only one I can\u2019t account for. Wait, you didn\u2019t happen to-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I took care of it. Not by choice, but it\u2019s gone now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d asked Grenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat copy machine can copy people,\u201d Mabel blurted without a second thought. \u201cDoofus here said that we should be careful with it, and then made a bunch of clones behind my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, that sounds fun,\u201d whined Candy. \u201cWhy did we destroy it? I could have used a study buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause <i>somebody</i> broke his own rule, and now the game isn\u2019t fun anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Too bad,\u201d Candy said, not pressing further. \u201cWait. You hear that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four listened. There was quite the commotion coming from the main room, including the voice of Soos. \u201cAnd the winner is Pacifica!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe competition. I missed it!\u201d bemoaned Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d Candy soothed, petting the larger twin\u2019s hair. \u201cIt is fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You totally would have won if we didn\u2019t destroy this machine.\u201d Grenda gestured to the smoking hunk of metal. \u201cBut that was also pretty great. You\u2019re pretty great, Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you guys.\u201d Still on the floor, Mabel pulled the other two into a hug and they all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like a third wheel, Dipper cleared his throat. With his eyes he asked if he was allowed to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, bro-bro.\u201d Mabel grabbed him and stood, the others following. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you out of my sight for the rest of the night. It\u2019s the only way to make sure you don\u2019t try any more stupid stuff.\u201d There came a small explosion from the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure? Because I think it\u2019s-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t care!\u201d Mabel stuffed him into her shirt collar and led the charge back to the dance floor. \u201cCome on girls. This thing\u2019s going all night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it did. For a good many hours. Wendy eventually joined the other girls on the mostly cleared floor, feeling so much livelier than before. Mabel was even gracious enough to donate a few strands of her hair to wrap around Dipper\u2019s waist as a kind of lifeline while he boogied on her shoulder. So, in a way, Dipper and Wendy did get their dance.</span></div></div>",

Mabel was keeping herself entertained with nacho earrings and Stan was fighting the urge to road rage. However, the old man\u2019s anger turned into fear when he finally noticed all the horses and covered wagons. \u201cOh no. Not today!\u201d He started driving like a maniac, spouting a bunch of nonsense about getting away. As Mabel slipped and slid in her seatbelt, she pulled Dipper from his minizora car seat and pressed him tightly to her chest where he\u2019d surely be safer. When Stan finally stopped, encircled by some wagons, Mabel looked out the window and saw an adorable baby cow with a bell around its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good feeling about today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Pioneer Day. No longer fighting it, Grunkle stan got out of the car and explained. \u201cEvery year these yahoos dress up like idiots to celebrate the day Gravity Falls was founded.\u201d He then threatened to break Toby for talking with an accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins, however, were enthralled by the many attractions on display. Candle dipping, gold panning, and a marriage between a man and a woodpecker were the closest. As the twins got ready to enjoy the festivities, Grunkle Stan sent them off with a warning. \u201cIf you two come back talking like these people, you\u2019re dead to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a couple of preteens being forbidden from doing something even moderately fun, the unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a carpetbagger in the turnip cellar.\u201d \u201cWell hornswaggle my habbersack.\u201d They then spat on the ground and Mabel carried her brother off for fun and adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDead to meee!\u201d Stan shouted after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheriff Blubs was on a stage, welcoming everyone to the opening ceremony. Behind him and the deputy sat four people dressed in period appropriate attire. There was Pacifica, a little brunette girl half her age, and presumably their parents, all wearing self-satisfied grins. That\u2019s when Pacifica took the mic. \u201cHowdy, everyone. You all know me, Pacifica Northwest, great-great granddaughter of town founder Nathaniel Northwest.\u201d She gestured to the regal statue behind her. The audience applauded. \u201cNow if you\u2019ve got the pioneer spirit, we ask you to come on up and introduce yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gasped. \u201cI get participation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her shoulder, Dipper frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mabel. Isn\u2019t that girl kind of like your arch enemy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s water under the bridge,\u201d Mabel laughed. But as she ran up on stage, she stowed Dipper in her sweater collar where he couldn\u2019t be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifica held out her hand in welcome before looking. \u201cOur first newcomer is M-Mabel!?\u201d she squeaked and stepped back. \u201cWh-what are you-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s get this pioneer day started,\u201d Mabel cheered, turning the mic around for this next part. She whispered, \u201cLook Pacifica, I just want to apologize for what I said the other night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacifica remained frozen, barely even breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou caught me at a bad time and I said some things that were 100% true, but shouldn\u2019t have said out loud, so I\u2019ll make you a deal. Whatever this <i>thing</i> is between us, it stays between us. Friends and family are off limits. Break that rule, and I\u2019ll mess you up worse than infamous axe murder Lizzie Borden, got it?\u201d Her smile was the very picture of chipper the entire time, leaving not even Pacifica\u2019s family to suspect what was really being said. Then Mabel turned the mic back and started cheering \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d to the audience\u2019s delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally regaining her composure, and not wanting to look weak in front of her family, Pacifica scoffed. She convinced herself that this weird girl was just blowing hot air, though her terms seemed reasonable enough. No need to bring outsiders into their feud. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to break it to you, but Pioneer Day is for serious people, and you look and act ridiculous,\u201d she carefully mocked. She pointed to Mabel\u2019s sweater. \u201cI mean, a puppy playing basketball? Are you always this silly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I can be serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do have nachos hanging from your ears, hun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly feeling self-conscious \u2013 an unusual sensation for the taller twin \u2013 Mabel departed the stage, hand on her collar to keep her passenger from moving too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re actually listening to her,\u201d Dipper chided once they were out of earshot. \u201cYou\u2019re Mabel. You run through self-important twerps like her like copy paper.\u201d When Mabel sighed despondently, Dipper considered a new approach. \u201cHey, let\u2019s get you some old timey butterscotch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunkle Stan, meanwhile, had gotten into a bit of a mess. After losing his temper, he\u2019d been thrown into the stocks. There he met up with Gideon, who\u2019d finally felt well enough to walk around without a limp. The tiny troll hadn\u2019t yet perfected his next diabolical scheme and was just out to unwind and enjoy the day like everyone else. And with Stan helpless before him, Gideon decided that the best way to do so was to pelt the man with tomatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was happening, Mabel was sitting at the base of the statue, petting the little boy in her lap while scarfing down candy. \u201cDipper, can I ask you something. Do you think I\u2019m\u2026 silly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper wasn\u2019t sure what the right answer was, but decided to go with his gut. \u201cI know that you\u2019re caring, friendly, and can tough it out against people ten times your size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you to say, but you\u2019re my brother,\u201d she sighed and slumped in her seat. \u201cUgh, I knew it. The nacho earrings. The sweater. I thought I was being charming, but I guess people see me as a big joke.\u201d She then discarded the nachos, pulled off her sweater so that only her pink undershirt was left, and tied the purple fabric around her waist like a belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mabel. You love that sweater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did before Pacifica ruined it for me. Grr, she ruins everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo kick her butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s right, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper shook his fists with brotherly rage. \u201cPacifica! Why does she think being related to the town founder means she gets to treat everyone else like garbage?\u201d Looking up at the statue, Dipper\u2019s memory was jogged and he pulled out the journal to flip through its pages. \u201cWait, I think I remember reading something about Nathaniel Northwest. Of course, this is perfect!\u201d He held up the journal for Mabel to read the tiny print with him. The author speculated that Nathaniel wasn\u2019t the real founder of Gravity Falls and that the secret lay within a document taped to the page. However, the author had never been able to crack the code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gawked after unfurling the paper and beheld its many strange glyphs. \u201cOh man! If this cover-up is true, then it means Pacifica\u2019s whole family\u2019s a fraud. This could be a major conspiracy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cWait, conspiracies are super serious, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, definitely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen if I help you crack the code, then no one will ever call me silly again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smirked up at her. \u201cYeah, duh. Like there was a chance you wouldn\u2019t want to get involved in something like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery true. Plus you\u2019d need someone to reach the high shelves, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMystery twins?\u201d Dipper extended his fist for a bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you hated that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019m starting to accept it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel bumped his tiny fist and the pair were off, utterly oblivious to the eyes upon them as they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should things go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow the episode with the 'Mystery Twins'?<br>\r\nForget the episode and have fun at the fair?<br>\r\nIs there a second encounter with Pacifica?<br>\r\nSomething totally random?</span></div></div>",

All the records were old and almost nothing had been uploaded online, there was even an old timey projector, so they had to research the old fashioned way. Dipper was gung-ho with this plan, but Mabel struggled almost from the start. This kind of book learning had never been her strong suit. While he cross-referenced the symbols on the parchment to other old texts, she was trying to figure out if reading upside-down would help her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Dipper thought he\u2019d made a discovery. \u201cHmm. Maybe if we use fire, it might light up some hidden message!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious. Also, I made a hat,\u201d she bragged, pointing at the parchment now folded into a paper hat. Her sense of pride quickly fell after she\u2019d realized what happened. \u201cUgh, I just did something silly again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait. Mabel, you folded it into a map.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did?\u201d she took the hat off to examine it. Sure enough, there was a dotted line and an x and everything. \u201cWow, how lucky is that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot luck. It must be part of the code the author never figured out. Mabel, if we-\u201d But before Dipper could explore further, they were alerted to the ringing bell of the sheriff and deputy. Apparently they were looking for a couple of kids for \u2018secret reasons,\u2019 which they proudly boasted about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into stealth mode, the kids snuck out of the library and made for the destination on the map, the Gravity Falls Museum of History. It was easy enough to get in. Pioneer Day was their busiest day of the year, and they even gave out complimentary balloons. As best as Dipper could interpret, the next clue lay within some abstract triangular painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure this out quick. I don\u2019t think those cops were at the library to check out books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the one with the bell can read,\u201d agreed Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, the twins just stared at the painting in search of some elusive pattern. Sure enough, Mabel once more cracked the code by lying upside down on a bench, prompting Dipper to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou figured it out again, Mabel. You\u2019re on a roll!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, thanks. I think I\u2019ve seen that somewhere in the cemetery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Are you noticing a pattern here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, looking at things upside down isn\u2019t that big a deal. I would\u2019ve gotten here too eventually,\u201d he explained defensively. \u201cMore importantly, you folded the paper into a hat. And you did so in precisely the way that everything lined up to send us here. What kind of mad genius are we dealing with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sucked in a breath. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m a mad genius, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it does, then dad owes me $50,\u201d Dipper muttered. \u201cAt the very least it means that whoever wrote this document, you guys might be on similar wavelengths or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got right side up, but did so too quickly and suffered a momentary head rush. Mabel, ever the clumsy one, landed with Dipper squished beneath her butt. \u201cHehe.\u201d She then wiggled her rump around, feeling him squirm helplessly between her skirt-clad cheeks. \u201cYou alright, bro-bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dipper could deliver a scathing retort, the cops showed up. In a panic, Mabel clenched her butt cheeks together to hold Dipper in place as she ducked out of sight. Eavesdropping, she confirmed that the two were definitely after a pair of kids. She waited until their backs were turned and made a break for it; brother now in hand because running like that would have just been ridiculous. Luckily, the cops got stuck in the doorway and she made her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Pacifica decided to skirt the rules just a tad when she saw Stan still locked up. She offered to free him in exchange for him admitting that the Northwest family was the best in town. It\u2019d be like doing Mabel a favor, but in such a way that would surely piss her off. It was the perfect crime. Unfortunately, when she offered him paper so that she\u2019d have this confession in writing, Stan refused to cooperate and wrote something highly inappropriate. And with Mabel not around, Pacifica felt safe with plausible deniability as she set the tomato armed populace on the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the cemetery, the twins stopped by the statue of an angel with her hand extended and pointing at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mabel. Have at it.\u201d Dipper gestured up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve figured out all the other clues so far, so let\u2019s see if third time\u2019s the charm. <i>I</i> think the statue is pointing at the next clue, but how would Mabel solve this mystery?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. That\u2019s a good question. How would Mabel solve this mystery?\u201d Mabel nodded, attempting to look serious as she studied the finger. Her reputation was on the line and Dipper trusted her to figure things out on her own. She\u2019d hate to disappoint him. Then she got a funny idea, scaled an adjacent statue, and stuck the finger up her nose. \u201cAhh! She\u2019s picking my nose. Haha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a crack as the finger bent and the headstone beneath opened up to reveal a secret passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down into the deep dark cavern, Dipper blinked. \u201cThat was somehow not at all what I expected, but also exactly what I expected. Good job, Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Who\u2019s silly now, Pacifica?\u201d she challenged as she carefully extricated her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be you,\u201d Dipper stated flatly as he awaited to be picked up and set on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re on her side now?\u201d she asked, depositing him where he belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Mabel. Don\u2019t you see? Paper hat, upside down, picking your nose,\u201d he listed. \u201cThose were all silly things that were exactly what we needed. Your silliness is solving this mystery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! In that case, double take that, Pacifica!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust watch your step. A place like this is bound to have booby traps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel snickered. \u201cHehe. You said booby.\u201d She then glanced down at her chest. \u201cSpeaking of, do you think Pacifica\u2019s are bigger than mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, history changing conspiracy hunting isn\u2019t the time for that sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. It\u2019s silly, and I thought silly was solving the mystery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper threw back his head and groaned as his words were turned against him. \u201cMabel, some girls get lucky and develop early. Most of them get addicted to the attention and become haggard prostitutes by age 20. Your body will develop at its own pace, and you can laugh at Pacifica when you\u2019re still cute and she\u2019s half plastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s so sweet of-\u201d Mabel stepped on a switch that made a loud click and sunk into the floor. \u201cUh oh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne daring escape from some poison darts in the wall later, and the pair found themselves in a dusty old hall that might have been someone\u2019s study. There were shelves lined with books, all kinds of old documents, and even an old projector like they\u2019d seen back in the library. Mabel gravitated towards a folder labeled \u2018Classified: Do Not Read\u2019 in big red letters, and quickly got to reading, learning all sorts of secrets about America\u2019s (apparently) freaky leadership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ben Franklin secretly was a woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen that would also make him a lesbian,\u201d Dipper added. \u201cDude was a notorious whore monger, ya know. I always liked to think he \u2013 or I guess she \u2013 reincarnated as Winston Churchill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they found what they came here for. Nathaniel Northwest wasn\u2019t some great pioneer turned town founder, but a waste shoveling village idiot. Whoever wrote that line must have been pretty vindictive. Regardless, the true founder was Sir Lord. Quentin Trembley, III, Esq. But before the twins could investigate further, the coppers finally showed up, the tall one half covered in darts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins are captured, as following the episode's plot?<br>\r\nWendy steps in?<br>\r\nPacifica steps in?<br>\r\nGideon steps in?</span></div></div>",

Blubs even had a film reel in his hat that conveniently explained everything, despite this apparently being a matter of national security. Quentin Trembley was the 8th and a half president. Despite winning the 1837 election in a landslide, he quickly gained a reputation as America\u2019s silliest president for declaring war on pancakes, appointing 6 babies to the Supreme Court, and banning pants, among his more mild activities. He was booted out of office and disappeared into the valley that would one day be known as Gravity Falls. All records of him were erased with Harrison replacing him as president and Northwest as the town founder. Trembley\u2019s body was never found\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil today,\u201d Blubs finished, pointing to a large orange block containing the man from the film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s pretty - *Thwonk* - hey!\u201d Mabel cried. Her wrists and ankles had been handcuffed while she wasn\u2019t looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fool thought he could live forever by encasing himself in peanut brittle,\u201d Blubs explained mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s great and all, but why did you cuff me?\u201d Mabel demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne, because finding Trembley has been our special mission. Two, you two are under arrest for learning the secret. And three, because everyone has seen that video of you with Manly Dan, and that\u2019s just not something we feel like dealing with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I cuffed ya while you was distracted by the film,\u201d bragged deputy Durland. \u201cWe-hehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs upset as Mabel was, she had to shrug her acceptance at that last one. \u201cOkay, fair enough. So what are you gonna do with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing bad. Just gonna escort you and all this stuff back to Washington. You ain\u2019t comin\u2019 back by the way,\u201d Blubs informed frankly. \u201cSay, where\u2019d the little guy g-Ow!\u201d Blubs looked behind to find a dart sticking out of his behind. \u201cNow how did-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYouch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDurland!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe got me in the nose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell find him. He can\u2019t have run far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho says I\u2019m running?\u201d Dipper intoned threateningly. On a table near the wall, he\u2019d found himself a mini catapult. Beside it was a pile of darts that had fallen off of Durland. \u201cLet us go, or the next one\u2019s going right for the eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Dipper! Show no mercy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Blubs answered. The short fat guy grabbed a book and threw it towards Dipper, smashing the catapult. But just as the minizora jumped down in preparation for his next move, he\u2019d landed right in Durland\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou let my brother go right now, or I swear I\u2019ll go Black Knight and bite your legs off!\u201d snarled Mabel. Alas, her captors were not appreciative of the joke. It took several chains and a long stick with a hook before the cops felt safe enough to transport the little girl and her brother onto the train for their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper and Mabel were stowed away in a large wooden crate, along with the entrapped former president. Fortunately, Dipper had some old tools in his vest pocket and was able to unlock Mabel. Unfortunately, the box was sealed tight and the only hole in the wood was too small even for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I left a trail of candy wrappers,\u201d Mabel bemoaned, back to the wall as she slid down to the floor. \u201cThis is all my fault. Pacifica had me pegged all along. I\u2019m just a failure like that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Dipper shouted, stomping his foot down. \u201cI\u2019m sick of you talking about yourself like this. Why do you let her get to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know. She just has this\u2026 way of getting under my skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell stop it. You\u2019re Mabel Pines, remember. Your silliness got us into this mess, maybe it can get us out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would that work?\u201d Mabel demanded, staring down at her tiny brother as she absentmindedly ripped a chunk off of the presidential block, trying to drown her misery in sweets. In so doing, she set off a chain reaction that set the whole thing to crumble. With the block now in shambles, the perfectly preserved man inside finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Tis I, Quintin Trembley!\u201d And then he ripped off his pants in an impressive show of strength, leaving only his pantaloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Told you,\u201d Dipper declared his vindication, once more reciting all the silly things Mabel had done to get them this far. \u201cYou\u2019re not silly. You\u2019re brilliant! Just like this guy with no pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as smart as a pantsless president!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the two brilliantly silly people contrived an exquisitely silly plan of fitting through the tiny hole. It didn\u2019t work, but somehow it did cause the crate to collapse around them, which was also good. Afterwards, following a brief chase on the top of the train, Dipper managed to convince the cops that Quentin Trembley was still technically the president, who then ordered them to forget that any of this ever happened. Dipper then amended that the cops should actually report that the kids were a false alarm and Blubs was the one who really solved the case. Unfortunately, Trembley had been reduced to dust and there wasn\u2019t anything to send back. Most of the papers, however, would have to continue on their journey, though Dipper did snag a few of the juicier secrets for himself on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three returned to Gravity Falls, chatting the whole way as Trembley revealed a few more embarrassing secrets about the other presidents. But as a reward for their services, Mabel was appointed as a congressman, complete with a fancy top hat. Dipper was offered some supportive words for his efforts in uncovering the deeper secrets of the town, along with a limited edition negative 12 dollar bill and the Presidential Key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Pacifica, Mabel gave the girl a low-key heart attack when she ran over. Luckily, it was just so that she could brag about her amazingly implausible adventures and not because she was going to take revenge for her Grunkle. Alas, Pacifica wasn\u2019t buying it and promptly dismissed Mabel, sparing a brief glance towards Dipper as she huffed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was not amused. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell her about her great-great grandpa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, Dipper. I\u2019ve got nothing to prove. With your help, I\u2019ve learned that being silly is awesome.\u201d And she slipped her sweater back onto its rightful place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I haven\u2019t learned anything,\u201d Dipper huffed. Pulling out his smartphone, he quickly logged into his favorite conspiracy website and uploaded photos he\u2019d taken regarding the Northwests. It took the internet practically no time to go viral with the story. \u201cHey Pacifica!\u201d He whistled for her car to stop. \u201cCheck SecretConspiracies.com. Nathaniel didn\u2019t found Gravity Falls and your whole family\u2019s a sham. Deal with it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a second for the blonde girl to check her own phone and cry out in alarm. \u201cWhat!? Mom, dad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, meanwhile, was in awe of what he\u2019d just done. \u201cMan, revenge is underrated. That felt awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for looking out for me, bro-bro.\u201d Mabel picked up the minizora and planted a big wet kiss on his cheek. \u201cI can always trust you to have my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext episode?<br>\r\nSee what else there is to enjoy on Pioneer Day?<br>\r\nReturn to the Shack for some 'relaxation'?</span></div></div>",

It was, in his proud words, the cheapest fair money could rent. While he oversaw most of the work, including the rigging of certain attractions, he tasked the twins with slapping fake safety certificates on anything that looked too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12 o\u2019clock rolled around and Stan was living it up in the dunk tank. He was shouting at everyone who got near, pointing out their various physical flaws and making himself nice and hateable. Everyone bought balls to try and dunk the jerk, but the target was rigged to be effectively immovable, barring some supernatural phenomenon. Still, Stan was making a considerable profit from hurling insults at people, and couldn\u2019t be happier for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, meanwhile, had graduated to hand-holding with Wendy\u2026 sort of. They were now comfortable enough with each other for her to carry him around in her hand. Her open palm was pretty steady, calloused from hard work, but overall soft. It was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then he threw the book at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy snickered, holding her question mark shaped treat in the other hand. \u201cWhat, like locked you up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. First, he threw an actual book at me. I was too dangerous with that catapult,\u201d Dipper boasted. \u201cThat\u2019s when they caught me, and then I was locked up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shook her head and wiped away a couple of tears. \u201cYou\u2019re a riot, little man. You know, you should write all this down. It\u2019d make a great story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, totally. Going on all these adventures with all the supernatural stuff in town. I know I\u2019d get a kick out of it. Just one thing, though.\u201d Wendy\u2019s smile shrunk a tad. \u201cFor real, though. Did all this stuff really happen, or are you just weavin\u2019 a yarn?\u201d she asked in imitation of her mother\u2019s accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cEh, who can say? Multibears and presidents encased in peanut brittle? That stuff\u2019s about as silly as ghosts in a convenience store, and who\u2019d ever believe that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s eyes widened and she laughed nervously. \u201cHeh-heh, sure.\u201d Suddenly feeling awkward, she was relieved when her snack dripped on her shirt sleeve. \u201cAh, boo. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She set him down on the ground near a booth and went to get cleaned up. Once she found the wipes, she took a bit too long as she thought things over. \u201cHe can\u2019t be serious, can he?\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cI mean, dad always had those stories, but they\u2019re just stories, right? They can\u2019t be real. Then again, I did see ghosts with my own two eyes, so if they\u2019re real, then\u2026\u201d She slapped herself. \u201cNo, stop it, Wendy! You can\u2019t think about it like that. He\u2019s just a nice guy telling stories to make you laugh.\u201d She blinked upon recalling an awful truth. \u201c\u2026 exactly how dad started with mom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy\u2019s mom never got tired of telling the story of how she met up with her husband. He was as much a muscle head back in high school as today and she\u2019d initially dismissed him as beneath her. She\u2019d only gone out with him on a dare, but then he saved her after an unfortunate encounter with a mugger; unfortunate for the mugger, who was hospitalized for six months after having a whole car engine surgically removed. She gave him a real chance after that and started listening to what he had to say. The more she listened, the more she wanted to hear. And when he proved just as good a listener, it was inevitable that things got physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy usually tuned her mother out around that point, or at least tried to, but none of that was relevant now. \u201cMe and Dipper are just friends who liked to talk. I talk with all my friends. It\u2019s no big deal,\u201d she rationalized. \u201cExcept, is he being serious when he talks about all these adventures? Did he really face down monsters, showing off the same machismo that dad-\u201d *Fwack* \u201cNope!\u201d She slapped herself again. \u201cDon\u2019t go there, brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the concession stand, Mabel had moseyed up to her little brother with two hands full of cotton candy. \u201cLook at you two, being all romantic at the fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t\u2019 this amazing. I just dove in. I said \u2018Hey, want to hang out at the fair?\u2019 and she was like, \u2018Sure.\u2019 It totally worked. All your advice about just going for it. It\u2019s finally paying off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel shook her head with a self-satisfied smirk. \u201cWhen are you going to learn, Dipper? I\u2019m always right about everything.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cHey, do you smell a gallon of body spray?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie showed up, looking as forcefully indifferent as ever. \u201cHey, you dorks seen Wendy? I got some super tight jeans and thought she\u2019d wanna check \u2018em out.\u201d He planted his foot on a box and started flexing to the disgust of the preteens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, yeah. I think I saw her in the Bottomless Pit. You should really go jump in there,\u201d Dipper offered helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I will, smart guy,\u201d Robbie sneered. The teen looked like he was about to step on the minizora, but one look at Mabel\u2019s death glower made him realize that he liked living too much and he turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s a jerk with tight pants and a guitar. I need to keep him away from Wendy at all costs,\u201d Dipper reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel nodded. \u201cYeah. All you\u2019ve got are smarts, cutes, body odor that can\u2019t be smelled a mile away, and a loincloth. You don\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it easy there, bro-bro. Whatever happens, I\u2019ll be right here. Supporting you every step of the-Oh my gosh a pig!\u201d And just like that, the little girl ran off to the booth that was giving out pigs, leaving her littler brother alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was fine, though. He hooked back up with Wendy shortly after as she carried him over to one of the prize booths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, check it out. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a duck or a pig, but I want one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll win it for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet, dude, but these things aren\u2019t exactly minizora friendly.\u201d Wendy gestured to the balls that were bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. My uncle taught me the secret to these things. You aim for the carny\u2019s head and then take the prize when he\u2019s unconscious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Nice. Alright then.\u201d She set him on the counter. \u201cGive it a shot.\u201d She didn\u2019t think he could actually do it, but it seemed too mean to deny him the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Wendy didn\u2019t know was that there was this trick for minizora that Dipper had found online and been practicing ever since he heard about the fair. By stretching his muscles in just the right way, he could create a bungie effect that could easily meet carny standards. He just had to get his aim down. However, what Dipper didn\u2019t know was that this was a fixed point in the timeline. Specifically, this was the point that causality decided to dick around with him and Wendy. So when he threw the ball, it ricocheted back and smacked her right in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! My eye!\u201d It had swollen to an awful shade of purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortified beyond rational thought, Dipper ran off to fetch some ice. On the way back, some bald fat guy in a gray jumpsuit tripped over the ice and about crushed the minizora beneath his big fat butt. By the time the jerk regained enough sense to flee the scene; it was already too late as Dipper beheld the horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobbie, thanks. That\u2019s really sweet. The gesture and the flavored syrup,\u201d Wendy said as he pressed the frozen treat against her eye. But when he popped the question and asked her to go out, she answered far quicker than she\u2019d ever done before. She\u2019d had a number of boyfriends and liked Robbie fine, but deep down this seemed like the perfect out. If she had an actual boyfriend, then maybe her mind would stop drifting to those fantasies about tiny people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel came up to Dipper, overflowing with joy at the chance to show off her new pet Waddles. When Dipper gave no response, it didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out what had gone wrong. \u201cOh,\u201d she said while watching the teens run off together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the fair day was spent with mournful sighs as Dipper hardly even moved. Mabel tried everything from tickling, to funny sounds, and even dressing Waddles up in cute costumes that she already owned for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, do you ever wish you could go back and undo just one mistake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, bro. We could solve this in ten seconds flat if you just let me break the guy\u2019s legs,\u201d Mabel stated frankly as she played with Waddles. Alas, she was being ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean Wendy only went out with Robbie because he had the ice,\u201d rambled the minizora, \u201cand she only needed ice because of the baseball, and I would have had the ice if it weren\u2019t for\u2026 That guy!\u201d Dipper pointed at the fat guy in the gray jumpsuit. \u201cHey you, tool belt. You ruined my life!\u201d accused Dipper as he marched up to the oblivious man with Mabel close behind. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve seen you before. Have you been following us around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get in on this, Mabel added, \u201cAnd why are you bald? What\u2019s that all about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuttering something about a compromised position, the bald man fiddled with his watch and made his suit run through all kinds of bizarre colors and backgrounds. \u201cCome on, stealth mode. Aw, dang it!\u201d And he brought out a screwdriver to perform some adjustments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing,\u201d awed Mabel. \u201cAre you from the future or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat guy was starting to sweat. \u201cWh-what? No. Who told you that? Uh, memory wipe!\u201d He threw a blue cloth at Mabel\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just throw a baby wipe at me?\u201d Mabel asked, more surprised by the absurdity than angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man finally caved and spilled all his secrets. His name was Blendin Blandin, a time traveler from the year twenty shneventy twelve. His mission was to stop a number of time anomalies that were centered around this time and place, but he\u2019d yet to find any. When the twins professed skepticism, he demonstrated how to use his time traveling measuring tape by disappearing and reappearing in a completely new set of clothes. Ultimately, the poor guy seemed awful tired, so Dipper suggested that he take a break and enjoy some rides at the fair. Mabel even gave him her remaining tickets. The twins shared a knowing look as Blendin stripped off his belt and got onto a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrunkle Stan would be proud of us,\u201d Mabel snickered as she pilfered the tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Shack\u2019s dining room, the pair awed at the item that sat on the table before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it, Mabel, our ticket to any moment in history.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get two dodos and force them to make out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s go get some cute and tiny dinosaurs just before they die, force them to make out, and then we can have an army of adorable ancient lizards!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnn-maybe,\u201d Dipper allowed. \u201cLet\u2019s just do something small for starters. Like, for example, going back and fixing my baseball throw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea! Oh, and I can come too. That way I can relive the greatest moment of my life. Winning Waddles.\u201d She kissed the pig on the head and shot Dipper a coy look. \u201cJealous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora rolled his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time was rolled back by six hours. Perfect. Mabel re-won Waddles in no time flat and, just for kicks, admitted to the carny that she was a witch before he could even ask. Dipper, however, wasn\u2019t so lucky. The ball hit Wendy in the eye all over again and Robbie appeared to comfort her. Although he wondered if time might conspire to undo new outcomes, Dipper reasoned that all he really needed was to try again. So he did, and hit her in the eye. He tried again and again, changing every variable he could think of. Half the time he hit the milk bottles, a few times he hit the carny, but the end result was always the same with Wendy taking a baseball to the face; except for that one time where time decided to be extra dickish and pelt her with a whole sack full of balls. One time the ball knocked him into Wendy\u2019s cleavage, which was almost the best possible outcome, if it didn\u2019t somehow hit her eye a split second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dipper ran through the math, he realized that what he was missing was help. If he could just enlist Mabel to be in the right place at the right time, then he\u2019d be golden. In a good mood after more than a dozen wins with Waddles, she was fully onboard, confident that another win was in the stars for her. It worked! Dipper finally won the stuffed creature of indeterminate species without injuring Wendy. Granted, also ending up in her cleavage would have been a nice bonus, but this was still acceptable, especially now that Robbie lost his chance to ask Wendy out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper went on a few rides with Wendy, just enjoying himself as he sat in her hand, when Mabel came up screaming. \u201cHey, what\u2019s-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper and Wendy waited until Mabel finally calmed before trying again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe messed up the timeline. Pacifica saw the flyer and won Waddles before I could. She took Waddles, Dipper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimeline?\u201d questioned Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s, uh, nothing.\u201d Dipper motioned for Wendy to set him on Mabel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, I\u2019m real sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Mabel then took the time tape out of Dipper\u2019s vest pocket. \u201cWe just have to go back in time and do things-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, no!\u201d Dipper took the tape back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, does someone want to catch me up here, cuz I think I missed a step,\u201d admitted Wendy. \u201cTimeline? Going back? And who\u2019s Waddles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s my new pet pig,\u201d Mabel cried, too distressed to think as Dipper urged her to hush. \u201cOr at least he was supposed to be. We keep redoing the day and I\u2019ve won him, like, twenty times. But now he\u2019s gone and I gotta get him back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy blinked and then fixed her gaze on the measuring tape. \u201cOkay. Maybe there was something in the food I ate, cuz it sounds like you guys are talking about time travel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed nervously. \u201cWh-what? That-that\u2019s silly. Don\u2019t be silly, Wendy. Heh-heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, my bullshit meter is going off like crazy. You two better start talking sense or\u2026 or else I\u2019ll find Pacifica and take this pig for myself,\u201d she threatened, shaking a fist for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blinked. \u201cUh, yeah. I\u2019d be fine with that. So long as you bring him right back to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, why didn\u2019t you just beat up Pacifica and take Waddles yourself?\u201d Dipper demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had guards. Guards with tasers. You know I hate tasers. But with Wendy\u2019s help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh no, man. I\u2019m not getting tased again. Not after last time. Ugh. Can you please just tell me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, can you give us a moment, please?\u201d Dipper requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. One minute. But if I don\u2019t get a straight answer, I\u2019m chucking you both at the carny,\u201d Wendy growled and stomped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell her we\u2019ve got a time machine?\u201d Mabel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? And tell her what? That I went back in time a bunch just to stop her from dating Robbie? Mabel, listen to me. I\u2019ve done the math. In any other timeline, Wendy ends up going out with Robbie. I can\u2019t mess this up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if we don\u2019t go, then I\u2019ll lose Waddles forever!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Dipper could be an evasive little scamp when he really put his mind to it. And in the scuffle, the tape was pulled out too far, sending the twins hurling through time. When everything stopped tasting purple, it appeared that they were on some dirt road in an unfamiliar wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen are we?\u201d Dipper asked, brushing himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel beamed at the chance to smart off. \u201cThe real question is \u2018when\u2019 are w-oh. Oh you already said it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, same thing. Hey, do you hear that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel that.\u201d The twins turned to see an incoming stampede of buffalo. Screaming, Mabel grabbed Dipper and started running as fast as she could. She wasn\u2019t watching where she was going and ended up off a cliff, and luckily right into a covered wagon full of settlers dressed like they were ready for Pioneer Day. In this case, a pregnant looking woman with a half dozen kids of varying ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sent us back 150 years, genius!\u201d Dipper snapped, calming as he pinched the bridge of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of the dirty children in the wagon approached and pointed. \u201cHey look, ma. She\u2019s got one of them there tiny wingless fairies like what they got up in the cities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness!\u201d said the woman, cheeks flushed. \u201cAh\u2019ve heard about the\u2026 <i>skills</i> of you tiny folk. Might Ah interest you in stayin\u2019 a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper blushed, too paralyzed to speak. While the other boys in the wagon looked curious, all of the ladies looked <i>curious</i>. Mabel\u2019s grip on her brother grew possessively tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look, ma,\u201d said that same kid. \u201cThat girl\u2019s got silver in her mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are called braces.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, no! You can\u2019t go messing with the past.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mabel remembered her wrath. \u201cOh, says the guy who\u2019s spent all day messing with the past and cost me my pig? I\u2019ll mess with whatever I want.\u201d She pulled out a calculator and handed it to the dirty kid. \u201cCheck it out. A magic button machine. Shoes that blink.\u201d She stomped on the floor, making them light up to the awe of the settlers. And after promising the women they could vote in the future, she even taught them to high five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper tried to steal the tape back, but mistyped a button and sent them too far back. Before they could get eaten by a dinosaur, Mabel pressed buttons wildly until they were sent (presumably) too far forward. The setting could only be described as post-apocalyptic with cities in ruins, twin moons, an eerie green hue over everything, laser blasts everywhere, and a giant floating baby with an hourglass on his head shooting eye beams and laughing at those who stood in his way. Dipper managed to get them back to the right century at least, but Mabel was on the run. Their connection to the time tape meant that they were always the same relative distance apart, no matter where or when they ended up. They ran past the day at the lake with the Gobblewonker, past the wax museum reopening, past the gnome incident, and several more events they didn\u2019t recognize before ending up back at the Shack in a winter before the sign had gone up. The tape overheated and the pair disappeared in a flash of light, mere seconds before a man with a familiar face poked his head out the door to check on the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything stopped spinning, the two stumbled their way out of a portapotty, gasping for fresh air. They were back in the \u2018present\u2019, specifically the one where Wendy got the prize and Pacifica got the pig. Dipper then immediately scaled up the potty out of his sister\u2019s reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, give it up. It\u2019s over. I\u2019ve worked too hard for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about Waddles?\u201d she cried actual tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me and Wendy? I thought you said you supported us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Head hung low and heart in tatters, Mabel went over to the totem and started thumping her head to it, mumbling Waddles every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not guilt-tripping me, Mabel,\u201d Dipper intoned, though truthfully it tore him up to see her like this. \u201cCome on, Mabel. You\u2019re gonna forget about this in a day. In fact, I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d He pulled out the tape and traveled a day forward, finding most of the fair taken down but Mabel in the exact same spot. \u201cOkay, maybe in a week.\u201d He tried again to identical results. This was distressingly familiar. So he tried a month, finding her looking filthy with roots climbing up her legs. But then he saw something else. \u201cHey, Wendy.\u201d He ran towards her, hoping to salvage this otherwise horrible outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead was heading for the Shack, likely to begin her shift, only for her mood to instantly sour when she saw who\u2019d called her. \u201cOh, it\u2019s <i>you</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disgust in her tone killed Dipper\u2019s momentum instantly. \u201cUh, hey Wendy. H-how\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a real piece of work, you know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you huh, me. You flake on me all summer and now you expect to talk like we\u2019re friends again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain? You mean we\u2019re\u2026 not, anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shook her head with a sneer. \u201cDude, just look at your sister. You honestly think I\u2019d ever want to hang out with someone who\u2019s that crappy to their own family?\u201d She turned away in a huff. \u201cI thought you were supposed to be better than that, but I guess I was wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dipper tried to speak, tried to deny it, but she was already out of earshot. Sniffling and rubbing his eyes dry, he knew that there was only one choice to make. Pulling out the tape one last time, he returned to that fateful moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, I just wanted to say that people make mistakes. And when they do, you should forgive them. Also, that tight pants are overrated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you lost me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Dipper conceded. Once more he went through the motions, barely even paying attention as he trusted the ball to find its mark. It did, and Robbie showed up to do his part as well. \u201cIt is done.\u201d The minizora was then swiped off the table and pulled into a bone-breaking embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper! Thank-you-thank-you-thank-you!\u201d Mabel cheered as she swung him around, dancing in joy. When Waddles made pig noises, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s saying \u2018thank you\u2019 in pig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t break your heart, Mabel,\u201d Dipper assured, patting her cheek. \u201cPlus it\u2019s not like Robbie can date Wendy all summer, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blendin returned to swipe the tape back. \u201cYou two!\u201d he accused. \u201cDo you have any idea how many laws you just broke? I-I\u2019m asking. I wasn\u2019t there with you, but it was probably a lot,\u201d he finished uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a couple of jacked-up dudes in future armor appeared. They listed off the repercussions of the twins\u2019 actions and set the blame squarely on Blendin, given that his machine had been used to travel to all affected time periods. They were deaf to Blendin\u2019s rambling stuttering excuses, trying to pin the blame on Waddles of all people as he was dragged off to be arrested. Why they didn\u2019t just flash away was anyone\u2019s guess. They did, however, stick around long enough to be offended by Grunkle Stan, leading to the old man finally getting dunked after the target was incinerated. Everyone cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins got an ice cream to split with Dipper riding on Mabel\u2019s wrist and Waddles being carried beneath her other arm. After realizing that they might have caused the anomalies that Blendin had originally been sent to stop, Dipper\u2019s mood was once more soured by the sight of Robbie sharing a caramel apple with Wendy. It didn\u2019t take Mabel long to realize that this was a prime chance to be a good big sister and sick Waddles on the smelly emo. Waddles only got the apple, but purely by coincidence and not at all planned, Robbie backed up into a pot of hot water that spilled onto his tight pants, making them extra tight and constricting his sensitive bits. Once more, everyone laughed. Wendy even tried to cover her snickering at her new boyfriend\u2019s expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling just a bit better, Dipper went over to Waddles while he nibbled on the apple and scratched him behind the ears. \u201cThat\u2019ll do, pig. That\u2019ll do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddles squealed happily and leaned appreciatively into the scratching.</span></div></div>",

The porker was already house trained, but still had to stay in the laundry room at night. And while Mabel had every intention of sneaking him up to her room now and then, tonight would not be one of those nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, bro-bro. Like what you see?\u201d Having deposited Dipper onto her bed, Mabel leaned back against the headboard with her legs spread wide. She\u2019d stripped down to just her undies, leaving basically nothing to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill fully dressed, Dipper swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a really great thing today, so I figured you earned some big sis lovin\u2019, which is where I come in,\u201d Mabel explained giddily. \u201cTonight, it\u2019s anything you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything. Come on. What\u2019s your biggest fantasy? I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smirked, accepting the challenge. \u201cYou and Wendy making out and using me as a double dildo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blinked. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s your second biggest fantasy\u2026 that I can actually make happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed. \u201cSorry, not trying to be difficult or anything, but that\u2019s kind of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Mabel asked in disappointment. \u201cNothing else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I mean, we kind of do everything else already. What, is there something more you\u2019ve always wanted to try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I always had this fantasy about you hooking up with a cute minizora girl and totally going at it while inside me.\u201d Leaning back, she pushed her underwear aside and parted her pussy lips to reveal the glistening pink insides. \u201cMmph! Just thinking about it gets me hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, yeah.\u201d Dipper took off his shirt and shimmied out of his boxers. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty hot, though I\u2019m not sure which of our fantasies is less plausible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ruin the moment with your stupid overthinking,\u201d groaned Mabel. \u201cJust pick something and get started already. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 over here,\u201d she whined while swirling her fingers over her clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, now there\u2019s an idea.\u201d Dipper finally approached and gently pushed Mabel\u2019s fingers aside. Staring into her glistening snatch, Dipper smirked confidently as he made his decision. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the no-hands thing again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, really?\u201d Mabel whined. She didn\u2019t hate giving the reigns to Dipper. In fact, she appreciated him being more assertive now and then. However, it had been so frustrating not being able to do anything herself last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but with one difference. You can\u2019t touch me or anything near me, but everything not near me is free game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-hoho,\u201d Mabel chuckled. \u201cMe likey so far. What\u2019re you gonna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper said nothing as he pushed the panties aside like a tarp and stepped into the frilly confines. Mabel pulled back her underwear\u2019s band to watch from above while he got to work. The minizora started by touching along the girl\u2019s slit. She shuddered and almost lost her grip on the band. Hands that small had no business being that powerful, but the evidence spoke for itself. His touch was gentle and exploratory at first, easing her into things so as to not overwhelm her. He was a considerate lover like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lower lip, Mabel used her free hand to start rubbing at her right breast. She kneaded the flesh while trying to mirror Dipper\u2019s actions. She tried imagining that her hand was his, that it was him at regular size doing the groping. When that didn\u2019t seem to work as well as hoped, she imagined his hands as tiny as they\u2019d always been and that really got her blood pumping. \u201cEeep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper had just touched Mabel\u2019s clit, sending volts of electricity through her body. Smirking sadistically, Dipper tried for more prolonged contact with a brief kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep!\u201d Mabel\u2019s back arched and she lost her grip on her panties. Her climax had jumped out at her like a snake and her mouth opened in a silent scream. One hand had dug into her developing boob and the other fumbled for anything it could reach, digging its fingers into her twat and its devious teaser. Mabel\u2019s vision slowly started to clear as her breathing evened. \u201cI need to start getting ice water before bed,\u201d she panted. Her attention was then called to some muffled shouts between her legs. Looking down, she could feel her brother moving about, along with some moisture on her fingers and released her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper poked his head out from her panties, smirking despite being covered in her juices. \u201cYou seriously came from just a kiss?\u201d he asked of his flushed sister. \u201cI barely even got to do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I ain\u2019t stopping you. I\u2019m a girl, which means I can orgasm all I want,\u201d she boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Well, I\u2019ve got minizora endurance, so I can pretty much do the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChallenge accepted!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrimming with confidence, Dipper dove back into the musky fabric and got back to work, this time less concerned with tenderness. With his own hand, he teased the area around Mabel\u2019s sex. It was already soaked, but he cared not for the smelly stickiness. All that mattered were the sexy sounds his sister made as he played her like a piano. \u201cGod, you sound hot,\u201d he thought aloud as he pressed himself against the slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel bit her bottom lip again, but extra hard this time. Somehow, she was able to feel the distinct protrusion of her brother\u2019s prick as it probed her flower. It was so small, but somehow her brain was lit a fire with the knowledge of what it was, where it was, and how it felt like a lump of burning hot coal against her sensitive nether lips. \u201cOh!\u201d She reflexively slapped her hand over her mouth to subdue her screams; a skill she\u2019d honed to near perfection over the years of keeping these trysts from their parents. They knew, of course, but it always seemed rude to disturb them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Whole-body pressed against the gooey line, Dipper began pumping his little dipper in and out. He knew Mabel appreciated it, but what really drove her crazy was what he did with the rest of himself. His hands never stopped moving, massaging the area around her lips in a way that made his sister go crazy. Bracing himself, he kissed her clit again. Her body shook and she came again, though not as hard as before. Ignoring the way her viscous fluids oozed around him, Dipper kissed her again, but this time more passionately. He imagined himself making out with another girl his size, just like Mabel\u2019s fantasy. She was hot, soft, and very welcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing her fate for not having more hands, Mabel made do with groping her breasts and suckling her own fingers. Again she imagined them to be Dipper; not his penis at regular-sized, but his whole tiny body. Nothing got her hotter than imagining all the wonderful things she could do with his tiny form, except for maybe the things his tiny form could do with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper had to press his hands around her lips to simulate the kind of tightness he needed to get off. He could just dive right in and get off that way, but that wasn\u2019t the point. He was trying to make love with Mabel\u2019s kitty like it was its own person. Losing himself in the rich aromas and scorching heat, it seemed to be working. Finally, Dipper felt himself on the brink. \u201cComing!\u201d he called, and released into his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel felt it, that injection of new fluids that weren\u2019t her own, and climaxed as well. \u201cH-how,\u201d she panted breathlessly, body a burning sticky mess and smile so wide that it hurt. \u201cH-how can you-you do that to me, ev-every time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out from her underwear, body glistening with her love juices, Dipper began to stretch. \u201cHey, some people just got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her orgasmic hi, Mabel was lucid enough to take offense at Dipper\u2019s movements. Here she was, barely able to lift a finger. And there he was, looking like he was warming up for a marathon. \u201cC-curse your minizora endurance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper snickered. \u201cYeah, well, it turns out I might have overestimated myself just a bit.\u201d He gestured down to his limp noodle. \u201cGonna need a few minutes before I\u2019m ready to go again. Hey, can I get you some water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her envy, Mabel nodded and Dipper went to the sink to fetch her a cup, which he brought back on a skateboard. It wasn\u2019t the coldest or the tastiest, but the liquid flowing down her throat was refreshing beyond words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, bro-bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time, sis,\u201d he said with a salute.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With today being notoriously slow in years past, Grunkle Stan agreed to close up shop early, as well as to be dragged off to the arcade. The old man found no amusement in the games and resented them for taking other people\u2019s money. That was his job. He also didn\u2019t care for how many games had different variations of some one-eyed triangle guy that seemed to follow his movements wherever he went. Creepy. The kids, however, were having much more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper and Wendy had found this really old game in the back called Fight Fighters. It was a standard fighting game where each player picked a character and commenced an honorable fight to the death. Just standard kid stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, stop doing that,\u201d Wendy griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, winning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. How are you doing that?\u201d To her, it appeared that Dipper was running around like a one-man beehive, dividing his time perfectly between the levers and the buttons. Then he won and they got to enjoy another cheesy cut-scene. \u201cWhaaat? You cheated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou take that baaack!\u201d Dipper deepened his voice in imitation of the game characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while they were having fun, who should turn up but Robbie. After once again reminding them about his band, the greasy teen was able to weasel his way into the game and push Dipper aside, doing so in such a way that didn\u2019t look forceful enough to offend Wendy. It was infuriating. Once Wendy set him down, Dipper was forced to stand off to the side while she told Robbie about her family camping trip tomorrow, but he didn\u2019t appear to listen. And when Robbie put his arm around Wendy, that\u2019s when the game said something relevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpponent sighted. Fight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, back at the Shack, Stan was trying to teach the kids how to play cards. Mabel, inexplicably, kept winning and taking everyone\u2019s spare change. The game was interrupted by really desperate rock music accompanied by even more desperate lyrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper groaned. \u201cUgh, sounds like Robbie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobbie? Is he that jerky twerp I see making goo-goo eyes at Wendy all the time?\u201d asked Stan, succinctly summarizing everything about the gross emo in his old man lingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I sick Waddles on him again?\u201d Mabel asked, petting the pig\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on this new suit of battle armor for him. I don\u2019t want to spoil it, but there\u2019ll be spikes. Extra sharp spikes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll handle it.\u201d Dipper hopped down to the floor as the others oohed him on. He marched out the front door to where Robbie was playing terribly and calling Wendy out like she was a dog or something. \u201cYou realize she\u2019s not here, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. Yes\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s out camping with her family today.\u201d He then added under his breath, \u201cMaybe if you\u2019d listened for once, you\u2019d know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that, short stuff?\u201d Robbie asked imposingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, however, was unimpressed. \u201cI just said she wasn\u2019t here. Are you actually deaf on top of being tone-deaf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you want to get into it, huh? Well, let\u2019s get into it. You think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, huh? It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve got a thing for my girlfriend. Don\u2019t you. Don\u2019t you!\u201d As Robbie stepped forward, Dipper pulled back, finally on the defensive at the implicit threat of his secret being revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. Come on, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s just dying to ask out an itsy bitsy twerp the size of her finger. Not like you could ever satisfy her at that size, anyway. Hey, here\u2019s an idea.\u201d He pulled out his phone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I call her right now and see if she wants to date you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t! Y-you don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Robbie was having none of it and hit the call button. Then, just as Wendy\u2019s voice was heard, Dipper found a pebble and chucked it at Robbie\u2019s thumb, startling him into dropping the phone. The thing might have been okay, if it weren\u2019t super cheap and landed in the worst possible way on a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy phone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re not getting off that easy.\u201d Robbie made to grab for Dipper, only to notice a red dot on his hand. The dot quickly climbed up his arm and disappeared somewhere onto his forehead. The dot came from a laser pointer tied to a grappling hook, which was currently being pointed right at the emo\u2019s face by a very irate little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy all means. Give me an excuse,\u201d Mabel warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie pulled back, but turned a sneer back to Dipper. \u201cYou. Me. Circle Park. 3 o\u2019 clock. If you\u2019re man enough to come without your sister, we\u2019ll finish this.\u201d And he stomped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel, after checking Dipper over to make sure he wasn\u2019t hurt, brought him back in with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, what was I thinking?\u201d asked the minizora pacing in a panic. \u201cI can\u2019t fight. I\u2019ve never been in a fight before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept for the gnomes, wax people, and that Multibear thingy,\u201d reminded Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the Gobblewonker count?\u201d Soos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunkle Stan rolled his eyes like he didn\u2019t believe any of this, but he also bit his lip uncomfortably. \u201cKid, you\u2019re a minizora, so your options are pretty limited. I say climb up his pants and go for the balls. After that hot water incident, those things are probably dead anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoys, why can\u2019t you learn to hate each other in secret, like girls do?\u201d Mabel asked with an innocent smile while everyone else gave her a deadpan stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, since when did you ever hate anyone in secret?\u201d Dipper asked. \u201cYou\u2019re, like, the most violent person I know. Like that time a girl put gum in your hair for picture day. You made her eat it, hair, gum, and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dude. Mabel might have a point,\u201d offered Soos. \u201cTeens are crazy dangerous. You\u2019re probably better off just not showing up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, yeah. Maybe he\u2019ll just forget about it? Maybe this whole thing\u2019ll just blow over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook kid, you\u2019ve got yourself a choice here,\u201d groused Stan. \u201cYou can either face him like a man, or hide like a wimp and let your sister fight your battles for you.\u201d He then turned a serious, knowing gaze upon the little girl, silencing her. \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dipper decided to go hang out with Soos at the arcade and totally not hide, Mabel caught up with Grunkle Stan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you say all that dumb stuff to Dipper? Now he\u2019s being all dumb and won\u2019t let me help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember that talk about distance?\u201d Stan reminded while gluing antlers to a stuffed gopher. \u201cWell, this is the same principle. It ain\u2019t healthy to be overly dependent on others, especially for minizora. It gives \u2018em all kinds of complexes. Ya gotta let him stand up for himself and make his own mistakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, someday he\u2019s going to be in trouble and you\u2019re not gonna be there for him. I know it\u2019s tough to think about, but that\u2019s life. If he doesn\u2019t learn to deal with stuff on his own now, he\u2019ll never be ready later. It\u2019s like learning to ride a bike. Falling and getting scrapes is part of the experience. Builds character and makes you tough. Tough enough to handle whatever life throws at you.\u201d When the silence went on for too long, he glanced at Mabel. \u201cClose your mouth, kid. You\u2019ll swallow a fly like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Grunkle Stan. If you weren\u2019t so old, I\u2019d say you were wise beyond your years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corner of Stan\u2019s mouth curled up. \u201cThanks, kid. And don\u2019t worry too much about Dipper. Even for a minizora, that shrimp\u2019s tougher than he looks. I doubt that Robbie kid could even do anything. This\u2019ll be like a training wheels experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Dipper handle his predicament?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo to the arcade<br>\r\nTrain<br>\r\nHide in his room<br>\r\nStick with Mabel</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Where Mabel had her comfort food, Dipper was trying to drown out his misery with video games. The world of Fight Fighters was so simple compared to real life. Checking his watch and watching the minutes tick away at glacial speed, he dropped the coin meant for the machine. He tracked it down to the back corner where someone had carved some secret cheat code. Curiosity peaked, and eager for a distraction, Dipper entered the code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it looked like the machine shut down. Then it blared to life with a blinding light. \u201cChoose your character!\u201d it demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Rumble McSkirmish?\u201d He was the only character Dipper knew off the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game\u2019s light flickered enough to be a risk for epilepsy before the screen spat out, who else, but Rumble McSkirmish in all his eight-bit glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRumble. You\u2019re\u2026 alive?\u201d They exchanged a high five. \u201cOw! Agh! Your pixels are really sharp.\u201d Dipper rubbed the hand covered in tiny cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, tiny child boy!\u201d Rumble said, his words stilted and voice sounding like he was speaking into a bad mic. \u201cI am Rumble McSkirmish from the USA.\u201d He delivered a flurry of kicks and punches into the air, making Dipper reflexively flinch back. The game character then punched a change machine to pieces in the hopes of turning into a wolf man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool! With Rumble around, Robbie will be so scared I won\u2019t even need to fight him. I\u2019ve got the world\u2019s strongest fighter as my bodyguard.\u201d Dipper turned back to face the game machine. \u201cShame about the pixels, though. There were some cute lady characters on that roster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper brought Rumble back to the Shack and fed him a taco, which he ate by stepping on. Rumble wanted to face the world\u2019s greatest Fight Fighters in the Soviet Union, but Dipper convinced him that there was a pretty tough fighter here in Gravity Falls. He explained that Robbie was his arch-enemy, and noncommittally affirmed that the guy killed his father. Rumble then delivered another flurry of attacks in what might have been cheer, damaging the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChallenge accepted. Press start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big red start button appeared before Dipper, which he pushed without a second thought. \u201cUh oh. I think I hear my uncle. Stay perfectly still.\u201d As Rumble continued his odd swaying, Dipper stressed, \u201cI said stay still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is as still as I can stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper reasoned that he\u2019d better hide Rumble until the fight, and so brought him up to the attic where his sister looked to be in deep thought. \u201cHey, Mabel. Have you met Rumble yet? He\u2019s my new bodyguard,\u201d he bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe child gave me a taco.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! He\u2019s got a crazy voice! Wait\u2026 bodyguard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He\u2019s a fighting machine. I\u2019m going to get him to defend me from Robbie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cSo you won\u2019t let me protect you, but this guy with a mullet and headband is okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis headband belonged to my dead father!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mabel. It\u2019s nothing like that. He\u2019s more like a summon, like in a JRPG. They summon all kinds of crazy creatures, but it\u2019s still them who get the credit for winning the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like a bit of a stretch,\u201d Mabel said uncertainly. \u201cThough I\u2019m surprised you picked this beefcake and didn\u2019t get any,\u201d she snickered, \u201ccheesecake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was a spur of the moment thing. Also, his pixels are sharp, so what you\u2019re thinking wouldn\u2019t work anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeesh. I don\u2019t even want to know how you figured that out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just a high five, Mabel. Get your head out of the gutter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis cut-scene is taking too long,\u201d Rumble observed. \u201cWhen does the fighting begin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper checked his watch. \u201cIn just a few minutes, actually. Well, we\u2019re off to beat up an emo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, before you go, do you have any ideas how you might cure someone of a fear of heights?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really paying much attention, Dipper answered, \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know. Exposure therapy maybe. Bye Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the park, while Dipper briefed him on what to expect, Rumble picked up a large quantity of dangerous litter. This included a large pipe, a sword, an axe, a crossbow, and what looked distressingly like a laser gun. Spying old man McGucket dancing off to the side, Dipper was able to convince Rumble to discard all of it, as it would be more honorable to fight with just fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in Circle Park, which was overdue for a mowing, Robbie looked to be deciding on which \u2018cool\u2019 pose he should go with. The clock chimed and Dipper came out in the open before the teen could settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. Look who decided to show up. I thought you\u2019d chicken out, or maybe got stuck to the gum on someone\u2019s shoe. So, you ready to settle this like men?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays the fifteen-year-old to the twelve-year-old minizora,\u201d Dipper shot back. \u201cLook dude, I don\u2019t think you want to fight me. Let\u2019s just call this whole thing off before someone gets hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie warily scanned his surroundings. \u201cYour sister\u2019s not here, is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Left her at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis confidence returned, Robbie laughed in mockery. \u201cHa, then I guess you\u2019re just being scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper shrugged his acceptance. \u201cOkay, dude. You asked for it.\u201d He snapped his fingers and Rumble marched out from behind a tree, his footfalls ominously heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie pulled back, but still maintained a tough-guy act. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend? And why is he so blurry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis happens to be the greatest warrior that ever lived,\u201d bragged Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie laughed. \u201cYeah right. Hey, eyepatch. What did the kid promise you? More tape for your arms? Hahaha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you laugh when you killed this boy\u2019s father?\u201d Rumble demanded with dramatic hand gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m giving you one last chance, man. Back down now or this guy\u2019s gonna go nuts. Seriously, he\u2019s got abbs you could grate cheese on. I fought the Multibear and this guy looks even tougher\u2026 even tougher\u2026\u201d Dipper trailed off, staring into the distance as the hamster wheel in his brain finally kicked in. \u201cI might have overthought this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight commences<br>\r\nRumble glitches before the fight<br>\r\nWendy shows up early<br>\r\nHere comes Mabel</span></div></div>",

This ends now!\u201d Robbie lifted his foot high, only to barely dodge when Rumble took this as the signal to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got out of control almost immediately as Rumble delivered blows that could bend steel upon the poor emo. Even grabbing Robbie\u2019s hoodie caused it to tear from the sharpness of the pixels. When the fireballs started flying, Robbie did the smart thing and made a run for it. Dipper tried to argue reason and restraint, but Rumble just punched everything with the misfortune of being in range as he gave pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper quickly lost sight of them, but was able to follow the trail of rampant destruction to the Barrels and Crates storehouse. \u201cSomehow I knew we\u2019d end up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie fled down a ladder on the side of the building. He demonstrated some of the remarkable feats humans were capable of when pumped full of adrenaline as he effortlessly dodged every barrel Rumble threw his way. If this weren\u2019t a life-or-death situation, Dipper might have commented that the emo was almost as good as a minizora, but that would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was able to follow with relative ease, even going as fast as his little legs could move. The manotaurs might have been jerks, but their training was the real deal. Even so, the minizora\u2019s legs were tiny, and it was only thanks to Rumble\u2019s insistence on stopping to punch everything in sight that Dipper was able to keep up. The cops eventually showed up to do their jobs for a change, only for their car to be deposited upside-down on a nearby roof. Soos finally returned from wherever he\u2019d been, immediately recognizing Rumble as a video game character, and offered to be Dipper\u2019s sidekick and drive the little guy to stop this menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, up high on the water tower, Grunkle Stan was suffering a terrible internal conflict. On the one hand, he was proud of Mabel for conning him to climb up here blindfolded. She\u2019d learned well. On the other hand, he was questioning his own sanity for coming all the way up here despite knowing the little gremlin was up to something. The arrival of that stupid emo in a smelly sweating panic was barely a blip on the petrified old man\u2019s radar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChallenger sighted!\u201d Despite being unable to look up, Rumble had found his opponent/victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoos drove up. \u201cAlright, dude. Go save the day. I\u2019d totally run over him, but, you know, he\u2019s impervious to cars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper again tried pleading, but Rumble was deaf to his words as he pummeled one of the tower\u2019s legs. Stan and Mabel managed to keep a grip, but Robbie fell, only to be caught by the eight-bit menace. With no other choice, the little boy tossed a coin at Rumble\u2019s head, finally getting his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRumble, I have something to tell you. Robbie didn\u2019t kill my father. No one did. I lied to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHyuuuk? Then that means you\u2019re a\u2026 bad guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I am,\u201d Dipper conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging Robbie up on a low branch like a sack of rubbish, Rumble commenced a mournful pose, accompanied by the wind to blow his hair and a very audible inner monologue. \u201cIf Robbie is not the last stage, then it must be\u2026 yooou!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother start button appeared before Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoos ran up, panting. \u201cDude, don\u2019t fight him. He\u2019s got, like, a black belt wrapped around his black belt. You could get killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to, Soos. I started this, so it\u2019s my responsibility to stop it. Besides, I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d He punched the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHealth bars and scores appeared over both opponents. Dipper tried mimicking Rumble\u2019s swaying in the hopes of building energy, or whatever. Rumble\u2019s first few blows missed, all designed to aim for someone regular-sized. Dipper seized on this advantage by punching the big guy\u2019s toe, doing a fraction of a percent\u2019s worth of damage. \u201cUh oh.\u201d Rumble then switched to low kicks that sent the minizora flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemonstrating unexpected cunning, Soos tried messing with the health bars, but his hands passed right through. \u201cEh, it was worth a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper thought he could hide high up, but rather than just punching the tree down, Rumble brought out his special skill and summoned his Fist Punch Rain, which was a literal rain of fists that made the area look like a warzone. Then, just as the big guy was getting ready to deliver his finishing move, Dipper saw his chance. \u201cSoos, kick me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it! Hurry, before it\u2019s too late. Kick me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, alright, dude. Just don\u2019t tell your sister.\u201d Feeling downright awful about this, Soos put his faith in the little guy, ran up, and delivered a kick that Charlie Brown could only dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Rumble was confused. Then Dipper\u2019s health bar went to zero as the boy lay motionless on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRumble wins!\u201d announced the bodiless narrator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumble struck a victory pose and declared, \u201cWinners don\u2019t lose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna bet,\u201d taunted Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGame over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rumble\u2019s pixels dissolved into nothing, he gave one final cry of \u201cNooo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper stood and brushed himself off. His clothes were in shambles and probably beyond salvage, and the myriad of bruises made it painful to breathe, but at least he was alive. \u201cThanks a lot for that, Soos. If you hadn\u2019t kicked me, Rumble might have actually killed me with his combo attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m happy for you, but please don\u2019t make me do that again. You\u2019re my little buddy, and buddies aren\u2019t supposed to hurt each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s smile fell. \u201cI wish I could make that promise, Soos. But with all the craziness we\u2019ve seen in just the last few weeks, I need to keep my options open.\u201d As Soos\u2019 head fell, the minizora added, \u201cBut you have my word that you\u2019ll be safe from Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, what happened?\u201d demanded Robbie, finally getting down from the tree. \u201cWho was that guy? How come every time you\u2019re around there\u2019s always ghosts or monsters or whatever?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just lucky I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking after that guy almost broke my neck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed. \u201cIf you still want to fight, go ahead. I just want this day over with.\u201d He held out his arms in welcome for whatever the emo had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Robbie was all too happy to finally put the shrimp in his place, but when it became apparent that Dipper wouldn\u2019t run, the emo got cold feet. Punching a tiny child was just too low, even for him. \u201cPssh! Probably not even worth it. I play lead guitar so I need to save my hands,\u201d he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Wendy came back. \u201cHey, guys. Wow, what happened here? Freak tornado or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr something,\u201d Dipper answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why are your faces all jacked-up? You guys weren\u2019t fighting, were you? I hate it when guys fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacked into a corner, Robbie stammered incoherently, unsure of how to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Dipper stepped in with a plan. \u201cActually, there was this super-strong guy who went on a rampage through the town. Ask anyone. They all saw him punching powerlines and flipping cars. Right Robbie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah. Yeah totally. It was the, um, strong guy. Had a mullet and no shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would explain why dad\u2019s acting weird. Mom says he\u2019s sensed a rival alpha male on his turf and now his primal instincts are going nuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Manly Dan was throwing a very manly \u2013 and surprisingly helpful \u2013 tantrum. Screaming at the sky, he punched stop signs back into alignment, flipped cars upright, and overall tried to undo everything that Rumble had touched. Some things just couldn\u2019t be fixed with punches, but Manly Dan was definitely saving the repair crews a lot of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, we lured him out here and tricked him into beating us up. The eight-bits gave away that he was a video game character, so once he thought he won,\u201d Dipper snapped, \u201cit was game over. Right, Robbie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy blinked like a deer in the headlights. \u201cDude, that\u2019s amazing! I\u2019m happy to see you guys getting along, but also terrified of video games coming to life,\u201d she added nervously. \u201cWell, I still got some unpacking to do. You\u2019ve got to tell me the whole story later,\u201d she said as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was out of earshot, Dipper leveled with Robbie. If they kept fighting, they\u2019d both lose, so they had to agree to a cold war pact and just hate one another in silence, like girls other than Mabel did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Mabel, Grunkle Stan was having a hard time getting her off the tower after his fear of heights had seemingly transferred to her. All in all, an eventful day for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should we go from here?<br>\r\nNext episode<br>\r\nFollow Soos<br>\r\nCheck-in with Wendy<br>\r\nLook into Stan</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another lazy day at the Shack when the doorbell rang. Stan answered and was greeted by a man telling him that he\u2019d won some contest no one had even heard of. It looked mighty official though, what with the camera guy and the beautiful women holding an oversized check. With everyone excited, Stan was told that he need only sign on the dotted line, and all this money would be his. So he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ha!\u201d proclaimed Gideon as he burst out into the open. \u201cStanford, you fool. You just signed over the Mystery Shack to li\u2019l ol\u2019 me!\u201d He then tapped out a condescending victory dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while the twins were horrified, Stan grinned like the cat who\u2019d swallowed the canary. \u201cMight wanna take another look there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Gideon read back through the document, all the way down to the signature. \u201cSuck a lemon little man!?\u201d He tore up the contract as Stan mocked him. \u201cHow dare you! Ah am not a threat to be taken lightly. Ah\u2019ll get you, Stanford Pines. Ah\u2019ll get you-\u201d A throat clearing caused Gideon to spin around. Mabel was there, smiling that radiant smile of hers that he just adored. \u201cW-why Mabel. W-what a surprise seein\u2019 you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel slapped a hand on Gideon\u2019s shoulder and dug her fingers in deep. \u201cGideon, are you aware that these people you brought with you are witnesses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped audibly. \u201cThat w-was the plan, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel tilted her head, her smile growing to terrifying lengths. \u201cSo you\u2019re aware that the only reason you\u2019re still breathing is because I don\u2019t want to go to jail for murder, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeaked and nodded. Sweat was staining his suit and her grip was growing more painful by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet this be your last warning. If I catch you anywhere near my family again, I might not be bothered to care about any witnesses. Get me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh gotchya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Then get!\u201d Mabel then picked up the fat boy, hurling him out the door and across the lawn. He skipped like a stone and scuffed his suit. The little girl shot a death glare at the troll\u2019s cohorts, giving them the cue that they weren\u2019t welcome. When the intruders finally left, Mabel looked down to see Dipper waiting to be picked up. She obliged and held him close. \u201cThank you, Grunkle Stan,\u201d she whispered tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name called, Stan regained his composure after nearly being scared pissless by the little girl. \u201cEh, it was no biggy. Little freak show needs to get up extra early if he wants to pull one over on Stan. Now, who wants to watch some TV while their favorite Grunkle gets them an ice cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel raised her hand, but Stan was already off. She sat against the chair, rocking herself while Dipper\u2019s tiny hand stroked her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Mabel. He can\u2019t hurt us anymore. The amulet\u2019s gone, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s still trying though,\u201d Mabel growled darkly. \u201cIs there a way to break someone\u2019s legs so that they can never heal right? I might need to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, no!\u201d Dipper asserted. \u201cI know that look. You can\u2019t go around picking fights like that anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one picking. He came into our house, Dipper! This is supposed to be a safe place where we can just relax.\u201d She turned to look down at the floor where Gideon had stood. \u201cNow his shoe prints are in the carpet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her grip too tight to wiggle free, Dipper tapped Mabel\u2019s knuckle and she brought him close to her face. For his sister, Dipper gave his most endearing smile, reached out, and hugged her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest person I know, Mabel. I know you won\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sniffled, unable to wipe away the tears before they could stain her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to see you like that again,\u201d she whimpered, recalling that horrid night in the abandoned building. Just remembering Dipper being so close to those scissors made her want to vomit. The idea that Gideon was still out there, still scheming, and still pining for her, made her feel even worse. \u201cI\u2019ve never hated anyone as much as Gideon,\u201d she confessed. \u201cHe\u2019s worse than any bully. He\u2019s a monster. And if I catch him here again, then I don\u2019t care what happens to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I do,\u201d Dipper called, interrupting her confession. \u201cI do, Mabel. You can\u2019t throw your life away like that; especially not for Gideon. I can\u2019t lose you to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t lose you either, bro-bro.\u201d Mabel\u2019s hands tenderly cupped behind Dipper, holding him where she needed him to be. I just need to stay like this for a while. That okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later, Mabel had calmed enough to play chess with Dipper. He won, like always. But in response to him being a sore winner, Mabel saw fit to rub her height in his face when Soos asked her to fetch something off a shelf. It was all in good fun, though. Dipper was basically numb to short jokes at this point and it was just nice to see Mabel smile again. However, this did get the minizora to thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper went flipping through the journal and found something interesting. The author described a kind of crystal in the forest with height altering properties. After making sure that Mabel was fine with him leaving, he ventured forth, promising that he hoped to return with a special surprise for his sister. As he went, following the directions in the pages, Dipper\u2019s heart began to race even more than his battle with Rumble. If what the journal said was accurate, then this could be a dream come true. And as much as Dipper hated when people called being a minizora a birth defect and treated it like a handicap, the crystals in this book could do something that could only be described as a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a brief tumble down a hill, Dipper came nose-to-nose with a deer. Not just any deer, but a deer less than twice his size. There was a whole herd of them taking shelter beneath some mushrooms. \u201cWhoa.\u201d Dipper ventured further into this shadowed part of the forest and spotted several more animals of unusual size. That tiny mountain lion gave him a scare. However, being shrunk didn\u2019t turn it into a minizora, so Dipper was able to fend it off with relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Dipper\u2019s journey led him to a giant crystal, surrounded by hundreds of other crystals. Light from the sun shined down and seemed to refract through the crystal, resulting in different beams of light with different size-changing properties. Pink for shrinking and blue for enlarging. So excited that he might pass out, Dipper quickly snatched up one of the crystals and took it back to the Shack. With a bit of finagling, Dipper managed to cobble together a specialized flashlight able to shrink and grow things at will. From here, he knew there could be only one course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is that course?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShow Mabel (Nice)<br>\r\nShow Mabel (Not Nice)<br>\r\nGo mad with power (GT)<br>\r\nDo nothing</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve got that surprise for you.\u201d Hearing rapid footsteps ascend the stairs, a very giddy Dipper dove into the closet and shut the door just as Mabel entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise? Surprise? Where\u2019s the surprise?\u201d Mabel asked like a dog who\u2019d just heard someone say \u2018walk\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to get on the bed first,\u201d instructed Dipper, the closet door muffling his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Mabel is intrigued,\u201d she said while rubbing her chin. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about the bed? And why are you hiding?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s where I\u2019ll give you the surprise, also that\u2019s a secret. You really want me to spoil it before you can be surprised?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you tell me, I\u2019ll still act surprised,\u201d Mabel said in a singsong voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sit on the bed and close your eyes. Trust me. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine, mister bossy pants.\u201d Mabel huffed and hopped up on the bed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre your eyes closed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they really, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeaaah!\u201d griped Mabel, starting to get annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they\u2019re open, the surprise won\u2019t be as good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Fine.\u201d Finally, she closed her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re closed. This had better be worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it will be.\u201d Dipper pushed the door open, tentatively poking his head around to see Mabel with her eyes closed. In his new state, she looked so very different. She was still the same as this morning, but his new perspective made everything seem so much\u2026 smaller. Dipper stepped out of the closet, his steps careful so as to minimize noise. He didn\u2019t want her to get any hints before she could be surprised. It was actually kind of exhilarating how loud the floor creaks were under his shoes. He\u2019d never made this much noise before. And all that junk that was left out on the floor. He had to step over it rather than walk around it. Okay, forget the wolf by the stream. This was the new greatest experience in Dipper\u2019s life. And he knew things were about to get better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I open my eyes, yet?\u201d Mabel whined impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Dipper whispered, almost there. \u201cJust a little longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I at least get a hint?\u201d huffed the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ever tell you how pretty you look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still closed, Mabel turned a confused look down to where she thought Dipper was, not realizing she was only facing his feet. \u201cWhat brought this on all of a sudden?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. You just live with something every day and it just fades into the background. Then there\u2019s a tiny change, and it\u2019s like you\u2019re seeing it for the first time all over again. And you realize just how pretty it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Dipper,\u201d Mabel said, wagging her finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you get all lovey-dovey with me. Not unless you\u2019re prepared to deal with the consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m prepared. I\u2019m prepared like I\u2019ve never been before,\u201d Dipper said, brimming with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sounds like you\u2019ve got something extra special going on.\u201d Something about Dipper\u2019s voice was getting her all hot and bothered. \u201cYou almost never initiate like this. I always have to nag you, or you just let me pick you up and have my fun. Why so assertive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know. Just feeling like a new me.\u201d Unable to restrain himself any longer, Dipper took the final step forward. \u201cAnd here\u2019s your surprise.\u201d Dipper pressed his lips into Mabel\u2019s. He\u2019d kissed her more times than he could remember, even on the lips, but this wasn\u2019t like those other times. Before, he\u2019d been tiny. A kiss from him was like the kiss of a mouse, and a return kiss from her would engulf most of his head. This time, his lips aligned evenly with hers. Their noses poked one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, Mabel\u2019s eyes shot open, and beheld a mirror pair of brown orbs staring right back at her. It was like a low key funhouse mirror, only significantly less twisted. The noses were identical, but the cheeks lacked her natural blush. The chin was a bit more angular and the hair was just flat out wrong. That\u2019s when it finally clicked for Mabel where she\u2019d seen this face before. It wasn\u2019t a mirror. It was her brother, only not tiny anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper finally broke the kiss and pulled back with his winningest smile. Standing at his full height, he was maybe an inch or two taller than Mabel sitting down. They were still on each other\u2019s level, though. For the first time ever, they were truly looking eye-to-eye. \u201c\u2018Sup, sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mabel a hot minute to fully process what she was looking at. But even when the simplest explanation asserted itself as the truth, it still didn\u2019t quite click with her. \u201cIs\u2026 is there a magnifying glass here or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper chuckled indulgently, reached out, and took Mabel\u2019s hand. Her skin erupted in goosebumps at his touch, but he was not dissuaded from carefully interlocking his fingers with hers. \u201cYou know, somehow it\u2019s even softer like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking from a hurricane of emotions, Mabel looked down at her brother\u2019s hand. It was definitely his. Bigger, but still his. He was holding hers as an equal instead of just doing the best minizora equivalent. If they could do this, then surely there\u2019d be other\u2026 For the first time since opening her eyes, Mabel remembered to breathe and sucked in a lungful. At long last, the stunned surprise finally faded from her face, replaced by shimmering eyes and a twisted mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Mabel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-ha!\u201d Mabel lunged forward, knocking Dipper to the ground as she wrapped her arms around him. Not just her hands, but her whole arms. It took all of her to hold all of him as she started bawling. She pressed her face into his chest to muffle her cries, flipping the script from how things usually went. His chest was broad and well-defined for his age, rigid with muscles and an inner strength neither of them was fully aware of just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving not expected this reaction, Dipper did what any minizora would do and rolled with the punches. His arms wrapped around Mabel. Not just her cheek, her hand, or even her foot. He wrapped his arms around her back until his fingers touched. It was the most amazing thing. Mabel\u2019s weight was fully upon him, but she was so light. He could probably pull her off if he wanted, not that he would. Someone his own size was atop him and holding him close. Feeling his own eyes start to water, he had no choice but to reciprocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while the twins just lay there on the floor, basking in the sensations of holding one another like never before. It was amazing, exhilarating, terrifying, and somewhat stomach-turning all at once. But amidst their tumultuous feelings, one question weighed heavily on both siblings\u2019 minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat comes next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings get awkward<br>\r\nThings get passionate<br>\r\nThings get weird<br>\r\nThings get nowhere because someone interrupts</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mabel had gone through a whole box of tissues before she was finally ready to face this new situation. Sitting across from one another on the floor, it started with her poking Dipper in the face. She watched as his skin compressed against her touch, marveling at the level of detail she\u2019d never noticed before. Mabel moved on to poking Dipper in the shoulder, the chest, under the chin, and under his armpit. He flinched, laughing at being tickled, but Mabel just frowned. \u201cHuh, that\u2019s weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s weird?\u201d Dipper asked. \u201cI might be big, but I\u2019m still ticklish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 I don\u2019t want to do it again,\u201d she said, not fully understanding her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Usually, when I tickle you, it\u2019s super cute and I just want to keep at it. But right now, I don\u2019t really want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve probably got a lot on your mind right now,\u201d reasoned Dipper. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re not the big sister anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering like she\u2019d been thrown out naked in a snowstorm, Mabel wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cIt feels like someone just walked over my grave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Mabel. You\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, Dipper. What you said\u2026 there was something seriously wrong with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s the truth. Now that we\u2019re the same size, technically I\u2019m older, so now I\u2019m the-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sprang forward and slapped both hands over Dipper\u2019s mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Dipper tapped at Mabel\u2019s hands. He\u2019d intended only to signal her to stop like he always did, but underestimated his own strength and pushed her hands aside instead. His eyes met hers and they shared a moment of silent understanding. \u201cI think I\u2019m still a minizora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that possible, though? You\u2019re so big and minizora are supposed to be, you know, mini.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be the crystal. It can change size, but everything else is as it should be. I\u2019ve still got my minizora physiology!\u201d he beamed. \u201cMabel, this means I\u2019m not just regular-sized. I\u2019m minizora tough! When I went to get the crystal, I wrestled with a shrunken mountain lion and won! Now\u2026 now I can do the same with a regular mountain lion! Hey, think we can go pay Manly Dan a visit? I wanna arm wrestle him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper\u2026 Wait, crystal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I made a size-changer using a crystal I found out in the woods. Just press a button and pfft. Big or small. The sky\u2019s the limit. Though we probably shouldn\u2019t test that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blinked. \u201cThen\u2026 this is reversible?\u201d she asked, sounding hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned. \u201cWhy would I ever want to reverse it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Why would you want to shoot yourself with some weird magicy size-changing ray, or whatever it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious right now. Mabel, did you actually ask me, a minizora, why I\u2019d jump at the chance to finally be regular-sized?\u201d he asked incredulously, and somewhat offended. \u201cI thought that would have been obvious, especially to you of all people. You\u2019re the one person in the world more worried about me getting stepped on, kicked around, or just swept aside and ignored than I am. All those times we talked\u2026 You were the one person who really understood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, Dipper,\u201d Mabel insisted, gesturing at him. \u201cBut this? This isn\u2019t regular-sized. This isn\u2019t natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening up, Dipper took a calming breath. While the world was chaos around him, inside he had inner peace. A few carefully measured breaths later and he was ready to start again. \u201cMabel, I think you might be missing the big picture here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s shoulders relaxed. That was Dipper\u2019s calming technique. It was something they\u2019d learned together, but only he really practiced. Seeing him calm down like he always did was a welcomingly familiar sight. Maybe not everything was so different? \u201cOkay. What\u2019s the big picture?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, if I\u2019m big, I\u2019ll never be stepped on again. And since I\u2019m big <i>and</i> minizora strong, Gideon can never hurt me again. I don\u2019t know if you heard me the first time, but I beat back a mountain lion. If Gideon comes at me with scissors again, I can just kick his balls up his throat; or at least give it a good try. Mabel, while I\u2019m like this, you never have to worry about me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s jaw about hit the floor. On the one hand, this was objectively terrific news. So much time had been devoted to worrying about Dipper that she frequently suffered bouts of constipation and other stress-induced afflictions. Living without that would be a dream come true. But more important than herself was him. Dipper being impervious to scissors and safe from general harm was her oldest wish, since back before she could remember. It\u2019s what she always put on the top of her wish list to Santa. Surely she should be happy at finally having her heart\u2019s most coveted desire, so why did she feel so awful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s one more thing you\u2019re missing,\u201d Dipper added, shooting Mabel a lascivious smirk. He leaned back on one hand, pulled up his shirt, and unzipped his fly. Mabel fixated on his pants, her eyes swelling to the size of dinner plates. Dipper reached into his pants like he was going to extract something, but instead started caressing himself to hardness. \u201cI\u2019m bigger, Mabel. Wanna see just how big I can get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel just kept staring, but gave no signs of confirmation. Why, though? Dipper was initiating. His newfound size had made him bold, and now he was teasing her without any prompting on her part. This was also something she\u2019d fantasized about, if to a lesser extent. By all accounts, she should have lunged for him again, or at least nodded until her neck hurt, yet all she did was stare. It was like she felt something really bad was coming, but couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper noticed Mabel acting off, but tried to ignore it, rationalizing that she was still processing the new him. That would change momentarily, however. When she saw the next part of his gift for her, her worries would be forgotten like a snap. She\u2019d be the old Mabel, he\u2019d be the new Dipper, and things would make sense just like they used to. Finally at full hardness, Dipper whipped out his cock in all its glory. To him, it looked the same as always. But to Mabel, she was pretty sure that this thing was proportionally bigger than it used to be, on top of being objectively larger. That thing could fill up her whole hand, or even mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin turned expectant and anticipatory. Any minute now, Mabel would react. She\u2019d jump him, licking him and pulling him inter her mouth like she always did. Granted, he was a bit more than a mouthful these days, but Mabel had always been a determined optimist; a dangerous combination when she got horny. Any minute now, her craving for his body would take control and he might finally enjoy a regular person blowjob, hopefully followed by more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s eyes practically sparkled as she beheld the tower of meat. It was the tallest she\u2019d ever seen up close. She\u2019d had it in her mouth before, tasting it and everything around it more times than she could count. Its flavor was rich and never failed to put her in a good mood, yet something was off. This new thing looked a lot like the old thing. Every detail was exactly as she remembered, save one. Did they really compare, though? Mabel finally looked away from Dipper\u2019s enlarged penis, trailing the considerable distance up his body until finally, she met his eyes as well. \u201cDipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mabel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think the prior choices are still applicable.</span></div></div>",

This is wrong, Dipper. <i>You\u2019re</i> wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what? Is that it, then?\u201d he asked irritably. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do it with me anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean yes. Grr! I want to do it with you, but with the real you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the real me, Mabel. The new and improved me. Why can\u2019t you be happy about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this everything we\u2019ve both wanted? Me safe and finally able to hold someone like myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-maybe this is all happening too fast for both of us,\u201d Mabel reasoned, her scheme forming. \u201cThis is still reversible, right? Maybe I\u2019ll feel better if I can hold you like I normally do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Dipper conceded. It was a fair request. Standing, he went back into the closet and pulled out the flashlight. He double-checked the settings to make sure they were in alignment, and prepared to press the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s mine now!\u201d declared Mabel, running out the door with Dipper in hot pursuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d made it a short distance across the lawn before he\u2019d caught up with her, tackling her to the ground. The flashlight went off, turning a caterpillar to the size of a bus. The two continued their struggle over the delicate machine, aiming at the other\u2019s bodies but only able to shrink or grow certain parts. In all the commotion, just when everything was proportional again, the flashlight went flying, stopping before a familiar pair of suede shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGideon was in rough shape. His latest plan had just failed and he was just about to leave the property when he noticed the device. \u201cMy, my. What delightful manner of doohickerey is this?\u201d He looked up, spying the Pines twins. Particularly he spied how one of them had grown a couple of shoe sizes, to say the least. He looked at the device, then back to the twins, and again at the device. His grin grew sinister and Grinch-like as he took aim, flipped the switch, and watched the magic happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly shrinking was a lot like going down on a roller coaster. For Dipper, everything was back to normal. Gideon was the same ugly troll he\u2019d always been; only now he had a power that rivaled the amulet. Mabel wasn\u2019t taking things nearly as well, however. Everything had become gigantic and terrifying. Spying a bird overhead, Mabel felt the same apprehension of it coming for Dipper, only exponentially worse. It could come for her, and there\u2019d be no one to stop it. Even worse, from her angle, she was staring straight up at giant Gideon\u2019s giant crotch. As always, she held close to Dipper for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gideon laughed at his impending victory, he used the jar that once held magic termites to scoop up the tiny twins. The pale boy\u2019s walk wasn\u2019t exactly even as he carried the jar under his arm, reasonably confident that no one would notice or confront him about its contents. Inside, Dipper held onto Mabel as the jar jostled and tossed them around. He tried to protect her from as many hits as possible. After all, he was a minizora. He was born to handle this kind of treatment, but she wasn\u2019t. Finally in his room, Gideon locked the door and dumped the twins onto his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two,\u201d he accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what are you gonna do with us?\u201d asked Mabel, refusing to let this hateful person see her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Mabel, Ah wouldn\u2019t hurt a hair on yer pretty little head,\u201d Gideon laughed, only to switch to a threatening tone so fast that it almost gave him whiplash. \u201cIf you agree to be my queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d she replied quickly and evenly, startling both boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, really?\u201d asked Gideon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, yeah. Doy.\u201d Mabel stood and approached the edge of the desk, smiling sweetly. \u201cI realize that I\u2019ve been acting silly. After all, you\u2019re li\u2019l Gideon the fortune teller. You\u2019re the most amazing person in Gravity Falls. I\u2019d l-love to be your queen,\u201d she strained to say without throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGideon\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you really think Ah\u2019m stupid enough ta fall fer that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Worth a shot.\u201d Mabel let her instincts take hold and lunged at Gideon, only for him to catch her mid-leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll change yer mind after this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou leave her alone you creep!\u201d Dipper snarled, looking around for anything he could use as a weapon. He\u2019d always been wary of what other people might do if they caught him, but worrying about Mabel in the hands of Gideon was far worse. Luckily, Gideon only dropped the girl in a bag of gummy koalas to keep her pacified with sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs fer you, boy,\u201d Gideon intoned sinisterly and shined a lamp light down on Dipper. \u201cTell me! How exactly did you come upon this magic item? Did somebody tell you about it? Did you <i>read</i> about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Gideon said that word told Dipper all he needed to know. The troll knew of the journals and possibly even had one. Dipper reflexively glanced down at his vest, but luckily his captor didn\u2019t notice. He smirked. \u201cLean closer and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in the power of his size, Gideon giggled, and obliged. \u201cWell, don\u2019t mind if Ah do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper pushed the button on the air horn right into Gideon\u2019s ear, making him scream. The minizora took advantage of the distraction and ran for Mabel, who was still stress eating. Unfortunately, an arm slammed down and blocked his path. Gideon had recovered, and was pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh should squash you right now!\u201d Gideon bellowed, his fist held high at the ready. Dipper, infuriatingly so, scowled and held out his arms in defiant invitation. Then the troll got to thinking and pulled his fist down. \u201cSteel yourself, Gideon. You can use them. You can use them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gideon was on the phone, trying to ransom the twins to Stan, Dipper had run over to the candy bag. The plastic was ridiculously strong for such a cheap product and resisted his efforts to tear it open. Pushing worked a lot better and he ran inside to hug Mabel, only for her to pull away in pain. Horrified, Dipper checked her body over and found numerous bruises. He\u2019d failed to protect her back in the jar. He\u2019d failed to protect her from Gideon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gideon\u2019s ransom plot failed, the twerp descended into maniacal laughter as the obvious struck him. \u201cWhat am Ah doin\u2019? Ah don\u2019t need ransom! Ah have this,\u201d he boasted, holding up the flashlight. \u201cAh\u2019ll shrink Stan \u2018n\u2019 take the Shack fer mahself.\u201d Then he looked back at the twins. \u201cYou\u2019ll be helpless ta stop me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want the Shack so much anyway?\u201d demanded Dipper, using his body to block Gideon\u2019s view of Mabel. \u201cIs all of this just revenge for Mabel dumping you? You know that\u2019s never gonna win her back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s mah li\u2019l ol\u2019 secret, boy. But now that Ah have this,\u201d Gideon eyed up the flashlight, \u201cAh might have ta accelerate mah plans. Imagine it, boy. An army of mah loyal followers grown ta giant size. Or perhaps Ah\u2019ll try the covert rout \u2018n\u2019 mass-produce these babies ta sell. It\u2019ll be a new-age of warfare with cities crushed beneath the feet of giants, \u2018n\u2019 all while Ah rake in the dough, bidin\u2019 mah time ta take over once the ashes settle. Either way works.\u201d His dastardly plan delivered, there was another moment of tonal whiplash after Gideon was distracted by the call of the ice cream truck, followed by uncaging his hamster to guard the twins and closing the door on his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will become of our heroes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins escape<br>\r\nGideon returns early<br>\r\nBud comes in<br>\r\nGideon succeeds</span></div></div>",

Wh-what if he uses the light on us again and shrinks us down to nothing? And how will we even make it to the Shack like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper nodded thoughtfully and peeked over the edge of the desk. \u201cThe carpet down there looks soft enough. I could handle the fall, but you can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s expression fell. \u201cWe have no choice. You might as well lea-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo chance in hell,\u201d Dipper said flatly. \u201cI\u2019d sooner die before leaving you alone to be some pervert albino\u2019s sex toy. You\u2019re coming and-and I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel looked hesitant and rubbed a bruise on her arm. \u201cCan you, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, we\u2019ll figure out a way.\u201d He took her hands in his, shuddering at the feeling. Having someone his own size was still exhilarating, but he pushed those feelings aside. \u201cWe\u2019re the mystery twins. We always find a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel finally smiled as her eyes watered. \u201cNow there\u2019s the real Dipper I know and love.\u201d Both were taken aback by her words. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I said that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned. \u201cWe can talk this out later. Right now we need to get out of here.\u201d His eyes fell upon Gideon\u2019s comb. \u201cAnd I think I have a plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTying the hairs into a rope, the twins descended the side of the desk. They snuck their way into the living room and witnessed Gideon throwing a screaming tantrum over being tickled, terrifying his father before knocking over a vase and storming out. The mother, whose hair had turned prematurely gray from stress, kept her head down and muttered, \u201cJust keep vacumin\u2019,\u201d like it was a meditation mantra. Reasoning that neither adult could be trusted to help thwart Gideon, the twins carefully maneuvered their way through the obstacles of furniture. Dipper pulled Mabel along, but she was only able to make it \u00be of the way to the doggie door before her sides ached from the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do this every day?\u201d she breathlessly gasped. \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper face-palmed. \u201cCuz I\u2019m a minizora,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, shooting Mabel a look of warning before she could say something stupid. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving together and that\u2019s that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d she wheezed. \u201cI just ran, like, three football fields and my sides hurt. I can\u2019t stop Gideon like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop Gideon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins snapped up to face Mrs. Gleeful. At some point, she\u2019d turned the vacuum off and switched to a brush and scoop for the glass from the vase Gideon broke. Tools in hand, now she stared at the tiny children like a prisoner who\u2019d just seen their first sliver of daylight in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomethin\u2019 wrong, sugar lumps?\u201d Bud asked distractedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, nothin\u2019 sweetie.\u201d Mrs. Gleeful squatted down, stared directly at the kids, and carefully said, \u201cAh see nothin\u2019 at all.\u201d She then set the scoop down to the ground and motioned for the kids to get on. They decided to take a chance and trust her, allowing her to ferry them away from Bud. \u201cHey, you\u2019re that girl Gideon likes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the girl Gideon stalks after I kicked his-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper covered his sister\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhy are you helping us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Gleeful\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cY-you don\u2019t belong here. You live at the M-Mystery Shack, r-right? That\u2019s where you s-should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned skeptically. \u201cUh, yeah. Yeah, the Shack is definitely the place we should be. Um, can you take us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Shack. I take you\u2026 away. Away from\u2026 place. This place,\u201d she muttered as she carried the scoop out to the lot and found one of Bud\u2019s test models with the keys still in the ignition. \u201cTake you away. I take\u2026 away. S-stop\u2026 him. Stop\u2026 him.\u201d With the kids dumped into her lap, the stressed frown slowly began to twist as she turned the key and started laughing. \u201cStop\u2026 him. I stop him. Istophim! Hehe, haha! I stop him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since being shrunk, Mabel was glad to be unable to see what was happening around her. Despite their best efforts to keep steady, Mrs. Gleeful\u2019s driving was even worse than Stan\u2019s. She kept making wild swerves, horns blared all around her, and the twins even heard a few crashes. She never stopped laughing; lost in her own little world in a joke that she\u2019d never told anyone. The joke that was her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she stopped, finally getting her laughing under control, and opened the car door. They were back at the Shack and Gideon was walking across the lawn. With one hand over her mouth to suppress her chortles, the other set the twins down on the ground. There was so much more she could have done to help, if she only had the nerve. But rather than doing something effective but illegal, Mrs. Gleeful spied the partially melted gummy in Mabel\u2019s pouch. She took it, and with skills that amazingly hadn\u2019t rusted in years of neglect, flicked the candy straight into Gideon\u2019s hair, sending him into another fit as he dropped the light. She drove off while he was distracted, laughing hysterically at the greatest triumph she\u2019d experienced in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins ran to the flashlight, but Dipper was the first to reach the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick, regrow me and I can stop Gideon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way. I can stop Gideon just fine on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour own? So you\u2019re not going to grow me back to regular size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re already regular size! I\u2019m not, so I should grow. Why can\u2019t you just accept that I\u2019m the big sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see how it is. You want me to stay small so you can lord it over me. You can\u2019t stand the idea of a Dipper who can stand up for himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d cried Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense ta me,\u201d Gideon patronized, snatching up the twins before they could react. Holding them up to his face, he continued his taunt. \u201cAh dare say you would\u2019ve defeated me, if it wasn\u2019t fer yer siblin\u2019 bickerin\u2019.\u201d Gideon\u2019s imaginings with what he could do with the twins must have reflected in his expression, because both of them pulled away in revulsion. That was fine. They were right to be afraid. Tired of stalling, Gideon stormed into the Shack, spied the fez, and shrunk its wearer. \u201cThe Shack is mine now, Stan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Gideon went over to pick up the fez and gloat, all were surprised to find Soos. The three tiny people were then tossed in a jar and stuffed in Gideon\u2019s pocket as he began his hunt through the Shack. \u201cStanford, Ah\u2019m comin\u2019 fer ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three tinies huddled together in the jar, unable to break free, as Mabel started crying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for what?\u201d asked Dipper. \u201cI\u2019m the one who made that stupid device. This is all my fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you made it. You\u2019re a minizora,\u201d Mabel countered. \u201cLike any of you wouldn\u2019t do that if given the chance! This is my fault because\u2026 because I couldn\u2019t accept you being bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurled up, she buried her face in her knees. \u201cYou were right about me. I didn\u2019t want to accept it, but it\u2019s true. I love being the big sister. I love looking out for you and you looking up to me. We relied on each other and got through the hard times as a team. But if you\u2019re big, then you don\u2019t need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper lunged forward and, as carefully as he could, pulled Mabel into an embrace, all while Soos had plugged his fingers into his ears, closed his eyes, and hummed to himself. \u201cMabel, you\u2019ll always be my big sister, and I\u2019ll always need you. Being big wouldn\u2019t change that,\u201d he assured as she cried into his shoulder. \u201cBut, now that I think about it, this wouldn\u2019t be something we could hide,\u201d he sighed. \u201cPeople would find out about a minizora turning up big. Questions would be asked and people would inevitably find the crystals. Then it\u2019d be just like Gideon said: a new arms race.\u201d Dipper pulled away and showed Mabel his most committed expression. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop Gideon, get everything back to normal, and\u2026 and destroy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel cried all the louder and babbled incoherently. Only Dipper was able to decipher her gibberish. She was saying how lucky she was to have such a caring and selfless brother, how she didn\u2019t deserve him for being so selfish and dismissive of his dreams. Taking all of this in stride, as minizora were prone to do, Dipper planted a quick peck on Mabel\u2019s lips, finally getting her to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will things play out from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins defeat the little troll<br>\r\nGideon plays with his toys<br>\r\nThe ray backfires<br>\r\nGideon wins</span></div></div>",

I was looking for some brainless twerp with bad hair to try out my new mirror maze. You here for the auditions? Cuz I gotta say, I like your chances. Haha!\u201d Stan slapped his knee. \u201cGet it? It\u2019s a joke at your expense.\u201d And he ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get back here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry and find me, twerp. Better hurry though. If Mabel catches you here, I don\u2019t want you leaving any stains on the good furniture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel is mine, Stanford. And soon, so will this blasted Shack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the jar, after informing Soos that it was okay for him to listen again, the tiny trio got on each other\u2019s shoulders and unscrewed the lid. They climbed up out of the breast pocket and spied the flashlight all the way on the other side of Gideon\u2019s chest. The safest route to it was to go up, around the back, and down again. However, just as they were walking across Gideon\u2019s fat neck, Mabel made the mistake of looking at his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoaaa,\u201d she awed with sparkling eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s so shinyyy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper pulled her away. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t look directly at it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Soos threw himself against Gideon\u2019s neck. \u201cDude, his neck is so squishy. Hey, look at me. I\u2019m making fat angels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap,\u201d Dipper muttered in muted horror, knowing exactly what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant pasty hand came into view. The tinies tried running, but Soos wasn\u2019t fast enough before the pudgy fingers came down and knocked him off. Luckily he\u2019d landed safely on the shag carpet. The twins resumed their trek and actually made it to the pocket. However, just as they were about to push the button, the flashlight was taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan had just appeared and Gideon drew the flashlight like a weapon. He fired, hitting a mirror. The bolt of light ricocheted all around him and he had to duck down to keep safe. The bolt finally hit a stuffed moose and was neutralized with its shrinking. Stan, knowing nothing other than his enemy\u2019s distress, just laughed. And in a rage, Gideon threw the flashlight, breaking one of the mirrors. Again he grinned as the obvious presented itself and he went on a rampage, smashing every mirror he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Stan came out of hiding. \u201cYou little troll! Those mirrors cost me ten-twenty-five-five hundred dollars each. And you\u2019re paying for all of \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh contraire, it\u2019ll be you who pays,\u201d Gideon challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, Grunkle Stan is doomed,\u201d Mabel gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily. Quick, too his armpit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s pupils shrunk to pinpricks. \u201cUh-uh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper pushed on her head. \u201cJust, ugh, come on.\u201d And the two scaled-down the inside of Gideon\u2019s shirt. Somehow the little monster managed not to notice two people crawling over his body, not even that time Mabel slipped and got a face full of fat boy nipple. The smell was putrid and the skin was sticky from all the running around in the sun in a suit that just did not breathe. Each time the twins had to lift up their hands or knees to move forward, it made a sound like Velcro. It was a miracle that Mabel didn\u2019t throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, what is that thing?\u201d Stan asked, backing away. The device looked funky, but Gideon was clearly holding it like some kind of weapon. The old man had had enough experience with such weird doohickeys to be wary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, after all these years. After every humiliation,\u201d Gideon boasted. \u201cYer business, yer family, everything\u2019ll be all mine! Ya have no one ta protect ya now!\u201d Stan was cornered and visibly sweating. \u201cPrepare for the wrath of Gideon Glef-ha. Haha. Bwa-hahahaha!\u201d Laughing uncontrollably, the boy fell over onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan looked around, half expecting a camera crew to come out and tell him that this was a prank show. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t even know how to respond to this,\u201d he said awkwardly. \u201cLook kid, I think this whole rivalry thing is getting to you. I understand. I mean, I am a formidable foe,\u201d he bragged, straightening his suit collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGideon tried to protest, tried to aim the flashlight, but couldn\u2019t control himself in this hysterical state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting down, Stan gave a friendly smile as he carefully removed the flashlight from Gideon\u2019s grasp. \u201cHey, come on. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get me one of these days. Maybe, you know, run your evil plans by your friends next time, huh? Workshop it. But first, get your issues in order.\u201d Bored with being civil, and still getting no coherent response, Stan started lightly kicking Gideon and rolling him across the floor. He kicked harder when it came time to go up the stairs. And ultimately the weird little laughing boy was rolled right out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally in control again, Gideon patted himself down. \u201cMah light!\u201d he reached out for the device in Stan\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the light of my life, too,\u201d Stan taunted, dangling the flashlight out in front of him. \u201cFreak show.\u201d He slammed the door, emotionally drained after the encounter, and set the flashlight down on the floor as he went to the TV room for some rest. He\u2019d investigate the thing later, if he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving jumped off just before Gideon was rolled out of the Shack, the kids scrambled over to the light. Dipper flipped the crystal around to the growing side and returned Mabel to normal. He smiled up at her as she did a little victory dance and sighed. \u201cThis is how it should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Mabel promptly grabbed up the tiny boy and pulled him into a big sisterly hug. \u201cI love you, Dipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too, Mabel.\u201d He kissed her cheek as she held him out before her, palm open. \u201cSo, I guess we should find Soos and destroy that thing before it falls into the wrong hands again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eyeing the flashlight carefully, Mabel stowed it in her sweater pouch. \u201cNah. I think I\u2019ll keep it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But\u2026 the fate of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, you gave up so much today. For the world, and for me.\u201d Her eyes lowered apologetically. \u201cI get that you can never be regular,\u201d she said with air quotes, \u201csized out on the streets and stuff. But at the very least, we can keep this around so you can have some private big time. You know, like a secret twin thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rubbed some moisture out of his eyes. \u201cI love you, Mabel. I don\u2019t say that enough, but it\u2019s true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I love-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a bulbous tuft of white hair poked in, followed by a pasty pale face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGIDEON!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat boy froze, regretting his decision to try and take back the flashlight. What followed was a series of horrific events that would have been too gruesome for any channel but HBO. When it was over, Gideon was taken by the ambulance, barely clinging to life. At least his folks came to visit him. Bud did his best to be an encouraging and supportive father, though his wife kept interrupting with hysterical giggle spasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins play with the ray<br>\r\nDipper risks going big<br>\r\nBoth twins go power-mad<br>\r\nWhat are the other characters up to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once everyone was returned to their correct size and sworn to secrecy, an exhausted Mabel was almost too pooped to shovel food in her mouth at dinner. The radio ran in the background, talking about how McGucket just won ten million dollars, and also that he planned on using the money to build an army of death robots, which Toby dismissed as a joke. The twins knew better, but were too tired to really care. They went straight to the attic after eating and got undressed for their shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe all the running I did,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAll that running you do daily. It\u2019s insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s what a guy\u2019s gotta do to get by in this crazy world,\u201d Dipper said with a dismissive wave, slipping out of his underwear. \u201cHey, you think we could\u2026\u201d He gestured to the flashlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, okay,\u201d Mabel said hesitantly and flipped the switch. Dipper was big again. Big and naked, and Mabel\u2019s gaze invariably fell on the limp noodle between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee something you like?\u201d Smirking, Dipper put his hands on his hips and started to sway, making his penis flop around. Normally she found this hysterical, but now she was doing that quiet staring thing again. \u201cUh, Mabel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fixed him with a stern look. \u201cSorry, but I think I\u2019m still traumatized from Gideon. That was <i>not</i> how I expected my first time to be getting up close with a naked boy.\u201d But before Dipper could smart off, she amended, \u201cBesides you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper snorted a laugh. \u201cFunny. Cuz if he was a girl, that\u2019s pretty much exactly how I imagined it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBleh! The human body is gross. All those\u2026 pours. Is that what you see when you look at me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think your pours are cute. Then again, I might be biased.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled and set the light over at the far end of the bathroom. \u201cOkay,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready to give this a try. Big people bathroom time. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s my line,\u201d she tittered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes and followed Mabel into the tub. The water was turned on and at first, the pair just stared at one another, uncertain of what to do. Dipper was still wary of his strength and didn\u2019t want to frighten his sister with sudden movements. Luckily, Mabel found her boldness and approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring Dipper in the eye for another few seconds, she licked his cheek. Pondering his taste, she switched to the other cheek. \u201cHmm. The flavor\u2019s the same, but the texture\u2019s a little off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure.\u201d Mabel submitted her cheek for licking. The tongue was slimy, but didn\u2019t trigger her revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou taste the same, too. I can\u2019t really describe it, though. It\u2019s just Mabel flavored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Mabel eagerly licked her arm, but it was as tasteless as ever. \u201cThis is definitely a minizora thing. We think you taste good and you think we taste good. Now we just need a second minizora to see if you two think the other tastes good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later. Right now, I think there\u2019s other things for us to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point.\u201d Mabel took the lead, probing Dipper\u2019s body with her fingers. Slowly she got used to the difference, reassured with the knowledge that this was definitely temporary. She was doing this as a big sister to reward her amazing little brother. Gradually her touches grew lower, until finally, she had to get down on her knees before the turgid member. She took a calming breath and exhaled hotly onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that feels nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHands behind your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m calling the no-hands rule. If we\u2019re doing this, then you can\u2019t use your hands. Promise me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smiled his acceptance and interlocked his fingers behind his back. \u201cPromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Mabel took Dipper\u2019s penis in hand, making him shiver. \u201cIt\u2019s hotter than I expected.\u201d Carefully she stroked up and down its length. \u201cDoes this feel good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh!\u201d Dipper replied, biting his lower lip. \u201cThat\u2019s way better than my hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is, goofus. Everything\u2019s better with a sister.\u201d Carefully pumping her hand, Mabel resumed her examination and giggled. \u201cHey, I\u2019m holding little Dipper\u2019s little Dipper.\u201d *Fap-fap-fap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper very nearly pulled his hands out, but stopped himself. \u201cGod, Mabel! You\u2019re really good at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Mabel then planted a kiss on his mushroom head. She almost pulled away, only to get a nose full of natural musk. Then she dove down, encompassing the head between her lips, and gave an experimental lick. \u201cIt\u2019s as yummy as I remember!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019mmm-hmm so glad to hear that,\u201d Dipper said, cheeks flushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. This is fun!\u201d Mabel gushed. \u201cLike having regular you in my mouth,\u201d she said between bobs and licks, \u201cbut bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper twisted his fingers together until it hurt. It was the only way to stop himself. \u201cI\u2019m not, but I want to,\u201d he gasped. \u201cRight now, I really want to grab your head and start face fucking.\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cShow you what it\u2019s like to be used as a sex toy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s grin grew devious and her grip tightened. \u201cIf it were anyone else, I might have punched you sterile for a line like that. But because it\u2019s you,\u201d she relaxed and took a sample of Dipper\u2019s delicious pre, \u201cyou get a pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh, yeah.\u201d Dipper grinned apprehensively. \u201cI get it. Even like this, Mabel\u2019s still in charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d she asked in sincere concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s familiar. Though, in the future, I\u2019d like to change things up now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d Mabel said before taking the plunge and sinking her lips down until she kissed the base. Her blowjobs had never been this precise before and she was loving tasting all the little veins across his shaft. Without thinking, her hand found its way to the boy\u2019s balls and began carefully massaging them. Based on the sounds he made, she inferred that she was doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was panting rapidly, almost simulating the breathing exercises of women in labor. \u201cHoo-hoo-hoo-haaah!\u201d Mabel\u2019s fingers and mouth were amazing. It didn\u2019t matter that she was just clumsily fumbling around. To him, she was an expert to rival any porn star. The knowledge that this was his sister, and also someone his own size just made things a million times hotter. \u201cC-close,\u201d he warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Stan, Mabel took this warning as her cue to speed up. One hand continued fondling his balls and the other grabbed a handful of Dipper\u2019s firm butt to hold her steady. Meanwhile, her bobbing went into overtime as she pulled back and slammed her face repeatedly into Dipper\u2019s belly. The added force gave his member the chance to finally tickle her uvula, but she managed to muscle through her gag reflex. For Dipper\u2019s sake, she had to press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCuuu-!\u201d Dipper began erupting into Mabel\u2019s mouth a split second before she went down one last time. With his eyes closed and the shower still going around him, it was impossible not to imagine that he was shoved up her vagina right now. All that warm liquid caressing his skin as his body showed his lover just how much he appreciated this attention. The lack of a full-body massage was just a nitpick that could be addressed later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mabel, she\u2019d never tasted so much delicious seed all at once. Compared to Dipper\u2019s usual sprits, this was more like someone went overboard with the catchup on their burger. It was almost too much to handle. But at the same time, the moment the flavor touched her taste buds, it simply wasn\u2019t enough. Mabel abandoned Dipper\u2019s balls and gripped both his butt cheeks, pressing her lips down in a vacuum seal as she greedily guzzled every drop. When it stopped, she focused her suckling on the penis and tried milking it for everything it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper slipped, grabbing the edge of the tub before he could land on Mabel\u2019s hands still on his rear. She never stopped suckling, even moving her hands up his back to keep him from pulling away. She suckled and sucked \u2018til her suckler was sore. Then Mabel realized something she hadn\u2019t before. She popped her mouth off and looked at Dipper, her voice in muted glee. \u201cGet on the bed. I need you inside me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlay with the ray<br>\r\nPlay regularly<br>\r\nMabel is hungry<br>\r\nChange perspectives</span></div></div>",

Dipper couldn\u2019t tear his eyes off of his sister and decided to tease her with his thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re not quite as big as I remember,\u201d he said with a shit-eating grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel snapped around and gave him a silent warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t smother me like this, buuut\u2026\u201d Dipper trailed off. \u201cNow I can appreciate your pertness.\u201d He reached down, but stopped just before touching Mabel\u2019s bottom. He waited a good few seconds, and took her lack of resistance as approval, trusting her to be honest with him. She made the most adorable squeak as he kneaded her soft, plush cheek in his hand. \u201cSo squishy,\u201d he laughed. \u201cLike it was made for grabbing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Mabel countered breathlessly, her face in a hot flush. \u201cThat butt was made for squishing little brothers who get out of line. Everything else is just a bonus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, me having fun feeling you up and making you make those cute faces is just a bonus, huh?\u201d asked Dipper coyly. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of talking you\u2019re doing. And not a lot of bed getting\u2026 on,\u201d she trailed off awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you just grabbed my butt a second ago. Aren\u2019t I entitled to a little butt time with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only little butt I-Nnngh!\u201d she gasped. \u201cCare about is yours, and you\u2019d better get it on that bed, little mister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle?\u201d Face twisting in faux outrage, Dipper decided that now was the time to indulge in another of his secret fantasies. Without warning he swept one arm behind Mabel\u2019s legs, knocking her off balance. She fell backward and would have surely gotten hurt, if his other arm hadn\u2019t caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the world stopped spinning for Mabel, she looked up to find Dipper smiling down at her. One hand held her back and shoulder while the other was looped under her knees. Upon realizing that she was being held bridal style, and that her face was so close to her brother\u2019s firm chest, Mabel gave a squeak like a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we can count this as my win,\u201d taunted Dipper as he carried his sister out and to the bed. \u201cAfter all those giant gummy koalas you ate, you\u2019re surprisingly light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel snapped out of her trance and turned the full force of her glower up at her big little brother. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always do,\u201d he replied smugly. \u201cAnd you never disappoint.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfuriated with his lack of fear, Mabel chose to hold her tongue. He\u2019d be singing a different tune once she set her plan in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper carefully deposited Mabel onto her bed, never dropping his smile as his eyes trailed down her body. \u201cWow. You clean up good, pretty lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s face was as red as a tomato. She hated how her brother could play her like a piano. Worse, she hated how much she loved it. But all of that could wait just a little longer. \u201cI\u2019m on top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me. You\u2019ve got minizora strength, remember. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d rather not have death by snu-snu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper pouted, but ultimately shrugged his acceptance. \u201cOkay fine. I guess I need to practice being gentle in this bigger body, but only if you start exercising more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal. Now,\u201d Mabel clapped, \u201cswitch.\u201d They exchanged places on the bed with Dipper on his back and Mabel looming over him. She took her turn to examine his body, scrutinizing it more than feeding her carnal hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. Close your eyes. There\u2019s something I have to check on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeesh, fine.\u201d Dipper shut his eyes and rested his head on the pillow. \u201cRemember, this is you showing your thanks to me, which means no farting in my face, or anywhere else for that matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. Don\u2019t be such a worrywart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, we\u2019re alone and you\u2019re horny. It\u2019s very rational for me to be worried.\u201d When she didn\u2019t reply right away, he asked, \u201cWhat are you checking, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a hunch. I\u2019ll let you know how it works out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink light flashed behind Dipper\u2019s eyelids as the sheets shifted all around him. He opened his eyes and jumped up with a start to find himself shrinking. Mabel had gotten the flashlight and returned him to normal. \u201cMabel, what the hell?\u201d he asked, more surprised than angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now for part two.\u201d The now taller twin switched to the blue setting and took much more careful aim this time. She held the light just long enough to get the thing back to its earlier size. Once complete, Mabel beamed in pride at her accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper just stared slack-jawed at what his sister had done. He couldn\u2019t close his legs. The giant limp lump growing out of his pelvis wouldn\u2019t let him. His cock and balls had been enlarged to regular people size and now made up almost half his body mass. \u201cM-Mabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that confirms it,\u201d she stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConfirms what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I like you better this way,\u201d she sighed contentedly. \u201cSmall and cute Dipper is best Dipper, but Dipper with a big little Dipper is also good.\u201d There was actually more she wasn\u2019t saying, but she\u2019d keep those feelings to herself until she understood them better. \u201cThe point is I\u2019ve just made you into the ultimate minizora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper returned his attention to his junk. There were only so many things Mabel would want to do with a body like this, and thinking about them caused his cock to twitch back to life. \u201cOh boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh big boy!\u201d squealed Mabel. She hopped onto the bed, making Dipper bounce. Sitting on her knees, she scooped a hand behind him to push him forward. Once everything looked lined up, Mabel gave the turgid 3-inch member a few playful pumps to alert it to attention. \u201cReady, bro-bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was completely eclipsed beneath Mabel. Her soft young flesh was all around him, shining with residual moisture. Her feminine musk was pungent in the air and looking straight up, past the glistening sight of her slit and over her tiny breasts, there were the pearly whites of her eternal smile. Only one response seemed fitting. \u201cBring it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Mabel dropped herself down. She\u2019d taken a whole brother up her kitty before, but this was different; thicker. The mushroom head parted her folds, sending sparks of bliss up her spine, but she pressed on. Lower and lower she sank, her brother\u2019s penis spreading her insides out like never before. \u201cThat\u2019s no mere dick. That\u2019s a cock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh my god! That\u2019s even better than your mouth!\u201d exclaimed Dipper as his swollen member was enveloped. The full-body massage he was accustomed to was now focused on his cock, hugging and pulling him deeper into its loving embrace. After cumming already, he was still super sensitive and didn\u2019t know how long he could last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she\u2019d gotten used to it, Mabel slammed Dipper in the rest of the way. Only her firm grip kept him from going further than his base. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d Back in full control, as was only right, Mabel slowly removed Dipper, the friction of his skin sliding across hers almost causing her to fall. She held her balance and her brother, pushing the latter back in with a lewd wet squelch. \u201cFuuu-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s arms wrapped around Mabel\u2019s thumb, needing the leverage as he was again pressed against her womanhood. Spying her clit a hair\u2019s breadth from his face, he smirked evilly and gave it a kiss. That\u2026 may have been a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a switch had been flipped. Mabel\u2019s mind went blank from bliss. All she knew was the pleasure of the cock up her twat. She needed it in, and out, and in again. Faster and faster she plunged the precious organ into her depths. Each time Dipper would be slammed into her groin, and about half the time he managed to touch her clit again. Faster and faster Mabel went, edging herself ever closer, until her orgasm struck her like lightning. Her mouth hung open in a silent scream. She lost all feeling in her limbs and fell onto the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, however, was still wedged inside as girl cum squirted all around him. This was a familiar state for the boy. As soon as he recovered from the battering he\u2019d taken, he was able to wiggle out of Mabel\u2019s fingers. Her pussy, however, held onto his cock with a vice grip. Apparently, her sex was even greedier than she was, a notion he had to laugh at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s voice brought Mabel back to lucidity and she decided to share her thoughts before passing out. \u201cBest\u2026 ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the twins have this new toy, what will they do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut it away and skip to the next episode<br>\r\nKeep experimenting with the ray<br>\r\nBegin their takeover<br>\r\nTake a break from adventures and just be regular kids</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turned out, the people of Gravity Falls loved Halloween so much that they celebrated it twice a year. With Summerween upon them, the twins were initially uncertain. Halloween in the summer just seemed unnatural. They got over their reservations as soon as Soos reminded them of the free candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe local shopping center was decked out in seasonal decorations like plastic skeletons, plastic bats, fake tombstones for sale, and all the fake blood anyone could ever need. Dipper and Mabel were having a time in the costume isle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Something sweet, or scary?\u201d Mabel asked, choosing between the cupcake and the slasher killer with the hockey mask. \u201cSweet or scary? Scary or sweet? So many decisions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper huffed his disappointment at the lack of costumes his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t be down. Mom\u2019s not here, but I\u2019ve been helping her make your costumes for years.\u201d Mabel beamed and added, \u201cYou\u2019re like my very own dress up doll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Dipper sighed and pushed her finger away. \u201cBut if we\u2019re gonna coordinate, then we need something with a second half. Slasher killers are all solo acts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how about that?\u201d Mabel pointed to a creepy doll covered in scars. \u201cI could stick my finger up your butt and make you my evil ventriloquist dummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, be serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper,\u201d she deadpanned. \u201cI\u2019m always serious when it comes to butts. Always!\u201d She turned her attention back to the costumes. \u201cWe could do PB&amp;J, but that be too uneven. People might ask questions instead of giving us candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mabel in shopping mode, Dipper descended down her body to the floor to do a little shopping of his own. He had no money, but it was still nice to look at things at his own pace and pretend like he could buy them. Then, after heading down a few isles, suddenly the ground left him behind as he was hoisted into the air by an unfamiliar hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness, well look at you!\u201d Gushed the strange woman. She had an east coast accent, probably a tourist, fat, maybe late thirties, with hair cut in what would someday be known as the Karen style, and gaudy clothes to match. \u201cAin\u2019t you just the cutest little dolly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper struggled to free himself, but she had a death grip on him. \u201cLady, put me down. I\u2019m a minizora, not a doll!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. A\u2026 talking dolly?\u201d she gasped in faux shock. \u201cWell, you\u2019re just the best souvenir I could hope for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Dipper asked, more shocked by her audacity than afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the brochures played this town up like some big deal, but it\u2019s been disappointment after disappointment. And after that brute busted my car, the least I\u2019m owed is a little sweetie like you to keep me company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, lady, you know this is kidnapping, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffed dismissively. \u201cKidnapping only applies to people, sweetie. And since you don\u2019t have a barcode, that makes you free merchandise. My favorite.\u201d She tittered like she thought she was clever. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep you in my underwear drawer. Pull you out on those cold, lonely nights. If you\u2019re good, I might even feed you.\u201d She tittered again as she brazenly slipped a few fingers into the front of her pants for her captive to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Dipper was about to scream out, the woman covered his mouth with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ah, sweetie. No need to be making a ruckus. You\u2019re mine now.\u201d Then a hand appeared on Karen\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, but Ah believe ya were asked ta put the boy down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren spun around to see who had dared to touch her, adopting a haughty smirk like she owned the place. She was totally unimpressed by this younger woman\u2019s perkier tits, clothes that hugged her trim figure just right, pert buttocks, and a face that wasn\u2019t wrinkled from a lifetime of frowning. \u201cAnd who are you supposed to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Corduroy,\u201d Dipper called after briefly wiggling free, only to be silenced again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Sheela,\u201d Wendy\u2019s mom said with a smile to Dipper. That smile turned blood curdling when she switched to Karen. \u201cYa\u2019ll can call me Shiva, Destroyer \u2018f Worlds fer all Ah care. Jus\u2019 hand the boy over \u2018n\u2019 things don\u2019t have ta get messy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren, unused to such remarks, foolishly stood her ground. \u201cExcuse me, but are you the manager here? Because if you aren\u2019t, then you have no right to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do with my purchases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela made a sound of understanding. \u201cOh, Ah see. So Ah\u2019m dealing with this level of stupid today. Well fine. Ah\u2019ll try to put this in words you\u2019ll understand. Put the boy down, or else.\u201d For the briefest second, it almost looked like her eyes glowed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, ma\u2019am, I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot,\u201d Karen said hesitantly. She was finally sensing the danger she was in, though not the direction it was coming from. \u201cThis poor thing is called a minizernum. He\u2019s mine, you see. He\u2019s just throwing a little tantrum. Chronic liar, you see. I just need to get him home and put him to bed. He always feels better after a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela Corduroy just stood there, arms folded under her ample chest and looking thoroughly unamused. \u201cNow Ah\u2019m insulted that ya think Ah\u2019m that stupid.\u201d She extended her hand. \u201cThis is yer last chance. Hand over the boy, or Ah can\u2019t be held responsible fer what\u2019ll happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sneered and pulled Dipper close to her chest. \u201cOh please. If you lay one finger on me, I\u2019ll call the police and have you arrested. You can\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d Her smirk was triumphant and punchable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ah know,\u201d Sheela agreed, resigned to the inevitable. \u201cAh gave ya\u2019ll fair warnin\u2019, so now Ah\u2019m jus\u2019 gonna stand here \u2018n\u2019 watch her get busy.\u201d She gestured behind Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Karen could inquire further, it was like the whole isle dropped fifty degrees. The overweight woman brought her hands up to heat them with her breath. Her breath was visible. That\u2019s when Karen became aware of a presence behind her. Despite growing up in the luxuries of the suburbs, her inner animal finally awoke to the sensation of being hunted. She was being hunted by a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe predator was short, scrawny, with long hair and dressed like an adorable cupcake. Its hair flailed about like it was enchanted. In the now flickering florescent light, the predator\u2019s teeth had an eerie glow and her eyes seemed to have no pupils, yet there was no question where her death glare was fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren spun around, turning her back on Sheela. \u201cH-hey you. D-don\u2019t you come near me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe predator gave a long exhale, sending forth a white cloud that froze Karen\u2019s shoes to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela once more extended her hand into Karen\u2019s line of sight. \u201cThe boy,\u201d she said expectantly. \u201cLast chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-f-fine! Here.\u201d Karen roughly slapped Dipper into Sheela\u2019s hand. \u201cStupid tiny. Too ugly for my liking, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela snorted a surprised laugh as she tenderly comforted Dipper. \u201cWow. Ya know, the Darwin Award ain\u2019t actually a competition, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren just looked at the other woman in a perpetual sneer. \u201cWhat are you ta-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous roar shook through the isles. It was like an earthquake, shaking merchandise right off the shelves and causing most shoppers to fall. Karen only barely held her footing when she saw the beast charging for her, mouth open in a lust for blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela, deciding to be merciful, turned Dipper away from the carnage. She smiled sweetly down at him, petting his tiny shivering body. \u201cWell howdy there, cutie. Havin\u2019 a rough Summerween?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, a little,\u201d Dipper said distractedly, fighting with all his might not to stare at the woman\u2019s perfect boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t you worry none. Ya\u2019ll\u2019ve been in Gravity Falls long enough that folks recognize ya as one of our own. We ain\u2019t like them entitled twats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper snickered, once more getting sucked into the black hole that was Sheela\u2019s fantastic chest. \u201cYeah. You guys are\u2026 nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t half bad yerself, sweetie. Ohh, Ah could jus\u2019 eat ya\u2019ll up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a throat clearing. Down below, Mabel was looking up with her hand held out expectantly. Her rage state had passed, but her vacant expression showed that she was still very stressed and needed her comfort object returned. As for Karen, well, Mabel was just a kid who\u2019d acted in self-defense. It was probably fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the good and lovely neighbor she was, Sheela returned Dipper to his sister, making her spring back with light and life. Cordial greetings were exchanged and, in gratitude for her service, Mabel agreed to loan Dipper out to Sheela whenever she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I was sensing some bullshit for a while, but I draw the line at that last part,\u201d asserted Wendy. \u201cAin\u2019t no way Mabel would ever agree to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela giggled at her daughter\u2019s reaction as she arranged the decorations for the house. \u201cYer free ta think what ya want, but Ah\u2019m telling ya, that\u2019s exactly how it happened.\u201d She faced her daughter and pushed her boobs up. \u201cBoy couldn\u2019t tear his eyes off me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turned away with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t be down. There\u2019s no need to be jealous. After all, with yer genes, you\u2019ll look at least this good in a few more years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaaa!\u201d</span></div></div>",

The less said about that incident at the store, the better, but suffice to say that everyone got exactly what they deserved. \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have the best costumes, get the most candy,\u201d Dipper listed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd have the biggest stomach aches ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I\u2019ve never seen you guys so pumped,\u201d commented Soos in his luchador costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, back home, me and Dipper were kind of the kings of trick or treating,\u201d Mabel humbly bragged and pulled out a photo album to show Soos. \u201cTwins in costumes. The people eat it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoos, however, was wary. After turning off the lights and shining a flashlight under his chin for atmosphere, he told the kids about the Summerween Trickster. It was the local legend of a creature that eats children who lack the Summerween spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d Mabel asked of her shoulder boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper pulled out the journal. \u201cHmm. I\u2019m not seeing anything here, but this is number 3. The author could have written about it in one of the first two, but I don\u2019t think we should worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! We\u2019ve got spirit out the wazoo! Whatever that is.\u201d After popping a sweet in her mouth, Mabel unwrapped one for Dipper and he started coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! What is this stuff? I\u2019ve never even heard of these brands. Gummy chairs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. I never thought anything gummy could ever not be appetizing, but there it is,\u201d Mabel observed. \u201cThis is all cheapo loser candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet your discontent, children,\u201d Soos warned. \u201cLest the Trickster overhear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. Um, wow, this candy is sooo good,\u201d Dipper loudly called. Sitting on Mabel\u2019s shoulder, he tapped at her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh. Yeah. I just love-love-love it!\u201d Smiling, she stood and carried the bowl to the outside trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. It\u2019s sooo good, we\u2019re gonna be extra nice and share it with the raccoons. Because that\u2019s the spirited thing to do,\u201d announced Dipper as he watched the bowl be dumped of its undesirable contents. \u201cThere,\u201d he said in a more regular voice. \u201cThat should keep the Trickster satisfied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, dudes. Most kids I tell this story to just laugh it off. You dudes are pretty serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoos, after the stuff we\u2019ve seen in just the last month, I\u2019m starting to disbelieve in the concept of fiction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means he thinks all fantasy stories are actually real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least in Gravity Falls,\u201d Dipper amended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins went back to work putting the finishing touches on the Shack while the TV played in the background. It was some fluff piece about the latest celebrity gossip. Specifically, well-endowed actress Britney Javelin was walking around with her minizora boyfriend, Timothy Corvette, wedged between her boobs. The little guy was smiling and waving to the paparazzi, looking very snug and comfortable. His transport was absolutely eating up all the attention, posing for the cameras, and even messing with Timothy by playing with her boobs. It was like she was sending a message to all the women of the world, saying: \u2018Look at me. I\u2019ve got perfect tits that can please a minizora. What do you have?\u2019 Mabel tried to keep busy with her work, but her eyes kept returning to the screen as her thoughts ran wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang and Stan instructed whoever to give them the terrible candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink I can do this on my own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel frowned. \u201cWell, okay, but I\u2019m taking a sniper position on the roof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever makes you happy, sis.\u201d Dipper patted her cheek and was let down. The bowl was placed on the skateboard for easy transport and a minizora button by the door opened it for Dipper\u2019s convenience. \u201cHappy Summerw-whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Sup, squirt,\u201d Robbie grumbled, having traded his usual broken heart hoodie for a skeleton one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Dipper,\u201d Wendy greeted more warmly. Her hair was braided and she wore a tie-dye shirt and skirt, looking right out of Woodstock. \u201cLike my costume. Mom picked it out for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s insides clenched. \u201cOh, heh-heh, yeah. She\u2019s, uh, g-got good taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna guess what I am?\u201d invited Wendy. \u201cA lazy, good-for-nothing leech on society with terrible taste in music.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I was going to say hippy, but I guess your way is more accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy laughed. \u201cYeah. We just came by cuz I forgot my jacket, again,\u201d she added in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the candy?\u201d asked a resentful Robbie. \u201cYou going trick or treating or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned. \u201cUh, it\u2019s in a bowl, like the kind you give <i>out</i> to trick or treaters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Robbie. Of course, he\u2019s not going out trick or treating,\u201d Wendy added after retrieving her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper felt his insides clench and his pits grow sweaty. \u201cUm, yeah. T-trick or treating is for babies,\u201d he agreed with a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should come to this party with us. Tambry\u2019s parents are out of town and it\u2019s gonna be off the chain!\u201d Wendy deepened her voice for that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot surprised you didn\u2019t hear about it,\u201d Robbie said, dropping the flyer haphazardly over Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the minizora pulled himself free, the couple had left. He quickly read through all the details, pausing briefly on the provocatively posed witch stickers, and found that the party began at nine. He carried the flyer and raced out to catch up with the pair. \u201cHey, uh, maybe I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, if your sister\u2019ll let you,\u201d Robbie grumbled, earning an elbow to the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s at nine,\u201d Wendy called as they drove off. \u201cDon\u2019t forget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dipper turned back to the flyer, studying its suggestive implications and contemplating his choice, a shadow eclipsed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at nine?\u201d Mabel asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mabel!\u201d Dipper jumped. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasually she scooped her brother up in her open palm, carrying the flyer along for the ride. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a good shot at Robbie with Wendy in the way, but it sounded like something was going on at nine.\u201d When Dipper seemed reluctant to answer, Mabel finally took notice of the flyer and read. \u201cThis looks like a party.\u201d She leveled a flat stare at him. \u201cDid you agree to go to a party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe!\u201d Dipper stressed. \u201cI said maybe. You know, maybe, after we do our trick or treating, we could swing by the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding her brother in her open palm, Mabel folded her arms and tapped her foot impatiently. \u201cDipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just Wendy was there, and Robbie, and she said, of course, I wasn\u2019t trick or treating, and then-mmh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel pressed her thumb to Dipper\u2019s mouth. He could pull away whenever he wanted, but he took the cue to shut up. The big sister sighed her disappointment and then fixed her brother with a firm look. \u201cTrick or treating first. Party second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s expression lit up. \u201cY-yes! Yes, of course!\u201d He hugged Mabel\u2019s thumb. \u201cThank-you-thank-you-thank-you. You\u2019re the best sister ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled. \u201cYeah, I know. Now let\u2019s get changed. It\u2019s gonna be a looong night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they dress up as?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Candy and Grenda arrived shortly after the teens left, dressed as a piece of candy and a weight lifting witch respectively. Mabel, dressed as an ice cream sundae with sprinkles and a chocolate syrup hat, cheerfully introduced the rest. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame Waddles can\u2019t come with us. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s got some,\u201d she snickered, \u201cimportant meetings to attend.\u201d On cue, the pig walked in with a little business suit hanging around his neck. The other girls laughed at how adorable he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your brother?\u201d inquired Grenda, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel squealed. \u201cYou guys are gonna love Dipper\u2019s costume. It\u2019s literally the sweetest thing ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy scoffed. \u201cSweeter than me? I doubt it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna bet.\u201d When the others looked around, unable to spot him, Dipper whistled to call their attention to Mabel\u2019s head. There he climbed out from his hiding spot and stood tall, dressed as a big old cherry and striking a proud pose. \u201cFeast your eyes, ladies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy and Grenda were not prepared for such adorableness and each suffered an explosion of estrogen. Candy grabbed at her chest, seized up, and fell backward. Grenda, meanwhile, started moaning like a zombie and reached out for Dipper. \u201cMust. Have. Cherry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, back off sister.\u201d Mabel pushed Grenda back. \u201cNo touchy my Dippy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrenda shook her head and started looking around like she\u2019d just woken up. \u201cWhere\u2019d I go just now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, I think we might\u2019ve gone overboard this year,\u201d Dipper said in worry. \u201cTwins as an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top? This is not a power that man was meant to wield.\u201d He silently congratulated himself for saying all that with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp,\u201d wheezed Candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. Screw that. I\u2019m no man, and I say we use this power to conquer Summerween and take all the candy for ourselves! Mwahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it.\u201d Dipper got down and prepared the candy bowl while Mabel ran defense against the girls and Waddles. Upon opening the door, Dipper beheld a freakishly tall man in rags, a pointed hat, a creepy smiling mask, skin so dark it was almost purple, and a disgustingly sweet smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrick\u2026 or treat,\u201d intoned the wheezing man ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d Dipper couldn\u2019t press the door button fast enough, causing it to slam shut. For what it was worth, he even put his hands on the door to keep it closed. \u201cGrenda, help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it, cutie,\u201d agreed the big girl as she helped block the door, not questioning why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, what\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Trickster, Mabel! That was the Summerween Trickster. We can\u2019t let him in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe local girls all looked worried at the mention of the legend and even Candy finally got up. \u201cThe Trickster is real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s real in Gravity Falls!\u201d Dipper stressed. \u201cHow do you people not-\u201d He was cut off by a more urgent knocking at the door. \u201cAhh! He\u2019s found us! Maybe he operates on vampire rules and can\u2019t come in unless he\u2019s invited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, calm down,\u201d assured Mabel. \u201cSoos said he only eats kids who lack the Summerween spirit, and look at us. We\u2019re all in costume, minutes away from a fun night on the town, and you\u2019re so scared you look like you might pee your cherry. How much more Summerweeny could we get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others exchanged looks, slowly surrendering to Mabel\u2019s reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, just step aside and I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d Mabel shooed the others aside and threw the door open wide with her biggest and happiest grin. \u201cHello, friend. Me and my homies were just about to have a night of fun with-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d boomed the Trickster. \u201cYou have insulted me. And for this, you must pay\u2026 with your lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blinked and tried shifting to a happier face. \u201cOh, I get it. You\u2019re joking. Obviously, we\u2019re already at peak Summerween spirit. You\u2019re a funny guy, Mr. Trickster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny, am I?\u201d the Trickster wheezed, stepping inside and voiding Dipper\u2019s vampire theory. Then, just to prove that he was a mean spirited dick with no concern for even his own rules, the Trickster gobbled up some random kid in a pirate costume who\u2019d just walked up. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way for you to avoid his fate,\u201d intoned the Trickster as he reached out with his creepy long fingers and made the children back up. \u201cI neeed a treat. If you can collect 500 pieces of candy, and bring them to me before the last jackomellon goes out,\u201d he produced one from his shirt, lit a flame within with his thumb, and blew it out, \u201cI will let you live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Dipper demanded, stepping forward. \u201cWe\u2019re in costume. We were going to trick or treat just fine on our own. What\u2019s your deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAside from your rudeness, which is reason enough, one of you lacks the Summerween spirit.\u201d Through his mask he looked upon the guilty child, making their stomach sink in dread. \u201cThough at this point, it hardly matters. You have a choice, children. You must trick or treat\u2026 or die.\u201d He jumped high in the air, crawling like a squirrel over the roof before disappearing into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat-do-we-do!?\u201d Grenda screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys, what\u2019s goin\u2019 on out here?\u201d asked Soos. \u201cI heard a ruckus. Haha. That\u2019s a funny word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoos, I don\u2019t know what we did wrong, but we pissed off the Trickster, and now he\u2019s making us trick or treat or he\u2019s gonna eat us,\u201d summarized Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a picture.\u201d Candy showed Soos with her flip phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, dude. You guys are in crazy bonkers trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, let\u2019s think this through rationally,\u201d Dipper began. \u201cHe just wants the candy, right? There\u2019s still a bunch in the bowl. If we also get some from your parents,\u201d he gestured between Candy and Grenda, \u201cthen that\u2019ll give us enough of a head start to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Quessh*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Dipper jumped back from the impact sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper!\u201d Mabel picked him up, holding him tight as they all examined what had almost squished him. \u201cIs that\u2026 a jackomellon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like the Trickster\u2019s picky about where he gets his candy from,\u201d deduced Soos as they all looked around for where the projectile might have come from. \u201cSorry dudes, but you\u2019re playing on hard mode.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel clapped to draw all eyes back on her. \u201cListen up, people. Now some might say that being cursed by a bloodthirsty holiday monster is a bad thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wet myself,\u201d affirmed Grenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that monster messed with the wrong crew. With Candy\u2019s spirit, Grenda\u2019s strength, Dipper\u2019s smarts, and\u2026 Soos, we\u2019ll get 500 pieces of candy and have fun doing it too, even if it takes us all night!\u201d Everyone cheered as Mabel led the charge to Soos\u2019 truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, however, was less enthusiastic. \u201cAll night? Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Then Mabel\u2019s smile flipped. \u201cYou\u2019re not seriously thinking about the party, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Me? No, of course not. I mean, obviously trick or treat or die takes priority. Can\u2019t go to the party if I\u2019m dead,\u201d Dipper laughed nervously and rubbed his elbow. \u201cBut, you know, if there\u2019s time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel waved dismissively. \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. Maybe. Now let\u2019s go!\u201d She threw her fist up to signal the charge. \u201cFor candy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the youngsters gone, Stan was left to entertain himself by scaring the piss out of any who dared approach the Shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out in town, kids and a handful of parents were having a night of demanding sweets from strangers. Manly Dan looked to be having a lot of fun dressed as a Viking and leading his sons into \u2018battle\u2019. Even the cops had dressed up as each other. But there was one group who was especially motivated to get them some candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first house was Lazy Susan. She was dressed as a ball of yarn and covered in cats, but oblivious to the self-deprecating joke. She went down the line to make sure everyone was in costume. \u201cChimney sweep, elephant man, squeegee, a pile of snot,\u201d Mabel\u2019s eye twitched, \u201cand\u2026 what are you supposed to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned. \u201cI\u2019m a cherry. You know, like the kind that goes on an ice cream sundae.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m the sundae. Just so we\u2019re clear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks more like snot with a zit to me, but whatever.\u201d Lazy Susan then gave each of them a single piece of what they all agreed to be loser candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Our first house of the night is the sucky kind,\u201d groused Mabel. She turned to the girls. \u201cYou guys live here, so you lead the way. Take us to the best houses with the best candy. I\u2019m talking chocolate bars the size of semis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Mabel, I think quantity might matter more than quality tonight,\u201d Dipper gently reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, bro-say. Mabel is the co-king of Halloween, which means she settles for nothing less than the biggest and the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d asked the Trickster. He was sitting upon a flickering street light before planting his long, spindly feet down on Soos\u2019 shoulders. Down at their level, the creature reached into the shaking man\u2019s bag and pulled out his single candy to scrutinize. \u201cHmm. I\u2019ve seen better.\u201d He then absconded with the candy, along with Susan\u2019s jackomellon, hopped onto a nearby house, and blew out the candle. \u201cTick tock.\u201d And once more he vanished into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmaybe quantity isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Mabel conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they changed up their strategy. As it turned out, folks were willing to give out more candy to single kids rather than groups. Mabel and Dipper stuck together, laying it on thick with cute dances and poses. One man even cried a single tear of joy. With Soos pushing the wheel barrel, the gang was making excellent progress. Though they did almost suffer a collective heart attack at the sight of Toby. Something about the night made his face exponentially more frightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one other house stood out as particularly interesting. It was almost completely encased in spooky decorations, meaning that they most likely had the candy to match. Mabel rang the doorbell and got into the prime dancing position. But when the door opened, she tripped on her own feet. \u201cM-Mrs. Corduroy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hi, sugar pie,\u201d she beamed her elation. Sheela was dressed as a sexy vampire with heavy eyeshadow, hair dyed violet, and a dress that was so form-fitting it was like someone had stuck in a vacuum and sucked out all the air until it hugged every contour of her body. The front of her dress was open, showing off a heart-stopping amount of cleavage and stretching dangerously south of her navel. She squeaked in glee. \u201cOh, goodness! Don\u2019t ya\u2019ll jus\u2019 look like the sweetest treats Ah ever did see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel had to punch her chest to make sure she was still breathing. \u201cErhem. Yes. Um, thanks again for earlier.\u201d Her eyes kept being drawn down to the lovely woman\u2019s chest, filling the little girl with an internal turmoil she didn\u2019t fully understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeren\u2019t nothin\u2019, sugar. Ah\u2019m jus\u2019 sorry ya had ta go through with that in the first place. Must be tough bein\u2019 so desirable.\u201d She shot a playful wink at Dipper and tittered when his heart restarted. Then her nose crinkled and she turned a suspicious eye on the twins. \u201cYa\u2019ll didn\u2019t happen ta cross paths with a tall smelly fella, did ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you mean the Summerween Trickster, then yes,\u201d Dipper blurted, unable to keep anything from this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela rolled her eyes and clenched her fist. \u201cThat old fogey\u2019s still kickin\u2019? Bleh. This is why Ah wanna start an HOA. One second, kids. Ah\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She turned around, swaying her bootylicious rump as she went back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re staring,\u201d growled Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Wha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018wha\u2019, me. You were totally just staring at her boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s not the point. Grr! What is with guys and boobs? It\u2019s just stupid chest fat and suddenly you go totally gaga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well, at least I\u2019m not so gaga that I missed what she said about the Trickster. Mabel, she talked like she knew him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop trying to change the subject! Right now we\u2019re talking about you and your stupid obsession with boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy obsession? Mabel, I think you might be projecting a little, here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d she stomped her foot to the ground, plucked her brother off her head, and brought him up to her face in closed fingers. She held him close, squeezing to the point that it was hard to breathe, but didn\u2019t actually hurt. In the dim, flickering lights of the jackomellons, it almost looked like her eyes were shimmering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela cleared her throat, bringing all eyes back to her and her nonplussed expression. \u201cYa\u2019ll are obviously under a lot \u2018f stress right now. Ah won\u2019t pry, but Ah can make things a bit easier.\u201d She dropped a large sack in front of the twins. \u201cThe deal is fer 500 pieces \u2018f candy, right? Well, that\u2019s 312, every piece in the house. Ah want ya\u2019ll ta give that creeper what he wants \u2018n\u2019 try ta have a nice Summerween. Ya\u2019ll kids deserve it. Also, when ya give \u2018im the candy, tell that sugar golem Sheela Corduroy wants him out of Gravity Falls by sunup.\u201d Her expression softened and she bent down low, somehow showing off even more cleavage. \u201cThink ya\u2019ll can do that fer me?\u201d The twins nodded. \u201cGood. Well, have a happy Summerween,\u201d she waved goodbye before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper pointed. \u201cSee! She knows something. Quick, ring the doorbell again so we can-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no!\u201d Mabel grabbed the bag, huffing and stomping her way back to the street. \u201cWhy are we even bothering? This night is ruined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Mabel.\u201d Dipper patted her fingers. \u201cMabel, talk to me. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou. You\u2019re what\u2019s wrong. First, you try to ditch me to a stupid party cuz of Wendy\u2019s boobs, Lazy Susan called me snot, then Sheela shook her big tits at you, and all night I\u2019ve seen everyone else laughing and having fun while I\u2019m not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMABEL!\u201d Dipper shouted with show-stopping force. He quickly lowered his volume to something softer. \u201cMabel, you were so gung-ho about trick or treating, even with \u2018die\u2019 at the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t, okay,\u201d she sniffled, wiping her face on her sleeve. \u201cI was just acting like people expect cuz I didn\u2019t want to ruin everyone\u2019s special night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 why didn\u2019t you tell <i>me</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel looked like she was about to answer, but then the others showed up, so she got cleaned up and put her happy face back on. In total, they\u2019d collected over 700 pieces of candy, enough to satisfy the Trickster and hopefully have plenty leftover. Dipper, however, convinced the others to give him and Mabel some space so they could keep talking. Grenda and Candy went to do a little more trick or treating, Soos went to fetch his truck, and the twins stayed back to guard the candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper now stood in Mabel\u2019s open palm. \u201cTalk to me, sis. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-do you think Wendy\u2019s prettier than me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper pursed his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s like comparing gummy candy to chocolate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd which do you like more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, you\u2019re my sister. I\u2019ve been with you since before I can even remember, and I probably loved you longer. No one is going to change that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why were you going to ditch me for the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I told you, like, the minute Wendy left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly cuz I forced you. You were totally planning on ditching me,\u201d she accused with rising ire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. Okay, maybe I was tempted at first, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ha! You admit it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t. I chose the both of you. Isn\u2019t that what all of this is supposed to be about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when tensions were at their highest, Robbie drove up with Wendy in shotgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Dipper. Mabel. Those are\u2026 some\u2026\u201d The redhead went bug-eyed. \u201cThat is the most adorable thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie was unimpressed. \u201cYou two losers aren\u2019t going to the party like that ar-yahahow!\u201d he cried as Wendy administered a purple nurple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are comin\u2019 though, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper looked between the two women of his life. One was biting her lip while seemingly hypnotized by something, and the other looked ready to blow her top any moment. \u201cUy, I\u2019m gonna have to take a raincheck on that.\u201d Swallowing his nerve, he added, \u201cMabel and I still have some heavy trick or treating to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Wendy sounded hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, definitely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay.\u201d Wendy stopped hurting Robbie and slumped in her seat as the pair drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, Mabel. In the end, you needed me more. Besides, there\u2019ll be other parties. Plenty of chances to hang out with Wendy and-and I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Then, taking the bag that Sheela had given her, she blindly swung it around and hit the wheel barrel, sending them both into the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, okay!\u201d She dropped down, brought her knees in, and started crying. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving hopped onto her knee, Dipper put aside all other concerns and sat down as well. The candy could wait. Summerween could wait. Wendy could wait. Right now, there was only Mabel. He touched her face and smiled softly when she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m angry, Dipper,\u201d she sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m angry even when I\u2019m happy and I don\u2019t know why. At first, I thought I was okay with you going after Wendy, but now thinking about it makes me all confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel pulled back. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked if you want me to stop. Look, Mabel, if me liking Wendy is hurting you then\u2026 then I\u2019ll stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel scowled. \u201cDipper, you can\u2019t just turn love off like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe it isn\u2019t love. Maybe it\u2019s just a passing crush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, a two-way crush. Did you seriously just miss the way she was looking at you?\u201d Mabel demanded. \u201cI swear, if it was just you two alone, she\u2019d rip you right out of that cherry and start making out here and now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Dipper\u2019s turn to flinch at this unexpected revelation. There was a lot to unpack there. \u201cWait, so, you\u2019d be fine with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think it really matters what I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it matters to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t get in the way of your love life, Dipper. You and Wendy would make such a cute couple.\u201d She sounded almost urging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper just looked thoughtful as he tried to process all this. \u201cThen\u2026 what can I do to make you less angry? You know you\u2019re prettier when you smile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel buried her face back in her sleeves to hide her grin. \u201cShut up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you like to spend the rest of the night shoved down my panties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Seven fifty, even split.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make any sense,\u201d Mabel laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been trying to learn to speak Mabel, but I can never get the accent right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing uncontrollably, Mabel seized her brother and held him tight to her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re such a goofus,\u201d she tittered. \u201cYou make me so mad, I just wanna kiss you all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on. Is this regular happy, or angry happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpen palm, she held Dipper out in front of her. \u201cI\u2019ve got the best brother in the world trying to cheer me up. I\u2019m happy enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, cuz as your brother, I\u2019m going to keep bugging you about this until we figure it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled. \u201cThat\u2019s all I need,\u201d she sighed, finally feeling at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d asked Grenda, startling the twins. \u201cNot to break up this cute moment, but where\u2019s the candy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it must still be in the bushes. Come over here. I\u2019ll show ya.\u201d Wiping her face clean, Mabel pushed the shrubbery aside. Her gut and expression immediately dropped like stones as she watched the bag and what remained of the barrel\u2019s candy floating down the stream. \u201cUh oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, it was, um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, the jackomelons!\u201d Dipper deflected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seriously, all the lights were going out. All save one. The kids all rushed McGucket to steal his hollowed gourd, but their collective sighs of relief blew out the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a single blinking streetlight left on, the Trickster stepped out from the dark and knocked on the air. \u201cKnock, knock,\u201d he wheezed, resuming his approach. \u201cSo, children. Where\u2019s my candyyy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear we had all 500 pieces!\u201d Dipper pleaded. \u201cHell, we had 700. This nice lady-\u201d He remembered. \u201cSheela Corduroy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Trickster stopped. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-Sheela Corduroy. She said she wanted you out of Gravity Falls by sunup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSunup, aye?\u201d Then the Trickster started to laugh. \u201cMwahahaha! HA-HA-HA! Plenty of time.\u201d The monster grew tall. It\u2019s back swelled out of his shirt until an extra pair of arms burst out. Now more than twice its original size, the Trickster snatched up all four children and wheezed its terrible, sickly laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Soos drove up in his truck, hitting the Trickster and smashing it to bits. When everyone was satisfied that they weren\u2019t hurt, the kids all ran up to the very anxious hero of the hour. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t, like, a regular pedestrian, was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Soos. That was the Trickster. And you saved us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy killing it,\u201d Mabel added. \u201cYou killed it to death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone loaded up on the truck and they departed for somewhere to rest for the evening, not noticing how the chunks of monster moved across the ground and fused back together. In no time the Trickster had regained his full mass, now with a body like an eggplant with stick arms and a narrow head. The only bit of clothing he had left was his mask and he hissed as his instincts told him exactly where his prey was. But before he could resume his chase, he felt a presence. He turned to see a woman, lavishly dressed, and carrying a glass of what looked like wine in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh wouldn\u2019t do that if Ah was you, honey bun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-Sheela?\u201d the Trickster said in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy there, Tricky,\u201d she greeted with a friendly wave. \u201cFancy seein\u2019 ya\u2019ll here, in <i>mah</i> town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this is Summerween. For this one night, all of Gravity Falls is my turf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMighty tall claim.\u201d She took a sip of her drink. \u201cThink ya can back it up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, nothing happened. A standoff was in play between the voluptuous Sheela Corduroy, and the grotesque Summerween Trickster. Then the silence was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFilthy sugar golem,\u201d Sheela spat, swirling her drink. \u201cAll the little feelings of disgust as kids threw away their unwanted candy, all added up to one hideous waste of space. Your whole existence is a bad joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d allowed the Trickster. \u201cBut tonight, it\u2019s a joke on everyone\u2019s lips. That belief gives me power; power enough to trounce the likes of you, witch.\u201d He shook his fist at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is mah final warning, Tricky. Leave Gravity Falls \u2018n\u2019 never come back. Cuz if Ah catch you after the sun rises, well, you know what\u2019ll happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, very well. I\u2019ll leave. This town was getting too small for me, anyway. Think I\u2019ll go restart my legend elsewhere. However, I still have one last curse to cast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou leave those kids alone!\u201d Sheela stomped her foot down, leaving a small dent in the gravel. \u201cOr Ah swear Ah\u2019ll hunt you down for the remainder of yer short existence!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Trickster just laughed. \u201cTry me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I hope everyone is feeling okay now that the danger has passed.\u201d As Candy finished speaking, everyone but her face-palmed. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou jinxed it,\u201d Grenda answered. \u201cBad Candy. Bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, dudes,\u201d Soos said, checking the rearview mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster was back in pursuit. It hobbled a little, almost like it had a limp, but it was still faster than any motor vehicle. The Trickster leaped into the air and jumped down on the truck, denting the roof as it maneuvered to block the front. Soos managed to swerve and knock it into a lamppost, breaking it. However, he lost control and drove straight into the store from earlier. Everyone hid as the monster followed after them and began its search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I was trying to be delicate before, but this is serious,\u201d Grenda whisper hissed. \u201cMabel, did something happen to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy narrowed her eyes on the minizora, though her words were directed at Mabel. \u201cI hope no one was stupid enough to hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, this is seriously not a good time,\u201d Dipper stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this needs to be said,\u201d Mabel relented. \u201cGuys, I\u2019m sorry for how I acted tonight. I\u2019ve been kind of moody for a while. I know it\u2019s no excuse, but I want you to understand that\u2026 that when the Trickster said one of us didn\u2019t have the Summerween spirit, I\u2019m pretty sure he meant me. I understand if you guys don\u2019t want to hang out with me anymore after this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy adjusted her glasses. \u201cNo offense, Mabel, but you are quite stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. The whole point of being friends is to stick together through the hard times. We\u2019ve been trick or treating together all night, and you think we\u2019d abandon you now? Honestly, I\u2019m insulted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sniffled, fighting a losing battle against her tears. \u201cYou guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I just thought of something.\u201d Dipper tapped his foot to Mabel\u2019s neck. \u201cIf this thing can sense spirit, how come he hasn\u2019t found us yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dude. Looks to me like he ain\u2019t walkin\u2019 straight.\u201d As Soos spoke, the Trickster tripped on its own feet and knocked over a display. \u201cMaybe he hit his head and now there\u2019s a screw loose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably the truck,\u201d reasoned Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to find its prey, the Trickster roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to escape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if it sees us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only there was something we could use to cover our bodies and faces with. You know, like a disguise,\u201d suggested Soos. However, while everyone was in awe and waited for the mic to drop, Soos disappointingly proved to be just as oblivious as he sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children and man-child did manage to find alternate costumes to resemble inanimate decorations. Following video game logic, they moved only when the Trickster had its back turned and froze when it looked their way. It was working and they almost made it out. Unfortunately, just when it looked like they were home free, Soos soosed up by tapping a singing skeleton head. The Trickster appeared behind him, opened its enormously grotesque mouth, and swallowed the big guy in one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel let out an unearthly shriek and charged in a blind rage towards the monster. After the night she\u2019d had so far, she was in no mood to lose anyone. While she scurried around its arms, breaking them with her bare hands while they kept reforming, the others armed. Whatever those fake Medieval weapons were made of, they were definitely not child-friendly as the kids hacked away. Dipper, remembering the Multibear, had Candy throw him approximately where the monster\u2019s groin was in the hopes of hitting the weak point. However, as he trudged through the gooey stickiness, something became apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel spat after biting through the Trickster\u2019s elbow. \u201cBleh! Saltwater taffy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper tripped and face planted on the monster\u2019s flesh. \u201cCandy corn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d Having recovered from the surprise attack, the Trickster once more grabbed up all the kids. Candy, Grenda, and Dipper had to share one hand since two were needed to restrain both Mabel\u2019s body and mouth. The last hand removed the Trickster\u2019s mask. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize me? Look at my face. Look\u2026 closely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped. \u201cLoser candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Trickster was made up entirely of unpopular candy. Like any good villain, with the heroes unable to escape, he exposited his backstory. He was made up of all the candy the kids of Gravity Falls ever threw away, so now he seeks revenge for their pickiness. \u201cNo one would eat me, so now I\u2019m going to eat you.\u201d Then he started to scream and writhe in agony. Something was moving deep in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoos burst forth, squealing like a mad pig as he held a large pulsing clump of candy. He pushed it out further, severing the strands that connected it to the main body. As a result, the Trickster fell over, spewing sugary gore as he dropped the children. Soos, meanwhile, sat atop his fallen enemy and casually ate his internal organs. \u201cDudes, you want some of this?\u201d he asked with a level of casualness that frightened the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d wheezed the Trickster. \u201cYou think I taste\u2026 good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I ever wanted was for someone to say that I was\u2026 good.\u201d Crying candy tears of joy, the Trickster stopped fighting and finally passed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the other kid emerged from the corpse, having somehow remained inside and unharmed even after the truck impact. Soos\u2019 truck was still in reasonable order, so they all took it and left, calling it a night. Back at the Shack, everyone found Stan looking very pleased with himself for scaring some trick or treaters, along with a certain someone carving a jackomellon in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy,\u201d Dipper greeted excitedly, only to pause and check with Mabel. She smiled appreciatively of his consideration and carried him over. \u201cHow was the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Lame. The highlight was Robbie eating a lollipop stick first and needing to go to the hospital. Honestly, I think I would\u2019ve had more fun trick or treating with you guys.\u201d She sighed wistfully. \u201cI miss those days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we could have used your help,\u201d Mabel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe fought the Summerween Trickster!\u201d Grenda cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy straightened her glasses. \u201cIt was a harrowing and stressful ordeal, but we have emerged stronger for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy blinked and looked at Dipper. \u201cSeriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to throw away unwanted candy ever again,\u201d he avowed. \u201cFrom now on, we\u2019re throwing it into the fire so it can\u2019t come back and get us later. Also, Soos ate him from the inside out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turned to Soos who was smacking his lips from an apparently delicious aftertaste. \u201cWhy do you guys get all the fun?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Manly Dan was a mighty proud father. His children had claimed a mighty haul of treasure this year. So much so that they were having a hard time carrying it all, which was probably the best kind of problem one could have. They didn\u2019t complain, though. They\u2019d seen that one group with the wheel barrel, but not one mentioned regret at not bringing one themselves. This made Dan proud. Hard work, he\u2019d taught them, was its own reward. The candy was just a bonus. They\u2019d learned this lesson well and it almost moved him to manly tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, dad,\u201d said Gus, the youngest of his sons. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like some kind of speedbump, but really weirdly shaped,\u201d added Kevin, the middle son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d do construction tonight. Maybe it fell off a truck,\u201d reasoned the eldest son Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManly Dan, after his eyes adjusted to the dim light, recognized the voluptuous shape and his face went pale. \u201cUh, kids, let\u2019s hurry home.\u201d He started pushing them away from the scene. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to sort out your candy so it\u2019ll last a few weeks. Remember to share,\u201d he added, finally getting them to their front door. Luckily it was unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna help us, dad?\u201d asked Gus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot right now, my sons. Dad, uh, needs to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin pushed the door open and noticed the absence of a constrictive hug threatening to suffocate him in soft, womanly flesh. \u201cAnd where\u2019s mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad has to go find mom,\u201d Dan answered honestly enough. \u201cShe probably saw Wendy\u2019s new boyfriend and has him pinned up a tree somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys laughed, accepting the plausibility of this explanation without question, and headed inside. Once the door was shut, Dan sprinted over to the scene of the incident. The gravel road was a mess with chunks of debris torn up and scattered all over the place. At the epicenter, in a modest crater, was the back of a woman. Her front half was submerged in the ground. Her formfitting dress had been torn to shreds, barely containing her curvaceous figure. In fact, it was that rounded booty that Dan recognized as his wife\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, can you hear me?\u201d Dan boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing his voice, Sheela started twitching and making sounds. Unfortunately, the road muffled her voice and she was wedged in too deep to get any leverage to pull herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey. I got ya!\u201d Dan stabbed his fingers to either side of his wife\u2019s waist, wrapped them around her childbearing hips, and carefully extricated her from the ground. Chunks of rock fell all around her as she coughed and sputtered. The front of her dress was even worse than the back and something the kids were not ready to see. Though to be fair, no kid was ever ready to see their mom in such a state. Cradling his wife bridal style, he tapped on her cheek. \u201cSpeak to me, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela groaned. \u201cAh\u2019m in tremendous pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that.\u201d Dan looked her up and down, already imagining all the terrible things he would do to whoever did this to his beloved. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela coughed and spat out some gravel mixed with blood. \u201cIt was\u2026 Tricky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Trickster?\u201d Dan said in alarm. \u201cI thought you took care of that monster already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh did, too,\u201d Sheela groaned. She curled up against her husband\u2019s chest, finding comfort in his warm muscles. \u201cAh might be gone for a few months. You understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d Dan grimly agreed, knowing full well what had happened and what his wife was honor-bound to do. It was a tragic thing, but justice needed to be served. \u201cWho was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela pressed herself tighter into her husband. \u201cWendy\u2019s friends. The Pines twins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPines? The tiny boy and his demon attack dog?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela looked up, confused by her husband\u2019s tone. \u201cYes. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just saw them not a few minutes ago. They were driving with that chipmunk guy from the Mystery Shack. Pretty sure I heard them laughing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few minutes?\u201d Sheela\u2019s eyes darted around as she processed this. \u201cAh was down there for a good half hour, at least.\u201d Her expression of embittered sorrow quickly morphed to one of joy. \u201cSo then\u2026 they survived! Ye-haw!\u201d With new energy she jumped up and wrapped her arms around Dan\u2019s neck, peppering his face with kisses. She then regretted her emotional outburst. \u201cYikes! Ow, ow, ow,\u201d she winced while slipping back to her more relaxed position. \u201cThis can only mean\u2026 they beat \u2018im,\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose kids and the fat guy beat the Trickster?\u201d Dan asked, barely able to believe it. Then he looked down at the woman in his arms and smiled. \u201cLet me guess. You softened him up for \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if I did, that\u2019s still a hell of a thing,\u201d Sheela intoned. \u201cAh knew there was somethin\u2019 Ah liked about those kids. Looks like they\u2019ve got a lot more goin\u2019 for \u2018em than jus\u2019 bein\u2019 cute,\u201d she giggled, looking around. \u201cThe boys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt home sorting candy. I told \u2018em you were giving Wendy\u2019s new boyfriend a rough time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela smiled contentedly at her husband\u2019s reliable and rugged face. \u201cYou always know just what to say.\u201d She lifted her head and puckered up, but didn\u2019t make it too far before Dan met her halfway. The kiss wasn\u2019t terribly long, but it was enough to quiet her aches enough that it no longer hurt to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManly Dan snickered and motioned down past his wife to the road. \u201cThat\u2019s some mark you left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela had to bite her lip to keep from bursting out in laughter. Down in the ground, in the middle of the crater, was a near-perfect impression of her luscious body. Her face was a little obscure, but her tits were clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe a shame to lose such a lovely work of art,\u201d Dan said, having never given a single dam about art in his life (except for the drawings his kids made). \u201cAfter I chuck you through the window so the kids don\u2019t have to see, want me to come back, dig it out, and hang it on the wall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheela slammed her face into her husband\u2019s plastic chest piece, denting it as her muffled laughs reverberated through his body. When she\u2019d finally gotten control of herself, she pulled her face out and wiped away the tears. \u201cYou know we can\u2019t do that. What would the neighbors think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Dan conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re keeping it in the secret basement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Dan didn\u2019t give his wife a chance to reply before encompassing her lips with his own. He walked her back to their home, carrying her just as he\u2019d done on their wedding day. And, just like their wedding day, he made good on his word by hurling her like a javelin through the window, where she landed perfectly on the bed. Manly Dan knew his wife, and knew that she liked it rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should we follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hot shower felt amazing as the water droplets cascaded down Mabel\u2019s body. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m being bombarded by a thousand tiny Dipper hands all giving me a massage,\u201d she breathlessly thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a request? Because it sounded like a request.\u201d Dipper was in Mabel\u2019s hand, fingers closed so that he didn\u2019t get knocked down. It was currently his turn with the washcloth, which he was using to get under his pits from a long night of fear sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d Mabel took the cloth from Dipper and pressed his body to her chest. Her hand was gentle yet firm as she rubbed him against her sensitive chest. She moaned as his expert little hands got to work in kneading her skin in the way he knew she liked. However, she was so caught up in the sensation that she didn\u2019t give him much time to focus on an area before moving him around. He was like one of those handheld massage machines and she was just too impatient to feel him everywhere that she needed attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was only slightly annoyed at not being able to give each area its due focus as he would have liked. However, if this was what Mabel needed, then he would comply. Instead of deep presses, he switched to a lighter touch, trying to match the movement of her hands to ensure maximum skin contact. Her fair skin was smooth against his own and his erection was quickly triggered, which just made Mabel moan all the louder. Even so, as lovely as this moment was, Dipper still felt the need to address the elephant in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s movements slowed, but they didn\u2019t stop as she ran Dipper through a tour across her chest and belly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever leave me, Dipper, but everyone says you have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur therapist, mom and dad, and now Stan. They say we need to be our own people and that we can\u2019t do that if we don\u2019t start getting some distance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed, having heard the same arguments. They all made sense and were coming from a place of genuine concern. \u201cI don\u2019t think making distance means being apart. Mom and dad do a bunch of different stuff. He likes bowling and she likes knitting. They also have different jobs, but they always come back to each other at the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel stopped using her brother as a soap bar and held him out to see her smile. \u201cBut can we have that? If we each get married, are we gonna live in some kind of duplex? Will our spouses be okay with us sharing each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the fantasy the twins had always shared. Marrying each other had never really been on the table. For as much as they loved one another, there was always the understanding that their hearts yearned for that little bit extra, those lovers who were just lovers and not also siblings. It made perfect sense to them. They thought of themselves more like siblings with benefits. Their therapist had struggled to understand, but their parents were far more accepting. The pair had never shown the serious affection they shared in public, but neither did they really try hiding it. What they had was more of an open secret. Dipper was a minizora and people just had certain assumptions for how he was and should be treated. Thanks in part to old customs and popular media, most folks just assumed that Dipper was Mabel\u2019s sex toy, a plaything that she kept on her for convenience, rather than a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you do with Wendy?\u201d Mabel asked after Dipper took too long. \u201cLet\u2019s say you got the balls to finally confess and she was into it. What would you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper shot her a playful smirk. \u201cWith or without you watching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith. Doy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sat back in Mabel\u2019s cupped palm and started stroking himself while she watched. \u201cI\u2019d be a gentleman and start with a kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA full-body kiss?\u201d Mabel asked, turning off the shower and carrying him to be dried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It\u2019d start small. My lips on hers and hers over my head,\u201d Dipper chuckled. \u201cThen maybe she\u2019d bring out her tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about her boobs?\u201d Mabel asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you want her to stick you in her chest? Maybe squish you around like they do on TV?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper winced, worried that this may still be a sore subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be okay with it,\u201d Mabel assured as she toweled off, careful not to jostle Dipper. \u201cIf I was there watching, it means she\u2019s accepted you, including the part that\u2019s mine,\u201d she giggled, set the towel aside, and touched her free hand to her chest. \u201cI\u2019d want to see it. I\u2019d want to see you totally at her mercy as she squishes you around, and I\u2019d want her to describe it. How does his squirming feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d Dipper beckoned Mabel down. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to taste. Come on. I\u2019m on her boobs. They\u2019re so big and soft, but also sensitive like yours. It feels just as good for her when I move around, so maybe you can help. C\u2019mon Mabel, help a guy out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in the fantasy, Mabel licked her lips and dropped her mouth down onto her palm. Dipper\u2019s taste was distinct, but she imagined her hand as something else. It was Wendy\u2019s boob flesh, warm and probably salty from sweat. Mabel made multiple \u2018nom\u2019 sounds as she licked, forcing Dipper back instead of pulling him in. \u201cSo\u2026 big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Dipper strained to say as the oral muscle had its way with him. Based on her going for a wide area instead of concentrating on his underwear region, the minizora had a good idea of what she was imagining. \u201cBig and soft?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig as my fist,\u201d Mabel cooed as the imagined taste rippled across her sensitive taste buds, almost eclipsing the sharp implement stabbing into her organ. \u201cI want my whole mouth around it.\u201d Her maw engulfed her whole palm, finally pulling Dipper in and submitting him to a proper tongue bathing. \u201cNnngh! So good,\u201d she said around her mouthful. Then, surprising herself, she sat on the bed and spat out her tiny morsel before finishing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-why\u2019d you do that?\u201d Dipper answered tiredly, a big goofy grin on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sharing, remember,\u201d Mabel cooed. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be hers, then you\u2019ve got to seal the deal and make her <i>yours</i>, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me there,\u201d Dipper demanded. \u201cWith your mouth. I want you to put me there and your tongue to push me in. I want to hear her moan all around me, but I want to hear you, too. Your hands can be wherever, but I want us all to get off together. I want us to cum, me and her, but I want you to taste it. I want to come gushing out of her and into your mouth.\u201d His hand found its way to his cock. \u201cThen\u2026 then I want you two to clean me off together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so gross,\u201d Mabel giggled breathlessly, her other hand where Dipper couldn\u2019t see. Her fingers were probing deep while also paying special attention to her little nub. She imagined another Dipper down there, stirring her up, but there was also Wendy to take care of. \u201cYou want me to make out with another girl while her juices are in my mouth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper arched his back as he pumped away at his slickened member. \u201cI want all three of us to make out. I want your tongues all around me, holding me. And I want you to t-touch each other. Grab her boobs while she grabs your butt, or whatever. I just want us all in the moment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take it anymore, Mabel slapped her hand to her lips and brought Dipper back in. Her tongue fought with his hand for control of his prick. Somehow he tasted even better than usual, possibly still mixed with the imaginary flavors. Mabel stuck two fingers in her mouth and suckled like they were another tongue, the tongue of another girl that she was making out with. Finally, it all became too much for the both of them. Dipper released his delicious seed upon her tongue, pushing her over the edge as she made a mess on her fingers. Luckily she\u2019d had the foresight to sit on the towel beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel collapsed against the sheets, naked and breathless. Her brother was allowed to ooze his way out, dropping with a wet plop beside her. She smiled at his naked butt. \u201cThat would be the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it would.\u201d Dipper flipped himself over and stared up at the happy giantess. \u201cStill want to make it happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marco ran as fast as he could towards his home, hoping with all his heart and soul that he wasn\u2019t too late. He had been fearing this day for so long, living in terror when he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop the one thing that would destroy his life and maybe the lives of everyone on Earth. He had to get home and do something before it was too late! As he burst through his front door, rushing upstairs in a blind panic, he nearly tripped over one of the laser puppies. Jumping over the magically created dogs, he dashed towards Stars room and threw open the door. He nearly screamed as he saw that he was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarco! Why didn\u2019t you tell me about this Internet thingy?\u201d Star asked as she stared at the screen of a laptop that Janna had let her borrow that came with full Internet availability. Star gaining access to the Internet was the scariest thing Marco could imagine, the power to look up any information, any video, anything she wanted, scared him beyond belief. Star was already a rebellious soul that always looked for action, he could just imagine her getting into a real flame war online that involved someone being burned alive. He knew he might be overreacting just a bit; he did tend to freak out at certain things, but Star was so impressionable. She had nearly got them both killed because of fortune cookies. He just had to hope that she didn\u2019t find anything that could lead her to any dark places on the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Janna left me all these windows with something called porn. Sounds exotic,\u201d Star laughed as she checked out what had been left for them by their friend. Marco slumped back against the wall, crying into the sleeve of his hoodie. Why Janna? Why!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. Bondage, looks like some of the stuff my mom tried to make me wear under my dress. Feet, why feet but no shoes? Milf, hey this lady looks like your mom, Marco. Shemale, this lady looks like you when you put on a dress, Marco. Vore\u2026.\u201d Star listed off the things that Janna had left for her, delighted if not confused by all of them. The images of perversion didn\u2019t faze her much, Star wasn\u2019t some shy little village girl that didn\u2019t know a cock from a codpiece. She took everything in stride, except vore. That one made her pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco whimpered as Star got up and brought the laptop over to him, her eyes firmly planted on the screen. She knelt down in front of Marco, turning the computer around so he could see the heavily edited images of someone eating another person. Star finally looked at him, her eyes big and glittery as excitement overwhelmed her. \u201cYou never told me humans could do this! It\u2019s awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStar, we can\u2019t. The images are fake. Vore isn\u2019t real,\u201d Marco explained slowly and carefully. He glanced at the screen, blushing at some of the more erotic pictures the site provided. It was interesting porn, but pure fantasy as Star should know. People couldn\u2019t eat each other, it's completely impossible. Star looked at him like she didn\u2019t believe him for a second before realizing he had no reason to lie. Her excitement died down and she plopped down on her butt, her head upturned as she stared up at the ceiling and let out a loud groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat really stinks. Shoving an entire person into yourself and feeling them wiggle around just sounds like a lot of fun,\u201d Star sighed. She also thought it sounded pretty hot, but Marco already looked pretty embarrassed, and if she admitted that he might just freak completely out. She didn\u2019t understand why he was so worried, so she discovered this online thing and discovered all these perverted things. If he could see some of the stuff that went on in Mewni after dark he\u2019d understand why this was nothing to get worked out about. Humans were a bit perverted, but they had nothing on the inhabitants of her dimension or some of the more wilder ones out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Star. It\u2019s just a fantasy. Humans can\u2019t eat each other, and nothing is going to change that. We are not going to magically learn how to do something that is completely impossible,\u201d Marco laughed softly. The instant he said that Star leaped to her feet with her smile returning bigger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut maybe it can be learned magically,\u201d Star slowly said, her grin threatening to overcome her face as an idea came to her mind. Before Marco to stop her, she rushed over to the Book of Spells by her bed and started going through it. She sped past pages she had already read and went right to the more forbidden spells. Marco held his breath, praying that she wouldn\u2019t be able to find anything to help. It seems whatever gods out there weren\u2019t listening because Star let out a happy squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it is! It\u2019d known as the \u2018Snake Mouth Spell\u2019 but it's vore. A spell to allow anyone to eat anyone else without any problems. I can cast it to give the power of vore to anyone, you, me, Janna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Janna?\u201d Marco said, the words just coming out of his mouth at the mention of the crazy girl. Giving such power to Janna seemed like the absolute worst idea ever. She would so eat him the first chance she got. If anyone should eat him it should be Jackie. At that last thought, he shook his head, now was not the time to be thinking these kinds of things. He had to do something fast before Star made a huge mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, the spell goes like this,\u201d Star said as she lifted her wand up and start to slowly speak the words that would cast the spell. As soon as she started the light in the room started to dim and thunderclouds formed outside. The wand glowed with an eerie light red as the spell began and fearing the worst, Marco did perhaps the dumbest thing of his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d Without thinking, Marco grabbed the wand in Star\u2019s hand just as she was finishing her spell. She tried to stop but it was too late. With both of them clutching the powerful magical wand a blinding light exploded around them throwing them both back and sending the wand clattering to the floor. Groaning, the teens slowly got up the spell seemingly complete. Rubbing the back of his head, Marco could only ask one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck just happened?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey there, folks. Lincoln Loud here,\u201d said the white haired boy to the audience in one of his typical episode opening fourth wall breaks. \u201cAnd welcome to this pornographic alternate reality of the Loud House. You\u2019re probably wondering what makes this different from the regular Loud House. Well, I\u2019ll tell ya. See, my mom and sisters are what we call predators. They\u2019re humans who can consume other humans alive and whole in pretty much whatever way they want. You might think that\u2019s a little odd and no doubt have some questions, so I\u2019ll try my best to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, when a predator consumes live prey, digestion is optional. If, for example, mom were to swallow me, she could just hold me in her belly for as long as she wants. It\u2019s actually pretty cozy in there. Mostly my family just vores people for fun, like as favors to friends, or how Bobby usually ends up inside Lori whenever one visits the other.\u201d Lincoln paused as he stared at the fourth wall. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. Vore is a lot of fun for both the consumer and consumed, even erotic depending on how you do it. And since most people in this house can vore, we have what you might call a very laid back attitude when it comes to promiscuity, both with each other and anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigestion does happen, but it\u2019s perfectly legal. It\u2019s the job of predators to help counter overpopulation, but preds are less than 1 in 1,000 of the world population. And if I\u2019m being honest, preds have legal protection to do pretty much whatever they want. Luckily, mom is there to keep the family in line. Digestion is only allowed for bad people and volunteers, although Lola and Lynn Jr. are the biggest offenders there, often needing to be grounded after their competition <i>mysteriously disappears</i>,\u201d Lincoln said with air quotes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that everyone in town is so accepting of us. Predators do what predators do, although it\u2019s generally frowned on to digest the kids your babysitting. Not good for repeat customers and all that. Also no one is allowed to vore teachers just because they do things like give out homework. Also-also, no one is allowed to digest each other\u2019s friends. As a result, we all have a <i>lot</i> of \u2018friends\u2019 who try to suck up in the hopes of staying off the menu, but there\u2019s also plenty of people who genuinely like us for us. Most of the time, folks just treat us normally. It\u2019s only when stomachs start growling that things get awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for volunteers, that happens more often than you\u2019d think. There\u2019s FindAPred.com that\u2019s kinda like a dating service. People can apply to be vored by predators in their area. They get to choose things like how they want to be consumed, whether or not they want to be digested, if they want sex, and some other options. They pay the pred to live out their biggest fantasy and the pred gets a fatter wallet with the possibility of a free meal. Everyone wins. Each pred in the family gets several requests a month, which leads to some awkward encounters in the morning. Luckily every bedroom also has a half bath with toilets specialized for predators, able to take either big piles of feces, or just people who really wish they could use the shower afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still do the normal family stuff. We fight for the remote and eat as a family every morning and evening. That said, the Loud preds do have to eat quite a lot. It says a lot about dad\u2019s skills as a chef that he can prepare meals for all us every day. He\u2019s even learned to prepare volunteers to enhance their flavor for whoever wants to eat them. You\u2019d think it\u2019d be awkward to hear someone moaning while being vored almost every meal, but we\u2019re basically numb to it at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. What else? Oh right. I forgot to mention if I\u2019m a predator or not. Well that answer is simple. You see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Lincoln is not a predator. Only women can vore, which means he is often at the mercy of the ladies in his life.<br>\r\nOption 2: Lincoln can eat people. He likes it fine, but prefers the pleasures of being an ordinary kid\u2026 mostly. Though there are some benefits.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, I can\u2019t eat anyone, which normally shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal. I mean, how often do you hear people whining about not being able to swallow people whole. But in this house, it puts me at the bottom of the food chain, literally. I\u2019m everyone\u2019s first choice to not only bug but also devour. Don\u2019t worry about me, though. I\u2019m still the man with the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lincoln finished his fourth wall breaking introduction he ran straight into a squishy wall. Bouncing off the soft surface, he landed on his butt before a massive looming shadow. He looked up, his view blocked by first a huge, swelling belly and then an equally huge pair of boobs. Something yellow moved from above the big knockers and the mass shifted so that Lincoln could see the ditzy smiling face of his second eldest sister, Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG Lincoln! I was just thinking about you and then you ran into my stomach. What are the odds?\u201d Considering it was the middle of the afternoon and a lot of the family was home, the odds were actually pretty good that they\u2019d bump into each other. Lincoln got up, carefully moving back so he didn\u2019t get hit again by Leni\u2019s big stomach, or worse her big boobs. The gut was caused by whoever she had devoured; probably some volunteer that saw the young blonde and thought that being her food would be sexy. The boobs, on the other hand, were from all of Leni\u2019s previous meals. Sometimes when you digest someone a little bit of mass is moved to certain body parts. If you're unlucky you get a fat midsection. Leni was lucky because the mass usually went straight to her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask you for something Lincoln? I ate this really tasty guy on the way back home and my tummy is having trouble with him. I could, like, really use a belly rub, and maybe I\u2019ll let you rub other parts of my body,\u201d Leni suggestively said, winking at her brother as she squeezed her boobs like she wasn\u2019t being subtle enough. Blushing at the offer, Lincoln wondered if the massage might lead to more between them as things often did, which might suck with Leni currently being so full. Lincoln had been squished under one too many full stomachs in his short life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln!\u201d Turning around, the young boy saw his other sister, Luna, coming out of her room, grinning happily at her brother. Whatever reason she had to be happy to see him couldn\u2019t be good. Luna only ate two kinds of people, women and her little brother. She claimed that men just tasted gross, but she didn\u2019t see her brother as a man. Every time she said that Lincoln wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man, I was hoping you\u2019d let me practice this new vore move on you that I want to try with Sam. I want to get it down pat before trying it with my girlfriend,\u201d Luna said, proudly proclaiming that she had a girlfriend. Sam was great for Luna. While they might not fit together perfectly, the other girl loved being devoured so much. Honestly, Lincoln was positive that if she hadn\u2019t met Luna, then Sam would have offered herself up as a volunteer to the first predator she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it right there, Lincoln!\u201d From out of another corner of the house came Lori, who did not look very pleased. Her breasts and ass had benefited from her diet, not to the same degree as Leni\u2019s chest had but it was obvious why Bobby put up with so much while dating her. At her angry glare, Lincoln wondered if he could hide behind Leni for protection. Those huge funbags were great for avoiding a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday you left something in my stomach while you were there. I\u2019ve been feeling it rattling around every time I move. You had better go inside and get it now, or next time I might just digest you.\u201d It was an empty threat but one that all his sisters made from time to time. Lincoln knew that no matter how angry they got with him, or how much they threatened him, they still loved him dearly. Still, Lori looked mad enough that she might forget she loved him once he got inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry girls, I\u2019m afraid you are all going to have to wait for a turn with Lincoln.\u201d Everyone froze as the biggest predator in the house, and the one they all had come to know as having the best and hungriest belly, came up to them. Mom had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the week and your brother\u2019s room is still dirty, which means it\u2019s time for his punishment,\u201d Rita Loud said with a cheeky grin. She eyed her only son, her tongue coming out to lick her lips. Lincoln blushed even brighter than when Leni offered to let him rub her boobs. Mom was a completely different kind of predator than his sisters, much more experienced and very willing to make things extra sensual when she started eating him. It had only started as he began to reach puberty; his hormones were different than most boys his age due to all the predator DNA inside him. It had certainly done wonders for his mom who had a very big set of breasts and one of the biggest butts Lincoln had ever seen. Her \u2018punishments\u2019 were often more rewards for her and him as long as he had the stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mom!\u201d the three other Louds screamed, arguing about who got him. Covering his ears, Lincoln groaned and wondered if running was a possibility. They might rip him apart unless they could reach a decision, as unlikely as that was going to be. It all came down to Lincoln then, he had to decide who he went with and fast. Looking between the older women in his family, he quickly picked the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really hope I don\u2019t regret this,\u201d Lincoln muttered to himself before moving towards his preferred family member.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mom and other sisters all reacted with varying degrees of disappointment with his choice. Lori, on the other hand, smirked triumphantly and set a hand on her brother\u2019s shoulder, just in case he tried running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d make the right choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, guys. My room\u2019s one thing, but I really shouldn\u2019t leave stuff cluttering a stomach. I know how much that bugs you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Now who\u2019s gonna rub my sore tummy?\u201d whined Leni as she tried hefting up her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo. I\u2019ll help ya, sis,\u201d volunteered Luna. \u201cJust let me practice on you afterwards, and we\u2019re square.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSquare?\u201d Leni looked down at herself. \u201cI thought I had more of a round ball shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rolled her eyes good-naturedly and pushed the swollen girl into her room, where she\u2019d no doubt commit all manner of unspeakable acts upon the agreeable ditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita sighed her acceptance. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m proud of you for cleaning up where it counts.\u201d She walked over, engaged in a brief standoff with Lori to silently assert who was still top dog, and then gave both her kids a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou two have fun.\u201d She turned and gave her rump an exaggerated shake as she left, but also smirked while neither of them could see. Besides being responsible to his family, Rita was also proud of Lincoln's cleverness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, twerp,\u201d sighed Lori in exasperation as she guided him to her room and sat him on her bed. \u201cYou know the rule. Now strip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to his fate, Lincoln slipped out of his clothes without a fuss. \u201cWhat did I leave in you, anyway? I just saw my cellphone in my room and I can\u2019t really think of anything I\u2019d risk digesting.\u201d He finished saying as he pulled down his undies and put his partial erection on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori groaned impatiently. \u201cHow am I supposed to know that? All I know is that it keeps jostling like some kind of jumping bean whenever I move and it\u2019s driving me nuts. Just get in there, get it, and get out.\u201d Hands on his shoulders, she closed her eyes, parted her lips, and leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to kiss her, Lincoln met her half way and felt her hot breath hit his face. She\u2019d eaten spicy chicken wings recently. Her moist tongue pressed against his face to begin the tasting and lubrication process. She moaned loudly, approving of her brother\u2019s flavor. As mad as she\u2019d been, eating someone she liked always seemed to calm her down. Her lips stretched to encompass more of his face as her hands migrated down his body. She grabbed a handful of his butt and giggled when he squeaked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this as permission, Lincoln took the initiative and reached out, blindly groping at the air until he found his sister\u2019s breasts. He sank his fingers into her soft and bountiful flesh. A part of him wondered just how many people it had taken to build up her rack like this, but he doubted that even she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori allowed Lincoln to continue helping himself as she did the same. With her grip on his butt as leverage, she forced more of him in until her lips were around his neck. It was fantastic having him at her mercy like this. Eating people was always a power trip, digestion or not. To have people willingly offer themselves for her enjoyment was the height of bliss. It was good from strangers, but exponentially better with the familiar flavors of her loved ones. Speaking of, as her lips pulled in her brother\u2019s collar bone, she removed a hand from his rear to find that he had a little boner. How cute. Since he\u2019d picked her over the others, Lori decided to give him a little reward for his consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln tensed as he felt the soft hand upon his member. \u201cL-Lori!\u201d he yelped, but she only moaned in answer. With light sparse, Lincoln looked down into the dark abyss of his sister\u2019s throat. For many, this was the last sight they ever saw. For him, he\u2019d seen it more times than he could count. There wasn\u2019t much time for reflection as Lori continued swallowing and jerking him. She\u2019d gotten to his shoulders, which made it increasingly difficult to reach her boobs. He felt her smile when they fell from his grasp. Experience had taught him that there was nothing left to do at this point but kick back and enjoy the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s tongue swept over Lincoln\u2019s chest as it slid through her mouth. There was a faint tang of sweat, which she liked, but mostly she enjoyed his natural flavor. All people had their own unique taste, and like even regular folks, Lori would frequently have cravings for one flavor over the other. Lincoln was just lucky that she\u2019d been craving him a lot recently. Feeling the twitching of his cock and balls in her hands, the eldest sibling sped up her swallowing until his crotch was past her lips. He sprayed his seed onto her tongue and she experienced a brief nirvana of flavor. The one thing that made a loved one taste better was their orgasm and she desperately licked at his member to coax out as much as she possibly could. Lincoln writhed and kicked all the while as she milked him for all he was worth. When his cock finally went flaccid, Lori turned her face to the ceiling. Gravity helped her brother down the rest of the way as her now free hands tracked the bulge he left down her throat and esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln slipped into the moist cavern like a limp noodle, spent after his orgasm. The gurgling walls churned as if to welcome him to their familiar embrace, which made him smile. However, while he might usually take this opportunity to nap, something bumped his head. His hand groped around the darkness until he grabbed what must have been causing Lori such distress. \u201cFound it,\u201d he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRecord timing. You must be so proud,\u201d she said, her bad mood resurrected, but less intense. \u201cSo what is it, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln felt around the object until it lit up, hurting his eyes with its brightness. \u201cIt\u2019s someone\u2019s phone. But not mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori blinked. \u201cSay what now\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. This isn\u2019t my phone. I told you I saw mine back in my room. Let\u2019s see here.\u201d After adjusting the brightness, Lincoln began searching for clues. \u201cNo password encryption. Says it belongs to someone named Susan. Ring any bells?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori face palmed.  \u201cUgh! She was the volunteer I ate right after you. She paid for an overnight stay in my stomach and I expelled her this morning. Dumbass probably wanted to take a selfie inside me, but forgot her stupid phone on the way out. She\u2019s probably half way across the state by now, or whatever. Ugh!\u201d She flopped onto her bed, causing her stomach\u2019s contents to bounce around. People in her belly were pleasant, but for some reason objects were irksome. \u201cI should have just digested it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t because you thought it was mine,\u201d Lincoln reasoned. \u201cI really appreciate that. Thanks, Lori. You\u2019re a good sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori was glad that he couldn\u2019t see how much that compliment made her blush. \u201cWhatever. So, now that you\u2019ve got it, I guess there\u2019s nothing left to do, except\u2026\u201d As if eyes were upon her, Lori turned a suspicious gaze on her pregnant looking belly. \u201cLincoln, why does it feel that you\u2019re smirking at me from in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln chuckled. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind kicking back, but that\u2019s gonna be hard for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? How do you figure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, mom wanted me to clean my room. I totally would have, if <i>someone</i> hadn\u2019t swallowed me first,\u201d he said with a shit-eating-grin. \u201cAnd since you interrupted my chore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori let out an even louder groan and smacked her forehead for her carelessness. In this house, when you interrupted someone\u2019s chores to swallow them, then the responsibility of that chore fell on the swallower. It was a rule to keep the house at least somewhat tidy, which Lori now realized Lincoln knew from the start. He was going in a belly no matter what, but any option other than mom would mean that his swallower would have to clean his room. She couldn\u2019t even do a bad job in retaliation, otherwise she\u2019d get punished worse than him. \u201cYou sneaky little pipsqueak. You tricked me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, man with the plan in here,\u201d he humble bragged while playing on the phone. \u201cNot my fault you forgot the rules. By the way, what do you want to do with this phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Lori grumpily marched down the hall to her brother\u2019s room to begin her task. \u201cI guess I can turn it in for store credit. If that idiot lost it in my gut, it\u2019s mine. That\u2019s <i>also</i> the rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln said nothing as he continued playing on the phone in his sister\u2019s gut. Susan had some pretty cool games, and a nice gallery of photos of Lori\u2019s innards. He just made himself comfortable while his sister toiled away and whispered under his breath, \u201cMan with the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what? Follow Lincoln and Lori until his expulsion, skip ahead, maybe Lincoln gets company, or should we should we switch to a different Loud?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lori frowned as she set about the task of cleaning her brother\u2019s room. Lincoln had a system for what went where, as they all did, and his wasn\u2019t too hard to figure out. The comics on the floor went on the shelf that already had comics, which she decided to arrange by title and numerical order. Normally she\u2019d never go the extra mile in cleaning someone else\u2019s room. However, she couldn\u2019t take the risk of Lincoln tattling to mom that she did a bad job, as unlikely as that was. Lincoln was a good kid and leagues more patient than she\u2019d been at his age, or ever for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made sense, of course. Lincoln was prey living in a house full of predators that treated vore as a preferred means of showing affection. And since they all loved Lincoln, he\u2019d basically been conditioned since birth to put up with that love. Thinking on that, Lori felt better about tidying up her brother\u2019s room. He\u2019d earned at least that much for putting up with the family. In fact, while dusting, she caught her hand lovingly cradling her swollen belly, which she quickly stopped and hoped he hadn\u2019t noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you\u2019ve been quite in there, twerp. Everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh yeah. Just playing around on Susan\u2019s phone. And before you say anything, I turned the brightness all the way down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s still really bad for your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually no. She\u2019s got the VoreLight app just like my phone. It\u2019s supposed to let you look at the screen in the dark without damaging your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori hummed thoughtfully. \u201cNow that you mention it, I think Bobby has that on his phone. That would certainly explain the texts he likes to send from inside me.\u201d She sighed romantically. \u201cHe\u2019s so thoughtful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe texts from inside you?\u201d questioned Lincoln. \u201cIs it too much effort to walk the zero feet to talk in person? Literally <i>in</i> person?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! You just don\u2019t get it, Lincoln. Bobby-Bubu-Bear and I are in love and we have our own special way of showing it. Besides, he mostly texts pics of himself. We still talk the regular way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I know what regular means,\u201d Lincoln joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Probably not,\u201d laughed Lori in agreement as she regarded her work. \u201cWell, I think that about wraps things up in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t that much. You know, if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think you deliberately left your room a mess just to provoke mom,\u201d she teased with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProvoke mom on purpose? Seriously?\u201d asked Lincoln in disbelief. \u201cYou have any idea how crazy that sounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sometimes people get in the mood for crazy. I don\u2019t judge.\u201d Lori shrugged noncommittally and left the room. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, mom wants me to do a grocery run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mind if I come with?\u201d asked Lana. \u201cLola\u2019s car has been making some clunky noises lately. I don\u2019t have the parts to fix it, but there\u2019s an auto shop near the grocery store.\u201d The resident handyman of the house wore overalls, a red cap, and seemed to always be dirty. There was nothing on the outside to indicate that she was a predator as her body was pretty normal for a girl her age, but she was a voracious one, if a bit picky. She often demanded that her meals roll around in garbage, mud, or other gross things before she consumed them. As such, she had a very niche appeal to a select crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the rule.\u201d Lori extended her hand. \u201cYou want a ride, you have to pay up. Favors or cash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need the cash for the parts. Got anything you need fixing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I suppose the drain in my room has been making some odd noises lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Lana cheered eagerly and they shook on it. \u201cJoke\u2019s on you. I\u2019d have done that for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smiled as she rolled her eyes. The two \u2013 technically three \u2013 boarded onto the lovingly named vanzilla and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is that Lincoln in there?\u201d Lana asked from the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am. Lori wanted me to get a volunteer\u2019s phone from her belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana gave the eldest sibling a deadpan stare. \u201cSeriously? Again, I\u2019d have done that for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I thought it was Lincoln\u2019s phone, which made it <i>his</i> responsibility to fetch. But since it isn\u2019t, I\u2019m turning the thing in for store credit the moment I expel it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana chortled. \u201cYou mean when you crap it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d Lori snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s better to say expel, or release, or anything that isn\u2019t so, bleh, gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you really are off your game today,\u201d observed Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori sighed as Lana laughed. \u201cHeard it the moment I said it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the car ride was uneventful. The girls split up at the parking lot with Lana being entrusted to handle her own finances. With the amount of volunteers they got, all the Loud sisters had been coached from an early age on how to handle money.  Besides, Lana was a predator. No one in their right mind would try bamboozling her. Even if she weren\u2019t, she was one of the best customers for DIY shops across town. They all knew her and were thankful for her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Lori, she walked into the grocery store and smiled contentedly as heads turned. Royal Woods was a small enough town where everyone knew everyone. Even if they didn\u2019t regularly talk, they still recognized each other\u2019s faces, and everyone knew who the Louds were. Being predators meant that they were like local celebrities. Many of said locals had even been clients of the Louds\u2019 vore services. Just about everyone waved and said polite greetings as Lori went by, which she graciously returned. Even if a lot of it was fake, being born out of fear and ignorance, it still felt nice to be noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am. Will you be needing help with your shopping today?\u201d asked a young woman in a staff uniform. She was cute, maybe Luna\u2019s age, with freckles and a nice figure to boot. Lori reflexively licked her lips at the sight of her, making the young woman smile anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, there\u2019s no need to worry. I\u2019m not gonna eat someone on the clock.\u201d Lori closed the distance and wrapped an arm around the young woman\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThat would literally be so rude. And besides,\u201d she gestured down to her belly. \u201cThe space is currently occupied, Emily,\u201d she read from the nametag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gave a relieved exhale. \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s good to hear. I was a little nervous when my boss said I had to help a\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t be nervous,\u201d Lori purred as she pulled Emily close enough to touch cheeks. \u201cEven if I did eat you, I almost never digest anyone who doesn\u2019t volunteer for that service. Besides,\u201d she quickly slapped her tongue against Emily\u2019s cheek, \u201cyou\u2019re the kind of tasty treat I\u2019d hope to enjoy more than once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gave an unintelligible series of chirps as her face turned beet red. No one had ever been so openly flirty with her before. She was broken from her stupor with a sharp pain in her backside. She turned around to see the predator\u2019s fingers pinching into her butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, I won\u2019t eat you on the clock. But the moment you clock out, well, I\u2019m sure you can find me,\u201d tittered Lori as she fluttered bedroom eyes at Emily. Afterwards, Lori had effectively conscripted the young woman as her servant. She read out from her list as Emily did the work of fetching things. This was a pretty normal scene when the Louds went out shopping as stores bent over backwards to accommodate them. They still paid for their purchases like anyone else. It was their job to control the population, not crash the economy, after all. But these added services were very much appreciated. No doubt Lana was getting a similar treatment for her shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lori noticed that things were a bit too quiet. \u201cHey, twerp. You still up?\u201d She rubbed her belly to get his attention, but all she got was him shifting around and snoring. Lori gave a contented yet prideful smile. It was like the first times she\u2019d put her other siblings to sleep all over again; an accomplishment mixed with familial adoration. Remembering that she was in public, she righted herself and finished her shopping. The cart was stacked almost as tall as her, marking this as only a light grocery run. She paid, thanked Emily, met Lana in the lot, and they returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what? Keep following Lori, or try something else?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After minutes of grunting and squeezing, Lincoln fell from Lori\u2019s ass with a wet plop. Everything stunk to high heaven, which made sense given where he just was. He was in a basin in the corner of Lori and Leni\u2019s room. Beneath him was a kind of padding that had thankfully softened his drop and above him was his sister\u2019s squatting ass. It was a lovely and familiar sight that always left him smiling. Lori turned around, bottoms still around her ankles and gave him an expectant look. Lincoln held up the acquired phone and gave it a shake. Unceremoniously, Lori switched on the basin\u2019s shower and a torrent of high pressure water bombarded Lincoln from above. The jet was powerful, but only lasted a few seconds. When it was over, almost all of the leavings from Lori\u2019s bowels had been washed away. The process was effective, but nowhere near as relaxing as a proper shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori then snatched up the cleaned phone from Lincoln\u2019s hand and started fiddling with it. \u201cHmm. Not a bad model. Cashing this in almost makes up for it rattling inside me\u2026 almost.\u201d Finally she spared a glance to her brother who was having a bit of trouble standing, which was normal after someone had been devoured and pooped out. Although she was still mad it him for tricking her, it was still uncomfortable to watch her family struggle with anything. She reached out a helping hand and hefted him up. \u201cThanks again, by the way,\u201d she said while keeping her eyes on the phone. \u201cFor the record, why\u2019d you pick me, anyway? You could have picked any sister to trick to clean your room, so why me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadying himself with Lori\u2019s hand for balance, Lincoln eventually stood to his full height, naked as the day he was born and just as shameless. \u201cAll three of you wanted my help with something, but you kinda seemed like the most in need. Plus I thought I\u2019d really left something in you, so it was only right to make up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLips twisting like she was sucking on something sour, Lori eventually surrendered to her impulses. She leaned down and planted a 3 second peck right on Lincoln\u2019s lips. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make someone very happy someday.\u201d She stood and readied to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLori wait!\u201d Lincoln grabbed her wrist. At her questioning stare, he pointed down where her bottoms were still around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I am really off my game today.\u201d Again Lori squatted and shimmied her way into her shorts and panties. She didn\u2019t do so out of any sense of modesty. Casual nudity was pretty common in this family. Rather, she just didn\u2019t want to make any more of a fool of herself by tripping on her own panties. \u201cThanks again, twerp, but don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get me so easily next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll just think up something new,\u201d agreed Lincoln as he waved goodbye. Looking around, he saw where his clothes had been discarded from earlier. He still felt a little gross, so rather than putting them on, he loaded them into his arms and poked his head out the door. The hall of the upper floor was as loud and chaotic as ever; doubly so with him being in the nude. Ringing an actual dinner bell would be less effective in getting his sisters\u2019 attention. And while Lori and Leni\u2019s room was one of the closest to the bathroom, that was still a lot of hall to cover without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretending like he was a swift bunny trying to evade a pack of hungry wolves, Lincoln lied low and waited for the chance to move. Then he switched to being a sly fox so that at least he wasn\u2019t on the bottom of the food chain. Lola was pulling wheelies in her pink toy car. She\u2019d definitely catch him if she saw him, but seemed to be too busy bickering with Lana over something. Luna had just walked out of her room with a doubly bloated belly. That meant that not only would she be too slow to catch him, but that Leni was a non-factor. An explosion from the room left of his told him that Lisa was preoccupied and Lily was still too young to swallow anyone. That still left 3 sisters unaccounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah!\u201d The boy jumped and spun around, ready to fling his clothes as a distraction to make his escape, only to recognize the only other unique head of hair in the house. \u201cLucy,\u201d he sighed in relief. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask you the same thing,\u201d countered Lucy in her typical depressed voice that sounded like a perpetual sigh. As Lincoln\u2019s fifth youngest sister, she still hadn\u2019t developed that much by predator standards. She was further along than other girls her age, but not enough to warrant a training bra or anything. She also wasn\u2019t that active a predator, being very picky about her volunteers and only taking digestion requests as part of her fascination with morbidity. She wasn\u2019t yet experienced enough to eat people who were too big and there just weren\u2019t that many young people looking to be digested. However, Lincoln was well within her range if she felt the urge. Speaking of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln gestured down at himself. \u201cI\u2019m naked in Lori\u2019s room. It\u2019s pretty obvious why I\u2019m here. Less obvious about you, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Right.\u201d It was hard to see behind her bangs, but Lucy averted her eyes. \u201cWell, I was looking for you, actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s eyebrow climbed up his forehead. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to swallow me, I should warn you Lori just pooped me out, like, five minutes ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually hoping to hear your opinion on my new poem,\u201d she said while pulling the paper out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Lincoln blinked like a deer caught in the headlights. It was such a normal and benign request that it took him a few seconds to process. \u201cWell if that\u2019s all then\u2026 How about a trade? Constructive criticism in exchange for safe passage to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Lucy recited her poem and Lincoln gave his honest opinion. Afterwards, doing his best to hide behind the girl\u2019s smaller body, the pair hurried into the bathroom before anyone else could notice. They made it! Inside, the bathroom was\u2026  </span></div></div>",

Better watch out for werewolves. Looks like a full moon tonight,\u201d said the freckled ventriloquist dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood one Mr. Coconuts,\u201d laughed Luan. Fourth eldest of the Loud siblings, Luan really had a fondness for making people laugh. Often her punchlines involved vore or sexual things, as in she\u2019d swallow someone at the end of a joke. She preferred not to digest people so that she could continue making them laugh, but her critics had long ago learned the importance of gentleness. Hecklers in general were an endangered species whenever the Louds came around. She was experienced enough to swallow people significantly bigger than herself, although the lack of digestion meant that she hadn\u2019t reaped the same bodily rewards as her other sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull moon. Ha. Ha. Ha.\u201d Lucy\u2019s laugh was deadpan and unnatural sounding, but it was hers. \u201cGood one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. I got a laugh out of Lucy. That\u2019s worth quadruple points for my daily laugh quota. Good job, me,\u201d Luan beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? I\u2019m the one telling jokes with your hand shoved up my ass. How come I always play second fiddle?\u201d Griped the dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. I\u2019m sorry you feel like you\u2019re just a number 2, Mr. Coconuts. But look on the bright side. At least you don\u2019t smell like a number two like, <i>some</i> people.\u201d Luan looked down at Lincoln with a cheeky grin and eyebrows bouncing suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, I know. I just came out of Lori\u2019s butt and I stink. If you guys would kindly leave me alone, I\u2019d like to shower in peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rubbed her chin as she pretended to think. \u201cLucy, don\u2019t the rules say that the bathroom has a three person limit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do believe it does,\u201d Lucy agreed. \u201cAnd I have been spending a lot of time in the dusty attic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s heart sank. \u201cOh, come on. Seriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, little bro. You\u2019ve got two lovely young ladies who just want to shower with you. Most guys would kill for a chance like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. \u201cSince I\u2019m not getting out of this anyway, can I at least ask that you not swallow me afterwards? I was hoping to do stuff later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters agreed and stripped down. Once all three were naked, they climbed into the tub and flipped the shower on. Because there was only one shower head, all three had to cuddle up close to share access to the stream. As a direct and entirely deliberate result, both girls began grinding themselves against Lincoln. Luan squatted enough to rub her smallish breasts against his back while taking several broad licks along his neck. Keeping her back to him, Lucy grabbed Lincoln\u2019s hands and held them around her middle while she grinded her small but pert rump into his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh. Looks like someone\u2019s trying to raise the dead,\u201d Luan chuckled as she watched Lincoln\u2019s erection rise and poke out between Lucy\u2019s butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Lucy grunted as she humped her hips more vigorously. \u201cRise from the dead, little Lincoln. Rise like Edwin from his coffin, ready to plunge his long and sharp fangs into an unsuspecting maiden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnsuspecting maiden?\u201d Lincoln asked incredulously. He pulled his hands from Lucy\u2019s grip and moved them north to cup her budding breasts. They were little more than nubs, but still super sensitive if the girl\u2019s loud moans were anything to go by. \u201cWhere would I find one of those?\u201d he whispered into her ear before giving it a soft blow. \u201cNot you, obviously. You\u2019re about as expectant as they come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d Squatting lower, Luna reached around until her fingers touched Lucy\u2019s hairless vulva, making the girl spasm from the contact. \u201cThis girl\u2019s drooling more than Luna that one time dad poured chocolate sauce on Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must be hungry then,\u201d Lincoln added, hoping to shift the focus off of himself. \u201cWant to give me a <i>hand</i>, Luan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nice one.\u201d Understanding his intent, Luan worked with Lincoln to lay Lucy down on the bathtub floor. With a somewhat sadistic grin, Luna stabbed two fingers into her little sister\u2019s sopping twat and began finger banging her. \u201cWow, Lucy. Your voice is so pretty when you\u2019re all hot and bothered. It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t show this side of you more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy couldn\u2019t speak. Lincoln was sitting off to the side and poking her cheek with his erection. She turned to face him, opened her mouth, and greedily began sucking. She closed her eyes and tried imagining that she was somewhere more macabre, like a dungeon. Her siblings were there, but they were creatures of the night, torturing her by subjecting her to their dark whims. The gloomy girl put up only a token resistance as the two fingers in her pussy became three, then five, and then the whole hand began slipping in. She cried out in bliss as her pussy was stretched, making Lincoln moan from the vibrations around his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan sank her hand deeper and deeper until she hit a wall. She tried going deeper still, but the little girl\u2019s womb just wouldn\u2019t accommodate. \u201cWow, Lucy. You really need to practice more. I can\u2019t even get past my elbow in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, ease up on her,\u201d dissuaded Lincoln as he rotated his hips to thrust his cock in and out of the girl\u2019s hungry mouth. \u201cShe\u2019s doing the best she can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she is, though.\u201d Luan tried to look serious even as her hand was stimulating the inside of Lucy\u2019s womb. \u201cLucy, you need to start eating more people. Even if you don\u2019t digest them, you need to build up your experience,\u201d she explained to the writhing goth. \u201cAnd ask to borrow some of Lynn\u2019s balls for practice. When I was your age, I could fit baby you in my pussy. And let me tell you, it felt fantastic,\u201d she gasped, both in fondness of the memory, and because her other hand was between her own legs. \u201cYou\u2019re a predator, Lucy. Don\u2019t go shutting yourself off from all the great things life has to offer you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was in heaven. Not only were her siblings using her body for their own gratification, but they were showing such concern for her wellbeing. As best she could with what little lucidity she still had, she nodded vigorously. A pressure was building deep in her core; one that Luan seemed to sense and was deliberately agitating. Lincoln\u2019s delicious cock was also twitching. Everyone in the house agreed that Lincoln was one of their favorite people to eat, but by far the best part was his cock and creamy center. She suckled more urgently trying to coax out his cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thrusting in and out for so long, Lincoln hilted in his little sister\u2019s mouth one last time. Her lips created a vacuum seal as he sprayed his load into her guzzling gullet. The rich erotic flavor finally pushed Lucy over the edge and she sprayed her juices all across Luan\u2019s arm. The eldest in the room found the whole thing hilarious and laughed uproariously. The three siblings eventually came down from their orgasmic hi and eventually found the strength to resume their shower. They were still handsy with one another, but without the lewd overtones. Afterwards, they dried off, got dressed, and went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Lincoln go, though?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAh, nothing quite like the peace and quiet of my own room,\u201d Lincoln said to no one in particular. Lori had done a good job of cleaning. She\u2019d even made his bed. As such, he\u2019d opted for a minimally messy activity and started reading one of his comics. Naturally he stripped down to his underwear to do so, since he liked being comfy. However, he\u2019d only made it to the second page when he got a signal on his Ace Savvy walky-talky. \u201cThis is agent L. Loud. Who might I ask is calling?\u201d he asked facetiously, as if it could be anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgent McBride here,\u201d replied Lincoln\u2019s neighbor and best friend. \u201cI was worried when you missed your last check in. So I waited an hour, as per our procedure, figuring you were inside someone. Glad that you\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for checking in on me, buddy. And yeah. Lori ate me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde swooned. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky. I wish Lori would eat me some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know why she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s not a picky eater like Luna. Plus I have it on good authority that she usually eats the kids she\u2019s babysitting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky babies,\u201d Clyde grumbled. \u201cWhen will it be my turn? When, I say?\u201d he wept in his usual melodramatic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to get eaten so badly, I\u2019ve got other sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame on you for even suggesting I cheat on Lori. You know my heart only belongs to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s a predator, which means her stomach is basically like the town bicycle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d really appreciate if you didn\u2019t talk about the love of my life like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough. So anyway, was there a reason you called, or did you just want to say hi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I just wanted to hear your voice. Got any plans this afternoon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thought I\u2019d kick back and treat myself to some comic reading. Hopefully no one will-\u201d The door slammed open, causing Lincoln to yelp, fumble the walky-talky, and fall off his bed. \u201cOw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Stinken?\u201d greeted Lynn Jr. As the most athletic member of the house, she was very well muscled, especially for a girl her age. Her preference for digesting people for their \u2018protein\u2019 had contributed nicely to her budding figure, but mostly to her physique. She always worked out the hardest after digesting someone, claiming that she was guiding the mass exactly where she needed it instead of letting it pool into her gut. Presently, she wore a hockey mask, roller blades, a jockstrap, and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned. \u201cClyde, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d He let his walky-talky hand go limp as he regarded the girl who was only slightly more dressed than himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, Lynn? I was trying to read in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn pulled up her mask and smiled lasciviously as she looked him over. \u201cI can see that. Anyway, I was wondering if you wanted to help me with something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s weight training, then forget it. I know what that means with you,\u201d he said in accusation. Basically it meant that he\u2019d ride around in her belly while she did her usual routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she whined. \u201cYou just did it for Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo things. First, exactly. I just got out of Lori and now I want to spend some time in the open air. And second, I thought I owed Lori a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn scoffed. \u201cIf you want to be out in the open, then do that and go outside. Don\u2019t just sit all cooped in your room like some lame shut in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have your thing and I have mine,\u201d reasoned Lincoln while making a shooing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn gave him an \u2018are you serious?\u2019 look. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get me out of here with <i>those</i> scrawny arms. Dude, even if I weren\u2019t a predator, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned. \u201cIf reasoning won\u2019t work, then we might as well resort to bargaining. I\u2019m not going inside you, so what else can I give you to get you to leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually just need one part of you inside me.\u201d Lynn turned around, bent over, and stuck out her butt. \u201cI was going to play basketball with my friends in the park. Victory is pretty much assured, but you can never underestimate the power of luck,\u201d she explained while giving her rump a wiggle. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try getting out of it by saying you\u2019re spent. You\u2019re an inert predator, which means you\u2019re not allowed to be such a light weight. Lisa told me that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s fine,\u201d Lincoln allowed. \u201cSo how do you want this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn guided her younger brother onto his bed, face up. After stripping off everything but her jockstrap, she planted her feet to either side of his waist and smirked down at him. She squatted down and fished around his underwear until she pulled out his half erect cock. \u201cThere\u2019s my favorite performance enhancer. Thanks for keeping it safe for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln glowered at his sister. \u201cHey, I\u2019m more than just a slab of meat, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a knot. Of course I do. You wouldn\u2019t be as fun to tease if you were. Now just lie back and let big sis Lynn get her fill.\u201d Slipping down to her knees, the athlete lined the cock up with her anus and began to lower herself. Her grunts were loud and her breathing was heavy as she strained to slide it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLube is for losers!\u201d Lynn snapped. \u201cIf I can take a football back there, then there\u2019s no excuse not to take a cock.\u201d Her rapid breathing continued as the mushroom head spread her anus apart and slipped further in. Her pained grunts soon morphed into moans of delight. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Lynn. Haa! Haa! Feel the burn,\u201d she muttered to herself. As a predator, she had an easier time with this sort of thing than most, but there was always that painful hurdle to overcome before they got to the good part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sucked in a hissing breath as he felt his sister\u2019s ass plant itself against his waist. On reflex he reached around to get himself a handful. She wasn\u2019t as plush as his eldest sisters, but her pert butt still felt nice. They stayed like that for a second, acclimating to the feeling of being connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn set her hands on Lincoln\u2019s chest and explored with her fingers. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d prefer if you had a bit more muscle, but I don\u2019t really mind your lankier frame.\u201d She dropped her chest down until they were practically nose-to-nose. \u201cIt makes me feel strong to put you in your place, Stinken.\u201d Lynn lifted herself up and groaned. \u201cNnngh! I feel you sliding against me, bro. Oh fuck, you feel big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly cuz you\u2019re so tight,\u201d retorted Lincoln, hands still on her ass as he felt her up. Her walls were grinding along his cock and he could feel her struggling to keep relaxed and loose. Lynn\u2019s chest rose and fell with her heavy breathing and Lincoln was hypnotized by the sight. She might be nearly a washboard, but she was still pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching him staring, Lynn smirked, grabbed the back of his head, and forced his face against her chest. \u201cYeah, you like that, don\u2019t you. C\u2019mon Stinken. Motorboat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his hands up to her back, Lincoln did just that and grinded his face across her chest. He loved the way it made Lynn moan as she picked up the pace in her bouncing. He tried to match his movements to hers to ensure maximum penetration, but he was quickly outpaced by the athlete. Lincoln was forced back down onto the bed as Lynn rode him like a proper cowgirl. \u201cC-close!\u201d he warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn took this as a call to speed up, humping with greater and greater force as her ass bounced against his hips. \u201cJ-just a bit more,\u201d she panted. Mid-hump, her hand slipped and she fell forward, planting her lips against Lincoln\u2019s in a surprise kiss. That was the last straw for the both of them as Lynn felt her brother shoot his seed up her ass hole, making her brain go white hot with ecstasy. She planted her ass firmly against his groin but kept grinding to coax out more of the hot, viscous substance; all the while her tongue had invaded his mouth and was making itself at home. The pair rode out their orgasms with Lynn spraying into her jockstrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally stopped, Lynn\u2019s legs were wobbly, but she still managed to stand. Clenching her ass to keep the lucky goop inside, she threw her gear back on and wheezily said, \u201cThanks, bro. You\u2019re my favorite cum pump.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re my favorite cum dump,\u201d he raspingly replied, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid what the others might say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStinken,\u201d Lynn chortled as she departed the room, at least showing enough courtesy to close the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShall we continue with Lincoln trying to read, or move on to something else?</span></div></div>",

She was tiny and petite, the perfect size for the junior pageants she loved so much. However, she also had the hottest temper and was prone to tantrums and revenge plots. After one too many \u2018mysterious disappearances\u2019, their mom had flat ordered the judges to do a head count before and after every competition. Any discrepancy would mean a grounding and a tanned hide for Lola, as eating someone to win was tantamount to cheating. Even so, Lola was a sneaky devil and had plenty of tricks for getting around the rules. This was the monster that had barged into Lincoln\u2019s room. \u201cI need your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and everyone else today,\u201d he groaned his exasperation. Standing, he looked the young blonde over and quickly spied the issue. \u201cWhoa, what happened to your dress?\u201d He pointed to the sizable tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was Lana\u2019s stupid frogs!\u201d growled the princess, stomping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cat or the dog I\u2019d buy, but how do frogs-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Lola whimpered as she held up the torn fabric, tears pooling in her eyes. \u201cThis was one of my favorite dresses. I was gonna ask Leni for help, but Luna still won\u2019t let her out. You\u2019re the only other person I can trust to handle a job like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Lincoln hadn\u2019t already been moved by the tears, his heart and ego had swollen with brotherly pride at her words. Adopting a serious expression, he grabbed his sewing kit from his dresser and authoritatively stated, \u201cLet\u2019s operate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in the twin\u2019s room, Lincoln sat at Lola\u2019s sewing station and got to work on the dress. Lola, dressed only in her tiara, high heels, and blue teddy bear panties paced around behind him like this was the waiting room of a hospital. Wanting to ease her worries, Lincoln decided to take her mind off the dress. \u201cSo, how have things been? It\u2019s been a while since we last talked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know how busy I can get,\u201d Lola humble bragged. \u201cTea parties, pageants, the occasional insufferable worm who dares stand in my way,\u201d she added while shaking a fist with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re not hunting people for revenge, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola scoffed. \u201cWhat? Me? Perish the thought.\u201d Her smile grew wide, showing off the gap in her two front teeth. \u201cDoes this look like the face of someone who\u2019d-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew what you were gonna say, and the answer is yes. You really need to stop eating the competition, Lola. Mom said we\u2019re not allowed to cover for you after last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the competition, though,\u201d whined Lola. \u201cSuzie\u2019s big sister threw juice all over my dress. Not spilled. Threw. I had every right to pay her back for sabotaging me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot without permission from mom you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola stomped her foot again. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m the only one who needs permission to digest non-volunteers. Leni\u2019s inside Luna right now, digesting some random guy she pulled off the street, but no one gives her the third degree about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Leni\u2019s Leni and you\u2019re, well, you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola leveled a stare upon Lincoln, eyes burning like the fires of Hades. \u201cAnd what is that supposed to mean?\u201d she asked through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one, it means that I\u2019m still working on your dress.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s words caused Lola\u2019s barely restrained rage to evaporate almost instantly. \u201cFor two, it means you keep breaking the rules while Leni doesn\u2019t. That girl doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body, but you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJunior pageantry is a cutthroat profession, Lincoln. If you\u2019re not the most ruthless on the catwalk, you might as well go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I\u2019ve helped you back stage plenty of times, but that\u2019s still no excuse for breaking the rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola folded her arms and pouted. \u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re not even a predator.\u201d The pageant princess immediately regretted her words when she heard the sewing machine go quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but mom is. A predator is making the rules for the rest of you predators, but also us prey. That\u2019s how it is and we all have to live with it.\u201d Lincoln hung his head low. \u201cI accept being at the bottom of the food chain. The least you could do is be gracious about being at the top.\u201d In truth, a part of Lincoln resented being the only one of his siblings who wasn\u2019t a predator. All of them had this amazing ability, and all he had was the tolerance to put up with it. He did, and most of the time he liked it. He understood that this was just how his sisters showed their love, but it was still hard not feeling like he was being left out; like there was some super fun party that only he wasn\u2019t invited to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola came up behind her nearly naked brother and pressed her nearly naked body against his back, wrapping her arms around his chest. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean anything by that,\u201d she said into his skin. \u201cI just\u2026 I was just blowing off steam and talking without thinking. You\u2019re my brother first and prey a distant second. You know that\u2019s how I really feel, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln gave a long, drawn out sigh and patted Lola\u2019s arm. Feeling her smile against him caused him to smile in return. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s still nice to be reminded from time to time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the tension leave his body, Lola came around Lincoln\u2019s side and planted a kiss on his cheek. \u201cThanks for the dress and\u2026 and for putting up with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019m used to both,\u201d he replied with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the record, I think you would have made a great predator. You\u2019re super considerate. I bet you\u2019d get more repeat customers than any of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the little blonde, Lincoln returned the kiss to her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice thought. Thank you.\u201d Lincoln finished patching up the dress in short order. It was good as new and Lola squealed with elation. With his little sister as his escort, on account of him still being in his tighty-whities, Lincoln returned to his room to once more attempt at reading his comics in peace.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d gotten his fill of comic reading, just in time for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner!\u201d Lynn Sr. called from downstairs. What followed was a stampede of lion killing proportions as the Loud children scrambled to take their positions at the adult and kid tables. Rita\u2019s job was to maintain order amongst the rambunctious kids, and she saw a rather sloppy violation of the house rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her hips in disapproval and foot tapping impatiently, the matriarch of the house said, \u201cLeni. What are you wearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d The blonde ditz stared down over her mountainous breasts, past her much more trim stomach, and all the way to her toes. \u201cMy birthday suit?\u201d she replied sheepishly. The second eldest sister had come downstairs buck naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita snapped her wrist like the cracking of a whip as she pointed upstairs. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ah. No excuses. The only ones allowed to be naked at the dinner table are the food. Are <i>you</i> on the menu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get dressed. We\u2019ll wait.\u201d That got a round of complaints from the other kids. Lynn Sr. stopped in the middle of his serving and moved the pots of food back to the oven to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job, Luna,\u201d grumbled Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me. I pushed her out almost an hour ago. It\u2019s not my fault she forgot to dress herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were the last one to vore her, so it <i>is</i> your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBogus, dude,\u201d Luna sighed her reluctant acceptance. Finally Leni returned and took her seat. \u201cSo what\u2019s on the menu tonight, pops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you asked. I was feeling nostalgic for my old recipes, so I brought back an old classic. Salisbury steak.\u201d The response from the kids was a forced cheer, followed by the clearing of a couple throats. \u201cOh, and let\u2019s not forget the other part of tonight\u2019s dinner.\u201d The Loud patriarch motioned to the four strangers lined up near the fridge. All were naked and smiling somewhere between excited and apprehensive. The first was a Hispanic man in his early thirties. He was a bit portly, but still had a handsome face and wore a confident smile. Next was a black woman in her mid to late forties. Her figure and face were on the plain side and she seemed rather apprehensive about everyone staring at her bare form. Third was a white boy no older than Lincoln. He was scrawny, trying to put on a brave face, but refused to pull his hands from his crotch. Lastly was a very small Asian woman somewhere in her sixties. She had probably been beautiful once, if that confident smirk was anything to go by, but the years had not been kind to her body. All four had been covered in sauces and spices, but not so much that they would drip on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeni, since you ruined your meal by digesting someone earlier today, I\u2019m afraid Carlos,\u201d Lynn Sr. paused to read from the list, \u201cgoes to Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Lori pumped her fist in victory and made kissy faces at the big guy. \u201cWell don\u2019t you look\u2026 filling?\u201d She licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. looked back at the list. \u201cAndrea goes to \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 Luna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so down, luv,\u201d encouraged the rocker. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to give you the time of your life on the way down,\u201d she said while tracing a line down her throat and between her breasts. Andrea, for what little her name still mattered, blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky little Zach is going to Rita.\u201d Lynn Sr. looked questioningly at his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I was craving a little boy in my tummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get that part. I\u2019m just wondering why you didn\u2019t accept someone more substantial, or at least two or three more. No offense, Zach.\u201d Lynn Sr. said indifferently to the little boy. It wasn\u2019t often Loud predators got digestion requests from people so young. Lynn had learned long ago that all people had their reasons and that it was none of his business. Besides, if eating this kid would make his beloved wife happy, then who was he to refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLastly, we have Ms. Miller. You sure you\u2019re up for this, Lucy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not too big. I\u2019m willing to give her a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie. If you can\u2019t fit her in, then I can take her so she\u2026 hmm.\u201d Rita stopped herself from saying \u2018go to waste\u2019. Just because these people were food, that didn\u2019t negate their right to some semblance of dignity. \u201cSo she can get her money\u2019s worth. Yes, that\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prey walked to their respective predators and climbed onto their plates while Lynn Sr. set about loading up all other plates with a veritable mountain of food each. Seriously, this guy had to be some kind of kitchen wizard or something to prepare so much food using only standard kitchen materials, and all on a budget. His and Lincoln\u2019s portions were obviously the smallest, but it was still plenty for them. Grace was said, and the feeding frenzy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the Louds were content to just shovel their food into their mouths, swallowing steaks two or six at a time without even chewing. Inevitably, most attention fell on the predators with prey. As things usually went, the preds started with their food\u2019s genitals. It was a good way of wetting the appetite and easing any lingering misgivings their food might have. By far the most ravenous this time were Luna and Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocker had her meal\u2019s legs wrapped around her head as she ate her out. The black woman loudly vocalized her arousal as her consumer hungrily devoured her pussy. \u201cJesus, god! N-no one\u2019s ever mmm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothin\u2019 of it, babe. I know what the ladies like.\u201d Luna licked the sex juice moustache from her lips before diving back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita\u2019s meal was quieter, but more incoherent with how he kept thrashing around. Likely he\u2019d led a relatively normal life up to this point, so having a woman\u2019s experienced mouth around his cock and balls was an entirely alien sensation. It was hard to tell if he was begging Rita to stop or go on, but at this point her courtesy was purely optional. He was on her plate, which made him her plaything until her hunger won out. Now and then Rita would share looks with her husband, smiling as she silently thanked him; not only for the meal, but for everything else she loved about him, especially his tolerance for her eccentricities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori was being unusually quick with her meal. Having already sucked the man off to orgasm, she sat him in her lap and began making out with him. That lasted only a few seconds before her lips widened and she took in his face. She caught Leni staring at her, looking bummed at having lost the meal who\u2019d applied for her specifically, but Lori wasn\u2019t terribly sympathetic. Leni should have been patient and not eaten that other guy. This current guy, whatever his name had been, would be a bit of a chore to get down, but Lori was confident in her skills as a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the kid\u2019s table, an eight year old had her face pressed against the pussy of a woman almost ten times her age. The other kids were also playing with their food, but in the more traditional sense. Lucy was exercising good predator manors by sending her food off with a smile. While that wasn\u2019t usually her style, it was the only way to taste their delicious orgasm, so she was willing to compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, meanwhile, was trying to eat in peace. Between the twins having a mini food war and the saggy old woman threatening to knock his plate over, it wasn\u2019t easy. He tried looking on the bright side of things and smiled at Lucy. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m proud of you for stepping up your game. Whatever happens, you\u2019re gonna be an even better predator in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, stop trying to make me happy while I\u2019m eating,\u201d droned the goth. \u201cThese are this woman\u2019s final moments in this world. This is a solemn and serious-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy!\u201d snapped the Asian woman. \u201cQuit yer yapping and put those lips to good use, whipper snapper.\u201d And she shoved Lucy\u2019s face back against her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln could only laugh at the scene that was as absurd as it was typical.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peeking around the corner at the adult table, Lincoln could only assume that the portly Hispanic man must have tasted well above average. His upper half had already disappeared down Lori\u2019s gullet, leaving only a very hairy ass and kicking legs sticking out. A sizable bulge had been created in her throat and chest, more than tripling the girl\u2019s width. As she\u2019d done with Lincoln earlier, Lori tilted her head back to enlist gravity in helping pull the man down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no interest in watching the rest, Lincoln turned to Lisa. The smartest member of the family, she was also the youngest active predator. Now and then she\u2019d swallow her classmates for practice, or \u2018experiments\u2019 as she preferred to call them, though she\u2019d yet to digest anyone. To date, the biggest person she\u2019d pulled into her belly was Lana, and that was with Lola\u2019s help to push her in. Lincoln had seen this happen, and seeing the way Lisa had struggled was a pretty stark contrast to the ease with which Lori was downing her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShomething on your mind, male shibling?\u201d asked the book worm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLori\u2019s really pulling that guy down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned a disinterested eye on the scene. \u201cSheems show. Whatsh your point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m just a little curious. Did that guy look, I don\u2019t know, appetizing to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Hard to shay. My diet hash thush far been limited primarily to kindergartenersh, which I would deshcribe ash having a mild shweetnessh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone has their own unique flavor, but youth is generally associated with sweetness,\u201d lectured Lola authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa don\u2019t say,\u201d Lincoln replied, grateful that the food fight was on hold. \u201cSo we talking like flavors of cake or candy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda, but it\u2019s not exactly the same,\u201d Lana chimed in. \u201cLike this lady for instance.\u201d She leaned forward and took a long, broad lick of the Asian woman\u2019s arm. The dirty twin hummed her approval. \u201cYum. That\u2019s some good old lady right there.\u201d Her enthusiasm leveled out to more of a lecture. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda hard to compare to regular food. Old lady tastes like old lady, and sweaty dayworker tastes like sweaty dayworker. At least I hope for Lori\u2019s sake he was still sweaty. A guy like that marinated in his own sweat is the best! And don\u2019t get me started on the body hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, for the love of all that\u2019s holy, don\u2019t start on the body hair,\u201d said Lola, visibly repulsed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can stand that stuff. It\u2019s bad enough going down the first time, but there\u2019s always strands that get caught in your teeth that turn up, like, days later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the best part,\u201d Lana argued. \u201cIt\u2019s like the next level of a delayed after taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled as the twins started bickering. It was just like Lana to talk about the merits of eating body hair. Even as an outsider, Lincoln had to side with Lola in finding that super gross, but that was still a very Lana thing to say. This was a girl who regularly went dumpster diving just for the fun of it. She\u2019d probably eat body hair even if she weren\u2019t a predator. In a way, it was reassuring to know that being a predator was just a part of who Lana was, and probably a pretty insignificant part compared to something like her aspirations of being world class mechanic. He\u2019d never fully understand what it was like to be a predator, which hurt a little, but at least there was still plenty about his family that he could understand. All the predators in his life had more to them than just eating people, and that\u2019s why he loved them, people eating and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFashcinating,\u201d Lisa said while jotting down in her notes. \u201cTheshe dishparate opinionsh on human flavorsh will be usheful in my reshearch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Aren\u2019t there, like, predator cook books you could reference?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShurprishingly no. There are gourmet cooksh who cater to predatorsh, doing as father doesh with bashting and shpicesh. However, there are almosht no predatorsh in the professhion of cooking. Thoshe that are have not sheen fit to record their ideash and observationsh. Rather irreshponsible if you ashk me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s more along the lines of downright stupid,\u201d Lincoln added, pretending not to hear the elderly lady scream and swear in orgasmic bliss. Besides, even if Lisa was, like, a bazillion times smarter than him in most things, he prided himself on being able to understand her on at least a conceptual level. \u201cI mean, like you guys said, dad\u2019s doing his best, but he\u2019s prey like I am. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between an old lady and a young kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I agree that thish ish a tremendoush oversight, I think you may be overplaying the shignificance,\u201d countered Lisa. \u201cTo be clear, there are different flavorsh and all predatorsh have their preferencesh. However, in my reshearch, both through tashte teshting and interviewsh with our other shiblingsh, I have deduced that all people tashte good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. \u201cOkay, now that really doesn\u2019t make sense. Remember that time we all failed to make dinner and just slapped everything we had into one dish? That tasted awful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. However, from the perhspective of every predator I\u2019ve interviewed thush far, all prey tashtesh good. While there are still preferencesh and shome people are objectively more flavorful than othersh\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Lisa grabbed Lincoln\u2019s hand and stuck her finger in his mouth. She suckled for a few seconds before releasing him with a wet pop. \u201cI feel reashonably shafe in assherting that all predatorsh find all people at leasht moderately appealing. Thish would account for why there ish sho little culinary information written <i>by</i> predatorsh <i>for</i> predatorsh. By in large, mosht are content to shimply eat their food raw. What father doesh with hish shaucesh ish much like shprinklesh on ice cream. Appealing to shome, but far from necesshary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Lincoln could look too glum at his failure to understand, a small hand was set on his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your inquiry, male shibling. I appreciate you trying to undershtand ush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, bro. Thanks for putting in the effort,\u201d Lana added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really does mean a lot,\u201d Lola said with a gentle smile. \u201cIt can be so annoying dealing with ignorant people with all these misconceptions about predators. It\u2019s nice to have someone who tries to be different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lily, burbling her nonsense baby talk, gave a small but cheerful applause while looking at Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lucy started gagging, drawing all attention to herself. The old woman had disappeared into the goth\u2019s hungry maw up to her shoulders, creating a considerable bulge in her throat; like a python swallowing a horse. However, Lucy\u2019s sounds of protest and urgent pulls away were all signs that something had gone awry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy, what\u2019s happening?\u201d asked Lola, but the black haired girl could only give muffled sounds of discontent with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa adjusted her glasses. \u201cIt would appear that the woman\u2019sh mammary glandsh \u2013 shtreet name: boobsh \u2013 became uneven and are now clogging shishter Lucy\u2019sh throat,\u201d she analyzed professionally. \u201cRecommendation, we help force her in, or pull her out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want us to do, Lucy?\u201d Lincoln said as he stood, ready to take action one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gagging and unable to speak, Lucy eventually motioned for the woman to come forward. The residents of the kid\u2019s table acted immediately. Lana and Lola stuck their arms down either side of Lucy\u2019s mouth and into her throat. They\u2019d either dislodge the clog, or force the goth\u2019s throat wide enough that her natural swallowing could do the work on its own. Lily made baby burbles that almost sounded like she was cheering for Lucy, which was certainly thoughtful. Lisa pulled out a machine and applied suction cups attached by wires along Lucy\u2019s head and throat. With no other options, Lincoln climbed onto the table and slammed his shoulder into the old woman\u2019s saggy backside. She reeked of old lady, and not in the good way that predators seemed to like. Her skin was smooth, but also very baggy and kind of gross. Lincoln tried not to think about how his arm was wedged between the old woman\u2019s ancient ass cheeks and continued to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a frantic minute, the old woman budged and Lucy resumed more normal swallowing. Her siblings weren\u2019t taking any chances, however. The twins kept their arms in her mouth, Lisa continued whatever it was her machine was meant to do, and Lincoln stayed behind the unsexy lady\u2019s bare bottom, ready to offer another shove if the need arose. Thankfully for Lincoln, the worst had already passed and soon Lucy\u2019s lips closed around the woman\u2019s ass. Lana and Lola extracted their saliva covered arms, looking proud and repulsed respectively. Lisa continued monitoring the situation until the woman\u2019s toes vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, Lucy?\u201d inquired Lincoln worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her breath and hugging her swollen middle, Lucy eventually found her second wind and looked up. \u201cThanks guys. I don\u2019t know if I could have done it without you.\u201d Muffled sounds came from her belly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It wasn\u2019t your fault. I might have pushed myself too hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m proud of you for trying,\u201d encouraged Lincoln. \u201cThat\u2019s how predators get experience, by pushing themselves. Trust me. The next time will be easier. And if it isn\u2019t, you know who to call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare moment of joy she just couldn\u2019t repress, Lucy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheck on the grownup table or stick with the kid's table?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, over at the grownup table, things were proceeding about as normal as one could expect\u2026 relatively speaking. Lori had finally finished her guy and now looked like someone had dressed up a bowling ball with limbs and a shirt. Her clothes stretched snugly across her bloated frame with no signs of tear. Clothes tailored to handle a predator were expensive, but significantly cheaper than having to buy replacements after every meal. Speaking of meals, Lori unleashed a mighty belch that shook the entire room, thereby signaling her fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon,\u201d said the eldest sister with a blush, hands resting on her tremendous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. Nice one, sis. That sure was a gas. Haha,\u201d joked Luan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019ve heard better,\u201d Luna said dismissively as she started licking her woman\u2019s toes and making her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori turned a challenging eye on her younger sister. \u201cOh yeah? Where, when, and who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna extended her fingers as she listed. \u201cLast Thanksgiving, there,\u201d she gestured with her thumb at the kid\u2019s table, \u201cand Lana. I haven\u2019t felt a rumbling in my bones like that since my last McSwagger concert.\u201d The rocker\u2019s attention was stolen by the naked woman\u2019s needful whimper. \u201cOh, somethin\u2019 wrong, luv?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019ve never felt so appreciated before.\u201d She sniffled; whatever her name was. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude. I\u2019m just the food after all. But, d-do you think we could\u2026 continue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gave her best disarming smile. \u201cGladly. Get ready for the ride of your life, beautiful.\u201d She slipped the woman\u2019s feet fully into her maw, licking even more incessantly to drive her meal wild. To keep her under some minimal control, she grabbed the woman\u2019s butt and pulled her close. The woman reciprocated by wrapping her arms around Luna\u2019s head in a loving embrace. She pulled Luna\u2019s face against her chest and sighed contentedly that after all these years, finally someone thought that she was worth their time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita said nothing, on account of her mouth being full. She\u2019d flipped the boy face down and pushed his knees against his chest. Bent as he was, his thighs and lower back had been pulled into the expert predator\u2019s lips, but he\u2019d barely moved in some time. Trying to behave by keeping still, the boy gave mewling whimpers and groans as Rita\u2019s predatory tongue teased his sensitive balls and little pecker. She even probed at his anus, which brought on a loud squeak. Being touched down there felt weird, but in a good way. Sometimes he\u2019d try looking over his shoulder in the hopes of speaking to his devourer, but she\u2019d just give him a smile and he\u2019d turn away in embarrassment. That often led to the other people at the table also giggling at his plight. Those that looked his way all had such friendly and heartwarming smiles. He wished he could say something like that other woman did. He wanted to say how grateful he was for such kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita, indifferent to the thoughts of her food, was suckling his backside like a lollipop. He\u2019d cum already and wasn\u2019t likely to do so again, but she was content to savor his flesh for a little while longer. Sitting at the head of the table, now and then her elbow would <i>accidently</i> brush against her husband\u2019s and they\u2019d share a look. It was a silent promise that every calorie she was about to consume would be burned off before sunrise. While there wasn\u2019t anything in her husband\u2019s ancestry to suggest that he was an inert predator like Lincoln, Rita was hard pressed to think up an alternate explanation. His wizardry in the kitchen was superhuman, but topping that was how he was the only man she\u2019d ever met who could keep up with her in bed. Granted, he\u2019d still tire well before she did, but he still went further than anyone else. Add onto this his good taste, yummy flavor, that cute butt, and his vore fetish, and she was hard pressed to imagine spending her life with anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Rita was so distracted staring into her husband\u2019s eyes that she started involuntarily swallowing the boy\u2019s butt. She felt his pulse quicken and his squirming increase, but paid it no mind. In her experience, such last minute jitters was a perfectly natural reaction, especially for one so young. Besides, if he wanted to back out, he should have said something earlier. Staring at Lynn Sr. the entire time, Rita\u2019s tongue lapped along the boy\u2019s smooth stomach and eventually chest. When he tried putting his hands on her cheeks to slow his descent, her body reacted on reflex. She grabbed his wrists, folded his arms, and stuffed his elbows inside her cheeks. He whined in protest, but she didn\u2019t care. His flavor was rich and her husband\u2019s eyes were dreamy. When only the boy\u2019s face was left, she waited a second to give him one last look at her loving family; easily the best thing Rita could imagine for a last sight. Then she widened her lips, pushed her tongue out over his face, and gently pulled him in before clicking her teeth shut. That was the last anyone ever saw of the boy as she swallowed and sent him where food belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas he good?\u201d Lynn Sr. asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita set her hand on her husband\u2019s while the other rested on the slight bulge in her middle. \u201cA boy that cute was always going to be good. But in the hands of a master chef like you, of course he was delicious.\u201d She emphasized her point with a light lick across his lips. \u201cMmm. I can\u2019t wait for dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Loud parents were having a lovey-dovey moment, Luna was trying something similar with her meal. She\u2019d stalled around the woman\u2019s waist and held her hips in her mouth. This gave her ample access to her food\u2019s ass and pussy. Her tongue was ravishing both, probing deeply and lapping up every ounce of flavor she could reach. On her back on the plate, the woman was moaning loudly as she was eaten out a second time. Every time the black woman looked at <i>her</i> predator, the one responsible for all of these wonderful feelings, she\u2019d breathlessly mouth \u2018Thank you\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare moment of selfishness, Leni leaned over, pulled the woman up in a sitting position, and kissed her full on the mouth. The woman squeaked in surprise, but quickly started moaning and getting into it. Said kiss became increasingly intimate when Leni\u2019s lips parted to encompass the woman\u2019s entire face. Incensed, Luna began slapping at Leni\u2019s butt to get her to stop food stealing. It wasn\u2019t until Rita cleared her throat that Leni stopped and pulled her mouth away with a wet pop, leaving the woman dazed, yet happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just doing her head, mom. I swear,\u201d asserted the ditz defensively. \u201cShe looked so cute the way she was writhing around like that. I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d Then she turned to the aggrieved party. \u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been practicing your tongue work. This lady is loving it,\u201d she said with a chipper smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom anyone else in these circumstances, Luna would be upset by the empty flattery. But from Leni, she couldn\u2019t see such remarks as anything but sincere, which made her smile. Luna caught her mother\u2019s eye, silently telling her that this was her call. With her mouth still full, the rocker said \u201cOoo-haay,\u201d and gave her elder sister an encouraging push on the butt. Rita smiled her approval at her daughter\u2019s willingness to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I totes owe you,\u201d Leni said before engulfing the woman\u2019s face once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole grownup table was aware when the woman orgasmed again as her visible body spasmed and muffled cries of ecstasy came from Leni\u2019s mouth. Reasoning that she\u2019d already played with her food enough, Luna resumed swallowing. The hips were no obstacle as she licked her way up the woman\u2019s lean back. Showing extra consideration, Leni helped to flip the woman around in Luna\u2019s gullet so that the rocker had easier access to her breasts, easily her second favorite part of the female body. Luna kept climbing up the woman until, inevitably, her lips met Leni\u2019s. They shared a giggling kiss that soon became passionate as they embraced. Tongues tangled around the woman\u2019s head for a solid minute before Luna\u2019s swallowing won out. The kiss ended with some saliva connecting their lips and the sisters exchanged loving looks. Their seats were retaken and all was well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was little in the way of chatter for the rest of dinner. Everyone had said all that they felt needed saying while the preys were still on the plates. With the meal concluded, everyone stood to carry out after-dinner procedure. All leftover food was loaded up into containers and stored in the predator sized deluxe fridge. Plates were loaded into the sink after a brief scrub. Rita was the first to go, allowing her to survey the others to make sure no one was trying to weasel out of their responsibilities. When all was finished to the parents\u2019 satisfaction, the kids were dismissed to do as they liked before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s walk had become more of a waddle thank to her new figure, but her movment\u2019s hadn\u2019t been limited too badly. She pulled out her phone as she ascended the stairs, already chatting with her boyfriend. \u201cHey, there, Bubu-Bear. Guess who got to eat Leni\u2019s <i>leftovers</i>?\u201d she hummed melodically. At Bobby\u2019s eager reply, she held out her phone, angling the camera down for a full body selfie, and hit send. \u201cDid you get that, Bubu-Bear? Uh huh. No, it was just one guy. A big one. Aww. That\u2019s so sweet of you to say. Aww, I wish you were here too. You know I sleep better with my snuggle bear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to show off, Luna raced ahead of Lori up the stairs. Her meal hadn\u2019t slowed her down in the slightest. \u201cSo long, wide load,\u201d she teased before rushing to her room. She stroked her hand lovingly over her belly and said, \u201cSorry for the rough ride, babe. No, don\u2019t say that about yourself. You\u2019re beautiful. You wouldn\u2019t have tasted as good if you weren\u2019t. Trust me.\u201d Luna then grabbed her axe and sat on the bottom bunk, legs apart to make room for her bloated belly. \u201cHow about a nice little lullaby to sing you to sleep. I wrote it especially for all of the lovely meals who gave themselves to make me what I am today. So thanks.\u201d She stroked the strings and began to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy, however, was in dire straits once more. \u201cUuugh!\u201d she groaned between periodic belches. The goth took only a single step before falling forward. Only her massive stomach saved her face from colliding with the floor. \u201cSigh. Life alert. I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. Good one Lucy.\u201d Rather than helping right away, Luan\u2019s grin became sadistically playful as she lightly kicked at the goth\u2019s side, causing her to roll. \u201cHoly cow! Hey Lynn. Up for a game of Lucy ball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I?\u201d Lynn excitedly stated more than asked as she ran up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow girls,\u201d Rita chided. \u201cBe nice to your sister. You\u2019ve all overeaten before, so you should know what she\u2019s going through. At least take her to her room, first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, mom,\u201d Luan and Lynn saluted, grabbed the goth from either end, and hefted her up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh the humiliation. To be reduced to nothing but an object for my sisters to literally kick around. Siiigh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell. Was that her happy sigh or sad sigh?\u201d inquired Luan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe led with a morbid monologue, so I\u2019m pretty sure that was happy,\u201d reasoned Lynn. \u201cBut hey, good on you for pushing your limits, sis. Only way to get ahead in this world is to give it a hundred and ten percent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Rita as the last predator in the kitchen. A lifetime of eating people had given her a truly impressive frame. Not only were her womanly assets top tier, but 6ft 2in, her physique was practically Amazonian in proportions. As such, the boy in her belly wouldn\u2019t have even been noticeable if he wasn\u2019t moving around so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got a squirmer,\u201d teased Lynn Sr, setting his hand on his wife\u2019s belly. \u201cThis is why you ought to have eaten more, so there wouldn\u2019t be so much room in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually like it when they squirm,\u201d tittered Rita as she lovingly stroked her tummy. Her food was saying something, but she tuned it out. \u201cI always have, but now it reminds me of when I felt the kids moving inside me for the first time.\u201d She kissed her husband\u2019s cheek. \u201cSorry for not giving you the big belly you wanted, but when I saw this boy\u2019s application, I just couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind. If you hadn\u2019t taken him, he might have gotten cold feet and either rescinded the offer or picked someone else. It\u2019s not like we could have held him until more kids came along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny you should mention that,\u201d Rita replied, her scheme evident in her expression. \u201cWith the money we\u2019ve been making from volunteers lately, I was thinking about creating an extension to the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr.\u2019s brows rose in intrigue. \u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Rita asserted flatly, not wanting to set off a false alarm that would send the whole house into a panic. \u201cNot yet, anyway. I was actually reading online about how some predators keep their food in pins. You know, like a barn to keep the livestock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. scratched his chin as he thought. \u201cIf we keep them, we\u2019ll have to feed them. That might put too much of a strain on our food budget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily. Legally we\u2019re obligated to feed them, but we can just give them discount stuff. And with us predators switching more towards <i>paying</i> prey instead of mountains of steaks\u2026\u201d Rita trailed off with a coy grin, still rubbing her belly. \u201cI\u2019ll need Lisa to check the math, but I\u2019m pretty sure a barn would actually save us money in the long run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I suppose I can see that,\u201d Lynn Sr. allowed. \u201cBut what will they do in the mean time? It seems unreasonable to just have them locked away without anything to keep themselves busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita pursed her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s the only part that seems a little tricky. From what I read, most predators who use pins keep their food <i>here</i> the house as, well\u2026 slaves. There\u2019s no dancing around it. Most pin users have their prey do things like keep the house tidy, or even go out and work to pull in some extra income.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. nodded, understanding the dilemma fully. \u201cIf we have the food do the chores, then the kids could end up lazy or even entitled. And there goes 17 years of good parenting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita smiled gratefully at her husband\u2019s priorities. Questions of morality weren\u2019t really a factor when it came to predators, especially not since anyone they put in the pin would be a volunteer. It went without saying that they couldn\u2019t risk holding a non-volunteer for any period of time. They might try to escape and hurt someone. No, the main issue with the pin idea was keeping the kids from being spoiled\u2026 along with all the other problems that they couldn\u2019t think of just yet, but would inevitably turn up at the worst possible time. \u201cIt was just a thought, honey. We can take our time to work out the details. For now\u2026\u201d She tapped suggestively at her belly. \u201cLet\u2019s send this kid out the same way he came in; with a bang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. growled romantically, grabbed his wife\u2019s wrist, and pulled her along to the master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Louds engaged in more benign activities. After the day he\u2019d had, Lincoln felt that he\u2019d earned some solitary video game time in the living room. Leni, after putting Lily to bed, retired to her room to work on the 10 piece puzzle that had been stumping her for the last week. Since it was too late for experimenting, Lisa decided to clean her work area and take inventory of her materials, just in case her siblings had swiped something or the beakers grew legs and ran off again\u2026 not that that had ever happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the peaceful winding down of another day in the Loud House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPick up with the Louds on a holiday Monday morning, regular Monday, or later?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln awoke sometime around the crack of dawn that morning, his bladder beating his alarm clock to the punch. That was probably for the best, since it meant that he might have a greater chance of beating his sisters to the bathroom. After quickly dressing and performing some basic warmup exercises, the middle Loud ran a mental list of what he\u2019d be dealing with. It might have been Monday, but it was a holiday, which meant that the family had time to \u2018enjoy\u2019 themselves, as opposed to the weekday morning rush. Lori, Luna, and Lucy would most likely be preoccupied with their predator bathrooms. Mom and dad weren\u2019t a factor since the master bedroom had its own fully furnished tub and toilet. Leni might still be dealing with the remains of the guy she ate yesterday afternoon, and Lily was still being potty trained. This left five sisters to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln poked his head out the door to survey the hall that connected his siblings\u2019 rooms; aka: the war zone. It was quiet. Too quiet. Alas, his bladder informed him that he didn\u2019t have the time for patience, so he stepped out. Living in a house full of predators, Lincoln had learned a lot about their instincts. For one, it was almost always a bad idea to run from a predator as that risked triggering their chase response. The trick was to move at a brisk power walk and keep calm. Predators could smell fear. Or that might have just been sisters. Either way was a concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing through!\u201d Lynn stormed out of her room on her bike, naked except for a catcher\u2019s mask and her lucky jockstrap. She wielded a hockey stick and battered a ball that Lincoln only dodged because he\u2019d been expecting something like that. At least that was one sister accounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up to the crossroads between the rooms of the twins and the youngest Louds, Lincoln listened carefully. Lola and Lana were bickering about something, which was normal, if a bit early. It also meant that they\u2019d most likely be preoccupied for a while. There was only silence from Lisa and Lily\u2019s room, which was disconcerting. After so many years of Lisa\u2019s science experiments, the absence of explosions or other chaotic sounds from that room was somewhat unnatural. Seeing no point in looking a gift horse in the mouth, Lincoln hurried on through, only to slow back down after passing the doors. There could still be predators lying in wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah!\u201d Lincoln jumped, spun to face the disturbance, and adopted a defensive pose. When he saw only Lucy, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHow do you always do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shadows are my friends. They allow me to slip into places unseen,\u201d replied the goth cryptically. \u201cThe shadows also whisper that you need to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt this time of morning, I\u2019d say that\u2019s more common sense,\u201d he replied plainly, relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed an escort? I owe you for your help yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure. That\u2019d be appreciated.\u201d With a gentlemen\u2019s bow, Lincoln extended his hand to take Lucy\u2019s and they walked side-by-side to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Leni came out of her room in her night gown and waved at the approaching pair. \u201cHey guys. Want to join me in the shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later. I\u2019ve gotta go number two first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Then by all means.\u201d Leni motioned the boy ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lincoln questioned hesitantly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some trick to let my guard down so you can eat me, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Lincoln. Don\u2019t be silly. No one\u2019s gonna eat you <i>before</i> you use the toilet, except maybe Lana. That\u2019s just bad manners and all kinds of gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln face palmed for forgetting something so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done my part. You can take him from here, Leni,\u201d Lucy said before heading back. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go finish writing Ms. Miller\u2019s eulogy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind them, Leni slipped out of her nightgown and shimmied out of her panties before tossing both into the clothes\u2019 basket. She had no shame about bearing her impressive ass and globular breasts for her brother to see. In fact, for no particular reason, she fully bent over and touched her toes before glancing over her shoulder. \u201cLike what you see, Linky?\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing from the lewd sight, Lincoln clamped his legs together while hopping between his feet and gestured to the toilet. \u201cUh, bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind waiting.\u201d Leni turned around and cocked her hip as one hand stroked under her breast. \u201cHmm. Lincoln, do my boobs look bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had already planted himself on the toilet to do his business, pants around his ankles, but found it difficult with someone watching him. \u201cUh, can\u2019t this wait? You know I\u2019m a shy pooper. Besides, since you digested a guy yesterday, the answer\u2019s probably yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know that. But I mean, like, more than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed his exasperation. \u201cIf you get in the shower, I\u2019ll help you check as soon as I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Linky,\u201d she chirped, walking with a swagger past the boy on the toilet. She unnecessarily bent over to turn on the shower, pushing her butt in his face. \u201cWhat about here? Am I bigger here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeniii!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You told me not to look, so I\u2019m not looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was technically true, but no less annoying. \u201cPlease just get in the shower already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Just so long as you hurry up with your teeny tiny prey poop,\u201d she giggled as she climbed in and pulled the shower curtain closed, giving some tiny semblance of privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed his relief\u2026 only for the door to slam open as Lola rushed inside. \u201cHey, occupied!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d questioned Lola, glancing at the tub. \u201cHow many?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the two of us. So you\u2019re good,\u201d replied Leni helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d Lola locked the door to ensure that the rule of three would be followed. Strutting confidently over to the hamper, she also stripped bare before strutting to the shower like she was on the catwalk. \u201cYou <i>will</i> be joining us, won\u2019t you, Linky?\u201d Her voice was sweet, but her smile assured that this was not a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned. \u201cSomeday\u2026 someday I\u2019m going to make it to the bathroom and get out without any funny business from my sisters,\u201d he quietly avowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Keep dreaming, mister,\u201d said Lola dismissively. \u201cNow hurry with your teeny tiny prey poop so you can do your brotherly duties and help your sisters shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hung his head in defeat and quietly motioned her to go on into the tub, which she thankfully did without a fuss. She\u2019d already won, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Leni! Did your boobs get bigger?\u201d Lola\u2019s voice echoed off the tub and tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right. They totes look bigger. Like, bigger than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Let me feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln turned a dumbfounded expression on the shower curtain and those who lay beyond. \u2018Seriously?\u2019 he mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, mamma! It feels like they\u2019re a full millimeter bigger than last time.\u201d Lola went quiet and Lincoln could practically hear the gears in her head turning. Lincoln also saw the silhouettes of the smaller blonde jump onto the bigger one\u2019s chest. \u201cWho did you eat, woman!? What was in that guy that got you to grow so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. He never gave his name,\u201d whimpered Leni as the tiny terror overpowered her. \u201cHe just came up to me, said I was pretty, and that he wanted to make me even prettier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA guy off the street?\u201d asked Lola in disbelief. \u201cDid he at least pay you first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no. He had this kit full of makeup, though. It was some really nice stuff. They were all brands that are only being sold by that new makeup store. Which, come to think of it, was just across the road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Leni. I don\u2019t think that guy was a volunteer,\u201d Lincoln offered. \u201cIt sounds like he was a store employee trying to sell you makeup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh uh. He was totes a volunteer. I asked him to strip for me and he did.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola groaned. \u201cUgh. Of course he did. You probably batted your eyelashes and pushed up your perky boobs-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, that hurts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-until no sane person could resist.\u201d Lola\u2019s tone shifted from irate to impressed. \u201cLeni, you sneaky devil. You actually manipulated someone into volunteering. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did? Wow. I wasn\u2019t even aware I was doing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola hopped back down to the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s cuz you\u2019re a natural, sister. A true hunter doesn\u2019t go looking for prey, but makes the prey come to her. Speaking of which.\u201d The tiny blonde snapped her fingers impatiently. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed that he hadn\u2019t been forgotten, Lincoln flushed the toilet, stripped, and climbed into the tub with his sisters\u2026 again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHere. Let me help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lincoln could ask what she meant, Leni had picked the boy up under his arms, turned him to face away from her, and wedged his scrawny body between her titanic titties. Fearful of falling, he wrapped his arms around the sides. However, when Leni pulled her hands away, Lincoln didn\u2019t budge an inch, much to his and Lola\u2019s surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! I\u2019ve finally got boobs of holding, just like mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Lincoln looked down. Breast flesh took up the entirety of his vision and completely obscured everything below his chest. \u201cWow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComfy, Linky?\u201d Leni asked while pressing on the sides of her breasts. \u201cMmmh. This feels nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 kinda does, actually,\u201d he conceded while reclining into his\u2026 carrier? Leni\u2019s skin was soft and warm and the steady rhythm of her heartbeat against his back was relaxing. \u201cMmh. I think I could get used to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s really sweet of you to say, Linky. Hey, I should try this on Lynn next. What do you think, Lola?\u201d No answer. Leni bent forward a couple inches to peer over her mountainous chest at the pouting blonde. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is your boobs are almost as big as me. It\u2019s not fair!\u201d The little princess stomped her foot in a mild tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually completely fair,\u201d Lincoln dared to argue. \u201cShe\u2019s older, so of course she\u2019s, ya know, bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s just cheating, somehow. She\u2019s got some kind of secret diet that she\u2019s not telling us about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s expression was deadpan. \u201cReally. You think that <i>Leni</i>, of all people, could keep a secret to sabotage others from being as pretty as she is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola averted her gaze. \u201cWell anything can sound absurd when you say it like <i>that</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola, I promise, I\u2019m not on any kind of special diet. If I am, it\u2019s totes not on purpose. Besides, you\u2019re still in your tiny adorable phase. As soon as the boobs come in, they basically kill the adorable factor. If there\u2019s one thing Lola Loud knows how to do, it\u2019s working with what she\u2019s got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola huffed and turned away with a grumble. \u201cI guess that\u2019s true. Not like I can argue with the power of cute.\u201d She looked down at herself. \u201cAt least I can still see my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for sticking up for me, Linky. I knew I could count on you.\u201d With most of his body still engulfed in her breasts, Leni wrapped her arms around her brother, squishing her mammary glands even more tightly around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 breathe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops, sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln panted. \u201cNo worries. Besides, I was literally already in the middle of it. It was either diffuse the situation, or be on the business end of Lola\u2019s wrath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was still really sweet of you.\u201d Hugging more gently this time, Leni pulled Lincoln up a ways until her lips were pressed against his neck. She inhaled deeply and took a long, sensual lick, making him shudder. \u201cMmm. You know, you never did give me that tummy rub, but I\u2019ll settle for a boob rub instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSettle. Hmmph!\u201d huffed the smaller blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know how to make that frown turn upside down.\u201d Without further ado, Leni hoisted Lola up in the air and deposited the little girl into her cleavage, face-to-face with Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair just stared at one another in awkward silence. They were naked, their bodies pressed against one another, they were surrounded by Leni\u2019s rockin\u2019 rack, and Lincoln was experiencing an involuntary physical reaction that was poking his sister\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to recover from Leni\u2019s brazenness, Lola began to grin. \u201cFancy seeing you here, mister.\u201d She wiggled to adjust her position, making Leni groan. \u201cWow, this is comfy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola. Don\u2019t squirm so much. My boobs are really sensitive right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cAnd there it is.\u201d The white haired boy would have elaborated, except his mouth had been overtaken by his little sister\u2019s. Lola was kissing him at full force while grinding and undulating her body against his. Leni was crying out loud enough that half the house could hear her. Despite foreseeing this, Lincoln still couldn\u2019t react in time to stop the little girl\u2019s hand slipping down between them and grabbing his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough of that,\u201d Leni said authoritatively as she extracted the smaller blonde from her busty hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Leni. Things were just getting fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I wanted a boob rub, not a boob\u2026 whatever you call it when two people start going at it while on top of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a term for that,\u201d observed Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is I just wanted to relax with my family massaging me. If you can\u2019t keep it in your pants, then I\u2019ll just have to keep you in mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking abo-oh no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her usual carefree grin, Leni slipped Lola behind her and wedged the smaller girls face into her ass crack. \u201cMmh. Now <i>that\u2019s</i> what I call relaxing,\u201d she hummed contentedly before looking down at Lincoln. \u201cC\u2019mon, Lincoln. Pretty please, give me a boob rub?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Lola\u2019s muffled protests from down below, Lincoln obliged and got to rubbing. He attempted long, rhythmic strokes, covering as much skin as possible with the entirety of his arms. Careful not to go too fast and risk upsetting whatever arbitrary standards his big sister had set, Lincoln was relieved when she gave another contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Lola was not happy. Leni\u2019s stupid, smelly butt was all around her face. No, it didn\u2019t matter how soft it was or how her natural musk was alluring. Lola Loud would not suffer such an indignity\u2026 without a fight. Unfortunately, she had little leverage in this position, and Leni was significantly stronger. It wasn\u2019t long before the pucker twitching against the princess\u2019 nose began to open and grab around the little Loud\u2019s face. A flurry of curses flew from her lips that could have peeled paint, but they were ignored by the larger pred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni bit her lower lip as she felt her anus stretch around her sister\u2019s head. \u201cLola\u2019s putting up a real fight back there,\u201d she told her brother. \u201cNot enough to get out, but it feels sooo gooood.\u201d Aligning herself under the shower stream, Leni decided to have a seat. The younger Loud was trapped between a hard place and a soft tunnel and quickly forced deeper in. \u201cMmmh. That\u2019s it, Lols. I love it when you wiggle like that. And Linky, don\u2019t stop on my account. I know you like this, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the mention of his name, Lincoln resumed his breast massage. He listened carefully to his sister\u2019s moans and tried to discern the spots that got the best reactions. In listening, he could also make out Lola\u2019s ravings. The words were muffled, but the sentiment was clear. \u201cI hope Lola won\u2019t be too mad when she comes out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe never is,\u201d Lola hummed. \u201cShe puts up a fuss, but I know she like\u2019s my butt. Before you came in, I caught her staring back there a bunch, even when she should have been looking at my boobs.\u201d She sucked in a breath through her teeth. \u201cNow only her little feet are outside me. Hehe. Her toes tickle.\u201d Leni wrapped her arms under her breasts and around her brother, holding him tight without being constrictive. \u201cMy brother in my boobs and my sister in my butt. This is the best massage a girl could ask for.\u201d Reaching between her breasts, she grabbed Lincoln\u2019s chin and turned him to face her, just in time to plunge her tongue into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln felt his eyes roll into the back of his head. His sister\u2019s saliva was euphoric. Combined with the steady rhythm of her heart and the warmth of her grand breasts, and his eyelids were becoming dangerously heavy. As if sensing this, Leni ended the kiss, leaving only a single strand of saliva connecting their lips before the shower washed it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Linky. I can always count on you for a good time.\u201d Still sitting, Leni extracted her brother and set him down beside her, careful to make sure he could still stand on his own. Afterwards she stood and encouraged him to join her in more platonic washing. He tried, but it was distracting being so close to an ass full of sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally finished cleaning. Lincoln put his old clothes back on, but Leni just walked out naked. It wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d gone back to her room that the boy finally noticed his painfully erect penis. \u201c\u2026 dang it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow Lincoln as he deals with this latest dilemma, or skip ahead to the next one?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln was in quite the peculiar position. His sisters almost never left him with blue balls. Leni must have been distracted with having Lola moving in her butt. No big deal. All he had to do was leave the bathroom, go into Leni\u2019s room, and politely ask her to finish what she started\u2026 and hope she didn\u2019t take things too far. Piece of cake, right? As if. Psyching himself up and mentally running through the best word choice to \u2018guide\u2019 Leni into doing what he wanted, Lincoln readied to head out. His face was immediately hit by the door swinging open. \u201cCan no one in this house open a door without tackling it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops. Sorry, bro.\u201d Dressed in her purple night shirt with the skull insignia, Luna reached down to help her brother up. \u201cWhoa, dude. That\u2019s a mighty fine tent yer pitchin\u2019.\u201d Luna\u2019s lascivious grin turned sour. \u201cI didn\u2019t jus\u2019 catch you tryin\u2019 ta rub one out, did I? You know mom\u2019s rule on masturbation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cI know, but that\u2019s the issue. See, we were in the shower, when Leni shoved me in her giant boobs and asked for a massage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola was kinda acting up, I guess, so Leni shoved her up her ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh hmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I guess that she got so distracted with Lola that she,\u201d Lincoln gestured down to himself, \u201cleft me high and dry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckled. \u201cMajor bummer. Oh well. Sucks to be her.\u201d She lifted her younger brother up and tossed him over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes. \u201cC\u2019mon, bro. Let\u2019s get you taken care of.\u201d She patted his butt possessively as she walked down the hall to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but can we make this quick? I was planning on hanging out with Clyde, today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna tsked. \u201cSo demanding, li\u2019l bro. Almost sounds like yer takin\u2019 our services fer granted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln couldn\u2019t see it, but he could feel Luna\u2019s teasing smirk. He took a few calming breaths before he said something he\u2019d regret. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just been an especially hectic 24 hours. Also I can\u2019t believe Leni blue balled me like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I agree with. It\u2019s not like her at all,\u201d said Luna as she entered her room. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little dude. Big sis Luna is gonna take good care of you.\u201d Closing the door behind her, she set Lincoln down on her top bunk. \u201cComfy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. So, what\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomethin\u2019 special, dude.\u201d Luna ascended the ladder with her laptop in hand. She sat down behind her brother and planted him in her lap. The rocker made sure to lean extra far forward so that her breasts pressed against his back as she set up whatever she was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sniffed the air. \u201cAre you wearing perfume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna froze, her body going rigid. \u201cUh\u2026 no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln took several more sniffs, following the scent to Luna\u2019s armpits and neck. \u201cYou are!\u201d he exclaimed in accusation. \u201cI thought you hated perfume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I hated it. I just\u2026 thought that maybe, ya know\u2026\u201d Luna averted her gaze and gave off other signals of discomfort. \u201cIt was time for a change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning tersely, Lincoln reached out and closed Luna\u2019s laptop. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t take that tone with me, little dude. You know what I can do to you,\u201d she warned while roughly grabbing his shoulders and spinning him around to face her in her lap. She cut an imposing figure with plenty of muscle built up from years of eating people. Between the muscles, the height, and raw sexual allure, she could easily snap the little boy like a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, however, was unfazed by the empty threat. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever tone I want, cuz I\u2019m your brother and you\u2019re acting weird. So you can either tell me what\u2019s going on, or we can go the nuclear option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s pupils shrunk to pinpricks. \u201cY-yer bluffing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sucked in a breath and readied to yell with all of his might to summon the other sisters for an intervention, only for a hand to slap over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright-alright! You made your point,\u201d Luna whisper hissed. She exhaled her defeat. \u201cFine. See, the thing is that tonight is\u2026 is date night for me and Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Not seeing the issue yet, but okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Sam\u2019s a really cool chick. I like hangin\u2019 with her, but lately things have been gettin\u2019 a little\u2026\u201d Luna rubbed the back of her neck apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that works. See, Sam and I don\u2019t really have all that much in common. She likes being eaten and I like eating her, but that\u2019s, like, 90% of what we do together. I thought if I changed things up a little, maybe she\u2019d see me as more than just a pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed. \u201cSorry to say this Luna, but that\u2019s one of the stupidest things I\u2019ve heard all week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna reacted like she\u2019d been slapped right across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018just a pred\u2019,\u201d he quoted derisively. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>her</i> pred. Everyone in the house knows it. Heck, I\u2019ve seen how you two look at each other. Trust me. There\u2019s nothing stale about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln set his hands on his hips and confidently pushed his chest out. \u201cAs prey living in a house full of preds, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve learned a thing or two about predator/prey relationships. It\u2019s like the difference between people who volunteer only once vs repeat customers who always apply for the same predator. They\u2019re smitten, and Sam\u2019s definitely got it bad for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sniffled, fighting the tears pooling in her eyes. \u201cR-really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so what if most of what you do involves vore? Can\u2019t be worse than Lori texting Bobby 24/7.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckled while pressing her forearm over her eyes. \u201cDammit, dude. How do you always know the right things to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, man with the plan here.\u201d Lincoln gestured at himself. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the girl with the sound. You\u2019re always there to help us when we need just the right sound for cleaning, or taking action, or even just going to sleep. That\u2019s pretty much our thing and we get along just fine,\u201d he reminded plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna yanked Lincoln forward and buried his face in her chest as she nuzzled the top of his head. \u201cThanks fer sayin\u2019 that, bro. I really needed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln turned his head so that at least he could breathe. \u201cHappy to help,\u201d he strained to say. \u201cThat said, this isn\u2019t exactly helping with my boner issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops. Sorry. Here, let me get you started.\u201d Luna proceeded to strip Lincoln bare. Her dexterous hands moved with practiced ease in the familiar task. Like eating him, the sisters had lost count of the number of times they\u2019d stripped him, except maybe Lisa. When Lincoln was bare, Luna smiled down at him and wiped a bit of drool from her lips when she beheld his exposed cock. \u201cSmugglin\u2019 some sausage, aye bro?\u201d She tittered. \u201cIt ain\u2019t that big, but I can tell it\u2019s mighty juicy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hunched over and tried covering his naughty parts. Whether she meant to or not, Luna always had a way of making him feel self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t hog the meat all to yourself, bro.\u201d Luna set a finger beneath Lincoln\u2019s chin and forced him to meet her look. Her eyes were gentle, yet lustful. Her smile was kind, but also drooling. \u201cJust because I prefer pie over sausage, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019ve got the yummiest wiener I\u2019ve ever tasted. You know that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln relaxed a little. For predators, complimenting someone\u2019s taste could mean different things depending on the context. Mostly it just meant that they were hungry. But with those they cared about, especially in the tone that Luna just used, it was a way of saying \u2018I love you\u2019. Luna might like to tease her only brother, as did the others, but she still cared about him. Lincoln decided to return that affection with a quick peck to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa!\u201d Luna pulled away, giggling. \u201cNot so fast. Save it for the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. What\u2019d you think the laptop was for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln turned to find that the machine had finally booted. Luna had brought up the webchat and was adjusting the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the feed. Everythin\u2019 comin\u2019 through?\u201d Luna asked as a face appeared. It was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is looking for some video phone sex, Luna's audience for her web show, other predators for her to show off to, someone else, or an interruption?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blank feed suddenly gave way to the bedroom of Sam. From what could be seen, the blonde with the blue streak in her hair was dressed in a lacy red bra and panties that were practically see-through. Possibly her night clothes, but based on her expression, more likely something she wore special for this call. Sam sat cross-legged on her bed against the headboard and was practically bouncing with anticipation.  \u201cHey there, Luns.\u201d Sam tilted her shoulder forward and gave a playful wink. \u201cHow\u2019s my hungry girl doing today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic now that I\u2019m lookin\u2019 at you, luv. Aww, you know the red one\u2019s my favorite,\u201d Luna cooed. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ribbon just waitin\u2019 to be torn off a present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is?\u201d Sam asked, feigning shock. \u201cI would never have guessed. Oh, and who\u2019s this handsome devil?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sam.\u201d Lincoln casually waved, unbothered about being seen in the nude, though he was blushing at the thought of what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, little dude? You here to help with Luna\u2019s big opener?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong story short, yeah. I suppose I am.\u201d Lincoln leaned back until his head rested against Luna\u2019s breasts. \u201cIs this about that thing you wanted my help with yesterday?\u201d he asked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet your tiny pale ass it is.\u201d Luna slipped out of her night shirt, revealing no bra or panties. This earned an approving whistle from Sam. \u201cHold your horses, luv. Not done yet.\u201d Luna pushed the laptop a short distance away, and laid Lincoln down flat on the bed, but at an angle. Making sure the camera caught everything; she planted her muscular knees to either side of his scrawny hips as her pussy loomed imposingly just above his pole. \u201cCan ya see alright, luv?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded eagerly. \u201cGot the faces and the crotches.\u201d She squealed with glee. \u201cI love it when you fuck your brother. It\u2019s so\u2026 naughty!\u201d She licked her lips for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproval achieved, Luna set one hand on Lincoln\u2019s chest and slowly descended upon him. She hissed when his tip touched her lips, the sudden stimulation sending shivers up her spine, but pressed on. Even drawing things out for the sake of her audience, it still took only ten seconds for Luna to hilt herself. \u201cSee, this right here is why mom doesn\u2019t let us have sex toys,\u201d she said with a confident smirk. \u201cWhy waste the money when family\u2019s better, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was fanning herself as she brazenly pulled her panties aside and fingered her pink nether lips. \u201cGod, that\u2019s sexy!\u201d she panted. \u201cEven if you did have a toy, they\u2019re nothing compared to the real thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was breathing heavily. Luna might not have had a full belly, but she was still pretty heavy. Her great weight squished him against the mattress as her thighs blocked his side view. Forward there was the lovely breasts and confident smirk of his musical sister, and looking \u2018up\u2019 was said sister\u2019s upside-down girlfriend getting off to seeing him used. He couldn\u2019t blame her. Luna\u2019s pussy was hot and tight. She had enough muscle control to squeeze his prick with the dexterity of a tongue. He tried to start thrusting, but Luna\u2019s hand held him fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gave him the wagging finger of chastiment. \u201cNot yet, bro. First, ya gotta talk ta yer audience. Tell her what it\u2019s like being dominated by yer big, sexy sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln tried evening his breath. \u201cIt\u2019s, ahh\u2026 Really heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam giggled. \u201cAww, is the big bad pred being mean to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shook his head. Since he couldn\u2019t thrust, he opted to run his hands along Luna\u2019s inner thighs to coax her to start moving. \u201cNah. She can be a little rough, but she\u2019s never mean. She\u2019s actually one of the sweeter sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrooo!\u201d Luna whined as Sam laughed it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try denying it, babe. We both know he\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard you play more beautifully than when someone\u2019s inside you, especially me.\u201d As she started plunging her fingers more deeply into her pussy, Sam\u2019s other free hand pulled on the left side of her bra and began pinching her nipple, all while she never looked away from the screen. \u201cNgh! I wish I could be there right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna started rotating her hips, making Lincoln cry out as he moved around inside her. \u201cYou \u2018n\u2019 me both, luv. Where do you think you\u2019d be, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now? Definitely sitting on Lincoln\u2019s face. His tongue work is great and we could make out while he gets us off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the hand that wasn\u2019t holding Lincoln down, Luna began groping her own breast. \u201cI like that. I\u2019d kiss your neck, grab that scrumptious booty of yours, and lick your face all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam began rubbing herself more vigorously as she bit her bottom lip. \u201cOooh, I love when the licking starts. You can never stop with just that, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even if I could. It\u2019s not just the taste, luv. I love your body. The way your nipples tickle my throat and how everything has just the right amount of squish. Ngh! It\u2019s like you were made to be eaten by me.\u201d Luna lifted herself a short ways off her brother\u2019s ten-year-old cock until only the tip was left inside, and then dropped down with the full force of her weight. \u201cF-fuck, bro! That thing might be small, but it packs a punch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln could only groan as Luna rode him. His whole body was hot and Luna\u2019s pussy was pulling needfully on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it does, though I bet you\u2019re mostly saying that cuz he\u2019s your brother,\u201d huffed Sam as she writhed under her own ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Luna conceded, starting to pant from the exertion. It thrilled her to no end to fuck her brother in front of her girlfriend. \u201cYa know, Lincoln was saying the nicest things about you, earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa don\u2019t say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He said he could tell that you\u2019re smitten with me; that I\u2019m not \u2018just a pred\u2019 to you. I\u2019m <i>your</i> pred.\u201d Luna giggled as she dropped down with a twisting action that made Lincoln really start to squirm. \u201cWhich I guess makes you my yummy little prey.\u201d She licked her lips for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweet Jesus, yes!\u201d Sam cried out. Her body seized up for a couple seconds before going limp against the headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Did my yummy prey tucker herself out already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed breathlessly. \u201cNo way, Luns. This was all <i>your</i> fault, calling me your p-prey like that.\u201d She struggled to pull herself upright. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can wait until tonight, babe. I\u2026 I need to be inside you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJus\u2019 hold on a sec, luv. We haven\u2019t even gotten to the best part. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll tide you over \u2018til then.\u201d Luna resumed rocking her hips back and forth, sliding Lincoln\u2019s cock within her in short but rapid thrusts. The boy tensed as his load erupted into her. Demonstrating muscle control that was only possible for a predator, Luna sealed her vaginal walls to keep his cum from going too deep. She waited until Lincoln finished cumming before lifting herself off and pushed the clear white goop out onto her hands. Holding eye contact with Sam, she brought the goop up to her mouth and licked her hand clean. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way bro, but your cum tastes better than it feels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungs burning, Lincoln couldn\u2019t speak. He could only give a weak thumbs up before his arm went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stared at the screen and huffed with the most adorable and longing pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wished I\u2019d saved that for ya, aye luv?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t worry. This\u2019ll be something I <i>know</i> you\u2019ll enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna tries unbirth or anal vore. Two simple techniques that she's pretty good at. Maybe she tries the more advanced and experimental breast vore or even becomes a futa?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luna started by adjusting her setup. She moved her back against the headboard and brought the laptop closer to keep the view. The rocker turned to face herself and Lincoln to the screen fully this time. She stared down at the scrawny boy with a lustful hunger and whispered, \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten off yet. Plus you still owe me for yesterday.\u201d She teased along her sex as she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in a house of preds left Lincoln with a pretty good idea of where this was going. There was, however, one thing weighing down his thoughts. \u201cIf this is going where I think it is, why didn\u2019t you just get Leni or someone bigger to start with? Even if it\u2019s for practice, which we both know you don\u2019t need, why not get someone closer to her size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna leaned down and cupped her hand adoringly to Lincoln\u2019s cheek. \u201cCuz I missed you, dude. Lately it seems like any time I try looking for you, someone else has already called dibs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true enough. In this house, some predators were definitely more proactive in hunting than others, especially when it came to their favorite brother. Luna was more easy-going and preferred her prey to come to her, preferably lured with her music. This was a stark contrast to someone like Lori, who viewed all her younger siblings as her permanent on-call stress relievers, or Lynn, who was known to chase down anyone the moment her stomach rumbled. Lincoln had learned a few tricks to prolong his outside time, even if he ended up inside someone at least once per day. But Luna was right. It <i>had</i> been a while since he\u2019d last been in her. And just like family activities, although Lincoln enjoyed his alone time, he also liked being there with and for his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled appreciatively and pushed up on his elbows. \u201cThat didn\u2019t stop you when Lynn got me the other day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckled. \u201cYeah. She had it coming, always going around with that tight butt hanging out. I made sure to teach her a lesson about stealing other people\u2019s food, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike any of you are gonna learn that when mom\u2019s not around.\u201d Brother and sister shared a snicker at their functionally chaotic family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sam cleared her throat. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. I just, uh\u2026 Oh!\u201d She reached over to the nightstand and downed half a glass of ice water. \u201cGlad I came prepared. Okay. Please continue. You two are so cute together,\u201d the blonde gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, luv. We were just gettin\u2019 ta the good part, anyway.\u201d Luna pushed Lincoln back down and grabbed his feet. She lifted them to her face until Lincoln was almost off the bed and started licking his toes. He laughed and squirmed around as her tongue ran across his soles and between his toes. Luna hummed her approval and locked eyes with Sam. \u201cSlightly sweaty, but I can tell he just got out of the shower, so they\u2019re mostly clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you prefer a clean body?\u201d Sam asked entranced, her hand returning to her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends. A little dirt and sweat is like a spritzing of spice, but I don\u2019t go overboard like Lana,\u201d Luna explained between licks before shoving both feet fully in her mouth, creating two small but noticeable bulges in her cheeks. Lincoln started frantically thrashing as his laughter turned uproarious and he begged her for mercy. Luna ignored him and focused on the taste. Eventually she released his feet with a pop and a satisfied \u201cAhh. That should do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln couldn\u2019t speak. He was still coming down from his laughing fit as Luna set him back down. However, she kept her hold on his feet and brought the slickened appendages to her equally moist pussy. She sucked in a hissing breath and curled her toes when his toes made contact, but didn\u2019t falter in her insertion. It felt to Lincoln like his feet were being pushed into a different kind of mouth, or maybe a throat would have been a better comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, even though yer feet are bigger, if I had to choose just one, I think I\u2019d prefer getting off on yer cock, little dude,\u201d Luna explained to him and Sam as she pulled the boy up to his ankles. \u201cYer prey, so all of you belongs to us preds, but yer cock was especially made fer pleasin\u2019 pussy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes he is,\u201d Sam gasped, having caught her second wind. She\u2019d retrieved a long purple dildo from her nightstand and was inserting it into her pussy. \u201cNnnf! Is he wiggling? Tell me he\u2019s wiggling,\u201d Sam demanded with a hint of desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Lincoln wiggled his toes against Luna\u2019s vaginal walls, sending shivers throughout her body. He smirked at the control he exerted over his consumer. Even if it was only temporary, he always relished turning the tables on his hungry family. Luna\u2019s devious smirk told him that his victory had already expired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, bro. Let\u2019s see if you can keep it up.\u201d Flexing her vaginal muscles, Luna pulled Lincoln further into her pussy. \u201cCheck it out, luv. No hands!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bit her bottom lip more intensely as more of her dildo disappeared up her vag. It looked like she was trying to match her pace with Luna to simulate the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the slick walls massage around his legs and clamp his knees together, Lincoln noticed that his erection had returned. \u201cHey, mind if I help things along?\u201d he asked, though was already trying to wiggle his way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna caught him, holding him down with one hand and used the other to tease his balls. \u201cSee that, luv? My pussy\u2019s so great, my bro jus\u2019 can\u2019t keep out. He wants in me sooo baaad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, f-fuck!\u201d cried Sam while twisting the dildo inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to keep you waitin\u2019, little dude,\u201d Luna said as she let him go. \u201cYou know I aim to please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow free, Lincoln resumed wiggling his way forward. More and more of Luna\u2019s body took up his vision as he sank further in. When he was past his knees, it was like his whole world was made up of her midsection. He could see nothing past his thighs as more and more of him disappeared into the hungry vulva. Remembering their audience, Lincoln decided to be considerate. \u201cGoing is a little awkward, but smooth. Luna\u2019s got a great pussy for taking bodies inside.\u201d Sam\u2019s groan was borderline painful as Lincoln wiggled in another few inches. His balls were resting against her clit when Luna stopped him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it from here, dude.\u201d Luna pulled Lincoln in a few more inches, consuming his butt, hips and groin. Then she pressed herself down on the mattress, making both of them groan. \u201cI\u2019m squeezing the little prick against my vag, luv. Nnnf!\u201d Luna started rotating her hips again, grinding Lincoln\u2019s sensitive cock against her even more sensitive pussy. \u201cI know how to please a guy, but I\u2019ve been practicing with girls, too. I\u2019ve learned this trick that makes it even better than grindin\u2019 beans, luv. Soon as I get ahold of you, you ain\u2019t gonna walk straight fer <i>hours</i>!\u201d Luna grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s legs were increasingly difficult to control. He tried pushing himself deeper in a desperate bid for sweet relief, but he\u2019d been reduced to a snail\u2019s pace. Luna\u2019s hand was fighting the greedy pull of her vaginal muscles. It really was like a throat, massaging him all over as it tried to swallow him, but Luna was cruelly drawing things out. Her body swayed and her eyes lidded as she lost herself in the throes of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna only opened her eyes long enough to check on her current and distant lovers. Lincoln\u2019s face was scrunched in bliss and it was adorable how he was humping so desperately into her. Sam had forgotten any sense of decorum and was screaming her lungs out. \u201cHey now. Easy there, luv. Don\u2019t wanna wake the neighbors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I need you!\u201d Sam cried wantonly. \u201cYou want me to stop so badly, come over right now and hold me. I-I need to feel you around me, to smell you, t-to make me feel like I\u2019m yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you <i>are</i>, luv,\u201d implored Luna with a coo. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. <i>All</i> mine. You were mine the first moment I saw you, smelled your hair, and licked your cheek.\u201d She giggled nostalgically as Sam started to calm down. Losing her focus caused Lincoln to slip past his navel into her vag, but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cI still remember that day. Most folks try pullin\u2019 away the first time I lick \u2018em, but you didn\u2019t. You leaned in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sniffled happy tears. \u201cI knew you were a pred. I wanted to talk to you so badly, but I couldn\u2019t work up the nerve. Then you came up to me an-and I about peed myself. Then I felt that wonderful tongue of yours\u2026\u201d She trailed off with a purr, only to giggle when her eyes opened again. \u201cHehe. Double lips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Luna found that Lincoln had been swallowed fully with only his face still visible. \u201cNever looked hotter, aye, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln said nothing. His eyelids had grown heavy from back-to-back discharges and his sister\u2019s comforting pussy. He let himself sink all the way inside as the world went dark and muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Luna let him out before her date, does she make him tag along, skip to Luna on the date without Lincoln, or will someone else be joining them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Lincoln came to, he was back in his bed, wet from water instead of pussy juice, and still very naked. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d He checked his clock. \u201cHmm. About an hour since I first left for the bathroom. That could have easily been worse. Not that it was bad, but I could still be shoved up my sister\u2019s pussy instead of free to do as I want. Ya learn to take the small victories in life.\u201d Then his gurgling stomach told him that it was time for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast!\u201d Lynn Sr. called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways pays to be prepared,\u201d Lincoln boasted to the viewer as he grabbed one of several spare towels from under his bed and began drying himself. \u201cSometimes my sisters forget to clean me properly after they\u2019re done. Luna at least got her girl cum off, so this isn\u2019t too bad.\u201d Once dry, Lincoln donned one of his many spare sets of clothes and ran out just in time to be overtaken by the stampede of sisters. The boy with white hair was carried down the stairs as if by a mosh pit with zero sense of personal space. When the world stopped spinning, he found himself conveniently at the kid\u2019s table with a plate full of pancakes. \u201c\u2026 Well that worked out nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln ate his fill as everyone else did. Cries of orgasmic bliss came from the grown up table, but Lincoln couldn\u2019t be bothered to see who it was. He\u2019d had enough vore and sexiness in the last hour to last him a while. Right now, he just wanted to eat and get his day started properly\u2026 preferably with minimal food stains from his rowdy little sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where\u2019re ya headin\u2019, Lincoln,\u201d Lana asked. She\u2019d just packed together a wad of pancakes half the size of her head and scarfed it down, creating a noticeable bulge down her throat and into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClyde and I are going to the comic store. There\u2019s a sale today and we were looking to start a new series.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I join?\u201d Lucy asked. \u201cVampires of Meloncholia is getting a comic spinoff and I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s any good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grinned from ear-to-ear. \u201cFinally, a fellow comic reader in the family. Say, if the book is any good, maybe that can be what Clyde and I start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d Lucy replied drearily, though her family could detect the subtle hint of enthusiasm. \u201cI know they say books are better than movies, but if you like the book, maybe you\u2019d want to check out the show, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled, understanding what Lucy was really hoping for. \u201cThat\u2019d be fine, but only if the book\u2019s any good. Also, you have to give my future comic recommendations a try. Agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola scoffed. \u201cComics. Such unsophisticated garbage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnsophisticated?\u201d Lincoln parroted incensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve done it.\u201d Lisa\u2019s voice was her usual emotionless deadpan, but like Lucy, her family could detect the subtle inflections that showed her annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln delved into a long and well-practiced tirade about graphic novels. The history, the evolved artistry of the panels, and the commonly accepted examples of stories that were better in comics than any other medium. Meanwhile, Lola smirked to herself as she drowned her pancakes in syrup, satisfied in her success at riling him up. Causing drama wasn\u2019t quite as fun as gossiping about it, but it was pretty close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, and paying Lori\u2019s fee for the ride, Clyde was picked up in Vanzilla and they set off to the comic store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Clyde. Lucy said Vampires of Meloncholia, her show, is getting a comic spinoff. I was thinking we could check it out for our new series.\u201d Lincoln explained this while sitting in the middle seat to discourage Lucy from trying anything funny with Clyde. Of all his sisters, she was among the least likely to pull something like that, but it never hurt to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the nervous boy said, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cHorror isn\u2019t really my thing.\u201d Then he caught Lori\u2019s visage in the rearview mirror and struck a bold pose. \u201cB-but I\u2019m willing to give it a try, because real men face their fears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVoM is more spooky than scary,\u201d Lori added from the driver\u2019s seat. After she and Leni agreed to start watching the show with Lucy, the blonde Louds had found a lot more to like than just the cute new actor. \u201cIt\u2019s a character drama with a gothic setting. Lots of creepy atmosphere, but they don\u2019t bother with cheap jump scares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde sighed his relief. \u201cPhew. I mean\u2026 phewww bad about that. I was really looking to test myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe real fear comes from the tension,\u201d Lori continued. \u201cLike that episode two nights ago. Edwin spent the entire time stalking that one girl, giving glimpses of himself now and then just to put the fear in her as she tried going about her day. By the end, she was a nervous wreck, and was practically begging to be taken just to be put out of her misery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rehash of an episode from season 1, but still very effective,\u201d appraised Lucy. \u201cThough now I\u2019m actually afraid Leni might give me tinnitus from her screaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what that was?\u201d Lincoln asked. \u201cI thought a jet had flown too close to the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right,\u201d Lori agreed. \u201cI tried to calm her down with the usual stuff. Petting her, groping her, and fingering her, but she just kept going. With lungs like that, she ought to try for swim team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Leni needs is a full tummy. She\u2019s always calm when someone\u2019s inside her.\u201d Lucy slowly and deliberately turned to face Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, I\u2019d love to \u2018volunteer\u2019,\u201d he said with air quotes, \u201cbut I\u2019m starting the comic to see if I like the show. I\u2019ll need to watch a few episodes to be sure, which I can\u2019t exactly do from inside someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Dang it,\u201d Lucy grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Clyde?\u201d Lori inquired with a scheming smirk. \u201cIt\u2019d really help the viewing experience if Leni didn\u2019t blow our eardrums out. Think you\u2019d be willing to do me a favor?\u201d She batted her eyelashes flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde, having never fully gotten over his crush, turned to jelly in the seat. \u201cAnything for you, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll like being eaten by Leni, anyways,\u201d Lincoln encouraged. \u201cIt\u2019s relaxing how she rubs you while you\u2019re in her belly. For a first time experience, I\u2019d definitely recommend her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Lucy. You\u2019re belly\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a little cramped for someone my size. However, if we finally get Clyde to see how great vore is, then we can work our way to you eventually,\u201d Lincoln rationalized. As pushy as his sisters could be about it, he truly believed that being eaten was one of the best things someone could experience and he\u2019d always hoped his best friend would see the light on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy hummed thoughtfully. \u201cAcceptable. Mind if I borrow your hand for just a second? I\u2019d like to taste your fingers.\u201d She reached out, but Clyde pulled away. For all his talk about wanting to give himself to Lori, the boy was still very much a virgin in every sense of the word. Just the thought of someone running their tongue over his body made him have to cross his legs. Luckily, Lincoln made sure to cover for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Eventually,</i> Lucy,\u201d Lincoln emphasized. \u201cI said eventually. Give the guy time. We don\u2019t want to ruin the experience, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not. Sigh.\u201d The goth slumped in her seat and took Lincoln\u2019s fingers as a consolation prize, which he happily allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man. Clincoln McLoud can withstand anything, even hungry sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s laugh was nervous. \u201cThanks man. I can always count on you to have my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was grateful for Clyde as his first real friend outside the family. So many people tried brownnosing up to him in the hopes of getting off the menu for his sisters and mom; as if they just went around eating people at random. Honestly, the whole notion really offended Lincoln. Sure, the women of his life were pretty handsy and liberal with their tongues. However, they almost never brought someone inside them without some kind of provocation, either an invitation or if someone just pissed them off. His family was made up of predators, not monsters. His and Clyde\u2019s friendship was born out of shared interests and just plain getting along, which meant he was safe to only be vored if he was willing. As for the other sycophants around town, Lincoln couldn\u2019t care less.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Lori parked, the younger kids disembarked from Vanzilla while she stayed behind to text. Inside, Lincoln and Clyde were having a ball welcoming a newcomer into their world. Lucy naturally gravitated towards the more monstrous and creepy covers, which the comic duo were more than happy to explain to her. This was a hero that turned into a monster, that was a monster trying to make it as a hero, and this was a regular person who turned into a monster that could be good or evil depending on the circumstances, but was still widely feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this earlier?\u201d demanded Lucy. \u201cAll of these monsters with tormented souls. They\u2019re just seeking people who understand them.\u201d She stroked her hand longingly over a cover depicting some kind of mud monster about to sink its teeth into a screaming woman while an angry mob was shooting it. \u201cI know your pain, dark and murky kindred spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault,\u201d asserted Lincoln. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get you guys on comics for years. And it\u2019s not just the western stuff, either. There\u2019s manga about super models for Lola, detective stories for Lisa, more sports\u2019 books than I can even count for Lynn, that one\u2019s about an up and coming rock band, and everything else. Oh, and all the vore themed porn books.\u201d Lincoln finished by pointing to an entire isle that radiated with an almost heavenly glow and angelic choir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce I was blind, but now I see. We must share this treasure with the rest of the family,\u201d Lucy avowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA nice idea, but how are we gonna afford it?\u201d Clyde asked. \u201cI don\u2019t get that much allowance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys. This one is on me.\u201d Lucy pulled out her personal credit card. The card was custom decorated with art from VoM, along with \u2018Predator\u2019 in big bold letters to dissuade any would-be thieves. It had access to her private bank account where all the money she\u2019d earned from voring volunteers had accumulated, minus the percentage that had been taken out and set aside for college. Maintaining a house full of preds was expensive, but luckily said preds did pretty decently in paying for their own upkeep with plenty to spare. \u201cPick whatever looks good. We\u2019re going to show our family the darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde raised his hand. \u201cUh, I think you meant light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what I said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the boys got a basket and loaded it up with what they felt were the best samples of what each of the sisters would appreciate, along with three copies of the VoM book. When it came time to pay, the teen guy behind the counter swallowed audibly upon seeing the card and became visibly shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, if you b-b-buy ten or more books, you g-get our 10% bulk discount. W-will there be anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cDude, just relax. She\u2019s not gonna bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I borrow your fingers?\u201d Lucy licked her lips in anticipation. \u201cI like the taste of fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh that put Lucy\u2019s to shame, Lincoln reached up, grabbed the guy\u2019s arm, and pulled it down for Lucy to reach. As she took two fingers into her mouth and started licking, the boy explained, \u201cSee. She\u2019s not gonna eat you. She just wants a taste. It\u2019s like shaking hands for predators.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-are you sure?\u201d asked the nervous teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs her brother, yes. I\u2019m very sure.\u201d Lincoln was rather adept at this conversation, having to explain his sisters\u2019 behavior to the ignorant masses far more often than should be necessary. \u201cIf she wanted to actually eat you, she\u2019d go for somewhere more intimate, like the neck or face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy finally released the guy\u2019s fingers and smacked her lips appraisingly. \u201cTeen angst. Not bad, but I\u2019ve had better. Now what was that about a discount?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019ll even throw in the employee discount!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be nice. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purchase was rung up and upon leaving, the guys were made to carry the haul while Lucy started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you,\u201d Lincoln accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. There was nothing about what just happened that was out of the ordinary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really wish I could disagree, but this isn\u2019t my first shopping trip with the Louds,\u201d Clyde said in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were totally scaring that guy on purpose,\u201d Lincoln argued. \u201cThat was totally uncool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he wants to be afraid of me just because I\u2019m a predator, that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he shouldn\u2019t be. You\u2019re not the monster he thinks you are and you shouldn\u2019t be perpetuating the stereotype.\u201d Lincoln pinched the bridge of his nose as they came up to Vanzilla. \u201cLori, please tell Lucy that she can\u2019t go around scaring people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori turned an incredulous eye on her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucy. Scaring people is pretty much her thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreeping up on people is one thing. I agree that there\u2019s no stopping her there. But she\u2019s making people afraid of her for being a predator. Doesn\u2019t that bug you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori just kept scrolling through her phone. \u201cNot especially. Stupid people are gonna be stupid no matter what. It\u2019s no skin off my bones if strangers can\u2019t be bothered to educate themselves. And if any of them try doing anything <i>extra</i> stupid, it will literally be the last thing they ever do. Why do you even care? This is a pred issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. \u201cI care because it\u2019s a <i>Loud</i> issue. You\u2019re my sisters and I don\u2019t like you guys being stereotyped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no biggie,\u201d Lori dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, Lori likes freaking people out just as much as I do. You don\u2019t complain then,\u201d observed Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips, trying to think of a delicate way to get his message across. \u201cThat\u2019s cuz Lori does things more\u2026 approachably. I realize that smiling and hugging people you don\u2019t know isn\u2019t exactly your thing, but there must be some Lucy way of interacting with people that doesn\u2019t perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, next time someone crosses you, you just eat them and say they were a volunteer,\u201d Lori added nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLori!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. I was only joking\u2026 mostly.\u201d Lori finally turned a more focused look on her passengers. \u201cThat seems like a lot more comics than usual. How\u2019d you guys-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComics aren\u2019t as boring as we thought,\u201d Lucy said. Still with her nose buried in her book, she pulled out a volume and handed it to the elder blonde. \u201cI bought samples for everyone. This is a romance about the eldest princess trying to juggle three suitors. Also she\u2019s a pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori slipped her phone in her pocket and began flipping through the pages. \u201cHmm. Well she\u2019s certainly pretty enough to warrant this kind of-\u201d She snorted a laugh at the unexpected pratfall. \u201cOkay, that wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d She flipped the page and her eyes began to sparkle as she fanned herself. \u201cOh, well isn\u2019t he a tall glass of water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lincoln wasn\u2019t ready to let go of his gripe with Lucy, he could take solace that at least Lori was enjoying her present. Once they made it back, the rest of the books were handed out and everyone seemed to like their new stories. Lincoln however, didn\u2019t join them. The man with the plan had a scheme cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he try helping Lucy with this perceived issue, or is something else going on?</span></div></div>",

I really relate to Edwin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean about her social life, such as it is. She\u2019s got friends in her club, but she\u2019s still such a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIntrovert,\u201d Clyde suggested. \u201cSo am I. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being comfortable all by yourself. That\u2019s probably not so easy for you in this house, but the quiet is still pleasant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I get that, but it still seems like a predator should be a little, ya know, proactive in their hunting. All of my older sisters are so outgoing. They\u2019re flirty, they get up close and personal, but then they start laying on the affection. Lana and Lola have this pretty down pat, too. Even if people are nervous at first, they\u2019re put at ease and see what great people preds are. I like seeing when everyone\u2019s happy and getting along. But with Lucy\u2026\u201d He trailed off, his meaning not needing to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is kind of a sensitive issue with you, but are you really qualified to handle something like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ya mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you live in a house full of preds, most of them older and more experienced. If Lucy were, say, underdeveloped, don\u2019t you think one of them would have stepped in by now? Mrs. Loud strikes me as the sort who\u2019d nip a problem like that in the bud; or butt, knowing you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned as he contemplated Clyde\u2019s words. \u201cYou might be right, buddy. This isn\u2019t my area of expertise, but I really want to be a good big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. So what did you have in mind?\u201d Clyde asked while putting the book down. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have plans for today, so I\u2019m up for whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hummed thoughtfully and scratched his chin. \u201cHmm. If I\u2019m <i>not</i> the expert, then I should find someone who is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, in Luna and Luan\u2019s room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you guys think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, little bro,\u201d Luna responded while strumming her axe. \u201cAt Lucy\u2019s age, I was still pretty locked up in my shell, too. I ate who came to me, but didn\u2019t really have the urge to go out and hunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, then you got a job at the pound, cuz you love hunting for pussy so much,\u201d Luan joked, only to rethink her punchline as her hand stroked her engorged stomach, which had shrunk since this morning. \u201cHmm. I could do better, but I agree with you,\u201d she said to the boys. \u201cLucy really ought to be a more active predator. Be a bit flirtier and lick people gently enough so that they don\u2019t get grossed out. Well, <i>as</i> grossed out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I wanted to hear. So, can you help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Lincoln. I\u2019ve got a kid\u2019s birthday party in an hour and I need to borrow Lynn\u2019s treadmill to work off this beer belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf yer lookin\u2019 fer advice, I recommend Leni,\u201d suggested Luna. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who knows how to make prey relax, it\u2019s her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater still, in Lori and Leni\u2019s room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll help.\u201d Leni was her usual bubbly self, not to mention naked as the day she was born. Clyde was wide eyed, speechless, and bleeding from the nose. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to give Lucy a makeover, but she\u2019s a wily one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakeover? No, we\u2019re talking about making her a more proactive predator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I guess I misunderstood, but that also sounds pretty fun. But we\u2019ll need a good sales pitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a retail thing, but it works equally well with predators. When out hunting and you spy someone who looks really yummy, you can\u2019t just say you want to eat them and shove them in. That\u2019s rude, not to mention they might start fighting, and that\u2019s no fun for anyone. You\u2019ve gotta sweet talk them, figure out what they want, and help them realize what they really want is the same as what you want: for them to go in your belly.\u201d Leni patted her trim stomach. \u201cBasically, Lucy thinks she\u2019s fine, so we have to convince her that being a more active predator is for her own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. That makes sense. Also, Clyde?\u201d Lincoln snapped his fingers in his friend\u2019s face, but got no response. \u201cUh, Leni. You mind putting some clothes on? You\u2019re distracting Clyde.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you like reading in your undies cuz it feels comfortable, and I like being naked. Besides, we\u2019re inside, so it\u2019s allowed.\u201d Crossing her arms under her ample chest, she blew her brother a raspberry to show just how mature the second eldest sister was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes and, rather than attempt bickering with a brick wall, decided to take Leni\u2019s advice. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, something that would appeal to Lucy, aye?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more later, in Lynn and Lucy\u2019s room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, lots of people say that those who seek thrills for a hobby have a death wish, which is kinda true,\u201d Lincoln began, causing Lucy to look up from her poem book. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting falling through the air at high speeds, almost like death itself is on their heels. Same with things like the Running of the Bulls. It wouldn\u2019t be nearly as popular if there weren\u2019t that danger, that possibility of meeting a gruesome demise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d groaned Lucy, crossing her legs. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy point is that, for most people, they get that same kind of thrill being with or even just near predators. <i>You</i> could make them feel like death is breathing down their necks, except it isn\u2019t death\u2019s breath.\u201d He lowered his voice to a stage whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucy\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh!\u201d Lincoln jumped and spun around to face where Lucy now stood. \u201cYou? But you were\u2026\u201d He pointed frantically between the goth\u2019s bed and her current position, covering over 3 meters in the blink of an eye. \u201cBut I was staring at you the whole time. How-did-you-do-that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of your petty mortal concerns. Like comics, I must now teach the prey of the world the joys of being close to death, or at least her dark disciple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? Death is a woman. All the popular goth literature says so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough. Leni\u2019s agreed to show you the ropes. Now we just have to-hey. Where\u2019s Clyde?\u201d Lincoln looked around the room, but saw neither hide nor hair of his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shadows tell me he\u2019s hiding under Lynn\u2019s bed,\u201d stated Lucy, making Lincoln flinch. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s a mistake no one makes twice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln and Lucy armored up with clothes pins on their noses and thick gloves on their hands. Together they probed the uninhabitable wasteland that was the space beneath Lynn\u2019s bed. The girl kept all her lucky clothes under there, the ones she never cleaned for fear of washing out the luck. Just lifting the sheets up released a tidal wave of stank that made both Louds gag. They found Clyde and quickly extricated him out into the open. After pumping on his chest and performing CPR, the boy finally took his first real breath after what felt like hours of suffocating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I saw the light,\u201d Clyde said in awe as he reached up to the sky. \u201cDeath was escorting me to the pearly gates. She was so beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you,\u201d Lucy boasted dryly. \u201cAlso, my newfound dream to share the joys of a brush with death was just beaten out by Lynn\u2019s old gym clothes\u2026 I feel inadequate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegin the lesson, or skip to a new plot?</span></div></div>",

Clyde lay beside her, still recovering his breath as she patted his head. \u201cHmm. Let\u2019s start by seeing your technique so we know what we\u2019re working with. Lincoln, pretend you\u2019re just some guy. Act like you don\u2019t know Lucy, and that you\u2019re kinda put off by preds. And Lucy, I want you to make Lincoln accept you. You don\u2019t have to eat him, but he does have to be fine with you licking somewhere other than his fingers. Now,\u201d she clapped her hands, \u201cbegin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pulled out his phone to scroll through videos. It didn\u2019t matter what he found, so long as he put up a front of indifference. He\u2019d even put on a black wig to further the illusion. Especially from Leni, this all seemed like pretty good practice so far, at least in theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy swallowed anxiously and made her approach. \u201cHey there, you. Can I lick your fingers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked if I could lick your fingers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBleh! That\u2019s gross. Why would I let you do that?\u201d Lincoln questioned, keeping his eye on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a predator, and I\u2019m curious how you taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln took a large side step away from his sister, but otherwise said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s running, but he hasn\u2019t left,\u201d Leni whispered. \u201cGive chase. He wants you to chase him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy tried just that and closed the distance. \u201cSo, um, do you want to know what it\u2019s like to come close to death?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd with that, I\u2019m out. A regular guy like me gets put off easily with talk of death.\u201d Still watching his phone, Lincoln started to leave, but very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him,\u201d Leni urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait!\u201d Lucy grabbed Lincoln\u2019s wrist. \u201cI-I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, you again? Look, I\u2019m very busy and I don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d Lincoln said, giving only a token effort to pull himself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what do I do?\u201d Lucy questioned anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething drastic. You\u2019re losing him, so be bold! Make him want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBold. Right. Um\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2019s mind was racing, trying to think of something, anything to keep this boy here. What could she possibly do to make him want her? Hang on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cAre we done here? Cuz I\u2019ve got way better things to do than-mmh!?\u201d Lincoln\u2019s words were smothered by a pair of cool lips pressed against his, and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d Leni cheered. \u201cThere\u2019s some boldness to stop folks in their tracks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was the first to break off the kiss. \u201cActually\u2026\u201d He trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConstructive criticism is crucial for improvement, Lincoln. I can take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded. \u201cFor one thing, it didn\u2019t feel all that passionate. It\u2019s like how you\u2019d kiss me normally. Not really show stopper material. You didn\u2019t even use any tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse\u2026 tongue,\u201d Lucy wrote into her notes. \u201cThis is good. Anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust kissing isn\u2019t enough,\u201d answered Leni. \u201cVore is, like, a full body kiss, so you need to put your full body into it. What are your hands doing? What are <i>his</i> hands doing? Where are the hips? Vore is a contact sport, so make that contact! Try again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Lucy looked back at Lincoln to see he\u2019d switched back to his slightly annoyed persona. Taking a breath to steady herself, she lunged forward and pressed her body to his like she\u2019d seen her sisters do with people. She slid her front up and down his sides, nuzzled under his chin, and teased around the groin of his pants. Additionally, the hand holding Lincoln\u2019s wrist pulled it around and clamped it on her butt. Lincoln\u2019s cheeks became flushed, which she took as a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni nodded. \u201cMuch better. However, that probably won\u2019t work so well on prey Lincoln\u2019s age. They haven\u2019t hit puberty yet, so they\u2019d probably be more scared if you touch their swimsuit area. Instead, make it more like a hug. Like you\u2019ve been fighting with Lynn and have a makeup hug. And don\u2019t forget to speak. That\u2019s the real trick. Hold them so they can\u2019t get away, and then convince them to stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded and adjusted her position to be more like a hug and rubbed her cheek against Lincoln\u2019s. The contact was nice, which she decided to share. \u201cYou smell really good and I like how warm you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, th-thank you?\u201d Lincoln was confused about what his character would do at this time, but reasoned he should probably take his hand off her butt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like being close to you. Normally I prefer the dark and cold, but you make me crave something more,\u201d Lucy whispered into his ear. \u201cI\u2019m craving you\u2026 stranger. A-are you craving me?\u201d That sounded like something her older sisters would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had the same thought, which brought a grin to his face. \u201cI kinda am, actually.\u201d He returned the hug. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind getting a little closer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get you close. Closer than you\u2019ve ever been with anyone,\u201d Lucy said rather desperately. \u201cI can make you feel good, too. It\u2019ll be exciting, like going down a water slide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best water slide of your life,\u201d Lincoln whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best water slide of your life. It\u2019ll be warm, and wet, and I\u2019ll hold you tight inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni applauded. \u201cPerfect. That was just perfect! Good job, Lucy. I knew you had it in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaintaining the hug, Lucy turned to face Leni. \u201cThat felt super awkward. I was just doing what I thought you guys would do, but it didn\u2019t really feel like\u2026 me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni waved dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It\u2019s normal to start by copying others. That\u2019s how art works. You just have to keep practicing until you get your own style. Well, I think that means you pass the first level. Now we do the, uh\u2026 level that comes next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond,\u201d Lincoln and Lucy said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. Silly me. Hey, Clyde.\u201d Leni tapped his cheek. \u201cClyde, you up? We could use your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning groggily, Clyde slowly stirred to consciousness and beheld the tremendous sight of Leni\u2019s big, round, and boobilicious chest pillows. \u201cError. Error. System overload,\u201d Clyde said in a high pitched and stilted voice, twitching like a malfunctioning robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is why I asked you to put some clothes on,\u201d Lincoln reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine,\u201d Leni huffed. She left to go put something on, but came back in a set of lacey see-through lingerie. \u201cBetter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy pursed her lips. \u201cSexier, but I agree with Lincoln. If we\u2019re going to use Clyde for anything, he should be able to function like a regular human, or at least as regular as any of Lincoln\u2019s friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roll of her eyes, Leni left and returned in a bathrobe. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln and Lucy both gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, good.\u201d Again Leni tapped Clyde\u2019s cheek until he woke up. This time her bodacious boobs were at least covered, so he didn\u2019t malfunction again. \u201cWelcome back. So, Lucy just practiced hunting with Lincoln and did pretty well. But he\u2019s her brother, so that makes him pretty easy to win over. So now we\u2019re moving on to level\u2026 uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo!\u201d Lincoln and Lucy said as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat one. Anyway, are you up for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp for what, exactly?\u201d Clyde\u2019s voice was skeptical as his eyes kept drifting down into Leni\u2019s robe. It was like he could hear her melons calling to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni smiled knowingly. \u201cDo you like my boobies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeees,\u201d Clyde droned, only to recollect himself. \u201cI-I mean, uh, what boobies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni appeared worried. \u201cThese boobies. The ones on my chest. See!\u201d She cupped her hands under both breasts and pushed them up, almost popping them right out of her robes. \u201cYou see them, right? Tell me you see them. They didn\u2019t shrink, did they?\u201d she asked in increasing panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can see your boobs, Leni. You\u2019re just overwhelming him,\u201d assured Lincoln with a hint of annoyance. The second eldest sister was pretty smart when it came to being a predator, but was still dense about almost everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni gave a relieved sigh. \u201cThank goodness. Anyway, I want you to let Lucy hunt you. She\u2019s not going to eat you. She just has to make you comfortable with her being around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, uh, what exactly do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do whatever feels natural. If she\u2019s coming on too strong, tell her. If you want to back away, then do that. You\u2019re the, uh, more difficult level. Think of it like playing hard to get. If you do a good job\u2026\u201d Leni pulled down at the collar of her robe. It wasn\u2019t enough to show any pink, but the implication was clear as her eyebrows wiggled suggestively. \u201cLori told me you wanted to help us watch VoM.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde swallowed audibly and turned a shade of crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni leaned forward and rubbed her cheek to his, (un)intentionally shaking her bootylicious posterior at her siblings. \u201cThat was really sweet of you to help like that. You\u2019re a really great friend, and I\u2019d be honored to be your first predator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s nose started bleeding again, but only a trickle compared to the earlier fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how does the practice hunt go?</span></div></div>",

To his left on the bed were Lincoln and Leni, acting as coaches and moral support. Directly ahead was Lucy, the creepiest of the Loud siblings, but he\u2019d long ago learned just how nice she could be. That was slightly reassuring, but this was still leagues out of his comfort zone. He stole another glance at Leni, her winning smile, pretty face, and the bathrobe barely containing her huge knockers.  She wanted to eat him. The Loud ladies always had and loved teasing him, just like they did Lincoln. The difference being that this time it was really happening. He\u2019d given permission as his \u2018reward\u2019 for helping with Lucy. He could only hope that what everyone said about vore being great was accurate. And although it was no secret that he\u2019d have preferred Lori, Leni was also very pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde slapped himself across the face to clear his thoughts. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready.\u201d He turned around and started whistling inconspicuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Leni\u2019s nod, Lucy made her approach. She came up around Clyde\u2019s side and said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um, hello\u2026 person I don\u2019t know,\u201d he greeted awkwardly. \u201cWhat can I, a person you don\u2019t know, do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of hamming it up, buddy,\u201d advised Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. You know I\u2019m not an actor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I like you,\u201d Lucy blurted, trying to keep things on track. At Clyde\u2019s bewildered reaction, she grabbed his arm and pressed herself to his side and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2026 I-I think you l-look c-c-cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde stiffened as his cheeks turned a shade of pink. \u201cY-you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned to face the older boy and inhaled deeply through her nose. \u201cYou smell nice and you look yummy,\u201d she said more naturally. \u201cDo you, um, want to try something exciting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m not so sure. My dads say that too much excitement is bad for the heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe heart isn\u2019t nearly so weak.\u201d Lucy set her hand on Clyde\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s beating strong, pumping gallons of precious blood throughout the body. You need to stimulate it to stay healthy. Exercise is one way, but lots of people enjoy thrilling things, like roller coasters and water slides.\u201d She leaned in closer and took another sniff of his neck. \u201cYou really do smell yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni beamed widely and gave two thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know ways to make your heart pump. I can manipulate your precious life essence in ways that feel amazing.\u201d Lucy began drawing a circle around Clyde\u2019s nipple. \u201cEveryone says how good it feels, and I can attest to that as giver and receiver. So, stranger, do you want me to make you feel good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s knees gave out and he fell onto Lucy, who easily held him up. The watchers on the bed both gave a standing ovation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. That was just perfect,\u201d cheered Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did great, Lucy. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy\u2019s mouth gave a twitch in the barest hint of a smile. \u201cThanks guys. The words feel a little awkward, but that was actually kinda fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt only gets better from here,\u201d Leni gushed as she ran over and pulled her sister\u2019s face between her breasts in a cheerful hug. \u201cYou did great for your first real try, and don\u2019t worry about the awkwardness. You just need to keep practicing with more people, try different things out, and eventually you\u2019ll have a technique that\u2019s perfectly Lucy.\u201d Her only answer was muffled cries and banging against her boobs as the goth struggled to free herself. \u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was able to breathe again, Lucy replied. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m so very happy,\u201d she said like she was fighting to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get why you wanted lessons in the first place. You took to that like a natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it was some things Lincoln and Luan said. They said I wasn\u2019t developing my predator abilities fast enough, and it got me feeling a little insecure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA literal arrow to the heart would not have hurt Lincoln as much as his sister\u2019s words. \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, Lucy. I-I didn\u2019t mean-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth held up a halting hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be. You guys were right. I was being lazy and falling behind in my practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you were so good with Clyde just now,\u201d countered Lincoln. \u201cLooked to me like you\u2019re a natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a predator, so some things come naturally, but natural talen\u2019s a lot like a dead body. It\u2019s no fun unless you dig it up and put it to use.\u201d A palpable silence followed as everyone eyed Lucy warily. \u201cI never said anything, and you can\u2019t prove otherwise. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to call my friends at the mortician\u2019s club and see who wants to glimpse down the throat of death.\u201d And she made her casual departure while everyone watched. She came back a couple seconds later. \u201cI just remembered this is my room. Could you guys give me some privacy? I need to commune with the spirits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo everyone else left. However, Leni had taken Clyde\u2019s hand and was refusing to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Leni?\u201d asked Clyde, trying to pull himself free. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo Lincoln\u2019s room, silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that, but, urrgh, why are <i>you</i> coming? Urrgh! Man, you\u2019re strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s easy. VoM is on tomorrow. So, since you\u2019ve already agreed to be in my belly for the viewing, I figured I should take your vore virginity now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Lincoln and Clyde exclaimed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, uh, does it have to be now?\u201d Clyde asked fretfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd does it have to be in <i>my</i> room? What about yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the help, buddy,\u201d Clyde deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use my room. Lori might come in and I don\u2019t want Clyde to feel too awkward,\u201d explained Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s actually kind of sweet,\u201d Clyde admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it has to be now, cuz a first eating should be something special. A good predator \u2013 which I am \u2013 should take her time in making her prey feel welcome and appreciated,\u201d Leni continued as all three entered Lincoln\u2019s room. \u201cWhen VoM comes on, I\u2019ll need to scarf you down quick so I can enjoy the show, and that won\u2019t allow me to savor you like we both deserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde blinked as he processed all of this. \u201cI never realized vore was so personal and\u2026 intimate. Are first times really that special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotes.\u201d Then Leni\u2019s smile faded. \u201cAlthough, I only really know about being a first time eater for people. I\u2019ve heard others talk about it, but I never really had a first time being eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. Lincoln said you guys eat him and each other all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Lincoln replied. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in and out of each other and mom since we were born. None of us can remember our first times, which is why you\u2019ve got a big opportunity here, buddy. You\u2019ll actually be able to remember your first time going down a throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntsy with anticipation, Leni leaned down and swirled her tongue along Clyde\u2019s cheek. \u201cO.M. Gosh! The others are gonna be totes jealous that I\u2019m the first to eat you. Eee! This is gonna be great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have\u2026 very mixed feelings about this,\u201d Clyde admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, buddy. Being eaten is great. It\u2019s exciting, like Lucy said, but also super relaxing. It\u2019s like a sauna mixed with a full body massage. And when you\u2019re inside someone, with their heartbeat echoing all around you, it can actually be hard not to fall asleep. And when you wake up again, you\u2019ll be super refreshed. Trust me. There\u2019s a reason so many people pay for this service, and you\u2019re getting it for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I\u2019m still not sure. Mind if I call Dr. Lopez real quick? No offense, but she\u2019s a professional.\u201d Clyde whipped out his phone and hit the speed dial. The phone rang a few times, probably (not) because Lopez was reluctant about answering another of Clyde\u2019s calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Leni figured she had a better way of convincing the boy. With the grace of a ballerina, she dropped her robe down to her elbows and let her breasts bounce freely right in Clyde\u2019s face. Her smile was sincere as she leaned forward and she giggled as his eyes followed her swaying tits. \u201cCould you get on the bed for me, please? I\u2019m really looking forward to playing with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter completing a full mental reboot, Clyde ended the call and hopped up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd would you mind stripping for me? Neither of us wants your clothes all yucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde nodded and obediently began to strip, never tearing his eyes off the blonde. Lincoln, largely resistant to nudity thanks to his home life, just smiled proudly as his best friend got naked on his bed. Truly, it was best for everyone that this was happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clyde sat anxiously on Lincoln\u2019s bed, legs crossed, and hands covering his privates. His blush was heavy and his eyes never strayed from Leni\u2019s ginormous boobies. They weren\u2019t the biggest he\u2019d ever seen, even naked, but they did have an odd sense of gravity that seemed to be drawing him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni, familiar with the look Clyde gave her, kept her sweet smile, but decided against discarding the robe completely. She didn\u2019t want him passing out again. However, there was one issue that needed correcting. \u201cI\u2019ll take these.\u201d She relieved Clyde of his glasses and set them on Lincoln\u2019s dresser. \u201cIt makes me happy that you like looking at me, but I don\u2019t want your glasses breaking inside me. That\u2019d be <i>super</i> not fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde was squinting, but nodded his understanding. \u201cI guess that\u2019s fair. You might just be a blur, but you\u2019re still a very pretty blur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. You\u2019re such a sweetie. Just for that, I\u2019ll give you an extra special treat.\u201d Leni dropped down to her knees, but even then had to bend her back to be on Clyde\u2019s level. Hands on her boobs, she leaned forward and smooshed her chest against the boy\u2019s pelvis. He gasped at the unexpected pressure that pushed his hands away and legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wh-what are you d-doinggg?\u201d Clyde stammered. His body was experiencing spontaneous spasms as alien sensations shot through his nervous system. He\u2019d been hugged by well-endowed women before, including the Louds, but something about Leni\u2019s soft and supple chest pillows were doing things to him that he\u2019d never imagined. Compounding this issue was Leni\u2019s natural aroma mixed with a bit of sweat, making him all tingly down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m, like, giving you a boob job, silly. It\u2019s a little tricky with you being so small,\u201d Leni thoughtlessly said, ignoring Clyde\u2019s crushed expression as she fiddled with her bosoms in his lap. \u201cI just, urgh, have to, nnf\u2026 There!\u201d She\u2019d found it poking between her boobs. Clyde\u2019s penis was small, smaller than Lincoln\u2019s, but Leni didn\u2019t especially care. She wasn\u2019t using it for herself. This part was all about making him feel good, of prepping her prey for eating. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh!\u201d Clyde had thrown himself bodily onto the vast expanse of boob flesh and felt himself partially sink into their softness. The masses weren\u2019t <i>total</i> marshmallows and had enough perkiness that they pushed back. It was like resting on the most comfortable of heated mattresses. Not to mention what was happening downstairs. \u201cM-my peepee feels funny,\u201d he blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. It\u2019s, like, so cute that you call it that,\u201d Leni tittered as she pushed on her breasts from the sides, making him whimper. \u201cI\u2019m squeezing your peepee between my boobs. Do you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde could only nod as he bit his lip to keep from screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni repeated the action from different angles, experimenting to see what got the best reactions. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re confused. Most boys your age don\u2019t really know how to feel about this, but trust me. After you\u2019ve had time to think about it, you\u2019ll find you really like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t lying,\u201d Lincoln said, reminding everyone that he was still there. He\u2019d been standing at the door and casually watching his naked sister molest his naked friend like it was ordinary. While he\u2019d intended to just be there for moral support, Lincoln couldn\u2019t deny that the slapping of Leni\u2019s boobs mixed with Clyde\u2019s stifled groans was turning him on just a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Clyde\u2019s whole body seized up before he fell back on the bed. His breathing was heavy as he nervously said, \u201cI-I think I just peed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni laughed as she leaned back. She pulled her boobs apart to show the clear white liquid oozing down the inside of her tits. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just cum. I made you orgasm. And don\u2019t worry about being a quick shot. That\u2019s also, like, normal for a boy your age.\u201d Craning her neck, Leni pushed her breasts up and extended her long tongue directly onto her bare boob. She hummed her approval as she lapped up the young boy\u2019s seed like a dog drinking water, smacked her lips with a pleasant smile, swallowed, and then opened her mouth wide. \u201cAll gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s eyes were the size of dinner plates as he stared down her maw. If his body would only listen to him, he\u2019d probably start crawling towards her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want head or feet first? Personally, I\u2019ve found head is less stressful for first timers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-head,\u201d replied Clyde, barely even thinking anymore. There were just far too many sensations competing for attention that his mental processing had slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni nodded and leaned forward, pulling Clyde up to a sitting position and keeping her hands on his shoulders. With a lick of her lips and an eager expression, she once more opened her mouth wide and wider still. Clyde\u2019s face was pelted by her minty fresh breath as he stared into the blurry dripping cavern. All the lights went out once the lips closed around his face, followed by the wet slap of her tongue. Normally such grossness would repulse the nervous boy, but Leni\u2019s tantalizing moans had a strangely relaxing quality. He wanted to hear more, so he leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just her eyes, Leni shot Lincoln a look that said \u2018thank you\u2019, which he answered with a thumbs up. Leni\u2019s hands descended down Clyde\u2019s thin frame as she pulled his entire head into her mouth. She felt him laugh when she touched his tickle spots and grinned around her mouthful. Slipping her hands beneath his bony butt, she lifted him from the bed and against her chest. He was smaller than Lincoln, so she could easily wedge him between her boobs. Confident that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere, she decided to give him a full body boob job and squished the globes of fat around his body. His laughter turned to cries of bliss, but nothing intelligible. Leni took her first swallow, slipping her lips over Clyde\u2019s shoulders and his head into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Clyde was overwhelmed was an understatement. Every sound made by Leni\u2019s body echoed with such intensity, especially her moans. She liked him, or at least how he tasted. The air was hot and muggy, but knowing that such a pretty girl liked him filled his core with refreshing warmth. There was only blurred darkness ahead, but he wasn\u2019t afraid. He trusted the Louds as friends. Having his arms pinned to his sides was a little disconcerting, but Lincoln had told him enough stories that he knew to just wait until it passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni had wrapped her lips around Clyde\u2019s waist following her latest swallow. Between her experience and his small size, she could have finished him off already if she was so inclined, but she wasn\u2019t. Eating and being eaten were just too fun, and the fact that this was Clyde\u2019s first time meant that she had to do everything to make it a wonderful experience. That was her rationalization for cutting the belly licking short and stealing an early taste of his peepee. Just thinking the word made her giggle. Having his privates stimulated brought Clyde\u2019s legs to life as they started jerking around, though his feet were still restrained in her boobs. Leni took another light swallow and pulled his pelvis into her maw. This freed his feet from her cleavage to flail weakly, but also allowed her to give greater attention to his peepee and balls. Her tongue weaved and constricted around both with the dexterity of a finger. There were still a few drops of cum to be squeezed out, but he was still very limp. At least his groin was tasty, as was his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his swimsuit area so brazenly caressed made Clyde wiggle like a worm. It still felt weird, but in a way he\u2019d decided was kind of good. The fleshy tunnel stroked his body like a massage, just like Lincoln said. And the rhythm of Leni\u2019s heart was hypnotically relaxing. Another swallow sent a ripple through the flesh that pulled him down quicker. With only his legs left in the open air, he felt Leni tilt her head back to quickly slurp them up. Although she did linger to tickle his feet. Clyde was squeezed through a tight orifice into a more spacious cavern. At least he could move his limbs a little. When he felt a pressure against his back, he recognized it as a hand and leaned against the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you doing, buddy?\u201d asked Lincoln as he patted Leni\u2019s pregnant looking belly. He pressed his ear to the skin when he got no answer, only to hear a loud snoring. Both Louds giggled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Lincoln. I really liked eating your friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no problem, although I\u2019m pretty sure Clyde liked it more.\u201d Again, they shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve been a really good brother lately, both with Lucy and me. I think you\u2019ve earned something,\u201d Leni licked her lips and folded her arms to push up her boobs, \u201cspecial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 eep!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever wearing that sweet and sincere smile of hers, Leni did Lincoln the service of relieving him of his clothes, which she dumped haphazardly on top of Clyde\u2019s. She picked him up and hugged him into her tremendous titties. Apparently they were her new favorite toy that she couldn\u2019t stop playing with. Lincoln was in no position to complain, however. In fact, from his position he was practically sitting atop Leni\u2019s belly bulge, aka: Clyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a funny face. Is something wrong?\u201d asked Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt kinda just hit me that I\u2019m about to have sex with my sister while my best friend is inside her. It\u2026 kinda feels awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? You have sex with full bellied preds all the time.\u201d That they were family went without saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but usually those bellies are full of sisters or strangers. This is the first time it\u2019s been a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni frowned sympathetically. \u201cI still don\u2019t really get it, but if it makes you feel better, we can do doggy style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled his gratitude. \u201cSee, that\u2019s why everyone says you\u2019re the nice sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni was practically glowing from the compliment. She set Lincoln down, got on her knees, and bent over onto the bed. Her chest pillows were durable enough to support her weight fine, but she adjusted herself to leave her belly dangling in the open. \u201cClyde\u2019s still snoring, so I\u2019m gonna try not to squish him,\u201d she informed while pulling her robe up to give full access to her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but won\u2019t he wake up anyway, ya know, once things start rocking?\u201d Lincoln tried to play it cool, but Leni\u2019s ass kept drawing him in like the gravity of a black hole. It was just so round and perfect, built up from a lifetime of eating people who\u2019d contributed to her exquisite beauty. Even if it was only the third biggest in the house, it probably had more concentrated mass than he did in his whole body. His erection throbbed painfully just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni looked thoughtful before an idea struck. \u201cIs that lube?\u201d She pointed to a squeeze tube on the dresser, which Lincoln had learned to keep handy for occasions just like this one. \u201cJust use that and you can, like, climb on my butt. Less rocking that way.\u201d Leni\u2019s logic was surprisingly sound. Her rump was so big that she often needed to pull her cheeks wide apart and either squat down extra low or lay down on her belly just so Lincoln could reach. Climbing on top was the most feasible solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it!\u201d Lincoln grabbed the lube and applied a reasonable dollop to his cock. The viscous liquid was striking cool. Using one hand to pull her ass apart, he used the still coated hand to massage the goop on and around Leni\u2019s anus. The pink pucker twitched in anticipation as its owner shuddered and bit her lip. \u201cThat good, huh? How about this?\u201d Lincoln sunk two fingers into the pucker, followed by the rest of his hand. The orifice twitched around him as he began applying the slimy substance to Leni\u2019s inner walls. Unlike Lynn, for a predator of Leni\u2019s level, lube was more of a courtesy than a necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that should do it,\u201d Leni gasped. Her breathing was heavy and her cheeks flushed. All the Loud ladies had extra sensitive asses and erogenous zones in general. It was one of the few downsides to being a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln felt no shame in using this to his advantage whenever possible, rationalizing that this was nature\u2019s way of evening the playing field. As such, he sunk his fingers into Leni\u2019s bootyful backside, making her yelp as he squeezed, and pulled himself up the side. Going up along the middle ran the risk of getting stuck. It was a long and arduous journey, but Lincoln ascended to the top of Mt. Leni. However, before he\u2019d even realized it, his body was attempting to hotdog his sister\u2019s ass as if by muscle memory. The friction of her skin against his just felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni cleared her throat. \u201cHurry up, Linky! My bumbum is hungry for your peepee.\u201d She tittered and gave her jiggly rump a light shake, almost throwing Lincoln off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right. Okay. Here goes!\u201d Using his knees to pry her ass cheeks apart, Lincoln lined up his pecker with her twitching asshole. He touched the tip to the wrinkled flesh, causing both siblings to suck wind through their teeth, but Lincoln was undaunted. Her anus was slippery, but the rest of her butt flesh was spongy, enabling him to sink the head in. He laughed and said, \u201cW-wow. A-almost feels like lips trying to pull me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wants you, Linky,\u201d Leni whined, heightening her pitch to sound extra cutesy. \u201cMy butt neeeeds you. It\u2019s so empty. Please fill me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh! I can\u2019t stand when you talk like that,\u201d Lincoln groaned with lust. His grip slipped and he fell forward, hilting his cock fully in her rectum, but also causing her bountiful butt cheeks to clamp shut around his middle. He tried to pull free, but something was off. \u201cUgh! Leni, you\u2019re not squeezing me, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Don\u2019t be mad. You just feel soooo good in there. Mmh. I\u2019ve got my brother\u2019s penis in my bumbum and a boy in my belly. What more could a girl ask for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. Leni was becoming complacent. Nothing good could come from this. Lincoln had to act fast if he wanted to walk out of this room on his own two feet, but Leni was holding him too tight. Hang on\u2026 \u201cHow about a butt full of your brother\u2019s cum?\u201d Lincoln offered. \u201cI\u2019d love to pump your ass full, but you\u2019re clamping so hard I can hardly-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d Leni reached back and pulled her ass cheeks apart. \u201cJust hurry and fuck me. Pump my ass full and don\u2019t you dare stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye-aye.\u201d Smirking triumphantly, Lincoln finally set about doing the deed. His cock had been teased for so long that he didn\u2019t bother starting off slow. Leni\u2019s ass needed a rough pounding and he was honor bound to give it to her. He tried to not get distracted by the coziness of her alluring, jiggling butt cheeks and focus on the task at hand. Despite having pushed whole people through that ring, the orifice was still amazingly tight. Each time he pulled out, Leni would moan in want, compelling him to smash back in all the harder. Her cries of bliss were even louder and more beautiful when he did so. Lincoln bit his lip as he humped away, making his sister sing as he played her like an instrument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni felt an odd sense of embarrassment at being dominated by her brother. If any guy was going to get the best of her, she\u2019d have preferred it be him. However, it was still a little humiliating for a predator to be topped by prey, and especially one so young. Even so, such thoughts were but fleeting distractions amidst the ecstasy coming from her ass and belly. Clyde was stirring, not quite awake, but his movements inside her sent tingles through her body. And Lincoln was being extra rough on her back door, just like she liked. The sounds of wet sliding and the slapping of skin filled the room. Leni could only give unintelligible moans and grunts as she felt her core swell to the point of bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was just as far along. Each slap of his balls into Leni\u2019s taint brought him ever closer. \u201cGuhhh!\u201d He slammed back inside one last time and came. Leni slammed her face into his pillow to muffle her screams while he hung onto her waist and buttocks like his life depended on it. He didn\u2019t unload as much jizz as he\u2019d have liked, having not yet fully recovered from the ordeal with Luna, but it was still enough to satisfy his beloved sister. Lincoln rested his cheek against her lower back as her screaming calmed. As much as he loved the sex and belly time, there was no arguing with the simple pleasures of cuddling those closest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an appropriate amount of time waiting, Lincoln tried to pull himself free, only to find that he was stuck again. This time it was Leni\u2019s anus clamping down on his cock, and refusing to let go. \u201cUh, Leni. Think you could relax your butt a little? I\u2019m ready to get down, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Leni respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she let him go? She could try holding him in place and carry him around in her butt cheeks. Anal vore is always an option. Someone catching them in the act could be fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOops. Sorry, Linky.\u201d Leni relaxed her anus and released Lincoln\u2019s cock. He slid down along the curve of her backside and hit the ground feet first, for which he was rather proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was fun,\u201d Lincoln said as Leni stood and turned around, almost hitting him in the face with her belly full of Clyde. He could hear the guy still snoring. \u201cMan, he\u2019s a heavy sleeper. So, what are you gonna do with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni stared down over the expanse of her breasts and belly at her naked brother, only to yawn. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go take a nap and, like, let Clyde work his way through my system,\u201d she said while tenderly stroking her stomach. \u201cHe\u2019ll be out in a few hours. I want him to enjoy the full experience, even if he\u2019s asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips. On the one hand, he was happy for Clyde finally being eaten. Truly that first experience would be something he\u2019d remember forever. On the other hand, his friend was now out of commission for the next few hours until Leni pooped him out. The girl departed for her room, robe still hanging low, while Lincoln was left to wonder what to do with himself until then. That\u2019s when he remembered the VoM comic. His and Clyde\u2019s copies were still on the dresser. And since he was already comfortably naked, he grabbed one, kicked back, and dove into the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaa!\u201d Lincoln jumped right out of bed. \u201cLucy! Why do you always have to\u2026 Lucy?\u201d He looked around but there was no sign of the goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln looked skyward where a pair of eyes were watching him from the vent. \u201cLana? What are you doing up there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola thinks she heard a rat up here. I\u2019m gonna flush it out and feed it to my babies,\u201d explained the dirty twin eagerly, referring to her myriad of pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes and got back into bed. \u201cWell, good luck with that. Just don\u2019t try eating it yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana huffed. \u201cThat\u2019s a dumb rule. Animal fur tastes great. I should be able to eat them if I want. Plus they make excellent practice\u2026 I assume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d Lincoln turned the page and attempted to tune her out. When he failed to hear the sounds of vent crawling, he looked back up. \u201cWas there something you needed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, actually. Lucy said you helped her with some hunting practice and I was thinking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy just needed a confidence boost. She seemed like she knew what to do. She just needed a push to go out and do it. If there\u2019s one thing Lana Loud already has in spades, its confidence,\u201d Lincoln deflected insistently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo arguments here,\u201d she boasted. \u201cBut I was actually looking for some practical experience. You know me. I\u2019m a hands-on learner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. And just what kind of experience are we talking?\u201d Lincoln asked warily. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in Luna\u2019s pussy <i>and</i> I just got off of Leni\u2019s butt, so I\u2019m pretty beat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good. Cuz I was hoping to practice some unbirth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s brow rose. He didn\u2019t exactly keep tabs on how far along all his sisters were in their predatory skills, but he was pretty sure that someone his size was out of the twins\u2019 league. \u201cWouldn\u2019t Lola or Lisa make better practice partners for that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already asked them, but they\u2019re busy. And Lucy\u2019s left, too. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned his defeat and closed the book. It seemed like he\u2019d started something with Lucy, and now he had to finish it. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the condition that you also bring Lola.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw man! Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if she finds out you got pred practice without her, she\u2019ll treat it like she caught someone cheating in a pageant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana shuddered. \u201cFair point. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Lincoln knew it, both his twin sisters were sitting on his bed, and all three were naked. Apparently all it took for Lola to not be busy was the suggestion of falling behind Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cleared his throat. \u201cFirst of all, I just want to make it clear that when I helped Lucy, my main strategy was to get another sister to do the heavy lifting. Ya know, cuz they actually know how this stuff works. I might be your brother, but I\u2019m still prey. I\u2019m basically an outsider looking in. There\u2019s only so much I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. You got this,\u201d assured Lana. \u201cLuan said you just gotta stick your arm waaay up there and move it around to work the muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that you\u2019ve got Lola on board, why not use <i>her</i> arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only here to make sure things stay fair,\u201d asserted the pink sister. \u201cBesides, your arms are bigger, which will give an even better stretch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Linky!\u201d Lola begged. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with more experience going inside a predator than anyone in the house. You know what feels good and\u2026 and\u2026 how to make it not hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cIs that why you don\u2019t want to do it with Lana? You\u2019re afraid of it hurting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola averted her gaze. \u201cWe\u2026 haven\u2019t exactly been practicing, ya know, down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana nodded. \u201cWe heard from some older girls at the bus stop that the first time down there is\u2026 really painful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had to force himself not to face palm. \u201cGuys, they were talking about sex. The first time for prey girls having <i>sex</i> is painful. Predators don\u2019t have that problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, I\u2019d feel more comfortable if it was you who did it,\u201d Lola admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Same. You know how to be gentle. Everyone else\u2026\u201d Lana trailed off, her meaning clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned as the twins looked up with shimmering, pleading eyes. They were using the big brother card. He couldn\u2019t say no to the big brother card. Finally he gave a defeated sigh and muttered, \u201cI\u2019m such a pushover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we know, but that\u2019s why we love you,\u201d assured Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Then let\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d His decision made, Lincoln pushed up his nonexistent sleeves and got to work. He started by extending both hands to rub the twins\u2019 pussies. His fingers explored their slits and tested their give, making both little girls start to moan, which threatened to revive his cock. Lincoln tried tuning them out as he sunk two fingers into each pussy to get a finger banging going. \u201cSo far, so good. Not too tight and a good amount of pull,\u201d he appraised expertly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for the big one.\u201d Extending his fingers like he was doing a karate chop, Lincoln carefully slid both hands up his sisters\u2019 twats. Both cried out and started flailing. Lola swore like a sailor while Lana had the sense to find a pillow to bite. Lincoln pressed onward, focusing only on the muscles undulating around his upper arms. \u201cGetting a little tighter. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d be able to fit a same-size body this far.\u201d Each set of fingers slipped through an orifice into their wombs. This sent the twins over the edge as their backs arched and they came over his arms. Lincoln patiently waited for their orgasms to pass before attempting to go further. Ultimately, he couldn\u2019t even reach his elbows. \u201cThat\u2019s it. The walls won\u2019t give.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-try moving,\u201d urged Lola. Both twins were panting hotly on Lincoln\u2019s bed, but they were already gaining their second wind. \u201cW-work your h-hand around. Make us stretchy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill biting the pillow, Lana only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but you guys have to tell me if it\u2019s too much.\u201d At their agreement, Lincoln tried pushing against the slimy and fleshy walls of their insides. He pushed both arms down to stretch against the mattress. His fingers wiggled to tickle around their wombs. He tried pushing back until they were against the wall, ever mindful of the sounds they made. While he was fairly confident in his ability to tell the difference between groans of arousal and pain, he was still very careful not to over exert himself. \u201cSee, this is why you need an older sister for this, like Lynn. I bet she\u2019d know if you\u2019re supposed to do one big push or a bunch of little ones,\u201d he griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-keep going,\u201d begged Lana. \u201cS-so gooood!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other alternative, Lincoln continued his experimental approach. He alternated different kinds of pushes and listening to his sisters\u2019 pleasured moans. This went on for several minutes, but Lincoln never stopped feeling like he was grasping in the dark. The only thing that kept him going was the aroused and needy expressions of his sisters. For the second time the twins came, even more intensely than before. They squirted so hard that some girl jizz got on Lincoln\u2019s face, which he happily licked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the twins lying limp on his bed, their chests rising and falling with their labored breaths, Lincoln asked. \u201cEnough?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Typical. Pulling back only dragged them along the bed. So he tried pressing them together and using the friction of their bodies to wiggle his arms free. Doing so required even more movement, which caused the twins to orgasm again. Eventually his arms were free. Sticky, but free. Then the twins\u2019 predator endurance kicked in enough for them to finally stand on their own. They were still winded, covered in sweat; their inner thighs were a mess of sex juices as their gaping pussies slowly closed, and both gap-toothed smiles beamed ever so thankfully up at their big brother. They hugged him, paying no mind to petty things like stickiness when there were important things like hugs to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot, Linky. That felt super good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa see. I told ya unbirth was fun,\u201d Lana boasted. \u201cWe totally need to practice more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really should,\u201d agreed Lincoln, setting his hands on the twins\u2019 backs to hold them close. \u201cBut you really ought to see an older sister to make sure you\u2019re doing it right, first. Lynn at the youngest. Use each other and practice dolls as much as you can, just like regular vore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have all of you inside me,\u201d Lola gushed as her face rubbed into his stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna feel sooo gooood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled and rubbed her back. \u201cI can\u2019t wait, either. I know you\u2019ll feel as good as the rest of our older sisters, but be patient. That\u2019s still a few years off.\u201d Even if his words were wise, it still felt a little hypocritical to say them, given all the times he\u2019d needed to be told that exact message and all in just the last month at that. He was growing at the same rate as the twins, at least for now. It wouldn\u2019t be until they were big enough to digest people more regularly that they\u2019d start to overtake him in height as Lucy had. The goth already had a half inch over him and that gap would just keep widening, but that was fine. He loved seeing his sisters big, happy, and healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of healthy\u2026 That was about the time that both twins noticed Lincoln\u2019s resurrected erection. They shared a knowing grin where he couldn\u2019t see, waited for his guard to fully relax, and then dove down. Lincoln gasped as twin pairs of lips kissed onto his shaft. The twins licked along the stretched skin and hummed their approval at the rich flavor. Lincoln set his hands on their heads to try and push them away, but together they pushed right back. After kissing one another around his meat, the twins switched for a more coordinated attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola slid up along the shaft, licking and sucking delicately, until she reached the head. She laughed when her tongue sampled the difference in texture and made Lincoln shudder. Now directly in front of him, she sunk the head of his cock fully into her lips. Suckling like it was candy, she hilted herself quickly, not even gagging when the tip poked her uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana had gone south to the boy\u2019s balls. She loved playing with them. Bouncing them in her fingers always made her laugh for some reason, but tasting was even better. They were so small and delicate, and the hand pressed against the top of her head was a gentle reminder to be careful. Lana knew well how to tend to sensitive machinery as she suckled the salty, sweaty orbs. Her lips came off with a wet pop and she said, \u201cI can taste Leni on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola slid off the shaft and smacked her lips in satisfaction. \u201cLuna, too, though not as strong.\u201d She looked up at her brother with bedroom eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly been making the rounds this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes, even as he fought against the pleasure. \u201cTell me about it. I g-guess that\u2019s the p-price you pay for p-popularity,\u201d he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh poor you. Hehe. I can\u2019t wait until I can fit all of you inside me.\u201d Lola purred as she nuzzled his cock against her dainty little nose. \u201cI\u2019ll make you cry out and beg for more,\u201d She then applied another lick to Lincoln\u2019s shaft before sinking back down to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana, meanwhile, scooted around to Lincoln\u2019s back. \u201cYeah, playing with the pussy is fun and all, but give me butt stuff anytime.\u201d The dirty twin parted her lips wide and engulfed the whole of Lincoln\u2019s ass, making him yelp. She wasn\u2019t trying to swallow him, but just wanted full access to his buttocks, which she found especially delicious. Her slippery tongue coated over his smooth cheeks with tender affection as he was sandwiched between the twins. When the slimy appendage touched his pucker, Lincoln gasped and felt himself twitch in Lola\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this as her cue, Lola finally started bobbing her head up and down the shaft. While she gave her brother fellatio, she reached around to take Lana\u2019s free hand. The dirty twin might have been having a blast eating ass, but Lola wanted her sister to share in the bounty they were both striving for. Regardless, Lola picked up the pace, pulling back until only the head was inside her lips, and then slammed her face against her brother\u2019s pelvis, swirling her tongue with each thrust. She loved the way his meat thrummed with his pulse, and his moans as the twins double teamed him was like honey to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-ummiiing!\u201d Lincoln warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Lola squeezed Lana\u2019s hand, just in case she missed it. The dirty twin abandoned eating her brother\u2019s ass and hurried back around to the front. Lola pulled off of Lincoln\u2019s slick cock, but kept pumping the base while Lana resumed fondling his testicles. When Lincoln set his hands on both twins\u2019 heads, they got right up to his cock head, mouths wide, tongues out, and cheeks pressed tightly together. Lincoln erupted out into the open air and right onto his sisters\u2019 eager faces. The moment his cum touched their tongues, any semblance of fair play vanished as the pair started struggling for control over his faucet. They shoved, punched, swore, and much more around Lincoln\u2019s sensitive bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for him, he didn\u2019t have much in the tank. So even though the pair knocked him over as they vied for dominance, there wasn\u2019t a lot to fight over. It didn\u2019t take long for their bickering to be silenced with licks as they lapped up any and all spilled seed, especially on each other. Lincoln just lay on the floor, breathing heavily as he let the twins work it out of their system. When they had, they helped their sticky brother up, each kissed his cheeks, and set him back on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Linky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019re the best brother a pred could ask for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big brother card played to fulfillment, Lincoln only gave a weak thumbs up and collapsed into the sheets.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln awoke with a start. His stomach grumbled. Checking the clock, he heaved a sigh that it was already lunch time. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being me sometimes. Having so many people packed in one space tends to eat up your time one way or another. That becomes pretty literal when your house is full of predators,\u201d he deadpanned to his audience as he slipped into his clothes from earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t even have time to get properly cleaned if I want to get to the good leftovers in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spraying on enough deodorizer to render a dog nose blind, Lincoln headed out to what was a pretty standard level of chaos and loudness. Good. If everyone was still doing their own things, that increased his odds of making it to the kitchen unmolested\u2026 Probably a poor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcushe me, elder male shibling. Might I borrow you for a moment?\u201d Lisa asked, stepping out of her room in a hazmat suit. It was distressing just how numb Lincoln was to such a sight by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it is, can it wait? I\u2019d really like to get to the fridge before-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShomeone shtealesh your chicken nuggetsh.\u201d Face expressionless, Lisa produced a plate with Lincoln\u2019s coveted breaded treats, all sizzling hot. \u201cAll cooked to perfection, thanksh to my homemade oven.\u201d There came a sound of something heavy bouncing around behind the genius, followed by a crash, which was very distinct from a standard explosion. Still looking unfazed, Lisa closed the door behind her. \u201cCare to try one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. For the umpteenth time today, a sister had backed him into a corner. \u201cI might not be Lola, but if this is a trick to experiment on me, I\u2019m definitely telling mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be paranoid.\u201d The crashing from Lisa\u2019s room resumed, only now there was a rhythm, almost like something was dancing. \u201cThe only experiment here ish the effectivenessh of my oven. By all meansh. Enjoy.\u201d She pushed the plate out into his hands. As Lincoln shrugged and popped a bite into his mouth, Lisa muttered, \u201cBeshidesh, that rule only appliesh to chemicalsh and drugsh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what now?\u201d Lincoln asked mid chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shaid nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello mah baby. Hello mah honey. Hello mah ragtime gaaal!\u201d sang something from Lisa\u2019s room, making her look very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln continue to chew, now especially mindful of what might be in his mouth. It was actually pretty good. \u201cSo long as I don\u2019t see it and it doesn\u2019t affect me, I\u2019ve got nothing to tattle about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dishcretion ish mosht appreciated.\u201d Lisa nodded. \u201cAnd the nuggetsh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln swallowed. \u201cBetter than usual, actually.\u201d Anticipating her next question, he began patting himself down and taking a few test steps. \u201cNo adverse side effects, yet,\u201d he said the last word in warning before taking another bite. \u201cOh, that reminds me. Is Clyde out of Leni yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet. Our elder shishter ish enjoying moving him through her digeshtive tract,\u201d Lisa said as she pulled out a notebook to jot down her observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln took another bite. \u201cStill good. Also, have you had time to read the book we got you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \u201cThe art ish nicely detailed, the protagonisht ish above average by human shtandardsh,\u201d high praise from her, \u201cand there are jusht enough cluesh for a keen eyed obsherver to put the piecesh together. I\u2019ve yet to figure out any myshteriesh before the detective, to the author\u2019sh credit, but I don\u2019t feel cheated, like the cashe wash sholved with an assh pull. Overall, very shatishfactory. And you? How ish the chicken?\u201d She gave nothing away as a purple tentacle sprouted from Lincoln\u2019s head, only to fall off and shrivel up behind him. He was none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad.\u201d Lincoln swallowed and popped in another bite. \u201cI probably don\u2019t want to know what you did to these things, but they\u2019re great. I think you might have another patent in the works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Lisa waited for him to finish eating, discretely shuffling any other growths off to the side before Lincoln could notice. When he was done, she took back the plate. \u201cYour cooperation, ash alwaysh, ish appreciated.\u201d Then she sniffed. \u201cAlthough I recommend that you abshcond to the shower, posht hashte. You know what\u2019sh likely to happen once theshe animalsh shmell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. About that.\u201d Lincoln rubbed the back of his head. \u201cYou think you could-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoin you on the journey to the bathroom in the hopesh of deterring our shavage shiblingsh from being triggered by your aroma and acting ash though in heat?\u201d Lisa said all in one breath. \u201cCertainly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back to their respective rooms to grab a change of clothes, with Lisa definitely not engaging in an epic battle against the latest monstrosity birthed by her experiments. They made it to the bathroom and, much to their surprise, had it all to themselves. The pair stripped and hopped in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa\u2019s experiments might be dangerous, but without her tools, she\u2019s one of the safest sisters to be around,\u201d Lincoln said. Although in this case, it might just be his inner monologue being heard by the audience, as Lisa gave no indication that she heard anything. She just made a sound of contentment as he kneaded shampoo into her scalp. \u201cLisa\u2019s young enough that her sex drive is effectively zero. She\u2019ll lick people just for the taste, rather than any other kind of gratification. Not to mention that she\u2019s not even old enough to digest anyone yet. She can only get Lily down, and only after a lot of struggling. It can be hard for a young pred, always being told they had to wait until they\u2019re ready. Fortunately for Lisa, her hobbies keep her pretty busy. Though I can tell she\u2019s envious of our other sisters. That\u2019s something the two of us have in common. Even so, I\u2019m almost as eager as she is for the day when she can finally digest someone, thus becoming a full predator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you wash my back next? I can never sheem to reach,\u201d requested the squinting genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Lincoln grabbed the rag and scrubbed firmly across his second youngest sister\u2019s skin. As one of his sisters, he was still pretty familiar with her body. No curves, other than some lingering baby fat, a flat butt, flatter chest, and super short. She was young enough to still be considered extra sweet, at least in what Lincoln understood of predator preferences. However, if given the choice, their sisters were still more likely to swallow him than her. Preferential treatment really wasn\u2019t all that great, to be honest, but Lincoln endured. He still enjoyed these quieter moments where he and his sister could just wash each other\u2019s backs without any lewd overtones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, with all the stuff you\u2019re always building, you think you could make something like a super deodorizer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what purposhe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so that the next time I\u2019m left in a puddle of sweat and sex juices in my room, I don\u2019t have to brave no-man\u2019s land just to get the stink off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. A meansh of attaining inshtant hygiene for prey looking to avoid opportunishtic predatorsh.\u201d Still squinting, Lisa turned a deadpan stare back at her brother. \u201cYou do realize I have a biash in favor of you washing my hair, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m always glad to lend a hand, but that\u2019s exactly the problem. No offense, but you guys can be awfully needy sometimes. I\u2019m not asking for a break, just a way to walk down the hall with some peace of mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \u201cI shupposhe \u2018needy\u2019 ish a fair asshesshment for a wily predator, and you <i>do</i> do a lot for ush. Very well,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI\u2019ll shee what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Lincoln grabbed Lisa from behind and pulled her naked body to his in a constrictive embrace. \u201cThanks a lot, Lisa. You don\u2019t know what this means to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have an inkling.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s flaccid cock was rubbing against her flat buttocks. And while she was still too young to fully appreciate the sensation, that didn\u2019t stop a light blush from reddening her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair dried one another off, got dressed, and amicably parted ways. Lisa had not only gotten some valuable data from her brother, but also the shared shower was an effective means of unwinding after a long day of twisting the natural order to her sick and depraved whims. Speaking of which, as she entered her and Lily\u2019s room, it seemed that the shriveled tentacles weren\u2019t so shriveled anymore. \u201cShtay back you fiendsh! I have a flamethrower and I know how to ushe it!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln reunited with Clyde shortly after the lucky guy had been pooped out by Leni. The middle Loud had little issue with helping his buddy get clean, regain his land legs, and get dressed; all the while the former meal kept staring at his devourer with goo-goo eyes. Naked people just weren\u2019t as big a deal to him as they were to most, except if there were overt sexual implications in play. Luckily, Leni was content to play on her phone for a while, giving the boys the opportunity to exit the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln wiped some sweat from his brow. \u201cPhew. That was close. It looked like Lynn might\u2019ve gotten us there for a second,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut look at you. I haven\u2019t seen you run that fast since that free giveaway of Ace Savvy merchandise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde beamed and pushed out his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I feel amazing; refreshed, even. It\u2019s like I can take on the whole world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown there, buddy,\u201d Lincoln said soberingly. \u201cYou\u2019re just coming off of a post-vore hi. I get it. They\u2019re super relaxing, but I\u2019m kinda surprised you got all this extra energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always found power naps very stimulating. Looks like a belly nap is that, but in spades.\u201d He swooned. \u201cLeni\u2019s the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought a smile to Lincoln\u2019s face. \u201cSee. What\u2019d I tell you, buddy? All preds do that all the time. There\u2019s a reason our house is practically a business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sign me up, cuz Clyde McBride just became a loyal customer.\u201d He fished around for his wallet. \u201cWhat are Lori\u2019s rates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln chuckled. \u201cUnless they\u2019re hurting for cash, mostly they take whatever\u2019s offered by whoever they think looks good. But for you, I think they\u2019ll be willing to bump you up the wait list.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde pumped his fist. \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil then, what\u2019s say we put all that extra energy of yours to work?\u201d Lincoln pulled out two pairs of binoculars and indicated a duffle bag filled with their brand name spy gear. \u201cClincoln McLoud super sleuths?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClincoln McLoud super sleuths!\u201d Clyde cheered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two donned their deluxe spy gear and ventured forth into the neighborhood in search of mystery and adventure. Naturally, they dove into the nearest set of bushes with a good view of the neighborhood. Open windows of any sort were an open invitation to the pair. Predators in the neighborhood tended to attract a certain kind of  neighbor, and the neighbors around the Loud house were an interesting bunch, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a bogey at 3 o\u2019clock on the second floor,\u201d announced Clyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible. Lana\u2019s done picking her nose by 2.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln chuckled. \u201cYeah, yeah. I know what you meant, buddy,\u201d he said while aiming his binoculars at the Yates\u2019 house. Upon seeing another set of binoculars looking back at him, he panicked. \u201cAhh! Our position\u2019s been compromised. Abort!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelay that. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve spotted us,\u201d countered Clyde. \u201cIt looks more like they\u2019re just watching your house in general.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatching our house?\u201d Suspicions at their peak, Lincoln resumed his viewing to confirmed that Mrs. Yates wasn\u2019t actually looking at them. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Mrs. Yates seems to be just looking at our house, but for what purpose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer, the much shorter and stockier Mr. Yates came up from behind his wife, hugged her from behind, and stuck his hand down the front of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we got a couple of voyeurs,\u201d assessed Clyde clinically. \u201cAnd since they\u2019re watching <i>your</i> house, it\u2019s probably safe to assume what they\u2019re hoping to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips. \u201cWell that\u2019s weird. If they want to see vore, they could just ask to come over. Better yet, they could apply as volunteers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but some people just like to watch. Plus this way is probably cheaper.\u201d As Clyde spoke, Mr. Yates had unbuttoned his wife\u2019s top to better reach into her blouse while she was trying to say something. \u201cFemale subject is speaking. If romance movies have taught me anything, she\u2019s probably making something up about what she\u2019s seeing in order to excite her husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of romance movies have you been watching?\u201d questioned Lincoln, more out of curiosity than shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dads have quite the collection,\u201d Clyde answered cryptically. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve made a discovery at the house of Yates. Should we pass on this intel to the proper authorities, or hold onto it in order to avoid causing an incident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a reasonable dilemma. Telling anyone in the Loud house was pretty much guaranteed to send at least a few of them over to give the Yates exactly what they wanted, or at least what they seemed to want. Not like anyone could stop a small army of Louds once they got started, anyway. Naturally, Lincoln could go along if he so chose. There were some cute girls at the Yates\u2019 place, even if their perpetually smiling faces gave him the creeps sometimes. Maybe they\u2019d look less unsettling with his cock in their mouths while a sister at them feet first? The whole lot of them really needed to unwind, in Lincoln\u2019s opinion. And if Clyde was any indication, a day with the Louds would certainly do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he <i>had</i> been complaining basically all day about being oversexed with his sisters. Wasn\u2019t it a little hypocritical to suddenly turn around and jump at the chance for sex with non-family? Probably not. Maybe short sighted would be better, given that a family visit like that would devolve into a full on orgy real quick. Plus it was nice to just hang out and play with Clyde like regular kids. On yet another hand\u2026 Wait, did he have three hands? After eating something Lisa had given him, Lincoln performed a quick check to confirm that the number of limbs remained unchanged. Good. He really didn\u2019t want to have a repeat of last month\u2019s incident. Anyway, on the hypothetical hand, Clyde could come along. He\u2019d never been to a Loud orgy before and catching Lori with her belly full was the ideal time to solicit her for extra intimate cuddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?<br>\r\nNothing. Keep being regular kids for a while.<br>\r\nSound the alarms and unleash the Louds of war!<br>\r\nGo over and talk to the Yates with just him and Clyde.<br>\r\nSomeone is looking for them.</span></div></div>",

How\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Not bad.\u201d Dressed in her usual hoodie and a helmet under her arm, she offered the pair of them a helping hand up. \u201cI was just passing through the neighborhood, doing some sick moves,\u201d she indicated her skateboard, \u201cand then I noticed you guys creeping through the bushes. You\u2019re not stalking anyone, are you?\u201d she asked with a coy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but it turns out the Yates may be voyeurs.\u201d Clyde handed her his binoculars and pointed to the window in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie Anne stared at said window for quite a while before putting the binoculars down, cheeks flushed. \u201cIt still weirds me out how not weirded out you guys are with stuff like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith my family, strangers getting off while they watch us is pretty mundane,\u201d Lincoln explained evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I just had my first vore experience with Leni,\u201d Clyde boasted. \u201cClyde the boy is no more. From now on, you can call me Clyde the MAN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie Anne looked unimpressed. \u201cOh hey, is that a stain on your shirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is?\u201d Clyde looked down, only to get his nose flicked. Now it was his turn to look unimpressed as Ronnie Anne mocked his gullibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you finally popped your vore cherry, huh? That\u2019s cool,\u201d she said after working the snickers out of her system. \u201cIs it actually as good as they say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Clyde confirmed. \u201cAll that stuff about a full body massage. That doesn\u2019t even come close to how great it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re curious,\u201d Lincoln trailed off and motioned up to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but no thanks, Linc. I think I\u2019ll take a page out of their book,\u201d she gestured at the Yates\u2019 place, \u201cand just stick to watching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lincoln\u2019s turn to smile coyly. \u201cYou know they\u2019re doing more than watching, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t get any funny ideas.\u201d Ronnie blushed and pointed a threatening finger in Lincoln\u2019s face. \u201cI might like you, but I don\u2019t <i>like</i> you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing weakness, Lincoln decided to press the attack. \u201cYou\u2019re not still afraid to come in my house, are you?\u201d he asked of the stunned Hispanic girl. \u201cI told you, I cleared it up with my sisters. They accepted your apology, so now we can all be friends without fear of digestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie pursed her lips and looked away. \u201cWhatever. And for the record, I was never afraid. You\u2019re family\u2019s just a little\u2026 overwhelming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstatement of the century,\u201d agreed Clyde. \u201cIt\u2019s basically impossible to spend 5 minutes in that house without someone licking you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right. And I know I\u2019m not exactly one to talk on the matter, but it\u2019s like no one in that house has any concept of personal space,\u201d Ronnie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen almost half your time is spent <i>inside</i> another person, personal space is more theoretical than anything,\u201d Lincoln offered helpfully. \u201cSeriously, my mom and sisters\u2019 collective stomachs are like a second room to me at this point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that\u2019s so wild,\u201d awed Ronnie. Admittedly, she was a little curious. Between Lincoln and Bobby, it was impossible to not be. Months back, Ronnie had almost made a grave mistake when she started picking on Lincoln for reasons she still didn\u2019t fully understand. Had she been a boy, his sisters would have digested her for sure, but luckily they all thought her actions were just a misguided attempt at flirting. They so weren\u2019t, though, and the girls\u2019 patience was wearing thin. It wasn\u2019t long before Lynn and Lucy started dropping hints in the halls that her \u2018flirting\u2019 was too aggressive for their liking. When Lori came over with Bobby, she was even less subtle, saying in no uncertain terms that if Lincoln ever got hurt because of her, then the blonde would literally digest her while fucking Bobby. That was about the time that Ronnie realized she\u2019d been poking a sleeping bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, that was all behind them. The pair found that they had a good bit in common and became friends. However, simply being off the menu didn\u2019t stop her growing fascination with vore. The Louds weren\u2019t just the local pseudo celebrities that she could keep a safe distance from anymore. They were a part of her life now and the things they did were frequently in her face. If it wasn\u2019t someone with a bloated stomach, it was casual nudity. If it wasn\u2019t that, then it was how she could no longer tune out seemingly everyone around her talking about their own weird obsessions with the family. And to top it off, Lincoln Loud, her best guy friend, effectively had zero sense of shame when it came to talking about sex and vore. It always left Ronnie feeling weird, though she still wasn\u2019t sure if it was a bad kind of weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Lincoln spoke up, startling Ronnie back to reality. \u201cWe were just playing spies. Want to join us? You could be our arch nemesis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie frowned. \u201cHow come I have to be the bad guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause of the three of us, you have the best evil laugh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie opened her mouth to protest, only to reconsider and shrug. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, and the boys were chasing the evil Dr. Angela up and down the street. Her doom buggy might have given her speed, but the boys had range with the deadliest of nerf guns. More than once she tried weaving through houses to throw them off, but the grass lawns always cut down on her speed and let the boys catch up. It was all a ploy, however, as she also had superior maneuverability that left her pursuers in the dust. Any pretense of being spies had been abandoned for a variation of tag, but at least everyone was having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Stinken?\u201d greeted Lynn, dressed for the outdoors, as she came up on her dirt bike. \u201cLooks to me like you\u2019re finally on the fun side of the hunt.\u201d She looked over to Ronnie who had come to a halt a few yards ahead, and licked her lips. \u201cI can see why you\u2019re chasing her. She looks yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Lincoln said in exasperation, oblivious to Ronnie\u2019s hot blush. \u201cWe\u2019re playing spies, not hunters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cSpies hunt all the time, and it looks like you\u2019re at the part of the movie with the big chase scene. Also looks like your prey\u2019s a wily one. Those that play hard to get are always the most fun to chase. If you\u2019d like, I could give you a few pointers on how to catch her, just so long as I get a share of the spoils.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are no spoils, Lynn. Clyde and I are spies chasing the evil Dr. Angela before she can flood the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you a doctor of, exactly?\u201d Lynn called over to Ronnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got my PHD in BS, though my specialty is putting nerds in their place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn turned to Lincoln with an even wider grin. \u201cOh yeah. That one\u2019s definitely worth chasing.\u201d Then she turned to Clyde and looked him over. \u201cSo, now that Leni\u2019s taken your vore cherry, does that mean you\u2019re available for the Lynn Miester?\u201d she asked while rubbing her stomach, earning a nose bleed from Clyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she still found the Louds super weird, seeing Lynn tease Clyde like that put Ronnie at ease, bizarre as that might have been. It helped to normalize the athletic Loud. That certainly would have been the sort of thing Ronnie would do if she were a predator and, ya know, into that stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do things go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn joins the game.<br>\r\nLynn leaves them to keep playing.<br>\r\nThey go inside.<br>\r\nThey go to Ronnie Anne\u2019s place.</span></div></div>",

Looks like we\u2019re going to have to pick things up later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no problem.\u201d Lincoln shared a fist bump with Clyde before he ran home. \u201cSee you at school, buddy.\u201d He waved goodbye and turned to his sister and other friend, looking thoughtful. \u201cLynn, since I\u2019m down a partner\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can play!?\u201d she gushed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you promise not to eat Ronnie,\u201d he said authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn puttered her lips in defeat. \u201cFine, but we both know my way\u2019s way more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie smiled at Lincoln coming to her defense. He might have been a dork, but he was also a pretty cool guy\u2026 not that she\u2019d ever say so to his face. Everyone took their new positions to resume the chase. Lincoln yammered some in-game explanation for why he had to change partners, but Ronnie barely paid any attention. Lynn had agreed to leave her bike behind, but she was known as the athletic Loud for a reason. Even on foot, she posed an imminent threat. Ronnie could no longer afford to slow down to taunt her pursuers. Now the tables had turned and it was Lynn doing the taunting, always getting just close enough to grab Ronnie, only to break off at the last minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s heart raced each time the athlete drew near. Lynn\u2019 smile also proved infectious, much to her prey\u2019s annoyance. Despite herself, Ronnie was actually having fun being chased. She was still determined not to get caught and risk Lynn breaking Lincoln\u2019s rule, but that just added a layer of excitement. Speaking of\u2026 \u201cWhaaa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026\u201d Ronnie and Lincoln groaned as they lay tangled in a heap. Ronnie had been so focused on Lynn as she drove her skateboard up and down the road, she\u2019d completely lost track of Lincoln. Between his sister\u2019s athletic prowess and Ronnie\u2019s wheels, the boy had fallen so far behind that he\u2019d wound up ahead of them both, leading to the collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn came to a halt over the pair, set her hands on her hips, and looked on with an appraising eye. \u201cWhoa, that looks like it hurts. Hehe. Not a bad crash, Stinken. You make an excellent speed bump,\u201d she praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Am I bleeding?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn rolled her eyes and checked her brother over with her hands. \u201cNah, you\u2019re fine. Too bad. A few scars could\u2019ve toughened you up.\u201d She turned to inspect Ronnie, feeling her up far more than was probably necessary. \u201cSame to you, though I\u2019ve got to say you\u2019ve got a nice body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie blushed. \u201cI\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You were rocking that board before. I can tell you must practice often. It really shows with the muscle balance. There\u2019s room for improvement, but when is there not, am I right?\u201d Lynn laughed. \u201cHow come you don\u2019t try out for sports? I\u2019m on, like, all of them for my age, but I get the feeling you\u2019d be top of the league for your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie smiled bashfully. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you to say, but I\u2019m really not much of a team player, ya know.\u201d She picked up her board and gave it a spin. \u201cI\u2019m more of a solo act, if you get my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear ya loud and clear, sister.\u201d Lynn laughed, which turned into a groan. \u201cI\u2019ve been hanging out with Luan too much. But there are still plenty of solo things you can try out for. I\u2019ve been trying to get this knuckle head,\u201d she pulled Lincoln into a headlock, \u201cto join a racing team since second grade. His endurance might not be the best, but he knows how to call on some mad energy for short bursts of speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Ronnie replied, a little suspicious. \u201cWhere was that a few minutes ago? I was skating circles around you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips and averted his gaze. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t want to leave Clyde behind. Then the game just kept going, and I guess I got tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Lynn cooed as she gave Lincoln an affectionate noogy. \u201cMy little bro\u2019s got team spirit after all.\u201d Then she turned to Ronnie with a lascivious grin. \u201cTo be clear, when I say his endurance needs work, I\u2019m talking about when his legs are moving. On his knees or on his back, and he can go for a stupid long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLynnnn!\u201d Lincoln whined as he tried to pull free. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn stared blankly at him for a couple seconds before her coy grin returned. \u201cAnd?\u201d She laughed when he slumped in her grasp. \u201cAww, don\u2019t take it so hard, bro.\u201d She set him back on his feet and let him go. \u201cThat\u2019s <i>my</i> job, remember? Bow-chica-wow-wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie had never considered herself a very imaginative sort, but right now her mind was tormenting her with all manner of horrific scenarios. All of them involved Lincoln being naked with his family. Said thoughts were making her feel all tingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lynn had a lightbulb moment. \u201cSay, since we were both the hunters chasing our prey-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot prey,\u201d Lincoln interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and you caught her, that means she\u2019s yours to do with whatever you want,\u201d she finished with a suggestive eyebrow wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cLynn, we\u2019re playing <i>spies</i>, remember. When we catch the bad guy, we thwart her evil scheme which, in this case, was to take over the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Ronnie added nervously. \u201cThe day is saved. Yippee,\u201d she cheered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn shook her head. \u201cNo can do, bro. You know how these movies work. The best villains always come back in the sequels. If you want to save the world, you\u2019re gonna have to lock this bad guy up somewhere she\u2019ll never escape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLynn, stop it. I said you couldn\u2019t eat her, so stop trying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but you saying I can\u2019t just makes me want her more.\u201d She looked past Lincoln and exaggeratedly licked her lips at Ronnie. \u201cC\u2019mon, girl. I can tell you\u2019re curious. We can take it super slow and I\u2019ll go any position you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Bad Lynn!\u201d Lincoln pulled out a squirt bottle and sprayed Lynn in the face until she backed down. He positioned himself defensively between the girls. \u201cConvincing is one thing, but you can\u2019t go around pressuring people like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Yes I can,\u201d Lynn asserted, holding her hands up like a shield. \u201cI do it all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but with <i>your</i> friends, not mine. Now back off.\u201d Lincoln sprayed her in the face again, making his sister hiss like a cat before grabbing her bike and scurrying off. Lincoln gave a relieved sigh and turned back to his friend, puzzled as to why her cheeks were so red. \u201cUh, you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah. I mean\u2026\u201d Ronnie rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever defended me like that before. And I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever fended off a Loud like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Lincoln tried spinning the spray bottle like he was a cowboy doing tricks with his pistol, only to fumble and send it flying. \u201cDang it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Ronnie offered, running into the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but it\u2019s really not a big deal. My sisters can be pretty persistent when they want to eat someone, especially me, but you just have to know how to talk to them. With Lynn, if the spray bottle didn\u2019t work, I had this.\u201d Lincoln reached into his pocket and pulled out a red ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s impressive. And also hilarious,\u201d Ronnie chuckled as she returned the bottle. \u201cIs your sister part dog or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility that we\u2019ve discussed many times in family meetings,\u201d Lincoln admitted. \u201cActually, how about we trade. The ball for the bottle. That way if Lynn ever gives you trouble again, you can defend yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, really? But\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I have a bunch more stored in my room. The bottle\u2019s more valuable, anyway. I just have to say its soapy water and Lana can\u2019t run away fast enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie chuckled as they made the exchange. \u201cWhoa, dude. I know you like to call yourself the man with the plan, but I thought it was just some cheesy nickname. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d actually <i>earned</i> that title.\u201d She regarded the ball and slipped it into her hoody\u2019s pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s go to your place.<br>\r\nLet\u2019s go to my place.<br>\r\nSmell ya later.<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s that over there?</span></div></div>",

So far it\u2019s got a promising start. Ya wanna read it with me?\u201d Lincoln offered without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ronnie squeaked, but with countless second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. I left my copy up in my room.\u201d Lincoln motioned Ronnie to follow him, taking several steps before finally realizing what he was doing, but not the full scope of things. \u201cYou\u2019re cool with coming inside, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a paper plane flew out of the window. It caught the wind just right as it flew right into Ronnie\u2019s hands. She unfolded it and read aloud. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said. Then there\u2019s a heart and its signed Luan.\u201d She looked up at Lincoln before crumbling and tossing the paper. \u201cYeah, actually. I mean, so long as you\u2019re there to keep your sisters in line, I guess I can-\u201d She was cut short by a hand pressed against her mouth. Lincoln\u2019s face was frighteningly close to her and he was shushing her urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever say that when they\u2019re in earshot!\u201d Lincoln whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ll take it as a challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 we\u2019re not even on your property yet.\u201d Ronnie motioned to the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trust me, alright. My mom and sisters have their ways of knowing these things. Just\u2026 try to act normal. Don\u2019t show fear, but don\u2019t be too confident, either. There\u2019s\u2026 a lot of ways to provoke my sisters, though usually they\u2019re pretty behaved when company is over\u2026 relatively speaking.\u201d He smiled awkwardly. \u201cSo, uh, about those comics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie Anne, despite every nerve in her body screaming to take the hint and just start running, replied. \u201cY-yeah. Let\u2019s get to reading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the Loud house was pretty much exactly what one might expect from the name. Lots of noise from shouts, laughter, whirring from the kitchen, the revving of a drivable toy car for kids, and what Ronnie was certain was an explosion. The girls of the house, the predators, were all doing their own thing and, much to Ronnie\u2019s relief, barely paid her a second glance. Lincoln suddenly grabbed her by the hand and started pulling her up the stairs. She followed, mindful to heed his advice about keeping calm without looking overconfident. She also tried to not make it too obvious that she was huddling close to Lincoln for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s this book about, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVampires of Melancholia, or VoM for short. It\u2019s a soap opera about vampires. The characters are really glum all the time, but they face some interesting supernatural drama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds pretty neat. So what does it-oof! Hey, what gives?\u201d She demanded irately. Lincoln had just stopped at the top of the stairs, resulting in her bumping into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln said nothing. He merely motioned for Ronnie to stay back as he ascended the final step onto the second floor. When nothing happened, he looked around, only to appear disappointed. \u201cTypical. The one time I\u2019m actually ready for Lucy, and she\u2019s not even here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Lincoln jumped back. \u201cLuan!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, don\u2019t be scared, little brother. You know my bite is worse than my bark. Or was it the reverse? I get the two mixed up sometimes.\u201d Luan laughed and then clicked her teeth together in a chomp. All the while her hand stroked her distended, squirming belly. \u201cOh, hey Ronnie Anne. Haven\u2019t seen you in a while. Did you get my message?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. That was funny,\u201d Ronnie affirmed, mostly to keep the peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. Don\u2019t be such a stiff.\u201d In the blink of an eye, Luan had closed the distance and pulled the younger girl into a bone constricting embrace. She also pressed her face into the younger girls neck, took a deep inhale, and gave a brief lick. \u201cMmh. You\u2019re tasting awful yummy today. What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cleared his throat and gently pulled Ronnie away from Luan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to my room to read my new VoM comic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThe one with the vampires and the werewolves. Well, have you checked her yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChecked for what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she\u2019s a werewolf, duh. You don\u2019t want to find out after the full moon\u2019s already risen. Haha. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie frowned. \u201cI\u2026 really don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinky likes to read comics in his undies,\u201d Leni informed plainly as she strutted by and down the stairs, dressed only in a pair of shoes, sunglasses, and a purse. \u201cYou two have fun. I\u2019m off to the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeniii!\u201d Rita chided. \u201cNo nudity outside the house. Get that tight butt back upstairs and put some clothes on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops. Sorry mom.\u201d Leni hurried back up and down the hall to her room, though she was mindful to give her hips an added sway when she noticed who all was staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie had suffered a blue screen moment and was left gawking at the top of the stairs. So much had happened so quickly that she was having trouble processing it all. Luan\u2026 undies\u2026 Lincoln\u2026 dat ass! It was too much, too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, having seen this look before, took Ronnie\u2019s hand and hurried her into his room where they were less likely to be bothered by his sisters. He closed the door behind them, just in time to miss the roaring of chainsaws from Lisa\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie finally snapped out of her stupor. \u201cWha\u2026? What happened? How\u2019d I get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. Looks like you experienced an overdose of Loud,\u201d diagnosed Lincoln. He pressed his forehead to hers to check her temperature. \u201cHmm. A little warm, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to worry about. So, uh, welcome to casa Lincoln.\u201d He opened his arms to indicate his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all coming back to Ronnie as she looked around. This was the place Lincoln slept. She was now alone, with a boy, in his room, while a pack of rabid predators stalked the halls just outside. This had not been her smartest idea. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, kind of small,\u201d she said, trying to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s actually a converted closet, but I\u2019m the only one in the house with his own room, so I take what I can get.\u201d He looked around and wondered where he should start his little tour. \u201cUh oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ronnie asked, suddenly fretful that the sisters had broken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo copies.\u201d Lincoln held up the two books. \u201cClyde must\u2019ve forgotten his. Oh well. I can return it to him tomorrow. But hey, at least this means we each get our own book,\u201d he said while handing a copy to Ronnie, which she tentatively took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, great. Um, I might have just imagined it, but it sounded like your sister Luan said something about you reading comics in your,\u201d she swallowed, \u201cundies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Lincoln answered plainly. \u201cI like being comfy while I read and clothes are just so constricting.\u201d Then Lincoln thought about his words and how they might be taken by an outsider. \u201cI don\u2019t have to if it bothers you, though. I\u2019ve already read this one, so I can just wait for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, no. that\u2019s fine. I mean, this is <i>your</i> house. It wouldn\u2019t be right for me to impose,\u201d Ronnie said politely. On the inside, however, she was screaming at herself. Where were these words coming from and why was her mouth so insistent on spitting them out? \u201cBesides, I\u2019d feel awkward if you were just watching me read.\u201d Which was honest enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, cool. I try to be mindful of the fact that not everyone\u2019s used to this kind of environment,\u201d Lincoln explained as he pulled his shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis revealed to Ronnie that he wasn\u2019t quite as scrawny as she\u2019d believed. There was some actual muscle definition there, if only a little. He continued stripping, turning around and letting his jeans drop. Ronnie\u2019s eyes were starting to hurt from going so long without blinking. It almost felt like her peepers might pop right out of her skull when he turned around in his near naked glory, looking perfectly content with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was either the best idea Ronnie Anne ever had, or the worst\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat flavor of awkward will you choose next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair read comics \u2018peacefully\u2019.<br>\r\nNosy sisters are nosy.<br>\r\nRita has some words.<br>\r\nClyde calls Lincoln.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ronnie and Lincoln were just a couple of friends sharing a perfectly ordinary and friendly activity of reading together. Granted, one of them was in his underwear as he read his comic and the other was fighting to keep her eyes on her own book, but it was just so hard. The act of reading, not the\u2026 never mind. Lincoln was reclining on his bed, looking oh so relaxed as he flipped through the pages, while Ronnie had opted for his desk chair, which she had the misfortune of turning around to face the boy in his tighty-whiteys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing unusual about this onset fascination. The only guy she\u2019d seen in so few clothes outside a pool was her brother, and he was pretty bashful most of the time. Lincoln, by contrast, didn\u2019t seem to have any shame at all. He\u2019d just convinced himself that being in his undies was normal and no one could convince him otherwise, not that Ronnie had the ability or desire to. That tingly feeling in her belly was back and she had the oddest compulsion to feed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she took a few sniffs of the air. \u201cSay, do you smell that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln also sniffed. \u201cSmell what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, you better not have farted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I did not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what smells like Bobby\u2019s room whenever Lori comes over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 would probably be sex,\u201d proposed Lincoln, the simple yet self-evident truth of his words hitting Ronnie like a sack of potatoes to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 So you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaundry was yesterday. And given that I\u2019ve showered recently, that means you\u2019re most likely smelling Leni, Clyde, me, and the twins,\u201d he listed off on his fingers. \u201cNot all at once, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and\u2026 Clyde?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Clyde and Leni. She sucked him off before eating him, then she asked me to f-to stick it in her butt, and after that the twins decided to\u2026\u201d Lincoln trailed off. \u201cIt\u2019s a predator thing. There\u2019s no way to not make it sound weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure? Cuz I\u2019d be willing to listen,\u201d Ronnie offered, putting the comic down. \u201cWhat happened with the twins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her insistence, Lincoln delved into the story of how he\u2019d helped the twins practice unbirth, followed by their insistence on thanking him with a dual blowjob. That prompted Ronnie\u2019s curiosity of what it was like being with a girl as big as Leni. This, in turn, was followed up by Lincoln giving the cliff notes on the other things he\u2019d done with his sisters that would have been washed off by the shower. By the end\u2026 \u201cUh, Ronnie Anne. Your nose is bleeding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d She wiped her nose and confirmed the presence of red. \u201cWhoa. How\u2019d that happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. I\u2019ve got a tissue.\u201d Still in his underwear, Lincoln casually closed the distance between the pair and handed her the white material. \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie wiped her nose clean, all while struggling against her wandering-eye syndrome. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m just\u2026 wow. You went through all of that in one day? How are you even still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cMom and Lisa say I\u2019m an inert predator, which I guess means I get things like a stamina boost, but I can\u2019t actually swallow anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, it\u2019s crazy that you do stuff like this every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdmittedly, today my sisters are a bit more demanding than usual, but it\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before. After a certain age, predators are as horny as they are hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s, like, unfair that they take all that out on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. Do you think it\u2019s unfair when your mom makes you do the dishes or take out the trash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot how I see it. Having all these urges makes it tough being a predator. And honestly, while it can get annoying sometimes, I\u2019m happy doing what I can to help my family get through the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s nose crinkled like she\u2019d detected another offensive odor, namely bullshit. \u201cUh huh. And the daily sex with a bunch of pretty girls is\u2026 what? A bonus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln held up one hand and set the other over his heart. \u201cThat\u2019s my story and I\u2019m sticking to it.\u201d In the awkward silence that followed, it was Lincoln\u2019s turn to notice that something was off. \u201cSay, did it suddenly get a lot quieter out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were followed up by a commotion just outside his door, like a bunch of people were suddenly tripping all over themselves. Sharing a suspicious look, Lincoln and Ronnie decided to investigate. The moment the doorknob turned, the usual level of clamor had returned to the Loud house. Everyone was out doing their regular things like bike riding, poem reading, scaring Leni with a spider, and even Lori seemed to be talking unnecessarily loudly into her phone. To Ronnie, the hall looked roughly like it did when she\u2019d arrived. However, while Lincoln couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it, something seemed off. Still, so long as everyone was keeping to themselves, it wasn\u2019t his problem, so he closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the door latched shut, everyone stopped whatever they\u2019d been doing and Lori gave the signal to Lisa. The genius activated her sound machine, compiling recordings of the daily affairs of the house and recombining them into a new sequence. The point was to throw off suspicions of those who knew what to listen for \u2013 namely other Louds \u2013 and cover for the illicit activities of the other members of the house. In this case, since listening at the door had proven too risky, the sisters had all gathered in Lisa\u2019s room to the transmitter that Luan had placed on Ronnie earlier. They were just listening. It wasn\u2019t like Lisa had a secret network of cameras hidden throughout the house to monitor her family\u2019s every move\u2026 anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where were we?\u201d asked Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were talking about how you have sex with your pred family all the time, and how you treat it like a chore that you\u2019re also proud of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChore\u2019s not exactly the word I\u2019d use. Is there a softer word for obligation? It\u2019s not like I <i>have</i> to do this stuff, though I kinda do, but it\u2019s something I feel like I ought to do. Like that one time I came over and you got dinner prepped for your mom after a long shift at the hospital. That was just a nice thing you wanted to do to help out a loved one. Well it\u2019s the same for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut with sex\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cSure. Is it really that weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor anyone else, that wouldn\u2019t even be a question. But for someone living in a house of preds, I honestly have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, my eyes are up here,\u201d Lincoln pointed out with mild irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s blush returned with a vengeance at being caught staring. \u201cI-I knew that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in Lisa\u2019s room, the sisters were all snickering quietly into their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I knew that,\u201d Lynn mocked in imitation of Ronnie\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe literally wants him so bad,\u201d agreed Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus he\u2019s in his underwear,\u201d reminded Luan. \u201cIs anyone else craving pickles and eggs? Cuz I bet Ronnie Anne is. Haha. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was scribbling in her notes. \u201cFascinating. He\u2019s utterly oblivious and she\u2019s in denial. Most curious. Could it be that a lifetime with us has left Lincoln oblivious to the less obvious signals of human attraction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d asked Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you people have the subtlety of\u2026\u201d Lisa paused. \u201cI can\u2019t even think of a hyperbole that doesn\u2019t pale in comparison to us Louds on a daily basis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori gave a dismissive wave. \u201cSo Lincoln\u2019s a little slow when it comes to girls that aren\u2019t us. No big. We just have to apply a little matchmaking magic and they\u2019ll be good as gold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic? But Lucy isn\u2019t back yet,\u201d Leni pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso I\u2019ve got a date with Sam tonight, which I really ought to be prepping for, dudes,\u201d Luna reminded. \u201cCan we take a rain check on this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori rolled her eyes. \u201cOkay, fine. For now, we\u2019ll just observe. Proper meddling in Lincoln\u2019s love life will begin once we\u2019re all in top shape. Agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d the other sisters sounded as one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Lincoln\u2019s room, Ronnie had made peace with the fact that things weren\u2019t going to make sense all at once for her. Preds had their own way of doing things, which extended to Lincoln. So she decided to give reading the comic another try. Time passed and it grew easier to keep her wandering eyes in check. She was getting used to Lincoln in his undies, imagining them as just an unusual type of swimsuit. That, unfortunately, got her thinking about swimsuits in general. All the older Loud ladies were super sexy. No doubt they were the center of attention whenever they visited a pool. Ronnie wondered if Leni in particular might <i>forget</i> to put her swimsuit on. Against such an onslaught of sexiness, should one of the ladies decide that they were hungry, who could resist their request?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie shook her head clean of such thoughts. She was acclimating to nearly naked Lincoln, but now her head was being plagued with images of the rest of his family. It wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d suddenly become bi\u2026 At least she didn\u2019t think so. The Louds were just so\u2026 much. Thinking back to when Luan had licked her, it was actually kind of nice. Luan was being so friendly and it felt weirdly good to be complimented like that. The Louds were a very friendly kind of predator and it made sense how they got so many willing meals. Bobby\u2019s obsession with Lori was starting to make more sense to the young girl. It wasn\u2019t just that she was smoking hot and matched all his fetishes. The Louds just had this naturally inviting atmosphere around them. But if that was the case, to what extent did it apply to Lincoln?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln looked up from his book just in time to catch Ronnie staring, which left him perplexed as she pressed her face into the book. She\u2019d said that she didn\u2019t mind him being in his underwear. Had she lied just to be polite? If so, would it be rude to call attention to it? Ronnie just looked so uncomfortable and he hated it. That\u2019s when he remembered his go-to strategy for dealing with problems like these. He sat up, startling Ronnie, and slipped his clothes back on. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me. Just gotta use the restroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, o-okay. Well, have fun.\u201d Ronnie\u2019s smile was awkward and her internal scream was deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln just nodded and stepped out into the hurricane of Loudness, but something was still off. It was like everyone was a little <i>too</i> into their activities. Leni had gotten dressed, but she still hadn\u2019t left for the mall. Lincoln decided that it was none of his business and instead made for the nearest sister who could meet his needs. \u201cHey Lori. Got a sec?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori said a brief goodbye to whoever she\u2019d been talking to on her cell before turning her full attention onto her brother\u2026 something that almost never happened. \u201cWhat is it, twerp?\u201d she asked as is she didn\u2019t have her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we talk in your room?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda private.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid someone say privates?\u201d Luan popped up, which caused her belly to bounce and squirm. \u201cCuz there\u2019s plenty of those in this house. Haha. Get-hmmf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori had slapped her hand over her sister\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhatever you say, Lincoln. Follow me.\u201d She gave a quiet look of warning to Luan before removing her hand and escorting her brother to the room at the far end of the hall. With her back to the boy, the eldest sister tried not to look too smug as she emitted an aura of triumph to her other sisters. The door was closed and she planted her grand booty on her bed before motioning Lincoln before her. \u201cFirst, you have to pay the toll.\u201d She slipped her shoe and sock off before presenting her foot to Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally. If you want advice, you\u2019ll have to pay.\u201d Lori flexed her toes for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes and quietly scolded himself for not seeing this coming. Of course he couldn\u2019t get something for nothing. The dominant currency of the Loud house was favors, but at least this was relatively mild. Lincoln knelt onto one knee and grabbed Lori\u2019s foot, mindful of her ticklish spots. He pressed her toes under his nose and inhaled deeply like he knew she liked. She bit her lip when he slipped her big toe into his lips. It tasted like skin and smelled like sweaty socks; neither of which had much appeal for the boy. He pulled more toes into his mouth and weaved his tongue between them. Lori\u2019s groans told him that he was doing a good job. For all the years he\u2019d done this, he ought to be some kind of expert by now. When he saw Lori\u2019s hand start to slip into her pants, he decided to end things now. Any further and things would only get more awkward for Ronnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo about that advice,\u201d he began, ignoring his sister\u2019s glower. \u201cRonnie Anne\u2019s being kind of awkward right now. I think she\u2019s bothered by me reading in my undies, but she\u2019s just too polite to say anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori snorted a laugh. \u201cRonnie Anne\u2019s a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the overpolite and sensitive type. You sure you\u2019re reading the signals right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain I\u2019m not, which is why I\u2019m asking for advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smiled proudly and began examining her nails to feign disinterest. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve obviously got good taste and have literally come to the right sister for help.\u201d Her eyebrows rose when she saw movement under the door and swore internally at her inability to stop the eavesdroppers. Granted, not that she\u2019d do any different if the roles were reversed, but it was the principle of the thing. \u201cIf my mastery of tween magazines is anything to go by, which it absolutely is, I\u2019d say that Ronnie Anne\u2019s at that age where prey girls are just starting to notice boys. Being alone in a boy\u2019s room while he\u2019s practically naked is pretty wild for someone like her. At her age, I\u2019d be all over the guy. In fact, I pretty much was.\u201d She sighed fondly at the memories of her young crushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d start with a little cuddling. I\u2019d get a feel for them, and then the tasting would start.\u201d Lori licked her lips. \u201cI\u2019d ask if they wanted to play dress up, strip them bare, and then\u2026\u201d She trailed off after spotting Lincoln and remembering what this was all about. Composing herself, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s probably what Ronnie Anne <i>wishes</i> she could do. But even as brazen as she can be with most things, this is a pretty taboo subject that leaves prey, especially the girls, super confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. \u201cBut Ronnie Anne and I are just friends. She doesn\u2019t want to do that sort of stuff with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s eyes rolled with enough force to throw the earth off its axis. \u201cYou\u2019re nice to her, you share interests, you defended her from Lynn, and she\u2019s seen you nearly naked. If nothing else, she\u2019s definitely thinking about it,\u201d she stated flatly. \u201cThe only question now is which of you will work up the nerve to make the first move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln blinked like a deer caught in the headlights. \u201cIs\u2026 is that really what\u2019s happening right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not sure. You\u2019re both prey, so no one\u2019s expecting you to just mount her like she was a Loud. If she\u2019s having issues with you in your undies, try doing something that she wouldn\u2019t find as awkward. You both like video games, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded. \u201cYeah, but that would mean going in the living room,\u201d he pointed out, the implicit dangers not needing to be elaborated on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll have a talk with the rest of the sisters. We\u2019ll go easy on Ronnie Anne since it\u2019s her first day here, but don\u2019t expect this to be an indefinite thing. Preds are naturally affectionate. Clyde got used to it, So she\u2019ll have to as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming brightly, Lincoln propelled himself onto Lori\u2019s lap and wrapped his arms around her waist. She was too big for his fingers to touch, but the sentiment was clear. \u201cThanks, Lori. I knew I could count on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori made a sound like a purr as she rubbed her grateful brother\u2019s back. Preds had greater tactile sensitivity compared to regular people, meaning that they absolutely adored hugs. Whether inside or outside the belly didn\u2019t matter. They just liked being close to people. And as his sister, Lori couldn\u2019t get enough of Lincoln initiating affection with her. Her imagination began to run with the possibilities. The Loud ladies were naturally meddlesome when it came to one another\u2019s love lives. Lincoln was not exempt. It was an unspoken understanding that, unless explicitly told otherwise, everyone\u2019s boyfriends and girlfriends were free game for the preds. It was also a universal desire among the elder sisters that when Lincoln did find a girl he liked, that he and she would inevitably be spending some shared belly time together. Lori\u2019s belly had been rocked plenty of times by Lincoln going at it with the other sisters, but a girlfriend was a whole new level of intimacy that made her loins burn just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut never mind all that.

It was lunch time at the Loud house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hopped from his sister\u2019s lap and gave her a salute. \u201cThanks again, Lori. I\u2019ll give you a few minutes to spread the word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy, Lincoln,\u201d Lori said louder than was probably necessary. \u201cYou go get Ronnie Anne and I\u2019ll have a talk with the sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspicious, Lincoln returned to the hall and made a brisk walk to his room. \u201cSorry for taking so long. Anyway, it\u2019s lunch time. We\u2019ve got some microwave pizzas if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie gave a relieved exhale and set a pencil in the book. With Lincoln gone, she\u2019d actually made some progress in the story. It was good, and it wasn\u2019t half bad at taking her mind off the complexity of her situation. Then she processed what all Lincoln had just said. \u201cUh, did you say lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, but don\u2019t worry. Lori\u2019s talking with the others so they\u2019ll back off a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like Ronnie had become 50lbs. lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d Lincoln amended, \u201cit\u2019s not indefinite. Preds are naturally affectionate and basically nothing can stop them from grabbing and licking whoever they want, but you have my word that it won\u2019t go further than that. No one\u2019s going to eat you without your permission. I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d become light enough to float away, or if she was wearing cement clothes. Lori would always give her and her mom looks whenever she came to visit Bobby. Now she was about to get the same treatment from <i>all</i> the Louds? Taking a page from Lincoln\u2019s book, she decided to count her blessings and accept this reprieve. \u201cThanks a lot, man. It means a lot that you\u2019d stick your neck out for me like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. What are friends for?\u201d Lincoln opened the door, bowed with a dramatic flourish, and gestured outside. \u201cMi\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie snickered. \u201cStarted cool, then you go right back to being a dork. You\u2019re crazy, man.\u201d Her laughter was cut short when she saw an Asian man in his late twenties step out of Luan\u2019s room. He looked disheveled and was soaking wet, but appeared in high spirits. Luan escorted him out, now sporting a more trim stomach. The pair exchanged some friendly words before Luan slapped him on the butt to encourage him to pick up the pace. Awkward smiles and half-hearted attempts at greetings were shared between the man and the other Loud sisters. Ronnie could only gawk in silence as the truth of the scene settled in her brain. That man had just been eaten, pooped out, and now he was going back to whatever counted as a normal day for him while the Louds did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shook her shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Yeah. Erhem. I\u2019m just, uh, really hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is everyone else.\u201d Lincoln watched his sisters descend the stairs. \u201cWant to give them a couple minutes to sort out the volunteers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVolunt-uh\u2026\u201d Ronnie cleared her throat. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m good. Bobby isn\u2019t that great about closing the door whenever Lori comes over, so I\u2019ve seen enough.\u201d That was the truth. It wasn\u2019t like she peeked through the keyhole to watch her brother go at it with the sexy blonde. That\u2019d be weird, and definitely not something she could confess to, especially in this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, Lincoln led the way down the stairs. Ronnie followed close behind and noted how several sisters had gathered in the living room. Rita, the voluptuous goddess of a woman, opened the door and welcomed in a group of strangers of varying ages, races, and sexes. All looked somewhere between nervous and excited as they lined up in front of the TV at Rita\u2019s direction. With hardly any hesitation, they all began to strip while the Louds ate them up with their eyes. Ronnie could barely pull her eyes away and almost slipped on a step. It was only thanks to Lincoln\u2019s mindfulness that she was saved from being injured, or worse, embarrassed. The girl decided that it was best to keep her eyes on Lincoln as they turned left and away from the predators and prey. That said, Ronnie\u2019s eyes did linger on a girl a little older than herself with a similar complexion. She was grinning bashfully when Lynn approached and planted a full on kiss to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the dining room and in the kitchen was a short line of other Louds before the fridge. Mostly the youngsters and Luna. The door was opened and everyone quickly picked out what they wanted before scattering to do their own thing. Lunches were generally not a family affair for the Louds, unless you wanted to count what was going on in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, dudette,\u201d Luna greeted warmly as she bit into a sandwich instead of just swallowing it whole. \u201cHow\u2019s the Loud house treatin\u2019 ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill trying to get my bearings,\u201d Ronnie admitted. \u201cYou guys are certainly a nice bunch, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s sweet of you to say.\u201d Luna reached out to ruffle Ronnie\u2019s hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie checked that Lincoln had put his selections of pizza and some leftovers in the microwave. With time to kill, she decided to converse with the freckled beauty. \u201cSo, uh, how come you\u2019re not eating anyone?\u201d If it were possible, Ronnie would have psychically slapped her head off. What was up with her mouth today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. I had a tall glass of water yesterday, so I\u2019m good. Besides, I\u2019ve got a date tonight.\u201d Luna pinched her exposed midriff. \u201cWant to make sure I\u2019ve got room for my girl. It\u2019s just common courtesy to have a clean belly before taking in someone new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. So, do you eat her often?\u201d Both Lincoln and Luna snickered at her question. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, Sam can barely keep her hands off me; or out of me, in this case,\u201d Luna laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing preds are so strong. I wouldn\u2019t be able to show her around if she spent the whole time inside me like she wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s curiosity was peaked, along with her desire to drown out the noises from the living room. \u201cSorry if this sounds ignorant, but you don\u2019t want her in your belly? I thought that\u2019s something all preds loved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled appreciatively. \u201cThanks for askin\u2019, but I like Sam for more than jus\u2019 belly time. I want to show her around, take her to nice places, maybe go dancing, and <i>then</i> rip her clothes off and shove her inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShove?\u201d Lincoln questioned with an amused grin. \u201cLast time I saw you two together, it looked like you were trying to hold her back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blushed and rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cYeah. Thanks again for the assist, bro. I owe ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou owe me, like, six. Not that anyone\u2019s counting.\u201d The microwave dinged and Lincoln took out the pizza and leftover chicken bites. He then turned to Ronnie with a bemused expression. \u201cThe dining room has a clear view of the living room, so that\u2019s probably out. Let\u2019s see here. I\u2019d usually go to my room if I don\u2019t want to get involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s mind raced with every possible implication of what \u2018involved\u2019 meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I got it. We could eat on the back porch so you don\u2019t have to see anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter directing Ronnie to grab them some juice boxes, Lincoln carried their plates out back and planted himself down on the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie sat beside him and they ate almost entirely free of the lewd groans and sexual exclamations from inside. She tried to take a bite of her pizza, only to burn her mouth. \u201cOw-ow-ow! Too hot!\u201d She fanned her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln quickly poked a hole in the box, jammed the straw in, took aim into his friend\u2019s mouth, and squirted with all his might. Ronnie sighed after swallowing the refreshingly cool liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick thinking, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetween a lifetime of video games and my family, I\u2019ve probably got the sharpest reflexes around,\u201d he boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Ronnie would treat such a proclamation as a challenge, an invitation to bring Lincoln down a peg. However, given how many times he\u2019d pulled her butt out of the fire in just the last few hours, she figured she\u2019d let him have this one. The pair ate in relative peace, chatting about the comic, school, and other miscellaneous topics. A cool breeze rustled the leaves and added to Ronnie\u2019s sense of peace. Being like this with Lincoln was nice. She didn\u2019t have any other way of putting it. He was a nice guy with a nice \u2013 if odd \u2013 family. He was cute, less of a wimp than she\u2019d thought, and had the ability to hold his ground against the most intimidating people she\u2019d ever met. And to top it off, while he was eating with one hand, his other hand looked strikingly unoccupied while dangerously close to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppress her feelings and keep on eating.<br>\r\nGrow a pair and grab his hand.<br>\r\nHer phone rings calling her home.<br>\r\nCut back to what\u2019s going on with the predators.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ronnie felt like she\u2019d been spending countless seconds eyeing up the boy\u2019s greasy chicken covered fingers. She\u2019d held it before. Or rather he\u2019d held hers. It\u2019s not like there were any rules against her setting her hand down and interlocking her fingers with his. Lincoln, she reasoned, had been conditioned to accept affection from others, especially girls. The worst case scenario would be that he\u2019d pull away from her, which made her heart sink just to think about. Except he wouldn\u2019t do that. That wasn\u2019t the kind of guy Lincoln was. If even half the things he\u2019d said were true, then his sisters were on him pretty much all the time, so why would he pull away from a simple hand holding? More importantly, why was Ronnie devoting so much brain power to something so lame?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Ronnie Anne Santiago for god\u2019s sake. She liked riding her skateboard and giving swirlies to dorks like\u2026 people who were similar to Lincoln, but weren\u2019t as cool. <i>Gah! No. I do not think Lincoln is cool.</i> The point was that she wasn\u2019t the sort of girl who fretted over stupid things like stupid hand holding with stupid boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost a relief when the back door flew open to free Ronnie of her internal dilemma. Lynn rode out on her dirt bike, once again dressed only in a helmet and jockstrap. Only this time she was sporting a gut that almost doubled her total mass. \u201cWoo-hoo! Yeah, feel that burn, baby!\u201d Her feet pumped the peddles faster than most people could track as she rode laps around the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been startled by such an alarming sight, Ronnie hadn\u2019t quite noticed that she\u2019d pressed herself against Lincoln for safety, or that his arm was wrapped protectively around her. Alas, this detail was not lost on their elder who rode up to greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ronnie Anne. Like what you see?\u201d Lynn turned to the side so that her giant belly was no longer cramped against the steering. There were slight bulges and bounces any time the girl inside moved, along with barely audible sounds. \u201cYeah, just doing some post-meal exercises. Not only does it burn off the extra calories, but it makes sure the added material goes where it needs to,\u201d she explained while flexing. \u201cMomma needs herself a new pair of glutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Lynn. You know what mom said about being naked outside,\u201d Lincoln griped while gesturing at Ronnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn scoffed. \u201cThe backyard still counts as inside. The fence is basically a wall. Besides, it\u2019s nothing either of you haven\u2019t seen plenty of times.\u201d She cupped her hands under her budding breasts and gave a more wicked grin. \u201cYeah, you like it, girl. Being a pred gives me a head start with stuff like this, but I can tell you\u2019re totally jelly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I am not!\u201d Ronnie blurted, finding her voice. \u201cAnd that-that\u2019s cheating. All those people you eat makes you bigger and\u2026 bigger.\u201d She pointed accusingly at the older girl\u2019s chest. \u201cWell enjoy it while you can. As soon as mine come in, they\u2019re gonna be <i>way</i> bigger than yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn threw her head back and laughed uproariously. \u201cAs if, girly. I\u2019ve not only got a head start, I\u2019ve got pred genes and a super exercise routine on my side. I\u2019ve eaten girls five years older who still didn\u2019t have sweater puppies like these.\u201d She rolled her nipples between her fingers in a taunting gesture. \u201cBy the time I\u2019m Lori\u2019s age, I\u2019ll be as much a bombshell as her, only with better muscle definition.\u201d She flexed her arm and kissed her bicep. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got going for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTargeting shyshtem aligned. Ready to extract the idiot,\u201d Lisa said as she aimed the net gun from the window. She was stopped by Lori who just saw Lincoln stand and position himself between the girls. Things might yet work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLay off her, Lynn. I\u2019ll have you know that Ronnie Anne\u2019s mom is super-hot. Maybe not Ms. Dimartino hot, but she\u2019s still as much a bombshell as any prey woman I\u2019ve seen. <i>That\u2019s</i> what Ronnie Anne has going for her,\u201d he argued while gesturing back at the stunned girl. \u201cI think we all know that if you were both prey, she\u2019d surpass you in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time Rita had eaten an extra-large meal, even by her standards. She\u2019d been so bloated that she didn\u2019t look before sitting and accidently crushed Lynn under her tremendous phat ass. That impact was soft compared to the brute force of Lincoln\u2019s words. \u201cO-oh yeah? Well\u2026 let\u2019s see who you like more after I digest you,\u201d Lynn threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes and marched up to his sister until her belly was squished between them and their noses were practically touching. \u201cGo right ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn froze in powerless frustration at her bluff being called. She\u2019d never actually digest him. And with her belly already full, she couldn\u2019t even eat him in retaliation. Feeling like she\u2019d been backed into a corner and needing to strike back, Lynn pulled her belly back before preparing the biggest and most aggressive belly slap she could muster to knock Lincoln over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn had no time to react before she\u2019d been encased by a net and yanked into the sky like a caught fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the delay, Lincoln,\u201d Lori called down as she helped Lisa with their squirming catch. \u201cYou did pretty well, though. Very manly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lynn had been pulled out of sight, Lincoln turned to Ronnie, feeling more awkward than ever. He\u2019d just called her mom a bombshell as a compliment to <i>her</i>! Did normal people do that? He was pretty sure they didn\u2019t. Would she understand what he\u2019d meant, or had he just crossed a line that could never be uncrossed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to look up from the plate with some pizza still left, Ronnie stood up. She took the plate with her over to Lincoln. She couldn\u2019t meet his eyes, but she still felt that he was owed a reaction. \u201cYou think my mom\u2019s hot, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery eavesdropping Loud winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. It was a, ya know, spur of the moment thing. I didn\u2019t mean it. I mean, not that you\u2019re mom isn\u2019t pretty or anything. Urgh!\u201d Since he didn\u2019t have any sisters to do it for him, Lincoln pulled off his shoe and shoved the end in his mouth before he could say anything else stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think I\u2019ll be as pretty as her someday?\u201d Ronnie inquired, still not meeting his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraying to whatever deities that might listen, Lincoln removed the shoe from his lips and hoped that the following words wouldn\u2019t cost him a treasured friendship. \u201cI think you\u2019re already pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s breathing grew heavy as her blush turned a similar shade of magenta as her favorite hoodie. She scarfed down the remaining pizza and almost choked before finally working up the nerve to look Lincoln in the eye. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out. After roughly an hour of her mouth doing its own thing, it picked <i>now</i> of all times to abandon her. Typical. Oh well. With her voice out of commission, but the need to express herself lingering, Ronnie did the only thing that made any sense. She kissed Lincoln\u2019s cheek, pushed him over, and then ran through the house and out the front door, picking her skateboard up along the way before bolting down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln just laid there on the dirt and stared up at the partially cloudy sky. A girl had just kissed him. He\u2019d been kissed by a girl who was neither family, nor someone\u2019s food. That had just happened, hadn\u2019t it? The phantom pressure of her soft lips against his cheek suggested that it had. A girl had just kissed him, and it had been Ronnie Anne of all people. Lincoln had no words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Loud ladies also lacked any words. They only had ear-piercing screams that threatened to break all the glass in the house, and possibly the neighborhood. Those who\u2019d had the decency to not eavesdrop were quickly brought in on the dramatic turn of events, and subsequently join the celebratory screaming. Even Lynn, bound and gagged, felt compelled to join the cheering. A love of family drama was one of the few interests that the Louds shared and the notion of privacy was more theoretical than anything. Everyone loved to gossip and be a part of everyone else\u2019s business and a kiss like that would definitely be a topic of discussion for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln gets the third degree from his sisters.<br>\r\nLincoln needs a break and visit\u2019s Clyde\u2019s house.<br>\r\nSkip to Sam and Luna\u2019s date.<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s up with Ronnie Anne, anyway?</span></div></div>",

The stampede of heavy footsteps descended upon him as several big-bellied and excited looking sisters surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO.M. Gosh! That was, like, totes adorbs,\u201d Leni gushed, hands resting atop her squirming belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo brave,\u201d Lola swooned, trying not to get pushed around by the many distended stomachs. \u201cLike a gallant knight swooping in to save his princess from the crass monster with no concept of tact or dress sense.\u201d Her romantic tone flattened towards the end when she spied the still bound Lynn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot cool, dudes. I thought we\u2019d called a rain check,\u201d Luna whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlans change,\u201d Lori said dismissively. She squatted down to Lincoln\u2019s level and maneuvered her giant, distended stomach to the side so that she could set a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou did great, little bro. If Bobby ever did anything like that for me, I\u2019d shove him up my pussy and wouldn\u2019t let him out for a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s eyes went wide. Off the top of his head, he couldn\u2019t think of anything Lori might say that would come close to such high praise. \u201cW-was I really that good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy undershtanding of human shocialization ish shtill limited, and even I could tell that you were in the zone,\u201d remarked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Lucy. You busy?\u201d Leni asked into her phone. \u201cI\u2019ll be quick. You totes missed it, though. Ronnie Anne came over and, like, totally kissed Linky. Uh huh. Yeah. We all saw it. Well, have fun with your friends. We\u2019ll tell you all about it when you get home.\u201d She turned around to find all the sisters giving her the stink eye. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <i>all</i> saw it, huh?\u201d questioned Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni gasped in horror. \u201cOh no. How\u2019d you find out? That was supposed to be a secret.\u201d Her words were answered with the harmonious slapping of eight hands to eight faces, and one thud of Lynn\u2019s head to the floor since she was still tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that you were all watching. Not like we didn\u2019t all do the same when you started bringing Bobby and Sam over,\u201d he conceded, resigned to the inevitability of the Loud house. Then he looked at Lynn. \u201cExcept you. What were you thinking talking about your boobs to Ronnie Anne like that? Were you <i>trying</i> to make her uncomfortable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn had finally worked the gag off her mouth. \u201cHey, it\u2019s not like I was trying to eat her or anything. I was just hitting on her, ya know. Maybe if she saw how awesome I looked, she\u2019d be down for some f-mmh!\u201d Her words were muffled by the gag being moved back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan checked the bindings around Lynn\u2019s wrists and ankles before hoisting her up. \u201cThis is quite the stuffed turkey we\u2019ve got. All in favor of throwing it in the freezer until Thanksgiving, say aye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe vote is unanimous. I\u2019ll just take care of this.\u201d Luan hauled her struggling sister over to the fridge, made some room inside, and tossed her in before returning to the others. \u201cAnyway, how was your first kiss? Did it make you want to join her in going\u2026 over the moon? Haha. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuan, that wasn\u2019t a real first kiss,\u201d argued Lori. \u201cThat was just a peck on the cheek. Cute, but it doesn\u2019t really count until after they\u2019ve had lip-on-lip action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe talking top lips or bottom lips?\u201d Luan gestured at her skirt. \u201cCuz Lincoln\u2019s pretty good with both.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori rolled her eyes and turned back to face Lincoln. \u201cBest not to bring up that sort of thing until at least the second date, which you can\u2019t do until you\u2019ve had a first date. You two share classes at school, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry playing it cool for a couple days. Talk to her like you usually would so she doesn\u2019t get too overwhelmed. I\u2019ve had dates that literally freaked out the first time I brought them over. Usually I\u2019d just stuff them in my belly until they calmed down, but you can\u2019t do that, so you\u2019ve got to try the more delicate approach. Give her some time to think things out, but make sure she knows that you\u2019re still her friend. She\u2019ll need that support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln raised his hand. \u201cSounds good and all, but how do you know what dating is like from a prey girl\u2019s perspective? I\u2019m not sure she even likes vore, yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana scoffed. \u201cOh please. No one can set foot in this house without at least getting curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus I totes caught her checking me out earlier,\u201d Leni giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best preds know how to make our food <i>want</i> to come to us,\u201d Lori bragged while feigning interest in her nails. \u201cAnd given how much raw predator energy we give off just by being awesome, she\u2019s definitely into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I guess I can\u2019t argue that,\u201d Lincoln conceded. \u201cSo tomorrow I just play it cool. Be her friend and don\u2019t try to be pushy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it helps, ask yourself what Lynn would do, and then do the opposite,\u201d suggested Lola to everyone\u2019s amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a thud from the kitchen. Everyone turned to find Lynn had pushed the door open and was now shivering on the floor. That\u2019s when Rita came up. \u201cM-m-mom. L-L-Luannn th-threw m-me in the f-f-f-freezerrr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you were harassing Lincoln\u2019s friend after being repeatedly asked not to,\u201d Rita informed tersely. She scooped up her daughter, removed her bindings, and carried her to the living room. \u201cI think some ass time should set you straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww mooom!\u201d Lynn whined as her mother began unzipping her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, everyone\u2019s attention returned to Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori appeared thoughtful. \u201cHmm. Now that you mention it, I think you\u2019ve got a point. Ms. Santiago <i>is</i> quite the bombshell, especially for prey.\u201d Her grin grew devious as she shared knowing looks with her fellow elder sisters. \u201cNext time I\u2019m visiting Bobby, maybe I should-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lincoln shouted. \u201cYou said I can\u2019t do anything to scare her off, well the same applies to you guys. If you start being too aggressive with her family, that might scare her off as sure as anything Lynn would do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it,\u201d Luna voiced everyone\u2019s thoughts as she snapped her fingers in disappointment. Then she checked her watch. \u201cOh shoot! It\u2019s almost time. I, uh, gotta go. Love ya, fam. K-thanks, bye,\u201d she said as she hurried off to meet her date. Then she poked her head back into the room and added, \u201cI\u2019m calling no interference on <i>my</i> date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was met by a round of disappointed snapping fingers and a near unanimous \u201cAw shucks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna beamed her satisfaction and left. With that out of the way and their sisterly advice imparted, the Loud sisters agreed that there was nothing more they could really do today and dispersed to resume their respective interests. Lori drove Leni to the mall, Luan went back to her room to plan her next birthday party gig, Lynn was indisposed, Lucy had yet to return, the twins went outside to play, Lisa resumed her experimentation, and Lily was put down for a nap. That just left Lincoln with nothing but time and his own thoughts. He opted to finally play a video game; something casual that would enable him to keep on thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d been kissed by Ronnie Anne. Granted, it had just been on the cheek, so it didn\u2019t count as a <i>first</i> kiss, but it was still a kiss. You only gave those out to people you liked. Ronnie Anne liked him, at least enough to kiss him, but how did he feel about her? She was fun and cute, a little rough at times, but he\u2019d taken worse from his sisters. Hanging out today had been pretty fun, but it definitely would have been better if she\u2019d been more relaxed. However, as Lori had said, that part was now on him. He had to help put her at ease. Lincoln had no delusions that his sisters were doing this as much for themselves as him, if not more so. Everyone wanted to eat Ronnie, just like they\u2019d done with Bobby and Sam. That was just how they showed affection and welcomed someone into the family. All Loud dates had been put through the same ringer, and now it was Ronnie\u2019s turn. As he lazily shot the zombies on the screen, Lincoln quietly vowed that he\u2019d make sure that Ronnie passed and was welcomed with open arms and open mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we take things from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day<br>\r\nLuna and Sam\u2019s date<br>\r\nA sister needs Lincoln<br>\r\nRita needs Lincoln</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Lincoln woke up bright and early. Once the bathroom routine was out of the way, he got dressed and performed his morning exercises. Today was like any other Tuesday morning for the Loud house. It was like all the chaos of the weekend, but on fast-forward. Everyone had their own routines that they needed to prepare for the day, or just get out of their system before having to sit at a desk for hours on end. Lynn especially embodied the latter as she threw balls at anyone with an open pair of hands, or tried wrestling anyone who got within arm\u2019s reach. Lincoln ducked as soon as she tried jumping him, resulting in her falling down the stairs\u2026 again. It was cool. She\u2019d taken worse damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln greeted the girl with the blue streak in her hair with a salute. \u201cHey, Sam. You have fun last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that even a question?\u201d she asked facetiously while holding Luna\u2019s hand and giggling. She wore her usual target shirt, aqua jacket, and torn purple pants. All these things she\u2019d wisely stowed in an overnight bag for when the inevitable happened. \u201cLuns really knows how to show a girl a good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn skippy I do,\u201d Luna affirmed with a firm slap to Sam\u2019s behind, making her squeak cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m just glad you both hit the shower before rush hour. Everyone ate last night, but knowing my sisters, you\u2019d probably still end up inside someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Are you concerned for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re kinda competing to be Luna\u2019s favorite meal. As your senior in being eaten, I figured I ought to look out for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam scooped the boy up in a giddy hug, burying his face in her chest. \u201cOh man, Luns. You\u2019ve got the cutest brother ever. Say, think there\u2019s time for a quick threesome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s response was muffled by the girl\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln inhaled. \u201cI said there\u2019s no such thing in this house. Now you guys better hurry up. Mom said that if we\u2019re late again, then she\u2019s bringing out the corks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the mention of the dreaded \u2018c\u2019 word made every Loud in earshot flinch. The cork was a device that, when shoved down a predator\u2019s throat, hindered their ability to swallow anything bigger than a basketball. When vore was seen as more of a reward than a punishment, the corks were Rita\u2019s ultimate leverage in keeping her daughters in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we put in a pin in that threesome, aye luv?\u201d requested Luna in her well-practiced British accent. \u201cYou can hold off until lunch, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam made her most adorable pouty face and nuzzled under the taller girl\u2019s chin. \u201cI can, but I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she bemoaned while swirling her finger against Luna\u2019s chest. \u201cYou sure we can\u2019t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna grabbed Sam by the shoulders and spun her around to face her fully. \u201cLuv, corks don\u2019t come out for a minimum of three days, <i>and</i> they fit up my pussy, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gravity of Luna\u2019s words finally sunk in, Sam flipped the script by grabbing her girlfriend\u2019s shoulders and practically dragged her down stairs. \u201cLook alive, ladies! If anyone\u2019s gonna be late to school, it ain\u2019t gonna be us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked back over her shoulder and shared a snicker with Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, Sam needs to come by more often. She\u2019s a great motivator,\u201d Lincoln observed just before whipping out an umbrella and deflecting a bucket of ice water. \u201cSorry, Luan. I saw you setting that one up last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know you did,\u201d the jokester said, half still in her room. \u201cThe real question is what you <i>didn\u2019t</i> see.\u201d She laughed sinisterly and retreated back into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, these are my shadows. I saw them first. Get your own,\u201d Lucy argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s <i>my</i> room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln decided to leave them be. He was in no great hurry and could always catch the bus. Once down stairs, he took his usual seat at the kid\u2019s table where a stack of pancakes was waiting for him. That stack was more like towers on his sisters\u2019 plates, along with their human meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam got to sit at the grownup table next to Luna, granting her the perfect position to make out with the homely but still cute Arabic woman on her girlfriend\u2019s plate. If Sam couldn\u2019t be eaten, the next best thing was to double team the one who could. As Luna began pulling the older woman\u2019s legs into her gullet, she looked up to find Sam absolutely ravishing her prey. They shared a look and smiled around their respective mouthfuls, knowing that both were turned on by doing this. Had they the time, Sam would have loved feeding a girl or woman to Luna, slowly pushing the person inside and watching them disappear inch after inch. They\u2019d done that plenty before and, unlike Lincoln, Sam had no issues with being crushed under a ginormous belly. If anything, that was even more of a turn-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone ate their meals in what passed for peace in the Loud house, ran all last minute checkups, and departed in\u2026 not quite record time, but still pretty decent. Coincidently, the stops for grade school and high school were pretty close to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey buddy,\u201d Clyde greeted excitedly. \u201cHeck of a day yesterday, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then. We had our usual comic run, I got eaten, we found out your neighbors are voyeurs, oh, and you kissed Ronnie Anne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? How did you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobby found out and sent me a private message on social media. You lucky dog you.\u201d Clyde lightly punched his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo, are you guys dating now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned uncertainly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. My sisters told me a bunch of stuff I had to do. Don\u2019t be pushy but make sure I\u2019m still there as a friend? I\u2019m not sure I get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds pretty straightforward to me,\u201d commented Sam. \u201cOn behalf of all prey girls, I can safely say that preds are an intimidating bunch. Even just having them in your family can be enough to give a lot of girls pause. But since she kissed <i>you</i>, even if she\u2019s a little intimidated, she still likes you enough to give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but how do <i>you</i> about this? Bobby message you, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grinned and rested her head on Luna\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNah. Luns just can\u2019t shut up when she\u2019s happy. If she\u2019s not singing, she\u2019s spilling juicy gossip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln filed a mental note to add a music player to his arsenal of sister control methods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s already made the first move,\u201d Sam continued. \u201cJust let her know that you\u2019re receptive for now. Then, when the time feels right, make the second move. Girls like someone who knows how to take what they want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were always tellin\u2019 us to take it easy with Clyde,\u201d Luna picked up. \u201cPersuade without bein\u2019 pushy. My advice is to take your own advice, li\u2019l bro. Also hug. Chicks dig someone who gives good hugs,\u201d she said as she pulled Sam in tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln saluted. \u201cCan do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had boarded their respective busses, Sam took advantage of their band mates having not boarded yet and whispered in Luna\u2019s ear. \u201cSo if those two start dating, does that mean the three of us can go at it inside you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, you sure do have a one track mind, luv,\u201d Luna said while petting Sam\u2019s head. \u201cBut god, I hope so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere shall we go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Johnson\u2019s Class<br>\r\nSwitch to Lori<br>\r\nSwitch to Leni<br>\r\nSwitch to Luna</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms. Johnson\u2019s class was the same as it ever was, and yet it felt so different. To Lincoln\u2019s left was his best friend Clyde, but to his back was Ronnie, his maybe girlfriend. Class hadn\u2019t quite started yet, so he took the chance to turn around and smile at her. Her reply smile was forced, uncomfortable, and she couldn\u2019t hold eye contact for very long. Not good. Usually this was the part where he\u2019d try strategizing with Clyde or a sister, but the subject of discussion was literally right behind him. If he said something she didn\u2019t like, a hamburger bun down his undies would be among her more mild reactions. God forbid if she got creative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln didn\u2019t have long to dwell on the issue before Ms. Johnson came in and began the lesson. Luckily it was fractions, which Lincoln was already fluent in. Living with ten sisters, it was pretty common that whenever someone found anything of value, it would need to be divided evenly to keep the peace. But as confident as he was in the lesson, he couldn\u2019t get Ronnie out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPsst,\u201d Clyde whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s looking pretty down. You should say something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t with the lesson going on,\u201d Lincoln argued, only to have a lightbulb moment. \u201cWait, I can\u2019t <i>say</i> anything.\u201d He grabbed some scratch paper and jotted down a message, only to erase it and start over. He had to pick his words very carefully so as to spare Ronnie\u2019s feelings and his tender skin. Finally he\u2019d gotten the message as close to perfect as possible. Checking to make sure the coast was clear, he crumbled the paper into a ball and tossed it over his shoulder\u2026 only for it to be caught before it could reach its goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem,\u201d Ms. Johnson cleared her throat as she eyed the crumpled paper in her hand. How did she get there so quick? Was Lincoln surrounded by secret teleporters, or was his peripheral vision not what it should be? \u201cPassing notes, are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNotes? Uh, no. That was just some scratch work I did. My hand writing was terrible, even for me, so I threw it away. But\u2026\u201d Lincoln checked to find that the window was open. \u201cI aimed for the trash, but the wind blew it off course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Johnson\u2019s expression went from a disapproving scowl to low-key impressed. \u201cNot a bad excuse, Loud. You come up with that just now, or were you saving it?\u201d That got some snickers from the rest of the class. \u201cSo, do we need to go through the song and dance of having you read the note to the whole class, or will you behave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sunk down into his seat. \u201cI\u2019ll behave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Johnson nodded curtly and returned to the front of the class. \u201cI should hope so. Your mom has all of her children\u2019s teachers submit weekly reports on your behavior. I\u2019d hate to tell her that you were being less than your best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was the sort of nosy mom that, under any other circumstance, teachers would secretly hate. However, given that she\u2019d birthed ten people with the ability to swallow humans whole, her need to intervene was most welcome. Most of the Loud siblings were behaved most of the time, but it was generally believed that the teachers could only keep such order thanks to the threat of calling Rita. Whenever Lynn started getting too hyper in a game, Luan disrupting lessons with pranks, or the ever present threat of eating anyone they didn\u2019t like, just the mention of Rita was typically enough to calm things down. Only a pred could keep other preds in line, and Rita was more than happy to give that proxy power to the teachers. And Lincoln, despite not being a pred, was cowed just as easily as his sisters by such a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a side of Lincoln that Ronnie hadn\u2019t seen before. With his sisters, he\u2019d held his ground, but just the mention of his mom was enough to make him surrender. It made sense, though. Her own mom could be quite the beast when she got angry. Ronnie could only imagine how much worse it\u2019d be with a mom who was also a pred. In a way, Lincoln was living in fear of his family just like everyone else. Perhaps it was because he couldn\u2019t see her, but Ronnie found the nerve to smile sympathetically at the boy. Crazy as it may have seemed, this felt like just one more reason to like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson went on like normal with minimal interruptions and ended with a pop quiz. Then came lunch. Lincoln and Clyde carried their lunch boxes to their usual table, followed shortly by Ronnie who sat on Lincoln\u2019s other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lincoln replied. Recalling the advice of his sisters and Sam, he decided that now was as good a time as any. \u201cI missed playing video games with you yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a third controller. How about after school, you, me, and Clyde hang out at my place and blast some zombies? Sound fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does, but I\u2019m certain I failed that quiz, which definitely means I\u2019m getting extra homework tonight,\u201d Ronnie bemoaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. I can tutor you. I\u2019m pretty sure I got fractions in the bag, so I can definitely give you some pointers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget me,\u201d Clyde interjected. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly confident in my fractions either. Like which is bigger, a fourth or a fifth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We could have a study session together. Just the three of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny chance on making it four?\u201d asked a tall Filipino girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Stella. I was wondering when you\u2019d get here,\u201d welcomed Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and pulled out her lunch. \u201cSorry. My locker was being stubborn. Luckily I remembered that trick you showed me and it opened like a safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrick?\u201d Ronnie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLori showed me this way to hit the even numbered lockers to make them unjam. Kinda sad that this school\u2019s had the same problem for half a decade and no one\u2019s bothered to fix them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, thanks for the advice,\u201d Stella said. \u201cSo is that a yes to a fourth on your study date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of the \u2018D\u2019 word got Ronnie\u2019s attention. Outside of school, she\u2019d never seen reason to hang out with Stella. She didn\u2019t dislike the girl, per say, but neither had she made the time to get to know her as she\u2019d done with Lincoln, and Clyde as an extension. The \u2018D\u2019 word, however, got her thinking. Stella was tall for her age and pretty cute. Lots of guys fawned over her when she first transferred, but she\u2019d singled out Lincoln and Clyde to be her friends. Ronnie had thought that friendship was all that the new girl wanted, but now she wasn\u2019t so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ronnie, it looked like Lincoln wasn\u2019t showing any signs of being smitten, so he probably thought of Stella as just a friend. He appeared to be trying to play it cool with the both of them, which was probably good. Lincoln hadn\u2019t outright rejected her. Most likely he was just waiting for a chance to talk to her alone about what happened, which was probably what the note was meant for. Ronnie continued to ponder the issue until a solution presented itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to <i>Lincoln\u2019s</i> house to study. Perfect. That place was not for the faint of heart. Ronnie had a stressful enough time just hanging out and reading comics. Clyde was no doubt used to it, but Stella would be totally blindsided. Even if she knew what preds were like, actually meeting so many was a whole different matter. Ronnie imagined that the most likely scenario would be that Stella would still be Lincoln\u2019s friend, but would be thoroughly frightened away from any romantic prospects. All she had to do was nothing, and the problem would resolve itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ll be joining us, Ronnie Anne,\u201d Stella said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been a part of this friend group for a while, but never really got to know you. You always seemed super cool, so hopefully we can have fun hanging out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2026 Dammit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkip to the study date.<br>\r\nContinue the school day.<br>\r\nChange plans to a less crazy house.<br>\r\nSomething strange happens at school.</span></div></div>",

Lincoln and Clyde shared a seat, as always, leaving Ronnie and Stella to share a seat behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to a pred house before,\u201d Stella remarked. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve run into Lynn and Lucy a few times, right?\u201d Lincoln inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella pursed her lips and nodded. \u201cThey really liked licking me. Said I tasted exotic, but at least they were nice about it\u2026 I think. They were also super grabby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Take all of that, only multiplied by twenty,\u201d Lincoln stated flatly. \u201cI told mom that this is a study date, so things won\u2019t get too weird. However, I can promise that you\u2019ll definitely get licked a bunch, groped, and see a minimum of two people naked. One will be my sister Leni. She says she just \u2018forgets\u2019 to wear clothes, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s a secret nudist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere was that warning when you asked me over?\u201d Ronnie asked indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve only ever had Clyde over before and he\u2019s used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long as everyone brushes their teeth first, it\u2019s really not so bad,\u201d remarked the timid boy. \u201cAlso, turns out being in a belly is actually pretty great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella blushed. \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re with me, so no one\u2019s gonna eat you without permission. Oh, I forgot the flirting. How preds usually hunt is basically identical to flirting. I can\u2019t stop them as easily if all they\u2019re doing is using words to persuade you. That\u2019s kind of a gray area in the rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a five-second rule,\u201d Clyde spoke up. \u201cThis one time, Luan put her hand on my butt and wouldn\u2019t let go for five whole seconds. It was\u2026 actually not that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Stella and Ronnie asked together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Preds are overbearing and top of the food chain, but they\u2019re pretty nice about it. At least the Loud family is. I like to think of them as just extra huggy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded thankfully to Clyde for having his back on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stopped and the four disembarked. The outside of the Loud house was as messy as ever. With 11 kids, cleaning had to be done strategically to avoid exhaustion. Lincoln led the way inside, once more assuring the others that they\u2019d be safe, but that they should avoid any provocative actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Stella asked just as they assembled at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHH!\u201d the four cried out, huddling together for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy! What are you doing?\u201d Lincoln chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard the siren song of fate being tempted. I couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d Lucy answered. \u201cOh, is this a new friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this is Stella, my <i>friend</i>,\u201d Lincoln stressed, not noticing Ronnie\u2019s smirk. \u201cSpecifically she\u2019s my study buddy. We\u2019re all here to work on our fractions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou came here, to our house, to study?\u201d Lucy asked incredulously. Her point was made when an explosion came from Lisa\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay! It only took my third pinkie toe,\u201d informed the genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dads have a date night and don\u2019t want anyone home alone,\u201d Clyde informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying in a motel for a couple of days while the house is fumigated,\u201d Ronnie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m just curious. Preds are so interesting. I look forward to getting to know you.\u201d Stella extended a friendly hand to Lucy. \u201cWhat?\u201d She was distracted by the triple face palm and didn\u2019t realize what was happening until her fingers were already in the goth sister\u2019s mouth. Stella froze as the other girl\u2019s slimy tongue weaved between her fingers while its owner hummed as if suckling candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy let go of Stella with a wet pop, only to close the distance and get up in the taller girl\u2019s face. \u201cYou taste even prettier than you look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 have no response to that,\u201d Stella admitted as she shook her hand dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I messed up. I mean\u2026 Lincoln,\u201d Lucy stage whispered. \u201cLine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts tough work being a big brother,\u201d Lincoln sighed his defeat. \u201cThe \u2018you taste pretty\u2019 was a good opener. I\u2019ve heard Lori use that one a lot. Then use the environment. In this case, we\u2019re a study group and Stella is curious about preds. Work that into an \u2018I can teach you a lesson we\u2019ll both enjoy\u2019 kind of deal. Also your hands. Hold her in place so she knows who\u2019s in charge, but be gentle about it.\u201d An awkward silence followed as everyone stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d Ronnie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cI grew up with six older preds all teaching their juniors what\u2019s what. I couldn\u2019t not know even if I wanted to, which I don\u2019t. Wait\u2026\u201d Lincoln reflected on his words to make sure everything lined up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Lincoln. You\u2019re the best.\u201d Lucy kissed her brother\u2019s cheek before heading inside ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, who\u2019s grabbing my butt?\u201d Clyde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie screamed and started frantically shaking her hand. \u201cEw-ew-ew!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella grinned. \u201cPreds are fun. I can\u2019t wait to-\u201d Whatever she intended to say was blocked by three hands covering her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what I said about provocation and not doing it?\u201d asked Lincoln. \u201cWell, you\u2019re doing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSup little dudes,\u201d Luna greeted as she strode on past, stomach full and hanging down almost to her knees. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a porch party, you know who to call if you need some tunes.\u201d Luna caught Stella staring, particularly <i>where</i> she was staring, and shot her a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! Coming through!\u201d Leni announced, running headlong into the wall to the door\u2019s left. Her middle was also swollen with someone inside, though clearly, they were somewhere lower than her stomach. \u201cOwey. Oh, hey everyone. I\u2019d love to stay and say hi,\u201d she reached back and grabbed her bulbous backside, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got a bathroom emergency.\u201d Finally, she found her way to the door and rushed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori was next, laughing as she texted. Her eyes locked with Ronnie\u2019s and she quickly typed a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger girl\u2019s phone buzzed and she checked. \u2018Rooting for you. Love your future big sis\u2019, she silently read with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Luan came up. She was escorted by a frumpy middle-aged woman. \u201cHey, guys. This is Betsy. She\u2019s paying me mucho mullah to be the <i>butt</i> of my next joke. Ha-ha. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reactions of the kids ranged from annoyance to confusion, while Betsy was fighting not to start dancing with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and Lynn said that she\u2019s sorry she can\u2019t hang out today, but she\u2019s running her team through extra drills to prep for the next big game.\u201d With that kernel of knowledge delivered, Luan disappeared behind the door, along with her future oversized butt plug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me. Make way for the princess,\u201d Lola greeted dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln looked around. \u201cLola, where\u2019s Lana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I, her keeper?\u201d she asked irately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Basically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola rolled her eyes. \u201cShe got detention. Something about uniting all the class pets into an army to overthrow the school. I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t really paying attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned his exasperation. \u201cAgain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on. Lana\u2019s behind the class pets acting weird?\u201d Ronnie asked as Lola departed. \u201cNo wonder the spiders were marching all funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella awed, her mouth finally free. \u201cWhoa! Is that a pred power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s just my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShpeaking of shistersh, kindly move ashide elder shibling and food with feet,\u201d requested Lisa. \u201cI have a lot of experimenting to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grabbed her shoulder. \u201cHold on. We all <i>just</i> heard you upstairs. You caused an explosion and lost your third pinkie toe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s eyes darted around shiftily. \u201cThat musht have been your imagination. Now, if you\u2019ll pardon me, shcience awaitsh.\u201d And she ran inside like the devil\u2019s clone was at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde began counting off on his fingers. \u201cIncluding Lincoln, that\u2019s ten Louds accounted for. Only one left, but she\u2019s just an adorable baby. I doubt anything weird will happen there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Vanzilla pulled into the driveway. Lynn Sr. was at the wheel and stepped out first. When Rita existed from the other side, the van bounced from the change of weight. The amazon\u2019s head poked over the top as she came around front, sporting a belly even larger than herself. It was the sort of belly that would enter a room a full second before the rest of her, holding maybe three or four people, and it bounced with their movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to stop taking lunch requests at work,\u201d Rita groaned, hand on her lower back to hold her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, honey. We both know you love being this full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt home where I can sit,\u201d Rita corrected. \u201cLugging this much weight around is killing my lower back.\u201d As her husband escorted her up the porch, her youngest daughter poked her head out from between her enormous breasts and laughed hysterically. \u201cGlad someone\u2019s enjoying themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not the only one,\u201d Lynn Sr. added before giving Rita\u2019s rump a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair was so caught up in their lovey-dovey world that they didn\u2019t even notice the kids stepping aside as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow <i>that</i> accounts for all Loud preds,\u201d Clyde amended. \u201cSo, you guys ready to go?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The inside was as loud as usual with everyone having split up to do their own things. \u201cAlright, group up. Even with the rules, these women are basically animals. So stick close and hold hands until we reach my room. Got it?\u201d he asked while grabbing Ronnie\u2019s hand. Everyone nodded and linked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hugged the railing up the stairs to make way for things like Lola\u2019s car and a smelly disheveled stranger. On the second floor, they were treated to the sight of Leni having already stripped bare as she walked around. She didn\u2019t have any destination in mind. She was just walking in the nude for nudity\u2019s sake. Also, she had apparently taken care of her bathroom emergency and looked much more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys. I just made some room in my tummy, so who wants to jump on in?\u201d Leni opened wide and pointed into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks. My friends and I are just here to study.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe four of you in that cramped little room? You sure you wouldn\u2019t prefer-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Lincoln cut her off. \u201cThat\u2019d be even more cramped. That is, unless you <i>want</i> to also swallow our pencils, paper, and erasers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni blinked. \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d And she departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, guys. Let\u2019s hurry before-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud clamor came from Lisa\u2019s room. \u201cBack! Back, you fiend! In my handsh, even a lowly microshcope can be a deadly weapon. Now back, I shay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie frowned. \u201cShould we-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d Lincoln pulled on the chain of friends and hurried them into his room, thankfully without further incident, and closed the door. \u201cPhew!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella looked around the compact room. \u201cAlright, so where are we sitting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the host, Lincoln opted to sit on the floor while Ronnie got the desk, and Clyde and Stella shared the bed. Each did their own copy of the homework and called on Lincoln whenever they had a question. \u201cThis goes here. Try thinking of it like this.\u201d Ronnie asked for help far more than she actually needed, liking the way he would lean over her shoulder to explain each problem. Even if he had no idea what she was doing, she was still making the best of their situation. Then came the first knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, we need your help,\u201d Lucy said with Lola looking uncomfortable and only poking her head into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink twin began. \u201cSee, I was just practicing with Lucy\u2019s bust of-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe stole Edwin and shoved him into a lesser darkness,\u201d Lucy cut in irately to the confusion of the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is,\u201d Lola continued, \u201che\u2019s stuck and we need your help to get him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you get someone else to help you?\u201d moaned Lincoln. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe needs to relax, but she refuses to stop clenching,\u201d Lucy explained. \u201cI offered to eat her out, but she stubbornly insists that it has to be you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleeease!\u201d begged Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed his defeat. \u201cCan you guys hold up without me for a sec? I\u2019ve got some brother business to take care of.\u201d Everyone nodded and Lincoln followed the younger Louds to the twins\u2019 room. He\u2019d had his suspicions, but there was no need for elaboration when he spied the stone bust sticking out from the back of Lola\u2019s dress. \u201cA rock? You shoved a <i>rock</i> up your butt?\u201d asked Lincoln incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a granite statue,\u201d Lucy corrected. \u201cNow please, release him from his smelly coffin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded, picked Lola up, and set her on the edge of her bed. He hiked her dress up and pulled her panties down, exposing her smooth pussy. \u201cLucy, you go around and get a grip, but don\u2019t start pulling until Lola cums. She\u2019ll just clench before then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d Lucy took her position behind her junior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Lincoln pushed Lola\u2019s legs apart and pressed his face against her groin. He wasted no time in licking at her slit and plunging his tongue into ever-increasing depths. Lola cried out and wrapped herself bodily around Lincoln\u2019s head. Lincoln slurped up his younger sister\u2019s wetness and decided to help things along by offering his fingers for her to suckle. She forced his whole hand into her mouth and began suckling like it was a pacifier. As he worked, Lincoln also caught wind of Lucy moaning. No doubt she was touching herself in response to his actions, meaning that he\u2019d probably have to take care of her right after. For now, Lincoln just focused on swirling his tongue like he knew Lola liked until she gave out an extra loud cry. Lincoln shot a signal to Lucy with his free hand. Then he grabbed the blonde just as the goth started to pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh!\u201d Lola cried in pain just as she came. \u201cOwey. Did you have to be so rough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln stood, mouth full of his sister\u2019s jizz, hugged her, and locked lips with her. She pulled away at first but quickly melted into the embrace as her sex juices were shared between them. Lola was placated as Lincoln checked to make sure that Lucy was satisfied with Edwin. She gave him a thumbs-up as he ended the kiss, swallowing his share of sex juices. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you don\u2019t shove rocks up your butt. Especially not without lube,\u201d he lectured with a chuckle. \u201cI figured I\u2019d have to teach Lana this lesson\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis head was so big that I thought I could challenge myself. Then the stupid vampire had to go and-\u201d WHACK! \u201c-ow! What was that for?\u201d Lola tried to whirl around on the one who\u2019d just spanked her, but Lincoln held her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call Edwin stupid when you\u2019re the one who acted without thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy, be nice. You know Lola\u2019s sensitive down there right now. And Lola, you know she\u2019s right. Besides the whole stone thing, you shouldn\u2019t steal in general.\u201d His chastisement delivered, Lincoln opened his other arm and motioned Lucy to join in their group hug. \u201cSee? Isn\u2019t this so much nicer than fighting?\u201d The sisters grumbled their acceptance as he let them go. \u201cSo to save us all some trouble, how about some makeup sex?\u201d He indicated the tent in his pants, perking up both sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair tackled him and Lincoln only barely held his ground. They relieved him of his pants, took a moment to marvel at their favorite hunk of meat, and dove in. Wet slurps abounded. Lola prioritized his shaft while Lucy had her way with his balls. Lincoln set his hands on both their heads and bit his lower lip to keep himself quiet. After all the times they\u2019d sucked him off, even his younger sisters were pretty damn good at it. Their tongues felt so good rubbing across his skin. There were even points where they kissed around his penis. Lincoln held out for as long as he could, knowing how much his sisters enjoyed the process, but also to make sure an extra hard orgasm would keep him satisfied for a while. Then he felt the building pressure. \u201cC-close!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sisters abandoned their previous posts and moved out in front. Their mouths opened as their cheeks pressed together. Lincoln held onto their heads to keep the peace and ensure everyone got their fair share. When he finally came, it was directly into his beloved sisters\u2019 mouths. They swallowed their treats eagerly and even gave his penis a few cleaning licks. When all was settled, Lincoln pulled up his pants, wished his sisters well, and returned to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more he closed the door behind him and said, \u201cPhew! That was an ordeal. So, who\u2019s got some problems that don\u2019t involve statues in butts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A long period of uninterrupted studying followed with everyone pretending like they couldn\u2019t smell what had happened. Lincoln finished up his homework while making time for everyone else. When their sheets had been completed, they checked for any discrepancies and followed their work to see who had done things right or wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that went faster than expected,\u201d remarked Clyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I feel like I really understand this stuff now,\u201d agreed Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know where I\u2019m going the next time I have math issues,\u201d Ronnie finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rubbed the back of his head. \u201cI hadn\u2019t actually planned for us to finish this quickly. You guys want to play some video games or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the \u2018or something\u2019 want\u2019s in,\u201d Ronnie said just as the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d Leni greeted, still naked. \u201cI was just going for some refreshments. You want anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOJ for me. I could use some Vitamin C,\u201d Clyde requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else gave their orders until it was Stella\u2019s turn. \u201cM-milk,\u201d she said while ogling Leni\u2019s udders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was because she was a predator, but the often oblivious Leni always knew when someone was checking her out. She smiled at Stella and folded her arms under her chest to push her boobs out. \u201cWow, you sure look thirsty. Can you wait for the carton, or would you like some straight from the tap?\u201d She gave her left nipple a pinch for emphasis, although her point went over almost all of their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeni can make herself lactate,\u201d Lincoln explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a vore skill to turn some of what they eat into breast milk. Personally, I find Leni\u2019s milk to be a little too sweet, but you guys can have some if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ronnie weren\u2019t already sitting, she\u2019d have fallen over at the sheer audacity of Lincoln\u2019s offering. She would have said as much, were it not for Clyde and Stella walking past her and up to the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni gave a sweet smile as she knelt on one knee and pushed her boobs out for the kids to reach. They did so as if in a trance and pulled her nipples into their mouths. Leni sucked in a breath as if in pain, only to give a prolonged and contented sigh as the pair began to drink. She gave them half-lidded stares as they suckled away. \u201cSee, Linky. They like it,\u201d she argued while gently setting her hands on their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just a little too sweet for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you should drink it anyway. I make it just for my family, you know,\u201d Leni added indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful. Really. But I\u2019m just not up for breast milk right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni pouted. \u201cBet you\u2019d say yes if it was mom\u2019s breast milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s not fair. Mom\u2019s the more experienced pred, so of course, her milk would taste better. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get there someday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea, Linky, but it\u2019d be nicer if you just sucked on my boobies like your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it means that much to you, I guess I can try. Ronnie, you want some, too?\u201d Lincoln offered. \u201cIt\u2019s better for Leni if we keep things balanced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I mean\u2026 sure.\u201d Ronnie turned to the gigantic melons, feeling like she was being pulled into their gravity just by staring at them. She\u2019d never really had these kinds of feelings for other girls before, at least until she\u2019d come into this den of preds. The Loud ladies just had this way about them that drew people like her in. Prey loved predators, as weird as that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni gently pushed the first pair of kids aside to make way for the new pair. Clyde and Stella were still left in their trance-like states as Lincoln and Ronnie approached. Lincoln latched onto the nipple without hesitation, but Ronnie took a few extra seconds to regard the pretty pink nub. She wasn\u2019t too sure why she put her lips on it, but she had no regrets. The smooth skin of the areola felt wonderful against her tongue. Then the taste hit and Ronnie briefly lost balance. She looked over to Lincoln. He\u2019d put his hand on his sister\u2019s humongous breast and began kneading it as one might see in a hentai depiction of farm work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sweet warm liquid began pouring into her mouth, Ronnie felt compelled to mirror Lincoln\u2019s actions. Leni\u2019s breast was larger than her head and probably heavier. The smooth texture of the bosom was just as warm in the Latina\u2019s hands. Even if she wasn\u2019t trying to squeeze milk out, Ronnie imagined that she\u2019d still want to play around with Leni\u2019s sweater puppy. The smell was pungent, vaguely sweaty, but also enticing. Ronnie felt her whole body begin to warm from both the milk flowing down her gullet, and from something else. Eventually, the milk stopped flowing, but Ronnie kept trying to coax more out. Even after Lincoln stopped, she still kneaded the older girl\u2019s breast. With a kind chuckle, Leni gently pushed the girl off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody have enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s response was the most coherent of the bunch. \u201cYeah. That was actually much better this time. Good job, Leni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, thanks Linky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, please leave before Clyde gets a nosebleed all over my stuff\u2026 again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d And she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln,\u201d Stella said breathlessly. \u201cYour sister is\u2026 amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she could do this all along?\u201d Clyde added. \u201cWhy am I only hearing about this now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon guys. Chill out. I didn\u2019t tell you because I knew you\u2019d just make a big deal about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I would. Its breast milk that\u2019s basically on tap,\u201d Clyde argued. \u201cHold on. If Leni and your mom can do that, does that mean Lori\u2026?\u201d At Lincoln\u2019s nod, Clyde collapsed face-first to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. That was exactly what I was hoping to avoid,\u201d Lincoln grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella raised her hand. \u201cSo, this might seem a little awkward. We were talking about what you were helping your sisters with a bit ago, and\u2026 were you having sex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of. Does it count if it\u2019s just oral? For reasons that only make sense in this house, I needed to eat out my sister Lola to help her and Lucy,\u201d he explained nonchalantly. \u201cThen both of them gave me a blowjob in gratitude. It\u2019s just a thing that happens here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella\u2019s jaw looked ready to hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie wasn\u2019t far behind, but was still lucid. The subject needed to be changed. \u201cSo, uh, how about those video games?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. I got Lana and Lisa to fix up our old TV and move it in here for my games,\u201d Lincoln explained as he pulled the console out of a shelf. Grateful for the distraction from his sisters, he let them pick the game as they all started playing. Clyde was left to rest and reboot in peace as Lincoln sat between the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie was only half focused on the game as her eyes kept returning to Lincoln and Stella. Hanging out was a step up from a study date, but the prospect of a proper date seemed unlikely, so long as there were other people around. All she had to do was pick a day to get Lincoln out of the house and all to herself, without any preds or potential rivals. They\u2019d have to go somewhere far away so that no one could call on him for whatever reason. Maybe the park would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Stella began, \u201cI was wondering if you guys might want to hang out again sometime, but somewhere quieter? There\u2019s always stuff to do down at the park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d Lincoln agreed. \u201cI think Clyde said he has plans with his dads for the next few days, but they don\u2019t call me the man with the plan for nothing. We can work something out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2026 Dammit!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As was inevitable, eventually the group had to split up because one had to pee. Lincoln insisted that they all go with Stella for safety, but she was having none of it. Having people wait just outside the bathroom for her seemed too weird. Besides, the Loud sisters had all been pretty nice so far. She was confident that she could make it to the other end of the hall unscathed. The depths of her wrongness became apparent only a few seconds after leaving Lincoln\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Luna was leaning against the wall and looming tall over the elementary student. Her smirk was confident, her exposed midriff was trim, and her eyes were crawling up and down the younger girl\u2019s body. \u201cI saw you checkin\u2019 me out earlier,\u201d she said while rubbing her now flat stomach. \u201cCurious, aye? Well, I can\u2019t exactly blame ya. I <i>am</i> something else, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella couldn\u2019t move and the only words she could muster were gibberish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeni said she got you to suck on her boobs. Lucky. I still haven\u2019t figured that trick out, but I\u2019ve been told by some reliable sources that my boobs <i>are</i> pretty tasty.\u201d Luna bent over and pulled down her shirt, revealing that she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. \u201cBut I\u2019m always open to outside opinions, if ya catch my drift.\u201d She finished by blowing a kiss. When Stella only squeaked in response, Luna straightened back up, fearing she\u2019d gone too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops. Sorry, squirt. Guess I got carried away, heh-heh.\u201d Luna looked around, namely towards Lincoln\u2019s door. \u201cAw, man. If Lincoln sees you like this with me, he\u2019s gonna lay an egg.\u201d Luna grabbed Stella by the wrist and pulled her along into her and Luan\u2019s room, closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh. Looks like someone\u2019s Stella-ing one of Lincoln\u2019s friends. Hope he doesn\u2019t find out and go Lola on you.\u201d Luan laughed at her bad joke. She was lying on her bed, her middle swollen immensely from the woman making herself comfortable in the predator\u2019s colon. \u201cBut seriously, why\u2019s the new girl in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I thought I was just doing some playful flirting, ya know. But I think I went too far and broke her,\u201d Luna explained in a growing panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan rolled her eyes and hefted herself out of bed. The mattress creaked under her weight, as did the floor. The \u2018funny\u2019 Loud made for the unresponsive Stella, took a few moments to look her over, and then squished a whoopy cushion in her face. The loud flatulence snapped the Filipino out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what? How\u2019d I get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude,\u201d Luna said in awe of her younger sister\u2019s skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was just the wakeup. You still gotta make sure she doesn\u2019t tattle,\u201d Luan reminded before hopping back onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Uh, so Stella,\u201d Luna began awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, sorry for coming on so strong just now. That was inappropriate and I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Then she knelt on one knee and set her hands on the young girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Lincoln. He\u2019ll blow things out of proportion, tell mom, and she\u2019ll cork me. I can\u2019t do the cork again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey. Chill. I\u2019m still not 100% on what\u2019s going on here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cYeah. See, the thing is that I maybe, kinda, sorta\u2026 overwhelmed you with my sexiness.\u201d Luan snorted. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s totally how it works!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d asked Stella, still a little dazed. Then her body sent her a signal. \u201cAlso, I have to pee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll escort you.\u201d Luna stood and set her hand on the young girl\u2019s back and gently pushed her out the door and across the hall. Stella didn\u2019t even have time to protest before they made it to the bathroom and the door was closed. \u201cOkay. You can do your business while I watch over you. Cool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella made a consternated expression. \u201cYou want me to pee\u2026 while you watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m a pred. You ain\u2019t got a thing I haven\u2019t seen on hundreds of other prey. Though I\u2019ll admit, you\u2019re definitely on the cute end of the spectrum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella blushed and looked away. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourse I am. Don\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d Luna leaned down to steal a lick of Stella\u2019s cheek. \u201cMmh. Yeah. If you volunteered, I\u2019d definitely take my time savoring you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou w-w-want to e-eat me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gave the girl a \u2018are you serious?\u2019 look. \u201cDude, I\u2019m a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to eating girls. I can usually tell taste just by lookin\u2019. And believe me, you\u2019d make a most excellent little snack.\u201d She licked her lips for emphasis, only to freeze when Stella started babbling again. \u201cAw, man! Not again!\u201d Thinking quick, Luna grabbed a cup of water from the sink and threw the liquid in Stella\u2019s face, waking her up. \u201cPhew. I really need to stop doing that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop doing\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook dude, here\u2019s the thing. Some prey have more of a thing for preds than others. My girlfriend, Sam, is a total belly slut. Her idea of a good time is just hangin\u2019 out inside me all day. And you\u2026 I think you\u2019re similar. You\u2019ve got a thing for preds. Nothin\u2019 wrong with that. It\u2019s just part of who you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella frowned. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure I get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I\u2019d love to explain sometime, but you\u2019ve gotta hurry before Lincoln gets suspicious. Later tonight, how about you message me on FindAPred and we can talk more. I can put you in touch with Sam to see if you\u2019ve got the same interests. Heck, if you\u2019re up for it, I\u2019ll even give you a discount if you want to volunteer.\u201d Seeing Stella start to look overwhelmed again, Luna took a step back. \u201cHey, sorry, little dudette. I\u2019m handling this all wrong. You\u2019re awakening to something beautiful and I don\u2019t want to ruin it. If you were a stranger, I\u2019d probably just take you somewhere private and show you just how great it is to be with a pred. But since you\u2019re Lincoln\u2019s friend, I guess I gotta take things a bit more gently. So for right now, how about you tell me what you want. Anything. You want me to leave, maybe talk some more, or maybe-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiss me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Say what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiss me. I don\u2019t know why, but I really want to kiss you right now. I want to feel your lips and\u2026 and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna set a shushing finger on the girl\u2019s lips. \u201cJust kissing for now,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI get the feeling you\u2019re going to be a repeat customer, so the first sample is free. Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella nodded quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna got on both knees and pulled the smaller girl into her warm embrace. Her boobs were nothing compared to her elder sisters, but they still squished adoringly around Stella. Luna turned the girl\u2019s chin up with her finger and smiled at her awe. This kid definitely had it bad for preds and her expression was flooded with infatuation. The musical Loud had absolute power over her prey, who appeared ready to accept whatever was done with her. Luna wished that she could take this girl to her room, strip her down, and just play for a couple of hours. By the time Stella went down her throat, she\u2019d be one of the most sexually knowledgeable prey kids in her school, second only to Lincoln. But that would have to wait for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Luna leaned down and gently pressed her lips to Stella\u2019s. The small Filipino was soft but inexperienced. Luna laughed at how the little girl tried to keep up with her movements, only to fumble. The pred decided to be merciful and just dominate her prey\u2019s mouth, pushing past the lips with her tongue and having her way. Stella had asked for it, so they weren\u2019t technically breaking any rules. Luna hummed in delight at the little girl\u2019s taste as Stella did the same. This was probably her first real kiss, and she was into it. Mindful not to overwhelm the potential future belly slut, Luna broke off the kiss. She helped Stella snap back to consciousness, only to giggle when the girl was a lot less reserved about peeing in front of her. Luna then escorted the girl back to Lincoln\u2019s room with him none the wiser.</span></div></div>",

And since she was feeling too awkward to trust her filter, maybe getting into that same headspace and speaking honestly would get her somewhere this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, what\u2019s sex like?\u201d Ronnie wondered if she could outsource the job of having ideas, because clearly, she was terrible at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, for his part, didn\u2019t even break his stride as he continued mashing buttons. \u201cThere some reason you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust curious, I guess. Bobby and Lori go at it almost nonstop whenever she visits, and I assume it\u2019s the same when he comes here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably.\u201d Lincoln lied by omission, reasonably certain that the stuff those two did here was far wilder than what they did at the Santiago house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you have sex with your sisters a lot,\u201d Ronnie continued. \u201cPeople keep saying that I\u2019m too young for that sort of thing, but they also say that predators have their own standards. You\u2019re not a predator, yet you still get to do a lot of the stuff they can. I\u2019d like to know what that\u2019s like,\u201d she admitted, hoping her envy wasn\u2019t too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln paused the game and leaned against the desk. \u201cYou know the mechanics, right? The penis and the vagina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Ronnie choked out. She dared not say too much, lest she look like an immature child before the more experienced boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the start of it. They don\u2019t really teach in sex ed just how warm the other person\u2019s body is. Then there\u2019s the smell, the way her breath blows your hair, and those big, strong arms wrapped around your back.\u201d Lincoln closed his eyes to better lose himself in the fantasy. \u201cPicture the biggest, most loving hug you get after a really rough day, and\u2026\u201d He trailed off. \u201cHeh-heh. I\u2019m not really sure where to go from there. I only really know the guy\u2019s perspective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me about it,\u201d Ronnie urged, cheeks red and body hot. \u201cWhat was your first time like? Who was it with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln laughed. \u201cIt was way back on my eighth birthday. I\u2019d been fooling around with my sisters a lot, mostly mouth and hand stuff, so I knew a little, but I hadn\u2019t actually had proper sex.\u201d He snickered. \u201cGranted, I had started cumming a lot when going down someone\u2019s throat, but that apparently didn\u2019t count.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Ronnie scooted closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember there was a lot of debate over who\u2019d be my first. Lynn said that she was closest to my age, Leni said that she gave the best hugs, and so on. Ultimately, mom stepped up and said it was her responsibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie gulped. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. She\u2019s too big and she\u2019d probably crush me. Well, she\u2019s a lot softer than she looks, so the worst I ever get is mild bruising.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually thinking that maybe she\u2019d be too good,\u201d Ronnie elaborated. \u201cIt\u2019s like all your sisters have tiers on what they can do, but you\u2019re mom\u2019s at the very top. After her, can anyone really compare?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln snickered. \u201cMy sisters tried arguing that, too. Mom just said that she\u2019d had plenty of practice fucking little kids my age, so she knew how to tone it down. So they stripped me down, took me to mom and dad\u2019s bed, and left me alone with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. I would\u2019ve thought they\u2019d make a big show about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, they wanted to. But they all agreed that my first time needed to be personal, which just couldn\u2019t happen with an audience. Anyway, I\u2019d been naked with mom plenty of times before, but I think that was the first time I\u2019d noticed just how pretty she was. Her body was like a valley of sexy hills that I just wanted to climb on. So she lay down on her back, spread her legs apart, and invited me over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d Ronnie scooted even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, I\u2019d gotten plenty of practice with my hands and mouth by then. I started with teasing mom\u2019s pussy to see what sounds she made.\u201d Lincoln laughed. \u201cHer thighs started to twitch, and I remember thinking just how big they were. If she closed her legs on me, I\u2019d basically be invisible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie also chuckled at the amusing image of the amazon concealing Lincoln within her superhuman thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I just kept playing with her because it\u2019s what I knew how to do. She came and I drank it up. A pred\u2019s sex juices taste almost as good as their milk,\u201d he added. \u201cAnyway, my erection\u2026\u201d He paused to check with Ronnie, who nodded that she was still following along. \u201cMy erection was so hard that it was kinda painful. My body knew what it wanted, but my head was still slow to catch up. I\u2019d seen my family go at it with each other and their food all my life, so it wasn\u2019t like I was ignorant, but even with an audience of one, I still had performance anxiety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you handle it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom did,\u201d was Lincoln\u2019s simple reply. \u201cShe put her hand on my cheek, told me she loved me, and to do my best. So I did. I put my hands on her thighs, got everything lined up, and started to push.\u201d The boy bit his lip at the memory. \u201cMom made herself pretty tight that day. She\u2019d taken whole bodies up there before, but she knew how to make sure I had an \u2018authentic\u2019 first time. It was like the smell of her arousal was flooding my brain and driving me forward. She was so wet. I mean, I knew she\u2019d be wet. I\u2019d gone inside her enough times to know, but there was something different when it\u2019s just sex. It\u2019s like the sensations are all concentrated into one spot. Like, instead of all of her loving all of me, it\u2019s just my cock and her pussy loving each other\u2026 if that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie licked her lips and vowed to start doing research the moment she got home. \u201cI th-think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was good that I was only on my knees, cuz my legs got all wobbly just a few seconds in,\u201d Lincoln recounted. \u201cI fell forward and rested my face just above mom\u2019s pubes. She kept cheering me on and telling me how good I was doing. My hips just moved on their own, humping in and out, in and out, and then I came like never before. I\u2019d cum in my mom and sisters\u2019 mouths before, but that first time\u2026\u201d He whistled. \u201cAll those times they said mouth and throat stuff doesn\u2019t count; well, it finally made sense. There\u2019s really nothing like busting a nut in a woman\u2019s pussy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially your mom, huh?\u201d Ronnie\u2019s hands were behind her back. To keep them occupied, she was pinching herself so hard that she feared drawing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, oblivious to her plight, laughed in good humor. \u201cYou can say that again. After that, it was pretty much open season on my penis. Sisters started sitting on my pelvis instead of just my face. Things calmed down a little after that first month, but boy what a month!  All my older sisters were on me around the clock. If it wasn\u2019t sex or vore, it was post-sex or vore cuddling. Every one of them taught me so much about how to please a woman. It helped that I was an eager student,\u201d he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral questions swirled in Ronnie\u2019s head as she regarded Lincoln. The more she heard, the more she wanted him. However, he was more experienced than she could even imagine. Was she even in his league? How could a preteen virgin even compare to all of his lovely sisters? And then there was his mom\u2026 Putting that mountain of a woman aside, Ronnie was facing some pretty steep hurdles. Even so, she\u2019d never been the sort to be easily dissuaded. All she had to do was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys!\u201d Stella greeted cheerily as she opened the door. \u201cSorry for being late. Things got\u2026 tricky, but its fine now.\u201d Her tone was dismissive as she retook her spot and picked up her controller. \u201cOh cool. You unlocked the new character.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lincoln and Stella exchanged pleasantries, Ronnie weighed the ramifications of hurling either Lincoln, Stella, or herself out the window.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in Lincoln\u2019s room, Stella seemed to have acquired newfound energy as she absolutely crushed the others in the game. Something had clearly happened on her trip to the bathroom. Lincoln had a good idea of what, but since Stella didn\u2019t appear bothered, there wasn\u2019t much he could do about it. She\u2019d probably just deny if he pressed the issue. Whoever had gotten to her had done a good job of winning her over. On the face of it, Lincoln was fine with that. He liked the idea of his friends getting along with his sisters and embracing vore. He only wished that it had happened with his supervision in accordance with the house rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of supervision, Lincoln had been holding it in for a while. Before she knew what she was saying, Ronnie volunteered to be his escort. The trip down the hall was largely uneventful. Making things easier was that most of the sisters were sticking to their rooms to do whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor better or worse, \u2018whatever\u2019 was elaborated on when the pair ventured past Lynn and Lucy\u2019s room. Leni was lying on the goth\u2019s bed, face down and ass up while the pale girl went to town on her nether regions. Both girls were naked. The older blonde wasn\u2019t quiet about it, either. Ronnie froze in her tracks to peek through the door and yanked Lincoln back to join her. Lucy didn\u2019t have as much volume, but she was very enthusiastic in her licking. Leni just grew louder and louder until she cried out at the top of her lungs. As Lucy\u2019s licking grew more urgent, an impatient Leni grabbed the goth\u2019s head and shoved her face in. Lucy didn\u2019t put up a fight as her head was engulfed by her older sister\u2019s pussy, though her hands did move up to start fiddling with the blonde\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln yanked Ronnie to resume their journey. She almost resisted, but didn\u2019t want him to think that she was a pervert. Then, as soon as the sisters were out of sight, she wondered if Lincoln even had a concept of perversion. The answer to that question came from Luna and Luan\u2019s room. The musician and comedian were sixty-nining on the bottom bunk. Luan was on bottom because she still had a person inside her, meaning that Luna was draped over her younger sister\u2019s bloated belly. Lincoln had even less patience this time around and pulled Ronnie along. At least Lori had the decency to keep her door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in the bathroom, Lincoln finally realized the awkwardness of their predicament. It was too dangerous to send Ronnie out there alone, but having her stay here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries.\u201d She pulled out some headphones from her hoodie and connected them to her phone. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with a plan,\u201d she said cheekily before turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled gratefully, hurried through his business, and washed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Ronnie began. \u201cAbout what we were discussing earlier. Is there, like, a place or a way that you prefer to, ya know, do it?\u201d Whatever was up with her mouth, she needed either a brain surgeon or some heavy therapy to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Usually, I just give my mom or sisters whatever they\u2019re craving at the moment. You saw them fooling around with each other, but I\u2019m like the designated itch scratcher around here,\u201d Lincoln informed proudly. \u201cIf Lynn needs her butt fucked before a big game, I\u2019m in. If Luna wants me to eat her out while she video chats with Sam, I\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering about Sam, actually. Bobby said some stuff and it sounds like you two are together\u2026 often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded. \u201cSure are. Sam\u2019s a lot of fun. Luna likes to drag me along on their dates sometimes. In the end, she scarfs us both down and we go at it inside her. Hmm. Now that I think about it, I\u2019d have to say inside someone is my favorite place to have sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda labor-intensive, I know,\u201d Lincoln added, thinking he understood the issue Ronnie had with his preference. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain if you\u2019ve never been inside someone before. A belly, vagina, or even an ass is super cozy. And when you\u2019re in there with someone else, there\u2019s basically nowhere to go but into each other\u2019s arms.\u201d He snickered. \u201cKinda cheesy, I know, but it\u2019s great. Whether it\u2019s Sam or someone else, we hump, cuddle, and will usually drift off to sleep while listening to our eater\u2019s body. Not only is it some of the best sex I\u2019ve had, but it\u2019s also some of the best sleep. I always wake up rested and ready for whatever life throws at me. Though that\u2019s partially thanks to the, well, messy release.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cPred toilets aren\u2019t exactly comfy, but they do the job of getting you clean and waking you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s house was only a few blocks from Lincoln\u2019s, but it might as well have been in a different country for all the weird stuff the boy lived with. Yet Ronnie found herself wanting to learn more. Lincoln\u2019s world was super weird and intimidating, but just hearing about it was stirring things inside of her; things she didn\u2019t know existed until now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Lisa\u2019s room, while the aspiring scientist was disposing of the evid-er-harmlessly tinkering, she distracted herself with the audio from the bathroom. Normally she\u2019d save all recordings and use an algorithm to sift through to the parts relevant for her studies. However, since the alert informed her that Ronnie <i>and</i> Lincoln were simultaneously present in the lavatory, she shamefully caved into her primitive craving for juicy drama. Most of what was said went over her head. However, according to the AI she\u2019d built just for such occasions, Ronnie\u2019s inquiry into Lincoln\u2019s sex life was a good sign. That is to say that it potentially progressed events to the desirable outcome of Lincoln getting a girlfriend, and said girlfriend being welcomed into the family, whereupon she\u2019d be made available for frequent consumption by the Loud preds. This would include herself, once she was big enough. But in the meantime, there was the short term gratification of lording her freshly acquired gossip over her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie stuck her hands into her pockets, kicked at the floor, and took a breath in preparation for this next question. \u201cLincoln. Apart from your family or\u2026 food, have you ever\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver thought about being with someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie would have face-palmed, but even she had trouble following her words. Maybe this was jumping the gun a little, anyway. <i>Normal</i> relationships didn\u2019t typically start with sex, right? They did regular couple stuff, like what was shown on TV. \u201cDifferent topic. What would you say to you and me getting a milkshake sometime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds fun. If we wake up Clyde, then the four of us can-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not the four of us,\u201d Ronnie cut in. \u201cJust the <i>two</i> of us, alone, without anyone else,\u201d her cheeks turned a soft shade of red as she finished, \u201ctogether.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, some might say that Lincoln had selective vision when it came to relationships outside his family. However, after a few seconds of processing, even he wasn\u2019t so oblivious as to miss what Ronnie was getting at. \u201cOh? Oh. OH!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 You know what, forget it. This wasn\u2019t a-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThursday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe already made plans for the park tomorrow, but I\u2019m free Thursday.\u201d At that moment, Lincoln became very mindful of his sweaty pits and how they might have smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we get milkshakes and just see where the day takes us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cI guess. I\u2019ve never been on a date before, so we might as well do trial and error.\u201d Then he felt a chill run up his spine. \u201cJust one thing. Don\u2019t, under any circumstances, tell Bobby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if you tell him, he\u2019ll tell Lori. And if he tells Lori, then we\u2019re going to have \u2018chaperones\u2019,\u201d he said with air quotes and gestured at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. Fair point,\u201d Ronnie conceded. \u201cSo\u2026 Thursday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThursday,\u201d Lincoln agreed. And they returned to his room, never suspecting all who had eavesdropped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the afternoon went by relatively quietly. Clyde eventually woke up, only to need to head home for dinner. Stella also left, although not before sharing a meaningful look with Luna. Ronnie almost asked to stay with the Louds instead of going back to the motel, but reasoned that she ought to pace herself. The Louds were a cunning and perceptive bunch. If she let something slip too soon, the preds would never allow her or Lincoln to hear the end of it. For now, they just needed to take things slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad that the sisters had plans of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, mom needs you,\u201d Luan called from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, Lincoln obeyed. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. Why didn\u2019t mom call me herself?\u201d He wondered aloud as he descended the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s see here. My homework\u2019s done, I\u2019m caught up on chores, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten any promises. Hmm. I wonder what she\u2026 wants.\u201d Lincoln came to a dead stop halfway down the stairs and gawked at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was sitting in her recliner in the living room, leaning back and looking very relaxed. So relaxed, in fact, that her pants were unbuttoned and her hand had slipped down the front. She was masturbating openly for all to see. Despite her rule that her kids had to use each other to deal with sexual urges, Rita was flaunting her privilege as the alpha female of the house. Then again, she was probably going off the technicality currently wedged in her mouth. It was someone\u2019s ass, and a girl\u2019s by the look of it. She had olive skin and was around Lincoln\u2019s age. All features beyond her rump were concealed behind Rita\u2019s suckling lips. Lincoln reasoned that the girl\u2019s knees had been pulled to her chest so that only her tight little ass was sticking out. Upon seeing her son, Rita smiled around her mouthful and beckoned him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough nervous, Lincoln swallowed and obeyed. Knowing his mom, it wasn\u2019t too hard to guess what she wanted. Rita patted her lap for her son to ascend, so he did. Now he stood on eye level with the underage booty. The ass cheeks were rather plump, but her position had spread them wide apart. Her anus was a soft shade of pink and her little slit glistened in the fluorescent light. Rita moaned all the while as drool dribbled out around the girl\u2019s backside. Lincoln must have been taking too long with his pseudo staring contest with the rear because someone got impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust fuck her already,\u201d Luan blurted, startling Lincoln to her existence. She was sitting on the couch, texting, and had slightly reddened cheeks; most likely the result of their mom\u2019s delighted moans. \u201cShe wants her food to have a cream filling, so give it to her already.\u201d The smaller pred sounded flustered as she continued texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita made an \u201cMmmh\u201d sound of confirmation and tenderly stroked her fingers along the girl\u2019s left butt cheek. Muffled cries came from Rita\u2019s throat as the butt wiggled around, but there were no signs of movement further in. Rita was a top tier predator and her throat muscles were too strong. Lincoln couldn\u2019t even tell if the girl\u2019s sounds were in protest or begging for more. It didn\u2019t really matter either way at this point. This girl, whoever she was, was going into Rita\u2019s tummy, and that was that. Whether or not she\u2019d be digested wasn\u2019t Lincoln\u2019s business; though it seemed that she\u2019d already worked through her earlier meal. What mattered to the boy was pleasing his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln unzipped his pants and whipped his cock out, already at full mast. To his eldest sisters and mother, he was pretty small. But to this girl, he\u2019d likely be among the biggest she\u2019d ever had, or possibly ever will again. Just thinking about the twisted reality that this might be this girl\u2019s first and last cock gave the boy a perverse kind of arousal. His shaft almost painfully erect, he cupped his hands around the girl\u2019s butt cheeks and gave them an experimental squeeze. Seeing his mom\u2019s expectant gaze, he understood that she wanted narration. \u201cTh-they\u2019re pretty soft and warm. She must\u2019ve been quite the eater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita nodded, causing Lincoln\u2019s hands to follow her head movements. The alpha predator\u2019s large hand reached around Lincoln\u2019s back, slipped into his pants, and took hold of his rear with a playful squeeze. The boy squeaked, despite seeing this coming, which made Rita titter around her mouthful. She made a sound with a questioning inflection, to which Lincoln nodded and Rita then lowered her head. From the right angle, it might have looked like she was sucking her son off, but the truth was much more perverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the heat of the girl\u2019s moist nether lips against his groin, Lincoln adjusted his grip to try hot-dogging himself. The angle made it a bit awkward and he had to lean back a ways, but his mom seemed to like the more urgent cries that came from her widened throat. Lincoln eventually conceded that foreplay wasn\u2019t really feasible here and decided to take the plunge. \u201cOh f-fuck!\u201d he blurted as his lower head sunk into her little slit. With all eyes upon him, Lincoln figured he ought to explain himself. \u201cShe\u2019s just, uh, really tight, and a lot wet. You must\u2019ve been playing with her for a while if she\u2019s this turned on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita gave a single nod and extended her large tongue under the girl to steal a lick of her son\u2019s balls, making him shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Um, here goes.\u201d Careful so as not to hurt her, Lincoln inserted the rest of his shaft up the girl\u2019s twat. He groaned as more and more of him disappeared past her nether lips, and coincidently between his mother\u2019s lips as well. \u201cShe\u2019s really tight, but she\u2019s not clamping,\u201d laughed Lincoln. \u201cLooks like she wants this as much as you <i>do</i>!\u201d he yelped when his mom pinched his rump. \u201cR-right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sank all the way to his base. \u201cAhh. I feel her pulse on my cock,\u201d he groaned, giving them both time to adjust. He started rotating his hips without pulling out, making the girl tremble and her cute anus twitch. \u201cI\u2019m gonna start moving now,\u201d he said, wondering if the girl could even hear him. He began with a slow extraction and a slightly quicker insertion. Both acts made wet and lewd sounds to compliment Rita\u2019s lustful moans. His hands kneaded the girl\u2019s plump cheeks and he quickened his pace. He\u2019d fucked plenty of pussies in his short life, so he knew how to make things last, but the wet slaps against this little girl\u2019s ass combined with his mom\u2019s even more erotic sounds were pushing him to the brink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Rita was watching her son the entire time. She playfully fluttered her bedroom eyes and moaned even louder each time they made eye contact. He made the cutest faces when he was fucking and he was such a dutiful son to improve her food like this. The girl was wiggling exquisitely in her maw as her tongue lapped over the undeveloped breasts and belly. The only downside was all the excess drool spilling onto her clothes, but that was a small price to pay. She could always follow Leni\u2019s example and walk around the house naked. That could lead to all kinds of teasing fun, but that would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-close,\u201d Lincoln warned. His fingers dug roughly into the supple cheeks and his rhythm intensified. He could also feel his mother\u2019s groping matching his pace while her other hand seemed to do the same in her pants. Lincoln kept pounding, feeling the pressure in his core build and build, until suddenly the girl\u2019s pussy was\u2026 taken away? The girl\u2019s pussy had been pulled deeper into the maw and out of his reach. The boy was left confused for less than a second before his mom\u2019s familiar lips and tongue closed in to keep his cock from feeling cold or neglected. Quickly resuming his rhythm, Lincoln humped directly into his mom\u2019s mouth until his seed erupted forth. Rita\u2019s tongue constricted around his member like a slimy snake, squeezing him for every last drop. It was only thanks to her groping hand that her son didn\u2019t fall when his legs gave out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita casually suckled her son\u2019s cock and mixed it with the girl\u2019s own orgasm into something quite divine. Then, with a single mighty swallow, her food was pulled down into her powerful esophagus and into her belly, where all food belonged. Even after his orgasm petered out, Rita held her son in place and continued suckling for another minute or so. When she\u2019d decided she\u2019d had enough, she released his prick with a wet pop and a satisfied \u201cAhh.\u201d She made sure to open wide so that her son could see well into her ravenous yet clean maw, and then giggle when his limp noodle twitched with new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see, sweetie?\u201d Before Lincoln could answer, Rita pulled up and planted a brief kiss on his lips. \u201cThanks for seasoning my food, sweetie. Normally your father would, but he had a meeting with some investors. Still, I don\u2019t consider it a loss,\u201d she whispered in a husky sensual voice.</span></div></div>",

Therefore,\u201d she banged her shoe against her dresser like a gavel, \u201cI hereby call this emergency secret sibling meeting to order. Our topic tonight: Lincoln and Ronnie Anne as a possible couple. So let\u2019s get the big issue out of the way, first. All in favor, raise your hand.\u201d Lori waited to count and checked her phone. \u201cLuan says yes, bringing out total to\u2026 eight? All opposed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoopoo,\u201d griped Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, sorry dudes,\u201d added Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re dealing with this now,\u201d Lori began. \u201cNot to be confrontational, but what is your problem with Ronnie Anne? She\u2019s literally going to be our sister as soon as Bobby and I get married, so why not speed things along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, chill out. I don\u2019t really have a problem with her. She\u2019s a little stiff, but she\u2019s fine,\u201d explained Luna. \u201cI just think that there might be someone better for our li\u2019l bro. Like, for example, Stella.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInquisitive murmurs ran through the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s posturing shifted from aggressive to curious. \u201cExplain yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna recounted the events in the hall and her theory about the Filipino girl. \u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 you, dudes. She\u2019s totally a belly slut in the making. Lincoln needs someone who embraces preds. I just happen to think that Stella is the better pick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was one of the first to suckle my boobs,\u201d informed Leni. \u201cLinky and Ronnie Anne didn\u2019t want to at first, but Stella and Clyde just came right up and started drinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019sh one point for Shtella,\u201d stated Lisa after pulling out a whiteboard and setting score columns for each girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckled. \u201cHell yeah. She\u2019s already bein\u2019 drawn in. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she applied as a volunteer before the end of the month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean a volunteer for <i>you</i>,\u201d accused Lola. \u201cClearly you\u2019re showing unwarranted favoritism to the new girl just because she might let you eat her first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Lola\u2019s got a point,\u201d agreed Lynn. \u201cWe agreed to share our dates with whoever wants them. It shouldn\u2019t matter who gets her first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDudes, I\u2019m tellin\u2019 ya, that ain\u2019t it. Stella\u2019s a hardcore prey, just like Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA willingnessh to indulge in vore is definitely a plush. However, Lincoln ish not a pred. It shtandsh to reashon that Shtella would be more attracted to any of ush than him. Shtella, if she hash any feelingsh for Lincoln at all, which ish shtill up for debate, would merely be ushing our brother to get to ush. The bashish for a long term relationship, thish ish not,\u201d Lisa summarized before erasing Stella\u2019s point. \u201cBy contrasht, Ronnie Anne already likesh Lincoln enough that she ashked him out for milkshakesh.\u201d She made her point by putting a mark in Ronnie\u2019s column.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smiled victoriously, but decided that there was still room for compromise. \u201cFor now, Ronnie Anne will be our primary focus. We can tone down the flirting to help her adjust to us. I can also act as her new big sis and give her some pointers whenever I visit Bubu-B-I mean Bobby.\u201d She turned to a dejected Luna. \u201cLikewise, you are free to coach Stella in whatever way you like. She can be Lincoln\u2019s second girlfriend, or you can keep her for yourself. So long as you don\u2019t compromise our plans with Ronnie Anne, we can all get what we want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot, sis,\u201d cheered Luna. \u201cThis is gonna be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck yeah, it is!\u201d Lana pumped her fist. \u201cTwo new girlfriends means two new perma-meals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn scoffed. \u201cLike you could fit either of them inside you, least of all the tall one. Nope.\u201d She pointed two thumbs at herself. \u201cThat food\u2019s going straight to-HRMMH!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExecuting a perfect spinning backflip, Lola launched herself through the air and wedged her butt firmly into Lynn\u2019s mouth. \u201cLincoln. The last word of that sentence was Lincoln, I presume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell said, Lola,\u201d approved Lori. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Stella\u2019s status is still undecided, but Ronnie Anne provisionally belongs to Lincoln. When she\u2019s his for sure, she can be shared just like Bobby and Sam, but only with permission. That means <i>no</i> date snatching.\u201d Lori\u2019s phone buzzed. She checked it and groaned. \u201cUgh. Luan just made a pun about snatches. How\u2019d she know we were talking about that?\u201d Lori blinked in realization. \u201cMeeting on hold. Everyone, check for bugs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! Bugs? Ew-ew-ew!\u201d Leni jumped on the bed and performed a hypnotic dance of terror. The hypnotic part was how her feminine assets bounced around. \u201cEw-ew-OW!\u201d She rubbed where something had stung her butt cheek. \u201cGross! I think the bug bit me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it,\u201d Lana offered after plucking something from Leni\u2019s ass. It was a tiny microphone decorated to look like a clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell played, Luan. I can respect a savvy tactician,\u201d Lola praised, only to whack Lynn across the head. \u201cHey, no chewing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. Meeting resumed,\u201d Lori declared after taking the \u2018bug\u2019 and tossing it out the window. \u201cSo we\u2019re all agreed. We shall do what we can to help Lincoln and Ronnie Anne get together. It\u2019s been a bumpy road for these two, and Lincoln\u2019s love life in general. However, I believe we\u2019ve all learned from past mistakes. We have a much better grasp of how far is too far, Lynn and Luna.\u201d Both girls flinched. \u201cWe need to approach this matter delicately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleh!\u201d Lynn finally spat Lola out. \u201cScrew that! Lincoln\u2019s way too passive. Maybe that\u2019s our fault for being too pushy, but it\u2019s the truth. He\u2019s never gonna do anything unless someone else initiates. So I say that someone ought to be us. Let\u2019s just toss those two in someone\u2019s belly until they get all lovey-dovey, or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpoken like someone who\u2019s never been on a single date,\u201d Lori said in bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on. That might not be so bad,\u201d Leni spoke up. \u201cLincoln <i>does</i> like girls who can take charge. Lori, maybe you should try pushing Ronnie Anne to be more assertive without being mean about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not a bad idea,\u201d Lori admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonally, I admire the way Lincoln becomes much more assertive when defending his friends from us. No doubt Ronnie Anne also appreciated his coming to her defense. As such, we should also help bring out Lincoln\u2019s chivalrous side. Make him a prince worthy of his princess. We need to consider her wants as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd another good point from Lola,\u201d added Lori. \u201cHmm. Looks like most of the work for hitching these two will be on me since I\u2019m the only one with a reason to visit the Santiagos. We should still coordinate our strategies so we don\u2019t step on each other\u2019s feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Lynn,\u201d chided Leni. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you have to wear your running shoes inside. Those things hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that kind of foot stepping,\u201d Lori corrected in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy raised her hand. \u201cOn a related note, I vote we start having more belly sex. Lincoln made some good points, but I also like cuddling in the dark.\u201d Her words were met with a round of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori had to slam her shoe to regain order. \u201cOkay, fine. A little off-topic, but a fair request. Those of us with stronger stomachs will make an effort to start eating the rest of you in pairs more often.\u201d Everyone cheered. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re all in agreement.\u201d Lori\u2019s phone buzzed again. \u201cOh, and good timing. Looks like mom\u2019s just about done with Lincoln.\u201d She turned the phone around for everyone to see, leading to reactions that ranged from snickers, to nods of approval, and even Lynn\u2019s panting with desire. With a few final words shared, the secret meeting adjourned, and everyone dispersed to set their plan in motion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wednesday morning had come as usual, more or less. The Loud house was as loud as ever, especially at breakfast. It was bacon and eggs today. However, almost all of the preds were eating elementary girls. Whether it was Lucy\u2019s one or Rita\u2019s eight, the commonality was undeniable. Lincoln couldn\u2019t help but be suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s some coincidence, everyone eating young girls around the same age,\u201d Lincoln remarked between bites. \u201cIs there some pred holiday I don\u2019t know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Linky,\u201d dismissed Lola as she demonstrated ladylike grace by shoveling food down her gullet with nary a chew. \u201cYou brought a couple of pretty young girls over, so now we\u2019ve all got a hankering for pretty young girls. I\u2019m just bummed there was no one in our range willing to volunteer\u2026 again,\u201d she finished irately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. What\u2019s the deal?\u201d griped Lana. \u201cHow come we almost never get anyone to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGenerally, younger humansh are more intereshted in mind-numbing cartoonsh than they are vore,\u201d Lisa explained. \u201cIt\u2019sh a shad, but shimple fact that the pool of volunteersh for predsh our age is abyshmal. Be grateful that at leasht you\u2019ve already digeshted people. I\u2019m shtill waiting for my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln. Could you come here a sec?\u201d Luan called. \u201cMine\u2019s a little bland. Bring your banana and turn this taco into a cream pie. Haha. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuan, it\u2019s not fair to ask that at breakfast,\u201d Rita gently chided. She\u2019d just finished swallowing another girl and still had two naked, anxious-looking bodies on her plate. A third was upside down with her head wedged in the milf\u2019s pants. She didn\u2019t have much of a technique, but the effort was certainly doing it for Rita. \u201cIf Lincoln gives your food a cream pie, everyone\u2019s going to want one, and then how\u2019s he supposed to stand long enough to make it to the bus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mom,\u201d Luan whispered, gesturing at the last girl on her plate. \u201cShe looks just like Ronnie Anne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get that, sweetie,\u201d Rita whispered back. \u201cBut now\u2019s not the time. It\u2019s too suspicious. You\u2019ll have to try later, preferably when the real thing isn\u2019t watching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan puttered her lips in defeat, only for a small hand to cup her cheek. The girl on the plate, despite her flushed nervousness, was smiling sympathetically. Luan perked up and pulled the girl into a grateful hug. She rubbed her food\u2019s back to calm her down. Given that she\u2019d already eaten her out, Luan pulled back, kissed her food\u2019s face, and then slipped her head into her maw. She\u2019d have preferred to see her brother thoroughly fuck her food first. Not only would the cream pie and added sweat improve the flavor, but the expression on her food\u2019s face would have also been extra delicious. She regretted calling her food bland, however. It had been a very mean lie, but it didn\u2019t really matter at this point. The comedian slurped down her Mexican food all the way down to her toes before sending her to join the others in her stomach\u2019s warm and welcoming embrace. Her plan might have failed, but at least the meal was satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith breakfast out of the way, everyone split up for their respective bus stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really ought to avoid slouching so much,\u201d Lola lectured. \u201cA strong posture is good for the back, builds confidence, and is generally more attractive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me until you see the results,\u201d Lola added with a confident smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bus arrived, Lincoln and Clyde sat in their usual spots, as did Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Lincoln. Um, is it okay if I ask you some questions about preds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. For prey, I\u2019m pretty much an expert on the subject. What do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella asked many of the standard questions, such as what vore was like, what made predators so alluring, and how do you know if it\u2019s right for you. Lincoln gave the usual answers. It\u2019s like a full-body embrace, but the only way to know for sure is to experience it. Predators generally had this overwhelming confidence born from a feeling of control. They knew what they wanted and how to make prey want the same thing. Again, the only way to know for sure is to try it and see what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella swallowed anxiously. \u201cSo, if I were to try, who would you recommend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my family is the only group of preds for miles, so that narrows it down. As for who, I\u2019d recommend Luan or older. Lynn\u2019s not really the gentle type, which I think is important for a positive first experience. Her rougher way of eating is fine, but not my pick for a first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde face-palmed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I forgot yesterday. I was supposed to ask Lori if she wanted to eat me now that I\u2019m not a vore virgin anymore.\u201d He sighed despondently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln patted Clyde\u2019s back. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, buddy. You should probably just stick to Leni for now. That way you can build up your experience with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperience?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s not just the preds who need to practice. If you plan on being eaten often, it helps to do things like build your endurance. It\u2019s hard not to fall asleep when you\u2019re inside someone. They\u2019re just so cozy. However, they really like it when their prey stays awake and moves around.\u201d Lincoln paused in his lecture when he noticed that everyone in earshot was staring. \u201cYa know, there are websites for this stuff. I\u2019m not exactly saying anything original,\u201d he said somewhat irately as everyone quickly averted their gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI checked some of those websites,\u201d Stella confessed. \u201cTo be honest, they didn\u2019t exactly make vore sound all that appealing. I had this image of some creep with bloodshot eyes typing away in a basement.\u201d She shivered in revulsion. \u201cYou make being eaten actually sound nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes, pulled out a sheet of paper, and wrote down a few addresses. \u201cI think I know what websites you\u2019re talking about. Here.\u201d He handed her the list. \u201cThese have moderators who actually know how to do their jobs. My mom and sisters post there sometimes, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Ronnie came aboard. \u201c\u2018Sup, nerds.\u201d She took Stella\u2019s seat behind the boys, but pushed past her to be on Lincoln\u2019s side. \u201cI heard they finished that new skate ramp at the park and was wondering if you guys could help me with something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something painful, is it?\u201d Clyde asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for you. I\u2019m thinking of starting a video series about skateboarding. Still not decided if I want to show off stunts or maybe go the whole teaching angle, though. I just need someone to film and we\u2019ll see where it goes from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some experience with filming. I help Lola practice for her pageants all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to teach, I could be your student,\u201d Stella volunteered. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be good at skating, so someone with moves like yours would make the perfect teacher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie smiled gratefully. She still hadn\u2019t sorted out her feelings on Stella. Her gut told her to be wary of a potential rival, but Stella didn\u2019t seem interested in Lincoln like that. Besides, the taller girl was nice and seemed genuinely interested in learning. Ronnie couldn\u2019t say no to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde sighed. \u201cI wish I could come, but my dads signed me up for violin lessons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? You any good?\u201d Ronnie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe only just started, so I\u2019ve got a ways to go. I played my first full solo the other day and made thirteen whole errors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie snorted dismissively. \u201c<i>Only</i> thirteen? The first time I got on a board, I twisted my foot 180 degrees. That\u2019s gotta be worth at least thirty errors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde blinked his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m saying you shouldn\u2019t feel down over not getting something the first time. Anything worth doing takes practice,\u201d Ronnie encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuan saves all her rejection letters in a box. She says they prove how much she\u2019s improved from where she started,\u201d Lincoln added. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, buddy. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Clyde properly encouraged, a more casual conversation followed until the bus finally arrived at school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things were pretty ordinary in Ms. Johnson\u2019s class. She went over everyone\u2019s extra homework and all of Lincoln\u2019s friends performed exceptionally. The gym class wasn\u2019t half bad this time. The coach brought out the obstacle course, again. Lincoln didn\u2019t beat his personal record, but he did finish ten minutes ahead of second place. A lifetime of dodging preds had its advantages. Ronnie came in at a distant second, while everyone else struggled to even finish. All winners were told to run laps around the gym until the rest passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with these skating videos?\u201d Lincoln asked, jogging leisurely alongside Ronnie. \u201cYou looking to get internet famous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while and now seems as good a time as any. Just looking to try new things, ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool. Ya know, some of my sisters-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFilm themselves eating people,\u201d Ronnie finished. \u201cYeah, I know. Bobby showed me some. It\u2019s crazy the kinds of views they get, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. Like the old saying goes: sex sells. Lisa made an algorithm that automatically blurs out the preys\u2019 faces and changed their voices before uploading. Some people like to stay anonymous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome people who also have white hair?\u201d Ronnie added with a coy grin and flushed cheeks. \u201cYeah, I saw those, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled flatly. \u201cTh-that could have been anyone. It could be a senior with really good skin, or maybe-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I know it was you. Your sisters were bleeped every time they called out your name. Bobby says Lori almost never learns the names of rando volunteers, so it\u2019s pretty obvious who she\u2019s riding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2019ve seen a lot of those videos, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie felt her insides twist as it became harder to hold eye contact. She was trying to play it cool, but the simple fact was that she\u2019d just confessed to seeing Lincoln naked. Not only naked, but balls deep in his own sisters and mom, and from some pretty creative angles at that. He could never know that she thought his butt looked cute, especially not when stacked atop one of the larger asses of the other Louds. \u201cW-w-well, I was just, I mean\u2026 I\u2019m just curious, is all. No need to make a big deal out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not,\u201d Lincoln stammered. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong w-with watching that stuff. I g-get my fill just walking down the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie felt her throat go dry and swallowed. \u201cI noticed. They, uh, don\u2019t just show the vore stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, they don\u2019t,\u201d agreed Lincoln plainly. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he felt that this conversation needed to end before things got any weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Lisa made that algorithm for censoring stuff,\u201d Ronnie hurriedly added. \u201cA-any chance she can make one for, ya know, regular editing stuff? Like how there are programs that correct grammar and spelling. Something to make suggestions for video making.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I can ask. Lisa is a stickler for good grammar, so it wouldn\u2019t be a hard sell to do something similar for video making.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourse, I\u2019m betting she won\u2019t do something like that for free,\u201d Ronnie added warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Lisa\u2019s rates are usually pretty reasonable. She\u2019s not Lori,\u201d Lincoln joked. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably just want to suck on my fingers for a few minutes. Or, ya know, get me to volunteer as a Guinee pig for one of her experiments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s eyebrow climbed up her forehead. \u201cReally? She wouldn\u2019t ask you to, ya know\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. Lisa\u2019s still too young for that. Preds don\u2019t develop sexual cravings until around five to seven, and only after they start eating people more often. Though she does like sucking on my,\u201d Lincoln made sure they weren\u2019t near anyone before whispering, \u201cpenis, but purely for taste. She won\u2019t get aroused for at least another year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie swallowed audibly as she mentally kicked herself. Why did her talks with Lincoln always have to go back to his sisters? \u201cIf you were to make your own internet show, what would it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I guess I could do reviews of Ace Savvy comics, but there are already hundreds of people doing that. I\u2019d need a way to stand out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could always do the reviews naked,\u201d she suggested with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln chuckled. \u201cYeah. That\u2019d sure get some attention. Hey, maybe I should post my address while I\u2019m at it. It\u2019d be like community service as my sisters clean up all the creepoes who try to swing by,\u201d he laughed off what he thought was just a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie pursed her lips as she considered Lincoln\u2019s words. \u201cYeah, I could actually see that happening. So your sisters would actually have a problem if people gave you <i>that</i> kind of attention?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget my mom. She absolutely <i>loves</i> people like that, especially with mustard,\u201d Lincoln snickered. \u201cWhat preds do is one thing. They\u2019re the top of the food chain for a reason. But prey that steps out of line gets what they deserve. That\u2019s why we take family trips to the local prisons every other month. Preds just doing their duty to make the world a better place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie was starting to feel that tingle in her lower belly again. It had really acted up last night when she watched a few videos of Lincoln with his sisters, but why now? This was a side of Lincoln she\u2019d never seen before. It should have been frightening, and it was, but it was also giving her the tingles. Ronnie licked her lips as she imagined asking to ride along on one of these family trips. It might not be soon, but it would definitely be someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch came with everyone in their friend group going through their trade routine. Ronnie didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. Instead, she mostly watched Lincoln bite into his sandwich as everyone else discussed their park plans. She\u2019d comment on occasion, but her imagination was focused keenly on his lips. He was no pred, but he was probably a good kisser. Even blurred, that\u2019s how it looked in the videos. The Loud sisters enjoyed locking lips with their brother. Watching those scenes, she hadn\u2019t been able to decide who she was more jealous of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in class, Ronnie\u2019s attention kept being stolen by Lincoln\u2019s back. She\u2019d seen it in all its bare glory. Thousands, maybe millions of people had seen his naked body. They\u2019d likely thought how hot it was for such a scrawny kid to be dominated by such powerful preds, which was fair. But how many had wanted just him? Any who tried would meet a less-than-desirable fate in the bellies of his family, but she\u2019d be safe, right? She wasn\u2019t just some rando off the street. She was Lincoln\u2019s friend and he had her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing too special happened for the remainder of the day, save for Ronnie noticing Ms. Johnson giving Lincoln some odd looks when she thought no one was looking. Finally, school had ended and they made it to the park. Everything was set for a nice and fun time of kids being kids. What could go wrong?</span></div></div>",

With everything set and a rough script set out, Lincoln picked out an idea angle to shoot and Ronnie began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, folks. This is Ronnie Anne Santiago, here to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut!\u201d Lincoln interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? We haven\u2019t even started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure you want to put your last name out there. Maybe use your account name instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that sounds safer,\u201d agreed Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie rolled her eyes. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s start over.\u201d She took a breath and waited for Lincoln\u2019s signal. \u201cHey, folks. This is your friendly neighborhood Roller Queen, here to do her first-ever skating video.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln kept his eyes on the screen, but gave a thumbs-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to my left is, er, someone who wants to learn how to skate. Introduce yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. You can call me, um, Hiker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Hiker, what were you looking to learn today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie and Stella went through the basics of rollerblading and skateboarding. Stella was just enough of a novice that Ronnie\u2019s teachings looked authentic. Lincoln did his best to zoom and track once they really started moving. However, there was only so much one could do with just a phone. That was fine. This whole thing was a giant rough draft. The point was to make mistakes that could be addressed later. But for the most part, things were going pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, little dudes. How\u2019s it hangin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut,\u201d Lincoln called before turning to the newcomer. \u201cLuna, what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe band and I usually jam in the park on Wednesdays,\u201d Luna explained, gesturing to where her friends were setting up. \u201cSay, you making a video?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRonnie Anne is. We\u2019re just doing some basic skating lessons for right now.\u201d Lincoln might not have been the sharpest when it came to other girls, but he could usually read his sisters like an open book. And right now, there was a question that Luna was dying to ask, so he beat her to it by calling to the approaching skaters. \u201cHey, Ronnie Anne. Need some skate music?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck, yeah. That\u2019d be awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet. I\u2019ll go let the guys know. See you cuties later.\u201d Luna waved before blowing a kiss in the general direction of the kids, leaving it vague who was the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music turned out to be a big help. The exciting music got the blood pumping and the beat helped the skater\u2019s coordination. Every now and then, Lincoln would call out directions on different shots he wanted to try. The premise of teaching had almost been completely forgotten as the girls started having fun just racing along the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tall one, right?\u201d Sam whispered while the band was on break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Whatcha think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Hard to tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, man. She was totally checkin\u2019 me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rolled her eyes with a good-natured grin. \u201cSo? You\u2019re a hot pred and she has eyes. Of course, she\u2019s checking you out. Even if she\u2019s curious, that doesn\u2019t mean she wants to turn your belly into her new apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Luna playfully bumped Sam\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo, whatcha think we should do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know what <i>I</i> want,\u201d Sam said cheekily. \u201cAs for those two\u2026 not sure. I didn\u2019t figure myself out until I met you in middle school. Kids that age probably haven\u2019t put too much thought into it. Plus, you guys are trying to be all sneaky and covert with shipping your brother, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatchmaking,\u201d Luna corrected. \u201cShipping just sounds less serious, but yeah. Gotta keep it on the down-low.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, unless you want to pull them aside and have <i>the talk</i>, I can\u2019t really think of anything except to wait for one or both to come to you for advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBogus, dude,\u201d Luna grumbled. \u201cNo way Lori\u2019s gonna be that passive the next time she visits the Santiagos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve met my family, but we\u2019re a <i>very</i> competitive bunch. I\u2019ve set myself up for team Stella, the underdog, while everyone else is either neutral or pushing for Ronnie Anne. I know it sounds silly, but\u2026\u201d Luna trailed off, unable to finish her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it for family, right,\u201d Sam finished, setting a hand on her girlfriend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou want him to be happy, but you also want to be the one who <i>makes</i> him happy. Am I close?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re givin\u2019 me the look, Sam,\u201d Luna warned. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t rock their socks off with you lookin\u2019 at me like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smirked, leaned in close, and blew across Luna\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back with the kids\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think we\u2019ve got enough trick shots for right now,\u201d Lincoln said as he scrolled through the footage. \u201cBut I think we could do better on the shots of you two on the weaving path.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella chuckled and picked some of the leaves off her shirt. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m still working on those tight turns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re making great progress, Stel,\u201d Ronnie encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly cuz I\u2019ve got such a great teacher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie grinned. \u201cCan\u2019t argue there.\u201d They shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Lincoln called to the band. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to start aga-hey! Where\u2019d Luna and Sam go?\u201d Lincoln felt stupid the moment he heard his own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam went and gave Luna <i>the look</i>, so they went behind the bathrooms,\u201d explained one of the snickering bandmates. \u201cNow our quartet\u2019s gonna be a trio for a few hours.\u201d Just as she finished speaking, Luna came back into view. The pred was licking her lips and affectionately stroking her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d Lincoln pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cOkay, sure. You guys can still play without Sam, so let\u2019s try this again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna threw up a fist and cheered, \u201cRockin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the park\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I just-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what if I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook kid, the dame ain\u2019t moving,\u201d said Mr. Coconuts. \u201cSo take the hint and beat the road before you end up as someone\u2019s butt plug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard the puppet,\u201d Luan added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on! They\u2019re skating. That\u2019s my thing. I could totally-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStep in, hog all the attention, and try to eat someone?\u201d Luan finished in bemusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I took care of that already, see.\u201d Lynn pointed at her distended belly where someone was still wiggling. \u201cI can\u2019t eat anyone when I\u2019m already this full, so I\u2019m safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan was unconvinced. \u201cUh-huh. And that\u2019s definitely a volunteer and not just some rando off the street, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Yeah, totally. He just came up to me, asked me to eat him, and I did. It\u2019s all legit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where\u2019re his clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis clothes. You kept them, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 No need. I\u2019m uh, digesting him. Yeah, that\u2019s it. He won\u2019t be needing them, so I put them in the, uh, donation bin.\u201d Lynn\u2019s remark got her belly shaking as its contents started crying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan shook her head. \u201cLynn, just stop. You\u2019re not fooling anyone. Now spit that kid out and leave Lincoln\u2019s friends alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn\u2019s pout intensified. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair. How come you guys are boxing me out like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause when Lincoln was giving Lucy pointers on being a more confident hunter, he told her to be flirty, affectionate, and overall approachable. <i>You\u2019d</i> rather chase your food down. And while I\u2019ll admit that that has its place, it\u2019s not good for beginners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to do that.\u201d Lynn stomped her foot like a petulant child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you want to eat Ronnie Anne and Stella, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Obvi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t do that until Lincoln gives the go-ahead. And he\u2019s not gonna do that until he\u2019s sure you won\u2019t scare them off. So either bring out your gentler side, or hit the showers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling her defeat, Lynn turned around and trudged away from the others. \u201cStupid Lincoln. Squeezing me out. I totally have a gentle side. Isn\u2019t that right, uh, whatever your name is?\u201d she asked of the boy in her belly. Her answer was a series of expletives that someone his age really shouldn\u2019t have known. \u201cUh, okay. Rude. Ugh! I guess I\u2019ll find your stupid clothes, but you\u2019d better be grateful.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything wrapped up with the video shoot with everyone agreeing that it went pretty well for their first attempt. Luna volunteered to carry Sam\u2019s gear and walk the kids home as her bandmates went their separate ways. As they went, Luna kept maneuvering herself \u2013 or at least her stomach \u2013 within Stella\u2019s peripheral vision. She was further convinced in her theory each time Stella gave her a wide-eyed look, but kept the chatter to a minimum. Sam was right that they\u2019d need some privacy to talk things out properly. In any case, the girls said their goodbyes and split off from the group, leaving Luna free to hoist her brother up and plant him atop her belly and against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComfy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you have to ask,\u201d joked Lincoln as he reclined against the soft chest pillows. \u201cThanks for waiting until the other\u2019s left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo prob, li\u2019l bro. You know I always got your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy back, front, top, bottom, and all the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. He\u2019s got you there, Luns,\u201d chuckled Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Sam. Can you tell me what it\u2019s like dating a pred?\u201d Lincoln was pretty sure he felt the girl shrug in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You probably know about as much as I do. You hang out, do things you like, and sometimes she eats you; though not as often as she should.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no bellyaching,\u201d chided Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed. \u201cCan you two keep a secret?\u201d He waited for both to nod. \u201cWell, yesterday\u2026 Ronnie Anne asked me out for milkshakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna slapped her cheek in shock. \u201cWhat? No way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s awesome,\u201d Sam cheered more convincingly. \u201cBut you don\u2019t sound too pumped about it. Something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t like Ronnie Anne. She\u2019s a good friend and fun to hang out with. But I guess I\u2019ve never really thought of her as girlfriend material, you know, after that one time.\u201d Lincoln turned an accusing glare up at Luna, making her whistle innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Sam realized. \u201cShe\u2019s your first date, isn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much, yeah. My only reference is watching my pred sisters, but I\u2019m prey, so how much of that actually translates? What\u2019s even the difference between regular hanging out and a date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, easy there, little man. Don\u2019t work your undies in a knot. But to answer your question, I guess there really isn\u2019t a difference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to say. It\u2019s like how you and Clyde are best friends. You get each other in a way that you and Luna might not. There are things you\u2019d want to do with one, but not so much the other. Well, a girlfriend is like a different kind of best friend, if that makes sense. I might not be the best one to ask since mine are one in the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Luna cooed as she cupped under what she was pretty sure was Sam\u2019s butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think about it, Luna is kinda like a girlfriend to both of us. We both like to cuddle her, chillax, listen to her sweet tunes, have nasty-nasty sex, and explore the beautiful depths of her beautiful body.\u201d Sam wiggled around, loving the feel of the stomach walls against her skin. \u201cBut how you two chillax is different than how the two of us do it. I guess I\u2019m saying that there isn\u2019t really a standard you should be shooting for. Just hang out, find some stuff you like, and see what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see it, luv, but I\u2019m giving you a thumbs-up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of shared interests,\u201d Sam continued mischievously. \u201cWhat are the odds of me getting a travel buddy in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln looked up to find Luna giving him a suggestive smirk. \u201cWell, so long as we find somewhere private.\u201d Before Lincoln knew it, Luna had taken off down the road to a secluded alleyway, ducked down behind some bushes, and stripped him bare. \u201cWell, gee. I wonder what Luna thinks of all this,\u201d he remarked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musician rolled her eyes, knelt down low, and opened wide. \u201cJust get in here, pasty buns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln stepped forward and pushed his hands into Luna\u2019s mouth. She wasted no time in scarfing him down. This wasn\u2019t one of their usual prolonged eating sessions. Luna was impatient to have Lincoln inside her, and by extension, inside her girlfriend. He saw no reason to resist and helped push inside, though he did pause to kiss Luna on the nose first. She gave him a thankful smile before her lips engulfed his face and encased him in semi-darkness. His sister\u2019s mouth was drenched in warm saliva that quickly got everywhere, but Lincoln had long learned not to be bothered by such things. Her swallowing pulled his arms to the back of her throat, followed by his face. Lincoln then felt Luna stand and tilt her head back, employing gravity to aid his descent down her gullet. She barely even fiddled with his penis, which was especially unusual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallow after swallow pulled Lincoln further down as the pink muscle undulated around him. His face pressed against an orifice that quickly parted, revealing a familiar face smiling in the dark. Sam reached out to Lincoln\u2019s hands to help him in and pulled him close in a loving embrace. He reciprocated by burying his face in her soft chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, stud. Ya miss me?\u201d Sam cooed as she nuzzled the top of his head. When she\u2019d started dating Luna, she had a feeling that the rest of her family would want in on the action. That\u2019s just how preds were, and it was fun all around. However, she never imagined that she\u2019d ever get so close to her lover\u2019s little brother. The only guy Luna let inside her, Lincoln was a really special guy, which Sam had grown to appreciate. He was like a rock in the tempest of insanity that was his family. And whenever she and Luna had the fight, Lincoln was the one who did the most to talk reason into them both. For all of that and more, Sam loved the little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways.\u201d Lincoln leaned up for a kiss. It was hard to aim in the dark and everywhere was covered in sticky stomach mucus, but they soon found one another and locked lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, however, proved just as impatient as Luna. \u201cC\u2019mon, stud. Let\u2019s get busy,\u201d she said while grabbing his dick and gently lowering it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, allow me,\u201d accommodated Lincoln. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been around the block enough times to know what goes where.\u201d Holding onto Sam, he soon aligned himself with her twitching sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right, you have, stud.\u201d Sam cupped Lincoln\u2019s scrawny butt and began pushing. \u201cNnngh! Oh, fuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had lost his grip on the slimy surface, slipped, and accidentally penetrated Sam in one go. \u201cOof! Sorry,\u201d he said into her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no problem,\u201d panted Sam as she adjusted her position. Lincoln was pulled tight against her body as she playfully teased a finger across his anus. She laughed when he started urgently moving, sinking in the rest of the way before slowly pulling back out. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the good stuff,\u201d she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing on top, Lincoln pulled his hips up and slammed back in. He couldn\u2019t tell if the wet, lewd squelches he heard were from Sam\u2019s pussy or someone\u2019s feet, but it was great. The boy latched onto Sam\u2019s left nipple and suckled, making her cry out before he began fondling her other breast. All the while he built a rhythm with his hips against hers. Her pussy greedily gripped his cock as he worked her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, f-fuck yeah! Suck me, Lincoln. Suck my boobs like I\u2019m your mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no words for Luna\u2019s anguish. No one could mistake her bouncing gut for anything else. Everything spoken in her stomach came through loud and clear, as did the movements. Her own pussy was crying out for attention and she wanted nothing more than to kick back and flick it, yet she was still a full block from her house. Running faster ran the risk of aggravating her condition further, but neither could she bring herself to discourage the pair inside her. This whole thing was just too hot for her to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst came to pass when Luna felt Lincoln slam into Sam one last time and hold himself there. It must have been a good one because the blonde started swearing like a sailor as she kicked at the stomach walls. Luna tried to save her dignity by finding some bushes to dive into, but it was too late. The stimulation from her stomach alone had created a mess in her panties. Worse, she had no one to blame but herself. Face flushed and breathing heavy, Luna hoped that she hadn\u2019t discovered a fondness for exhibitionism. So she sucked it up, stowed her panties in the bag with everyone else\u2019s clothes, and went commando the rest of the way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luna held her head high as she walked up to the porch. It wasn\u2019t like she had any reason to be ashamed. Who among them hadn\u2019t creamed their panties while walking down the road? No, seriously. A list would have been appreciated right now. But it didn\u2019t\u2019 matter. All she had to do was make it inside, up the stairs, and no one would be the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh. Looks like someone had themselves a little <i>accident</i>,\u201d taunted Lola from her car in the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? No I di-I mean, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Luna tried to play it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh. Sure thing. Not like a pageant queen would recognize the walk of shame when she sees it. And between your stomach and how close together your thighs are, it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out what\u2019s what.\u201d Lola tended to yell when she lost control of things, but it was her controlled whispering that really gave her sisters the willies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna slumped in defeat. \u201cAlright. Name your terms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerms? Why, whatever do you mean?\u201d asked Lola, feigning innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rolled her eyes. \u201cThe terms to keep your mouth shut. Don\u2019t play games with me, queeny. Just tell me what you want so we can all move on with our lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Well, there isn\u2019t too much I want that you can give me. I <i>could</i> ask for your share of dessert for the rest of the week, ooor\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can loan me Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna snapped her fingers and shot two fingers and an approving grin at Lola. \u201cDessert it is. Happy doin\u2019 business with ya, Lols.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, hold on a sec.\u201d Suddenly fretful, Lola hopped out of her car and ran up to Luna. \u201cIt\u2019d just be for one day. Not even that. Just the rest of today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, dude. I ain\u2019t handing Sam over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You do it all the time with all the other older sisters and Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, that\u2019s not loaning. That\u2019s sharing. Second, what would you even want her for, anyway? She\u2019s too big for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe growing up with you guys has given me a preference for older girls. Ever think of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna folded her arms under her hefty chest and over her heftier belly. \u201cYou getting\u2019 all defensive ain\u2019t exactly sellin\u2019 your case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola\u2019s normally high and proud chin lowered to her collar bone. \u201cI just want to try her, alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I just want to try her. I don\u2019t have any experience with older prey and\u2026 I just want to see what it\u2019s like with someone her age who isn\u2019t also a pred. Is that so wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you could\u2019ve just come out and asked if that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola rolled her eyes. \u201cI thought I was doing you a favor by bargaining for something you\u2019d have given away for free. But clearly, you don\u2019t understand generosity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, excuse me. Do I get a say in this?\u201d Sam asked, her voice muffled by the stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely, luv. You get the final say in whatever involves you, and never forget it. That\u2019s the Luna Loud guarantee.\u201d She emphasized her point by patting the side of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Luns. So, what exactly are we talking about? I missed about every third word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Luna\u2019s gesturing, Lola approached and spoke closer to the stomach as the both of them finally entered the house. \u201cI want to see what sex is like with an older girl who isn\u2019t just gonna gobble me up afterward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Sam commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, per se, but it can get tedious. Lincoln knows what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI plead the fifth,\u201d he asserted. \u201cThis has nothing to do with me, though I will say I\u2019m not happy with you guys passing Sam around like a piece of meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s kinda funny coming from someone sharing a stomach with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 My point still stands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s sweet of you to be concerned for me, but I think I can handle myself. And if it helps Luns out, I don\u2019t mind spending some time with Lola. I mean, I\u2019ve already been with Lincoln more times than I can count. I probably shouldn\u2019t show favoritism.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Luna conceded. \u201cI\u2019ll go upstairs and spit these two out. You can have her then. Just make sure I get her back good as new, or I\u2019ll be spendin\u2019 some <i>time</i> with your stuffed animals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola scoffed. \u201cNot a problem. I might haggle, but I can stick to a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee that you do.\u201d Luna then began ascending the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErhem-thighs-erhem,\u201d Lola fake coughed, prompting Luna to walk more carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musician made it to the bathroom, where she behaved as many musicians do after a spontaneous tryst, and threw up in the bathtub. Lincoln and Sam were still embracing as they were deposited on the ceramic surface, bodies glistening with stomach fluid and chunks of things that were probably better left not thought about. However, the way they cuddled close, completely indifferent to the wet squelches of their every movement, and even the chill of the open air. It all made Luna go, \u201cAww. Ain\u2019t that precious. Almost makes me feel bad about doing this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d Lincoln asked while cuddling. Even slimy and gross, Sam was just so nice to hang onto. Squinting in the light, he looked up. He saw Luna with her hand on the shower knob and a sadistic grin on her face. His blood ran cold. \u201cNo! No, stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna spun the knob with a dramatic flourish and a blast of water cascaded down on the pair. Both had braced themselves for either scalding hot or nipple freezing. Instead, they both blinked their surprise when they got comfortably warm water. Luna held it in only a second before she fell back, clenching her shrunken stomach as she rolled on the floor laughing. \u201cHahaha! Y-your faces. Bwaha. Oh, y-you should\u2019ve-hehe haha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pressed himself to the tub\u2019s edge and glowered at his sister. \u201cNot funny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a little funny,\u201d Sam giggled and rubbed his back. \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t do the same in her position?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled flatly. \u201cI\u2019m pleading the fifth again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you are just too cute,\u201d Sam gushed as she pulled Lincoln\u2019s face between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can I get in on some of that?\u201d Luna asked after recovering from her giggle fit. She didn\u2019t even wait for an answer before she started undressing. The others welcomed her in and she got to work helping clean them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pred toilet would have been more efficient, but there was no question that a scrub in the tub was more relaxing. Hands explored all they could with nowhere being off-limits. Lincoln figured his hands were better than a washcloth and paid special attention to Sam\u2019s butt. He groped and kneaded her pert buns until they sparkled, and then he kept at it because he was having too much fun. Sam, likewise, decided that Luna\u2019s boobs needed a once-over. They were coated in sweat, she claimed, and nothing but bare hands backed up by a tongue could do the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, needing to busy her own hands, attacked both Sam\u2019s boobs and her pussy. She plunged her fingers deep into her girlfriend\u2019s snatch and felt the sticky globules of her brother\u2019s cum. She made sure to extract as much as she could so that the blonde could watch her lick her fingers clean. Sam fell into her girlfriend\u2019s arms for support, which Luna took as an incentive to press the attack. Eventually, the pred\u2019s fingers bumped into Lincoln\u2019s tongue. He was eating Sam while paying token attention to cleaning her legs. Incensed by such greed, Luna pulled Sam away from her nipple so that they could share a kiss instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy every metric she could think of, Sam was having a lovely afternoon. First, her girlfriend ate her, then she got to fuck said girlfriend\u2019s little brother in her belly, and now she was being double teamed by the both of them at either end under the pleasant warmth of a shower. This had to be what heaven was like. She wanted to cry out with joy, but her mouth was busy being dominated by her pred; by <i>her</i> beloved pred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween everyone\u2019s heightened libidos, it was a miracle that any cleaning got done, yet it happened. They still stank of sex and stomach juice, but they were passably clean. Lincoln got dressed in his prior clothes and grabbed his backpack. Luna put back on her old duds, minus the panties. She almost tried to wear Sam\u2019s, but a pred\u2019s thicc ass would have torn those dainty things to shreds. Sam, remembering the deal, just stayed nude. It was practically her uniform for the Loud house, anyway. Everyone said their goodbyes and went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Lincoln run into next?</span></div></div>",

He flinched in preparation for the worst, but when it didn\u2019t come, he looked up to spy his elder sister staring down at him with fire in her eyes. Lincoln swallowed anxiously, wondering whatever had happened to put her in such a mood. \u201cUh, h-hey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking me,\u201d she deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Those words in that tone could have multiple interpretations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I stutter? You. Me. My room. Now!\u201d Lynn didn\u2019t give Lincoln a chance to react before grabbing his wrist and yanking him onto the back of her seat. He reflexively grabbed around her stomach as she rode down the hall at break-neck speeds. At some point, he was pretty sure they ran loops over the ceiling before finally coming to an abrupt halt in front of Lynn\u2019s bed. Lincoln failed to brace in time and was hurled forward straight into her pillow while his pack went off elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d he groaned into the pillow with his butt in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReal cute position, Stinken, but not what I need,\u201d Lynn said gruffly without a trace of flirtation or even her usual easy-going confidence. She dismounted her bike, discarded her coverings, and climbed up beside him, mirroring his position. Her expression was impatient. \u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than dropping trou as she wanted, Lincoln frowned at his sister. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. My ass is empty and needs a good dicking. Now hurry up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sat up and thought. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you had any games to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget the games and just fuck me already!\u201d Lynn snapped. Her ass shaking was more demanding than inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now I <i>know</i> something\u2019s wrong. Lynn, if there\u2019s-\u201d He was cut short by his sister grabbing his wrist and pulling his face against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you have to say right now. So either put your dick in my ass, or I\u2019m spending the rest of the day with your head up there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded and unzipped. Digesting him might have been a bluff, but <i>this</i> was definitely up in Lynn\u2019s arsenal. Pun intended. Positioning himself on his knees behind her, Lincoln set his hands just above Lynn\u2019s freckled rump and pressed himself against her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn\u2019s head spun around to shoot him a death glare. \u201cWhat the hell? You\u2019re not even hard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, give me a break. I just got done with Sam, and now you\u2019re being all super aggressive. Just\u2026\u201d Lincoln grunted as he started humping his limp noodle against his sister. \u201cGive me a sec.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn dropped her head to the pillow with a huff. \u201cFigures you\u2019d get it up for Sam, but not me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln paused. \u201cI might have a short recovery time, but even I have limits. I\u2019d have trouble even if you were mom. Instead of huffing and puffing, how about you tell me what\u2019s wrong. Maybe I can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Lynn asserted, though with less bite than before. \u201cI just need you to fuck me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Lincoln made up his mind not to fuck Lynn. \u201cAlright, but flip over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get in the mood and it\u2019s easier if I\u2019m facing you.\u201d Lincoln waited patiently while Lynn grumbled and flipped onto her back. Her face was a scowl and she couldn\u2019t look him in the eye. \u201cYa know, you\u2019re cuter when you smile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn made a face like she were in the middle of a laborious dump as she fought to maintain her bad mood. She was about to snap at Lincoln again, only for him to grab her budding breasts. Her moan was shocked and embarrassingly feminine while his grin was insufferably victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln tenderly pinched Lynn\u2019s nipples while the rest of his hands massaged her young boobs. She was far from a handful and couldn\u2019t even give a boob job yet, but there was still plenty to play with. Lynn\u2019s moans helped bring new life to his cock, but it wasn\u2019t enough. One hand was moved from her chest down to her pussy. His fingers penetrated despite unexpected resistance, causing him to start swirling his digits while his thumb massaged her love button. Lynn\u2019s expression grew flushed as she began to pant. The tension was leaving her body, but Lincoln was still unsatisfied. \u201cReady to talk, now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou asshole,\u201d Lynn huffed breathlessly. \u201cWhere do you get off talking to me after doing <i>that</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln leaned down and planted a soft kiss at the corner of Lynn\u2019s lips while his hands continued their work. \u201cI get off being right here, loving you, and wanting you to talk to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn couldn\u2019t stand it. Lincoln was pulling her strings like an instrument. It was only a matter of time before she started singing to his liking. Worse, the sincerity of his words had already worn down her resistance. \u201cLuan wouldn\u2019t let me join you at the park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you guys at the park. You were skating and I wanted to join, but Luan stopped me. Sh-she said I\u2019d just jump in, hog all the glory, and try to eat everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded like something Lynn would do, but Lincoln was wise enough to not say as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, you\u2026 like it when I eat you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s massage of his sister continued, but more relaxed. He wanted to maintain both of their aroused states without taking from the moment. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-even when I chase you down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln kissed her eye this time. \u201cYou chasing me is like going on a roller coaster. A little scary, but a lot exciting. Sometimes you do it when I\u2019m busy with other stuff, but I don\u2019t usually mind. Plus, I know I\u2019m your favorite guy to run down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s cuz no other guy can last more than a minute against me, even with handicapsss!\u201d She sucked in a breath when the fingers in her pussy suddenly plunged past the knuckles. Now, half of Lincoln\u2019s hand was up her twat and tickling her vaginal walls. Her legs began kicking into the air with curled toes as she grabbed around his back and yanked his bare chest against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln adjusted himself to align his cock and tease the tip against her wet slit. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna fuck you,\u201d he whispered into her ear, \u201cbut I will love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a handful of Lincoln\u2019s ass, Lynn slammed his pelvis down. His cock penetrated her in one go, finally filling her with that satisfying sense of fullness. \u201cL-Lincoln!\u201d she cried out. A series of gibberish words followed as she moved his buns around to better feel him sliding inside her. \u201cH-how does this always feel so gooood? I\u2019ve taken whole people up there, so why is your dumb cock so much better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCuz I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Lincoln replied smugly. He pulled back against Lynn\u2019s grip a few inches before slamming back in at full force. She cried out in bliss and wrapped her lips around his. Lincoln returned the kiss and began rotating his hips in and out of his sister\u2019s pussy. Her moans were like honey to his ears as the friction of her slick walls glided across his sensitive member. Lynn followed his movements, but never let him pull too far out, which he didn\u2019t mind. Rather, Lincoln wrapped his arms around Lynn to hold her closer. He felt her pulse quicken, as did the urgency of her kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn suddenly flipped them over. Now on top, she began slamming her hips so hard that they almost hurt. \u201cOh, f-fuck! H-harder, Lincoln!\u201d she demanded despite being in full control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln seized the chance to grab Lynn\u2019s ass and teased a finger into her anus. This made her grunts even more erratic as she bounced on his cock. Face flushed and drenched in sweat, Lincoln saw his sister in a similar state and told her, \u201cSee? So much cuter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuuuck!\u201d Lynn cried out to the heavens as she slammed her hips down one last time. She hadn\u2019t closed the door, so half the house probably heard her orgasmic whaling as Lincoln\u2019s seed poured into her womb. Lynn saw stars as hot goo flooded her insides and she bit her lip to keep from moaning further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s mind was in a half-daze, but he still felt proud that he\u2019d brought this out in Lynn. She\u2019d definitely needed some lovemaking over fucking. As she fell atop him, breath laden with bologna and body as sticky as his, Lincoln wondered what else he should do to help his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho comes in next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln lay naked in the bed, acting like the big spoon as he cuddled with Lynn. His limp cock was still inside her pussy, but only because she whined every time he tried to pull out. \u201cSo, was there more you wanted to talk about? If something\u2019s bothering you, I\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch. Leave it to a pansy like you to ruin the mood with stupid feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not stupid if they\u2019re yours,\u201d Lincoln argued. His hands reached up and cupped Lynn\u2019s chest nubs. \u201cHow you feel matters, especially to me. Now, why\u2019d it bug you so much that Luan said you couldn\u2019t skate with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn snorted indignantly. \u201cI even ate a kid just before coming over. I figured if I had a full belly, you wouldn\u2019t be so put off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would that put me off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you-you. Ronnie Anne and Stella. I figured if they saw my stomach was already full, they wouldn\u2019t worry about me trying to eat them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. By his standards, that seemed like a perfectly sensible line of reasoning. \u201cAnd she still didn\u2019t let you join us? That\u2019s doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, why\u2019d that bum you out so much to begin with? Don\u2019t you usually hang out with your middle school friends around that time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I really wanted to hang out with you today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, as in\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn rolled her eyes. \u201cYou as in you, dumbass. I just feel like you\u2019ve been pushing me out lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln blinked. \u201cLynn, I\u2019m so sorry. If I was, you know it wasn\u2019t intentional, right? I love spending time with you. You\u2019re one of the few sisters who can make me build up a sweat without using sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn snickered. \u201cYeah. Plus you\u2019re just so much fun to wrestle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that? Wouldn\u2019t Lucy or Luan also be good since they\u2019re closer to your size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re all good in their own ways. It\u2019s fun flipping Lori onto her big fat ass and the last time I threw down with Leni, I knocked her out with her own boob.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln snorted a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola and Lana are both pretty solid scrappers and Luan\u2019s body is covered in booby traps, so I really gotta keep on my toes with her. But you.\u201d Lynn reached back and cupped Lincoln\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re not just family or prey. You\u2019re both. There\u2019s just something about your smell that makes you so fun to put in a hold. Not to mention,\u201d she reached down between her legs and tapped at his balls, \u201cI like how you get all excited. Everyone else just gets hard nips, which can sometimes be easy to miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad I could give you what you need.\u201d As Lincoln was about to get up, a hand yanked him back around to Lynn\u2019s front, where her grin was smug and domineering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, Stinken. I\u2019ve worked up an appetite, so you know what that means.\u201d Then, just as Lynn was about to open her mouth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah!\u201d The pair jumped in the bed and backed against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d Lynn demanded accusingly at Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here the whole time. Did you guys really not notice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTypical. Anyway, so long as you\u2019re here, I was wondering if you could help get me inspired for my new poem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInspired?\u201d Lincoln questioned apprehensively and gestured down at his cock. \u201cSorry, Lucy. I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019m kinda spent right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw, which is why I was asking Lynn. I feel like her brand of mouth work would be perfect for what I\u2019m going for. Lincoln, if you\u2019re available, I just need your lap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, I guess I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln untangled himself from Lynn and patted his lap while the elder sister also made space. Lucy slipped off her shoes and panties before climbing up between the two. Her black dress was pulled back, showing off her pale butt cheeks to her sister as she got on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYummy!\u201d Lynn grabbed Lucy\u2019s ass and pressed her face firmly between the cheeks. Her tongue stole its first lick of her younger sister\u2019s snatch, making them both moan in delight. Despite Lucy\u2019s cold exterior, her insides were as hot and steamy as anyone\u2019s. Her smell of arousal was just as intoxicating, but the athlete quickly grew bored with the vanilla work. She pulled Lucy\u2019s ass cheeks as far apart as they could go as she sank more of her mouth into the goth\u2019s twat. Her tongue plunged deeper for that succulent liquid arousal, but it wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Lucy\u2019s words about her <i>brand</i>, Lynn decided to kick things up a notch when she stuck a pair of fingers into her sister\u2019s anus. Lucy moans were muffled around her mouthful of cock, but Lynn pressed on. First, she sunk all her fingers into the hole, and then her whole hand. The more she put in, the more Lucy\u2019s sex put out. Lynn drank greedily of her sister\u2019s nectar and started wiggling her arm around to see what other kinds of reactions she could get. Good ones, if the increase in love juices was anything to go by. Lynn sunk her arm all the way up to the shoulder, doing her best to maximize stimulation while keeping balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lucy\u2019s rear was getting the rough treatment she\u2019d asked for, her front was administered the TLC she\u2019d expected from Lincoln. Her lips were around his cock. She could taste all the leavings from his and Lynn\u2019s fornication, along with trace amounts of Sam along his smooth skin. It was like discovering a hidden cherry atop her ice-cream. The smell of their crotches was especially pungent as the aroma tickled her brain. It was a good thing Lynn was already holding her up, otherwise, her legs would have given out. Lucy\u2019s arousal was building rapidly from the plunging into her ass and pussy. However, tempering that arousal was the gentle way that Lincoln stroked her hair. He never moved her bangs from her eyes, but his touch was tender as he tidied up the strands of hair around her face. His smile was even tenderer. It wasn\u2019t the smile of a boy being sucked off, but a brother happy to give his sister a helping hand, even if that hand was his penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lucy finally came, it was into the vacuum seal of Lynn\u2019s mouth. The young jock drank down her sister\u2019s girl cum like her life depended on it. She even probed her tongue in even more deeply to make sure that not a single drop was spared. Upfront, Lincoln\u2019s cock fell from Lucy\u2019s lips with a wet plop as she shuddered. Lincoln just kept stroking her cheek and hair to calm her down while the arm up her ass went even wilder. This conflict of sensations was precisely the inspiration she needed to write her next great work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had recovered enough to move, Lincoln started to get dressed, only to reconsider fermenting himself in his own sweat and sex stink. Lynn volunteered to escort him to the bathroom while Lucy got to work on writing. In the tub, as they started washing one another, and getting a little frisky, Lincoln decided to make something clear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you feel like I was ignoring you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Lynn hummed as she pressed her back against Lincoln\u2019s front. \u201cYou\u2019re a good brother, ya know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re a good sister.\u201d Lincoln kissed under Lynn\u2019s jaw. \u201cMaybe if you showed off this gentler side more often, Ronnie Anne would be more comfortable with you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really my style, but I\u2019ll think it over. Thanks, Stinken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair dried off and got dressed, which was a lot easier for Lynn, considering her sport\u2019s gear. Hoping that he could take a breather from his sisters for a while, Lincoln hurried to his room and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould we see what the other Louds are up to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lori was busy. She was caught up on homework, had no shopping emergencies, no babysitting, and she\u2019d wisely gotten out of the house before her family could laden her with any demands. The eldest sister was so busy, in fact, that she\u2019d put her phone on silent; a true rarity for her. The reason for this business was sitting down on the bed before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, babe. Is that for me?\u201d Bobby asked. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, buck naked, and ogling Lori\u2019s voluminous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it, Bubu-Bear.\u201d Lori cocked her hip and struck a pose, causing her engorged stomach to sway. This alerted the person inside to start wiggling, which caused Lori to slap her stomach. \u201cHey, not yet! If you start too soon, I won\u2019t even make it to the bed,\u201d she chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby chuckled. \u201cYou just can\u2019t find good help these days, huh, babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boyfriend\u2019s smile quickly calmed Lori\u2019s nerves. \u201cLiterally, tell me about it. I thought I\u2019d laid out the directions perfectly clear,\u201d she explained as she sashayed over. Her hands ran all along her curves to better entice the guy who was practically drooling already. \u201cBut some people just don\u2019t know how to take a hint.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, you know you\u2019re a bombshell on any day of the week,\u201d Bobby began, the \u2018but\u2019 implicit in his tone. \u201cHowever, and this might be controversial to say, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re at your sexiest when you\u2019ve got someone inside you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori almost stumbled as her cheeks turned beat red. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that,\u201d she laughed dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, babe. Just look at you. You\u2019ve got that perfectly round belly, but not a trace of fat. Everything\u2019s pleasantly plump with all those people going to just the right places.\u201d He made a show of peaking around to stare at her curvaceous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori rolled her eyes in good humor. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that cuz you\u2019re an ass man, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling contently, Bobby looked Lori straight in the eye and said, \u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and lunged for her Bubu-Bear. Her stomach impacted him, knocking him back against the bedding. He skidded back a short way until his head rested against the pillow. Perfect. Lori got herself into position, reaching under her giant gut until she found his cock. Bobby was bigger than Lincoln, but smaller than her dad, but that didn\u2019t matter much to an experienced pred like her. Slipping his sausage into her lower mouth, Lori cried out as she sank down atop her boy toy. Her giant ass pinned his upper legs while her tummy felt so cozy sitting on his chest. \u201cHehe. I can feel your chest hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Cuz all I can feel is this.\u201d Bobby was effectively immobile from his neck to his knees. So to emphasize his point, he wrapped his arms around her giant belly and hugged tight. Whoever was in there started moving again, but this time without Lori\u2019s complaint. Based on the sounds, Bobby reasoned that Lori had eaten a woman, and that that woman was currently masturbating inside the love of his life. So hot. \u201cBabe, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh!\u201d Lori groaned. Bobby\u2019s cock was penetrating deep into her pussy as she rocked back and forth. Not only was the friction of his penis to die for, but the pressure of his body against her full stomach made everything a zillion times better. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Bubu-Bear. Rub my stomach. Show it how much you love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI,\u201d kiss, \u201clove,\u201d kiss, \u201cyou,\u201d and Bobby kissed her again. He pushed his hands firmly along Lori\u2019s gut as he tried to feel out what part of her meal he was touching. \u201cNot to complain, but you couldn\u2019t wait to get here before you ate her? You know I like to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smiled coyly. \u201cI think we both know you like to do a lot more than just watch.\u201d She pulled her stomach in so that she could see his face. \u201cWhich is why I didn\u2019t wait. I knew you\u2019d spend so much time giving <i>her</i> a cream filling that there\u2019d be none left for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby didn\u2019t answer right away. The movement within the belly currently crushing him was too distracting. It was almost better than the amazing pussy wrapped around his cock. His girlfriend had a whole human being inside her, masturbating, and the only thing better than feeling from the outside would be if he could join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh, sorry babe. I couldn\u2019t hear you over the sound of your stomach smothering me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess that is pretty distracting,\u201d Lori conceded before repeating her prior concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? I thought you loved my cream filling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but I prefer it here.\u201d Lori gestured. \u201cYou probably can\u2019t see it, but I\u2019m literally pointing at my pussy right now. Speaking of\u2026\u201d She trailed off as she hefted her tremendous weight up. It was only a couple of inches, but the drop back down caused the mattress to creak under the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh!\u201d Bobby moaned. Lori\u2019s warm belly was so deliciously soft and it sounded like the woman inside was really getting into her self-pleasuring. He wanted to move, to hump back and show Lori how much he cared, but could only manage to hug her gut more insistently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori felt the excitement of both her food and her lover. It was adorable that Bobby was trying so hard to fight against her crushing weight. Meanwhile, her food laughed hysterically as she went to town on herself. A part of the blonde regretting eating the woman before sharing her with Bobby. He wasn\u2019t the only one who liked to watch, but she needed his jizz in <i>her</i> pussy tonight, where it belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s excitement was further bolstered when she noticed movement under the door. A pred\u2019s peripheral vision was better than that of prey, so she was fully aware that she was being watched. She\u2019d also deliberately left the door open a crack in anticipation of her usual audience. \u201cOh, Bobby! I love riding your cock. Nnnf! Give it to me, Bubu-Bear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing my best babe,\u201d Bobby chuckled, still largely immobilized. \u201cHehe. Hey, I think this chick is sitting on my face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that reminds me. Leni was asking when you\u2019ll come over next. She\u2019s been longing for one of her favorite cushions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but only if you guys remember to record this time. You can\u2019t ask me to miss two hot sisters making out twice in a row.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, Bubu-Bear.\u201d Lori underwent the herculean effort to bend forward. Her belly was quite the obstacle to overcome, but in time, her body gave in to her demands and her food managed to flatten herself out. Bobby\u2019s face was finally in reach and she commenced with peppering his face in kisses. As she did, she also made sure to lift her butt up just enough to that any looky-loos would have an unobstructed view of not only her perfect ass, but also where she and Bobby were fused as one. Staring into her beloved\u2019s eyes, she began bouncing atop his cock. She was gentle at first, wanting to build up anticipation before the final climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Lori! This\u2026 amazing!\u201d Bobby gasped. Finally, he could reach over her stomach and grabbed her shoulders. He couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say, so he pressed his lips to hers and offered out his tongue to play with. There was so much more of her that he wished to touch to show his affection, but his love\u2019s happy moans told him that this was enough. And her food\u2019s orgasmic wailing wasn\u2019t bad, either. Finally, Bobby exploded into his ravenous love as she cried out to the heavens. His whole body tensed for several agonizing seconds before going limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smiled her adoration and cupped his cheek. He was still conscious; a significant improvement from their first lovemaking. He was no Lincoln, and never would be, but that was fine by her. Coming down from her orgasmic hi, she was happy with both these guys in her life. Besides, there were more than just the guys in her life to think about right now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting just outside the door to her brother\u2019s room, Ronnie kept stealing looks up at the clock. Her mom wouldn\u2019t be home for a while, but she couldn\u2019t shake this feeling of urgency as she peeked through the door crack. Lori was going to town on her brother. The way her womanly assets jiggled with every bounce made the girl\u2019s mouth water. Bobby looked so happy hugging and kissing the stomach that pinned him. This was his fetish, as she\u2019d learned from all the other times she\u2019d watched. Was it hers, though? Did she have a thing for being crushed under a giant stomach? That wasn\u2019t something Lincoln could ever do for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln! That stupid jerk. Even watching her brother get pounded under his Amazonian girlfriend, somehow, that stupid white boy kept invading her thoughts. Worse, she was pretty sure that she\u2019d started thinking about him around the time her hand had slipped into her shorts. She imagined Lincoln\u2019s face twisted in bliss like Bobby\u2019s while her probing fingers were the cock that had satisfied \u2013 to the best of her understanding \u2013 nine preds. Her imagination couldn\u2019t quite make sense of how all these things fit together, but it was making her so hot trying to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard a car drive up. \u201cOh crap!\u201d Ronnie whispered and made a break for the bathroom. She splashed her face with cold water and flushed the toilet to cover the hairdryer blowing. She couldn\u2019t afford to let anyone see her in this state. The front door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoneys, I\u2019m home,\u201d Maria announced as she set her supplies down. This was weird. She expected at least one of her kids to greet her at the door for arriving so early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Ms. Santiago. Bobby\u2019s a little\u2026 indisposed right now,\u201d Lori explained delicately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Lori. Well, that explains where Bobby is,\u201d Maria laughed, still putting everything up and not yet looking her way. \u201cAnd how many times do I have to tell you. Call me Mari-A!\u201d she yelped upon seeing the blonde girl, her massive trembling stomach, and her total nudity. Maria\u2019s cheeks reddened as her voice failed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d Lori rubbed the back of her head while her eyes glinted with a predatory glean. \u201cI\u2019m used to nudity not being a big deal at my house. If you want, I can go change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Maria called, surprising herself with her volume before Lori even made it two steps. \u201cI-I mean, y-you\u2019re our guest. You and Bobby are so close and I-I want you to be comfortable,\u201d she explained as her eyes drank in the voluptuous high school student. Lori\u2019s curvaceous figure was nothing to scoff at, but easily her most eye-catching feature was that big round stomach protruding in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie, meanwhile, had poked her head out to see what was happening, and what a scene she stumbled upon. It took great effort just to tear her eyes from Lori\u2019s sumptuous ass to take in her mother\u2019s expression. All things considered, it was a pretty standard reaction to full-frontal Loudness. Maria\u2019s chest rose and fell with her heavy breaths, her cheeks were flushed, and there could be no doubt what was running through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori, mindful of her audience\u2019s return, smiled and approached. \u201cMaria. Right. I can\u2019t thank you enough for opening up your home to me.\u201d She stepped up and took the woman\u2019s hands in hers in an appreciative gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was acutely aware of the squirming stomach poking hers. She was equally aware of the girl\u2019s other endearing assets. Maria was quite a lovely woman and had taken good care of herself over the years. She\u2019d always been popular in school, but never had more than a passing fancy in the same sex. Seeing Lori\u2019s beautiful body presented before her, jiggling from the contents of her stomach, was making her rethink some things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind if I grabbed some juice? Bobby\u2019s pretty tuckered out after I rode his cock and could use some fluids,\u201d Lori explained without even the pretense of tact. Maria just nodded as the blonde went over to the fridge and bent over far more than necessary in search of juice. She\u2019d found it immediately, but that was no reason not to sway her massive ass back and forth. She could almost feel Maria\u2019s eyes on her butt and almost hear what the older woman was craving. The cool air of the fridge felt pleasant against her sweaty boobs as she maintained her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie didn\u2019t know how to feel when she saw her mother step forward. Maria appeared to have been hypnotized with her mouth agape and hands reaching out in longing. Luckily, a car blared its horn outside and snapped her back to reality. Ronnie felt a blend of relief and disappointment as her mom retreated to a safe and respectful distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPursing her lips, Lori finally retrieved the juice and turned back to Maria. If luring wouldn\u2019t work, then there was always the direct approach. \u201cBy any chance, have you ever had sex with other women?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-er-um\u2026\u201d Maria stammered. \u201cI mean, I experimented a little in college, but it never went too far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori grinned. \u201cIf you want, my door\u2019s literally always open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t think that would be appropriate. You\u2019re too young and possibly my future daughter-in-law.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori scoffed. \u201cSo? I have sex with my mom all the time. It\u2019s great. Usually, I end up inside her right after, which is like the icing on the cake. Come to think of it, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever been eaten, have you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria swallowed, but remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re really missing out,\u201d Lori said while stroking her less-wiggly belly. \u201cPlenty of people pay out the wazoo for the chance to be intimate with a pred, but Bobby\u2019s special. I eat him whenever he wants and he doesn\u2019t pay a dime because I love him.\u201d Lori\u2019s grin grew sly. \u201cYa know, as my future mother-in-law, I could extend the same deal to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously, I don\u2019t want to put pressure on you. You don\u2019t have to answer right away. If you want, we could even schedule an appointment with me on FindAPred and we can just ignore the fees. I\u2019ve eaten plenty of women, so I know what the ladies like. I know the best places to touch, to lick, and to squeeze that make my meals cry their hearts out.\u201d Lori\u2019s free hand began massaging her breast as she spoke. \u201cI could show you a night of passion you\u2019ll never forget, and then finish it off by embracing you like no one ever has before. Just imagine it. You\u2019d be inside me, surrounded by my powerful muscles, and held in my loving embrace. My walls would massage you like no professional ever could, purging all those nasty aches and making you feel like a new woman.\u201d Even without her words, the way Lori was looking Maria over left no doubt what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria cleared her throat. \u201cTh-thank you for the offer, L-Lori. I-I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the first time can be a little scary, but trust me. I will literally make it worth your while.\u201d With a final suggestive wink, Lori departed. She pretended not to notice the door closing as she returned to Bobby\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lori was out of sight, Maria caught herself on the kitchen counter to keep from falling. Lori had never been that forward with her, before. The pred had long ago made it clear her desire to her boyfriend\u2019s mom. Preds stereotypically wanted to eat everyone they saw. However, the way the blonde had looked at her just then, Maria had the feeling that she was seconds away from being kidnapped to her bedroom, having her clothes ripped off, and ravished from head to toe by the younger woman. Likewise, Maria had the feeling that she\u2019d offer no resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar thoughts ran through Ronnie\u2019s mind. She wondered what her mom might do if Lori initiated something. When a pred really wanted something, there wasn\u2019t a lot that prey could do to stop them. Whether by instinct or cultural conditioning, most prey just went along with the pred\u2019s desires and enjoyed the moment. If that happened to her mom\u2026 Ronnie would want to watch, for which she felt a notable absence of guilt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing in the middle of Luna and Luan\u2019s room, Lincoln stared blankly at the bottom bunk after being summoned. \u201cUh, what am I looking at?\u201d He was looking at Luan, naked from the waist down, and holding a naked blushing Hispanic girl around his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Lincoln. This is Alice,\u201d Luan cheerfully introduced. One hand held onto Alice\u2019s hip while the other teased across her flat chest and made her moan. \u201cSay \u2018hello\u2019, Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello, Alice,\u201d she said breathily as she leaned into Luan\u2019s touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha. Nice one. Anyway, I was wondering if you could do me a solid and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck her,\u201d Lincoln cut Luan off, already pulling his pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan\u2019s smiled lasciviously when she spied the tent in his undies. \u201cWay to <i>rise</i> to the occasion, <i>little</i> bro. Ha-ha. But seriously, Alice asked to be eaten, but also to lose her virginity. Normally, I\u2019d do it myself, but then I thought, \u2018Hey. Wouldn\u2019t this little cutie enjoy an actual cock up her pussy instead of just my stellar tongue?\u2019\u201d she narrated before forming a V with her fingers and sticking her tongue between. \u201cAnd so here you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! He\u2019s so\u2026 big,\u201d awed Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a ten-year-old, yeah. He\u2019s the biggest on the block,\u201d agreed Luan with a chortle. \u201cSo what d\u2019ya say? Want to smash some taco? Ha-ha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Lincoln said, now fully naked. Something was nibbling at the back of the boy\u2019s mind. His sisters had been acting suspicious all day, though he couldn\u2019t speculate why. Confronting Luan directly wouldn\u2019t get him anywhere, except at the business end of a prank or shoved up her ass. He\u2019d have to be clever about this. \u201cSo, how are we doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan showed off her braces in a wide grin as she adjusted Alice to lie down with her head resting between the pred\u2019s spread knees. The future meal stared transfixed up at Luan\u2019s neatly trimmed pubes and dripping slit, likely oblivious to what was in store for her. With her hands gently holding Alice\u2019s shoulders, Luan said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to you. Let\u2019s see how you handle an ordinary prey girl instead of a sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven carte blanche to do as he liked, Lincoln climbed up near Alice\u2019s bottom half. She was scrawny and still a ways off from hitting puberty. There was no body-hair to speak of and she was shaking with anxiety, unable to choose who to stare at. Lincoln smiled warmly, leaned forward, and cupped her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be gentle, okay. It\u2019ll hurt a little at first, but I promise I\u2019ll make you feel great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded blankly, resigned to her fate, while Luan cooed. \u201cThat\u2019s the ticket, Lincoln. Sell her on the ride of her young life. Ha-ha. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing good-naturedly, he grabbed the girl\u2019s knees and gently pried them apart. She resisted at first. \u201cIf it helps, just focus on Luan. You probably saw videos of how much fun people had being eaten. Try thinking about that if it helps you relax.\u201d He watched the girls exchange looks as Alice finally relaxed, granting him access. Her young pussy was already moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, bro. Prey girls can be skittish about these things, so smart move calming her down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln stared inquisitively at Luan. \u201cUh, yeah? I know this. I was basically telling Lucy that a little bit ago,\u201d he recounted while scooching between Alice\u2019s legs. Still staring at Luan, he touched the tip of his cock to Alice\u2019s lower lips and made her flinch. \u201cHey, don\u2019t be scared. I\u2019ve done this with plenty of girls I know what the ladies like,\u201d he said with a confident smirk and a suggestive eyebrow bounce, making both girls laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s just nice to sit back and watch a pro at work,\u201d commented Luan. One hand reached down to spread her pussy for Alice to gawk at while the other kept its hold of her shoulder. She\u2019d have liked to just sit on the girl\u2019s face already, but that would compromise the test. She wanted to study Lincoln\u2019s technique with prey girls \u2013 especially virgins \u2013 to see if and where improvement was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Lincoln inserted himself into Alice. She tensed, but he just kept smiling and offering words of assurance until she relaxed. \u201cOkay, brace yourself,\u201d he warned after hitting an obstruction. This was the moment. After sucking in a breath and motioning her to do the same, Lincoln dropped his lips onto Alice\u2019s. She went bug-eyed while he simultaneously thrust inside. Lincoln paused his pelvic movements to let her body adjust to the surge of pain while drawing attention to the kiss. When tears pooled in her eyes, he kissed them away. And when that resulted in a look of confusion, Lincoln smiled and playfully licked her nose, prompting a light giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan bit her lip. Damn, that was cute. Both young faces were flushed. Alice\u2019s raspy panting was countered by Lincoln\u2019s more controlled breathing. The novice was following the expert\u2019s cues to keep calm as he slowly guided her through the experience. It took all of Luan\u2019s self-control to not shove both of their heads up her twat then and there. Having a couple of cute kids fucking inside of her pussy would have been the best thing ever right now. However, that could wait. For now, she needed to observe more. Sinking her fingers inside herself up to the knuckles would have to suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln carefully inserted himself all the way to the base, making Alice\u2019s breath hitch. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl. You took my whole cock. How\u2019s it feel?\u201d he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice\u2019s answer was to wrap her arms around Lincoln\u2019s back and pull him into another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t quote me, but I think she\u2019s into it being into her. Hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln carefully pulled himself from the tight virgin pussy. The walls gripping his shaft felt electrifying and his partner\u2019s moans were like honey to his ears. One hand migrated to grab onto her tight little butt cheek while the other tested the sensitivity of her flat chest. The former got a stronger reaction, so he focused his attention on kneading her ass. It gave him better leverage to push back in, anyway. Alice\u2019s croaking moans were swallowed by Lincoln\u2019s kiss as he asserted himself with greater force. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve gotten past the hard part,\u201d he panted. \u201cNow, let\u2019s give you what you paid for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging Alice to be on the tougher side, Lincoln really picked up the pace. The room echoed with wet slaps, muffled moans, and other sounds of lewdness as he slammed his hips against hers. Her hands and feet went wild along his back as they struggled to find leverage, but his relentless pounding always denied them. Alice\u2019s temperature was climbing as she writhed against him. Once, Lincoln turned his head while maintaining the kiss to look at Luan. Her breathing was just as heavy as she furiously masturbated above him. He shot her a knowing grin before returning to his sister\u2019s meal/client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln slammed into Alice at full force, shifting her atop the covers. He sat up to catch his breath, only for her mewling cries to suddenly become muffled again. Alice\u2019s face had disappeared between Luan\u2019s pussy lips. The pred could no longer restrain herself as she pulled the girl in by her shoulders. Smiling, Lincoln aided with even harder impacts into the former virgin. The siblings inched closer to one another as more of the girl disappeared into Luan. The pred set her hands on her brother\u2019s shoulders and passionately kissed him. Likewise, Lincoln removed his hands from the girl\u2019s ass and grabbed hold of Luan\u2019s perky tits. Once a lover, Alice had been reduced to a mere toy to facilitate the Louds\u2019 carnal desires. She had no complaints, given that this was the hottest and most intense experience of her young life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan felt Lincoln tense when he finally came into her pussy\u2019s meal. That tensing shot through the girl and made her extra squirmy within the pred\u2019s love tunnel. She grabbed Lincoln\u2019s hips and slammed him against her. Only Alice\u2019s legs were left kicking outside as the rest of her flailed wildly within her new confines. Luan flexed her vaginal muscles to pull the girl in faster, succeeding just in time to feel the final spurts of her brother\u2019s cum empty into her stretched yet sensitive opening. They held one another as Luan slurped up the last of her meal into her lower lips and felt her curl up in her womb. Lincoln was not allowed to soften as his cock was rotated within her pussy as she passionately smashed her face against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Loud siblings, there was no purer expression of love. Not to mention that Luan got what she was after.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d passed out after their latest round, but she was content with the hot and sticky load he\u2019d pumped up her pussy. For now, she was passing the time on her phone when she got a text from Luan. \u2018Lincoln\u2019s skills,\u2019 it read. Mindful that she may still have an audience, Lori disappeared into Bobby\u2019s private bathroom, locked the door, and called. \u201cSo what\u2019s the word?\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d Luan gushed. \u201cWait, why are we whispering?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Ronnie Anne might be listening. She\u2019s been watching me ride Bobby for a while, not to mention flirting with her mom. Her interest has literally been peaked, but never mind that. What\u2019s the deal with Lincoln? He\u2019s not too rough, is he?\u201d Lori felt a little awkward asking this. How Lincoln treated their meals had never been a factor before. All that mattered was making them squirm and filling them with his jizz, but that now posed an issue. He was so used to going full force with food and preds that he ran the risk of hurting any potential prey girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he was great. I picked a virgin and he was so tender with her. Touched her face, whispered that everything would be okay, gave her time to breathe, the whole nine yards. He was such a gentleman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori exhaled her relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. At least we won\u2019t have to worry about him breaking anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he diiid get a little rough towards the end,\u201d Luan added hesitantly. \u201cBut by then, I\u2019d also kinda lost control and was shoving her inside of me. He probably took that as permission to go full force. The one thing I can say for sure is that this girl ain\u2019t gonna walk straight for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori chuckled before turning thoughtful. \u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll probably have to give her and Lincoln some alone time so that they can practice. Having us around might trigger him to go wild.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan sighed despondently. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say that, but I guess it makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it does. You don\u2019t get to be the oldest in a big family without picking up a few tricks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I thought you got to be the oldest cuz the morning after their wedding, mom and dad both caught themselves humping in their sleep.\u201d Luan snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see it, but I\u2019m rolling my eyes,\u201d Lori informed. \u201cThe point is that Lincoln is good at sex with both preds and prey. Now, we need to test his skills in the boyfriend department. Holding open the door, taking her places she likes, and so on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Lincoln\u2019s always been pretty considerate when it comes to us. He fucked a virgin just cuz I asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but I still think there\u2019s room for improvement. We should-\u201d Lori paused when she heard the creaking of the floor outside the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019ll call you back.\u201d She hung up and then rushed to the door, unlocked it, and threw it open. Bobby was sitting off the edge of the bed and stretching awake. \u201cBubu-Bear? Did something happen?\u201d She looked around but saw no one else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Nah, babe. I was just,\u201d he yawned, \u201ctrying to wake up. You really tuckered me out good this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s expression softened as she closed the distance and planted a wet one on Bobby\u2019s cheek while pushing his side with her distended stomach. \u201cAnd you\u2019re doing a lot better. I\u2019m so proud of you, Bubu-Bear. By the way, you\u2019re mom\u2019s home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, wow. I must\u2019ve been\u2026\u201d Bobby trailed off when he looked at his naked girlfriend. \u201cWait. Did you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smirked and gestured down her body. \u201cGive Maria a full-frontal dose of glorious Loud? As a matter of fact, I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby went wide-eyed. \u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe knows what I\u2019m about. And she\u2019s\u2026 curious,\u201d she whispered into his ear. \u201cWhy? Are you\u2026 curious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you even need to ask,\u201d he gushed excitedly as his cock twitched back to life. \u201cSeeing you go down on my mom would be the hottest thing ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the same page, Bubu-Bear, but be patient.\u201d Lori hugged his side and nuzzled his cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s still a little antsy, so I\u2019m gonna take my time and make sure she really wants it before I do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, babe.\u201d Bobby then pulled her face to his as they sat together and started making out. The bed creaked under their combined weight as they sucked face and explored one another\u2019s bodies. Eventually, Bobby\u2019s alarm went off. He was late for one of his many part-time jobs and quickly threw on some clothes and deodorant before rushing out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow by herself atop the bed, Lori propped herself up on her hands and stared vacantly up at the ceiling. \u201cI really like the Santiago family,\u201d she said to no one in particular. \u201cBobby\u2019s my dream guy and Maria\u2019s a tall glass of water I can\u2019t wait to drink up.\u201d She slurped at the air. \u201cThat just leaves Ronnie Anne. A little on the brash side, but nice. I literally don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a single Loud that wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to try those sweet and spicy buns of hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, beneath the bed, Ronnie was fighting with all her might not to make a sound. It had been risky coming in here in the first place, but if she let herself be caught now, then\u2026 Well, she wasn\u2019t too sure what would happen; only that it would be bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe just needs to open up more,\u201d Lori continued. \u201cWe preds aren\u2019t ashamed of our sexuality. In fact, we flaunt it so that the whole world can enjoy. It\u2019s liberating being able to walk around and make out with anyone I think is cute. Not to mention seeing all the jealous looks on everyone else\u2019s faces when I don\u2019t pick them,\u201d she giggled. \u201cYup. Everybody wants a piece of us preds. Bobby gets his for free cuz I love him. And Lincoln\u2026 He might not be <i>as</i> free, but he\u2019s a sweet guy and a real beast in the sack. I wonder how he and Ronnie Anne might get along, though,\u201d she wondered aloud, her implication evident as she finally stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with Bobby gone, I guess I shouldn\u2019t overstay my welcome,\u201d Lori said as she found where she\u2019d tossed her clothes and slipped them back on. Slipping her panties back on, she made sure to shimmy them up in the way that gave her voluptuous assets their most enticing shake. The elastic material easily stretched over her stomach, even if most still hung over the top of her shorts. She checked herself over in the mirror to make sure that everything was smooth, and that her \u2018secret\u2019 audience was still paying attention. Satisfied that enough seeds had been planted, the eldest Loud sister made her departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lori was gone, Ronnie exhaled so intensely that she farted and got the hiccups all at once. She ached all over as she crawled out from under the bed. The room was ripe with the smell of sex and teen sweat; which she was sadly getting used to. Her panties were a mess and she could spot the fresh stains still on the bed. Luckily, it was Bobby\u2019s turn to do the laundry. Unluckily, she wasn\u2019t sure what Lori was doing with that monologue towards the end. She couldn\u2019t have known that Ronnie was there, otherwise, she\u2019d eat her in retaliation or something. Then again, that didn\u2019t seem right. That stuff she said about being patient with Maria was actually kind of sweet. Maybe there was more to preds than Ronnie had initially thought? Whatever the case, Ronnie knew that this matter required further investigation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the day winding down, Lincoln found himself in the living room playing video games in his underwear. Player 2 was Sam, dressed in her finest birthday suit and looking very pleased with herself. Luna sat to Sam\u2019s other side, not really paying attention to the game, but entertaining herself by fiddling with her girlfriend\u2019s hair and teasing her ticklish spots. Naturally, Lincoln was winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha! Hey, no fair,\u201d tittered Sam as she fended off a raspberry kiss from Luna. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna make me lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Babe, you know what seeing that hot bod does to me. I can\u2019t help myself.\u201d Luna draped herself over Sam\u2019s shoulders and began brazenly pinching her nipples, making the blonde squirm and moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you at least wait until the game is over?\u201d plead Lincoln. Alas, it was already too late as the Game Over sign appeared. \u201cDang it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, Luns. You cost us the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna scoffed and pulled the pair against her chest. \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry, guys. Is there anything I can do to make up for it?\u201d The look lascivious in her eyes left no doubt about what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuy us dinner.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s words left the pair stunned. \u201cYou heard me. You cost us the game, and that cost is a trip to the Burpin\u2019 Burger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we do pizza, instead? I\u2019m really craving a slice right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard the girl,\u201d affirmed Lincoln. \u201cYou\u2019re taking us out for pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna leveled a harsh stare at the high-fiving pair. \u201cReal harsh, dudes, but alright.\u201d The parents were informed of the last-minute date plans. While Sam and Lincoln got dressed, Luna texted the sisters that she\u2019d found the perfect chance to check Lincoln\u2019s skills on a date. And although they had to walk, the pizza joint was comfortably close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Luns showed me that new comic you got her, and I thought it was pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually called manga, but glad to hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. The up-and-coming musician plot really resonates with me. Can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d remarked Sam as she shot a playful wink at Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. There\u2019s nothing really wrong with the story and I like it alright, but, eh. I\u2019m not sure comics are really my thing, ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. Say, is there a way to, like, wrap the books in plastic so they can be read inside someone?\u201d inquired Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa\u2019s been working on that one for ages. Trying to slip each page into its own sleeve is a hassle that she hasn\u2019t been able to figure out,\u201d informed Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame. You guys could probably sell that stuff like crazy. Why hurt your eyes staring at a phone all belly ride when you can read a nice, wholesome book,\u201d remarked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re including porno mags on that list, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam met her grin with a hip-bump. \u201cNaturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe manga term is hentai and it\u2019s practically its own genre.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blinked at her brother. \u201cYou\u2019re joshin\u2019 me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shook her head. \u201cNope. The Japanese get away with all kinds of lewd stuff in their stories. They really love their dirty jokes and suggestive imagery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blinked again. \u201cDude. Why didn\u2019t you start me on <i>that</i> kind of book? That\u2019d be the easiest sell ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like someone just volunteered to join me on my next trip to the comic store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam raised her hand. \u201cOh-oh. Is it me? I\u2019ve been meaning to update my stash with some new blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. The both of you can come along the next time Clyde and I go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, like a double date?\u201d Sam teasingly elbowed Lincoln\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah-yeah. Whatever. What matters now is that you and I need to coordinate our efforts to make Luna a full-fledged comic convert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded solemnly. \u201cAgreed. This is a rare chance to show the second most amazing rocker I know the deep joys to be found between the pages of a comic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 second?\u201d asked Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMcSwagger takes first on stage, but you know you\u2019re prettier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. Fair enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio arrived at the restaurant not long after and Lincoln got the door. They grabbed a booth with Lincoln sitting opposite the girls so that they could play footsies under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, aside from reading, what do you like to do when inside Luna?\u201d asked Lincoln casually. \u201cDo you play on your phone, nap, or do you enjoy torturing her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. A little of all three. It all depends on the mood, ya know. Though if I could, I\u2019d want to bring my guitar in there,\u201d Sam said while patting Luna\u2019s stomach. \u201cI bet no one\u2019s ever tried acoustics like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s eyes darted around. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rubbed the back of her head. \u201cI convinced Luan to go inside me with an old base to see what would happen. That, uh, was not a fun trip to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln flinched in sympathetic pain. \u201cI remember that. It\u2019s basically the reason for the unofficial rule about not eating anything bigger than a shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hissed and squirmed in her seat. \u201cYouch. Uh, I guess I don\u2019t really need to do that much when I\u2019m inside Luns. In her stomach, up her butt, or even snug and cozy in her heavenly womb,\u201d her eyelids fluttered, \u201cI guess the only thing I really like doing is singing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d cooed Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Linc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m the same. There\u2019s no better place to nap than inside a pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear that, Luns? You\u2019re our personal mobile sleeping bag,\u201d teased Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst class all the way, baby!\u201d Luna emphasized her point with a long, broad lick across Sam\u2019s cheek. Then she noticed Lincoln\u2019s wistful sigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You two look so cute together. I guess it just now hit me that I\u2019ve never been on an actual date with anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, I find it hard to believe,\u201d commented Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. What about the Sadie Hawkins Dance? You had four dates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrection. I had four girls who were nice enough, but never clicked with me. I\u2019m just glad they all found guys they could actually hang out with. I\u2019ve tried with other girls, but nothing ever came of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it.\u201d Sam reached across the table and took Lincoln\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a great guy, Linc. You\u2019re smart, funny, cute, and you\u2019re great in the sack.\u201d Sam\u2019s eyebrow wiggle made the boy blush. \u201cAny girl would be lucky to have you.\u201d<br>\r\nContinue here 4,600<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got ya there, bro. Ya just gotta be patient and Ms. Right will come along before ya know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you looking for in a date, anyway?\u201d asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I guess kind of what we have.\u201d Lincoln gestured between himself and the girls. \u201cFriends that have fun hanging out, but also get intimate.\u201d He turned to Luna. \u201cSay, any chance Sam could be girlfriend to both of us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna shook her head and smiled apologetically as she possessively pulled Sam in close. \u201cSorry, bro. I don\u2019t mind loaning out my bae to the rest of the fam, but she\u2019s mine all the way through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d Sam chuckled as she turned Luna\u2019s face towards hers as they stared into one another\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough we\u2019ll definitely keep you in mind when we feel like havin\u2019 kids,\u201d Luna added as her foot reached out and pressed between Lincoln\u2019s legs. \u201cYou\u2019d make the perfect baby daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln blushed heavily and averted his gaze. He looked to Sam for her reaction and found only blissful contentment. The boy had figured that Luna would want him to be a sperm donor. She\u2019d dropped hints here and there in the past, though this was his first solid confirmation. He didn\u2019t mind, however. Being raised by preds had warped his concept of a happy and healthy family, so fathering kids with his older sister\u2019s wife seemed perfectly reasonable. Even so, he was still just a kid, himself, so the idea of becoming a parent was still pretty wild. Luckily, the pizza had arrived before Lincoln\u2019s imagination could spiral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere shall our little quasi-date go next?</span></div></div>",

Even Luna, wanting to be polite, took bites like a regular person instead of scarfing down her three pies all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled as she watched her girlfriend. \u201cWow. I almost never see you eat like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019m not that hungry,\u201d Luna remarked after finishing her fifth slice in as many minutes. \u201cBesides, this place does good pizza. It\u2019d be a shame not to enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuna\u2019s always been a slower eater, especially when it comes to prey. She\u2019s one of the few sisters that almost never forgets to eat her food out before eating them up,\u201d remarked Lincoln after finishing his first slice. He noted a few nearby tables go silent at his words and softly laughed. \u201cFunny how people always hone in on the juiciest parts of a conversation, especially without context.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Luns is such a sweetheart. When we\u2019re in bed and she\u2019s licking me all over, I sometimes wonder which of us is enjoying it more,\u201d Sam added with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say it all depends on <i>where</i> she\u2019s licking. If it\u2019s your arm or back, that\u2019d be her, but you\u2019re definitely getting more out of it when she licks somewhere sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot true, dudes. Erogenous zones taste waaay better than the rest. Licking your boobs and butt is not only fun, but it\u2019s yummier than stuff like your arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam giggled. \u201cWell, that would certainly explain a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the hands and feet?\u201d Lincoln asked. \u201cLisa said those parts are extra flavorful because of all the stuff they touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but there\u2019s a difference between flavorful and good. If you threw everything in the kitchen in a stew and boiled it, that would be flavorful, but not as good as something cooked properly. I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 I don\u2019t like tasting hands and feet, but I\u2019d rather have a <i>juicy</i> slice of pie.\u201d Luna\u2019s remarks made the others snicker. \u201cI\u2019m also partial to wieners, but I\u2019m picky about the brand.\u201d That got even more snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem,\u201d fake coughed a woman who\u2019d come up to the booth. She was middle-aged with clothes meant for a slimmer body and a beehive haircut. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, you\u2019re saying some very inappropriate things right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming from his giggle fit, Lincoln spoke first. \u201cSorry, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll be quieter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be quieter. I want you to behave yourselves,\u201d she asserted while ignoring Lincoln. \u201cFor god\u2019s sakes, you have a child with you. Don\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna patted herself as if searching for something. \u201cShoot. I knew I forgot something. Must\u2019ve left it back with my lucky panties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the outside, Sam leaned over to position herself between Luna and the irate woman. \u201cDon\u2019t mind her. She\u2019s a pred. You know how they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s eyes narrowed as she playfully growled. \u201cOh, yer gonna pay for that, later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCounting on it,\u201d Sam whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what she is,\u201d she said obnoxiously. \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for poor manners in a public restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically, most restaurants are private,\u201d Lincoln corrected, letting his inner smartass out to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, brat!\u201d spat the woman. \u201cNow, all three of you listen here. My name is Karen,\u201d Sam snorted a laugh, \u201cand I\u2019m a big deal around here. If you don\u2019t start behaving, I\u2019ll call the manager and have you thrown out. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booth sitters were momentarily dumbstruck. This sort of behavior was entirely new to all of them. The two prey slowly and deliberately turned to face Luna, who seemed as shocked as the rest of them at the sheer audacity of this stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBitch, do you even know what a pred is?\u201d Luna questioned with naked wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? How dare you speak to me this way. Manager! Someone call the manager.\u201d Karen scanned the room until she spotted a waitress. \u201cYou there. Go get your manager right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress looked between Karen and Luna. \u201cUh, I\u2019m not sure what that would accomplish. I think I\u2019ll just let nature take its course,\u201d she said before turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you people?\u201d Karen demanded of the other shocked patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not as stupid as you,\u201d Luna said with deadly seriousness. Sam had hurried out of her seat to give hier girlfriend room. Now at her full height, Luna stood a good head and a half taller than Karen. The older woman hesitated only briefly at the imposing sight, but doubled down on her self-righteous crusade. However, before Karen could say anything, Luna slapped a hand over her mouth and lifted her up in the air. \u201cOne moment, guys. I gotta take care of something.\u201d Luna then carried her future food off to the bathroom. The restaurant went dead silent for a bit before the sounds of struggling could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what was with that lady?\u201d Lincoln asked, trying to reset the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. She must not be from around here, but even so,\u201d Sam added, ignoring the brief scream from the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone disrespect a pred like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it a few times, but they usually back off the moment they find out they\u2019re harassing someone who can-\u201d A loud thud was heard. \u201c\u2026 that. Someone who can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel sorry for her,\u201d Sam said while staring at her pizza. \u201cPoor Luns. She always looks so happy when she eats happy people. I hope that nasty hag doesn\u2019t give her a stomach ache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilver lining. If she does, then it\u2019s on you to give her a belly massage,\u201d informed Lincoln to Sam\u2019s cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna emerged from the bathroom rubbing her unsurprisingly swollen middle. However, rather than a bulge that hung over her skirt, the swelling was more concentrated around her abdomen. Only the pred\u2019s fellow booth sitters spotted the subtle indication that Luna had taken her prey up the ass instead of down the throat. Luna still had a sour expression when a man approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, excuse me.\u201d He flinched when Luna leveled a scowl on him. \u201cYes, sorry. Stupid question, but did you just\u2026?\u201d He indicated her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat that bitch? Yeah. Left her gawdy clothes on the floor. Why? Got a problem with that?\u201d Luna asked in warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite the opposite,\u201d said the man with a relieved smile. \u201cThat woman\u2019s made my life a living hell for years. You just saved me the trouble of a lengthy divorce.\u201d He offered his hand to shake, which Luna eventually took. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s spirits finally lifted. \u201cHey, no problem, dude. Ah\u2019m just a humble pred doin\u2019 her part to improve the world and give people what they ask for.\u201d When her belly started shaking with muffled screams, the rocker punched herself in the gut. \u201cAnd this bitch was definitely askin\u2019 for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed like he\u2019d just won the lottery and handed Luna every bill in his wallet. He then paid for his meal by card and left, practically skipping out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table couldn\u2019t be adjusted, so Luna had to sit facing out of the booth to avoid being cramped. \u201cWell, that was an ordeal,\u201d she huffed. \u201cThough I\u2019m surprised neither of you came along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, were we supposed to help?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m still learning the rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. That bitch didn\u2019t stand a chance against a pred like me,\u201d boasted Luna. \u201cI just know how much you like to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally, yes. However,\u201d Sam grimaced, \u201cI don\u2019t think there was anything hot about watching that woman get what was coming to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame,\u201d agreed Lincoln as he resumed eating, relatively unfazed by recent events. \u201cEarlier, I fucked a girl into Luan, but there was no chance I\u2019d stick my dick in <i>that</i>.\u201d He gestured to Luna\u2019s middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally understood, bro. That bitch was so caked perfume that I couldn\u2019t even taste her skin. Nasty. So, I figured I\u2019d show her a little nastiness in return.\u201d Luna unleashed a thunderous belch that shook the restaurant. \u201c\u2018Scuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow where shall the date go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Lincoln read, Lola had called a secret sibling meeting. Upon seeing how serious she was, everyone dropped what they were doing and gathered in Lori and Leni\u2019s room. They took up their usual sitting arrangements, with the exception of Leni still being inside of Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal-e-o, li\u2019l sis?\u201d asked the rocker. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Lincoln? Shouldn\u2019t he be here, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola took up the presenter position on the wall opposite the beds. \u201cLincoln is the subject of this meeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled sounds came from Luna\u2019s gut, with the rocker electing to translate. \u201cLeni wants to go on record that she\u2019s not comfortable with talking about Link behind his back. I\u2019d like to second that motion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan raised her hand. \u201cThird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this even about, Lola?\u201d questioned Lori before things got out of hand and everyone walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was just thinking that maybe\u2026 possibly\u2026. We miiight be a little too hard on Lincoln.\u201d At Lola\u2019s words, she was immediately met with an uproar of accusations and denials from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roll of her eyes, Lori joined the pink sister in the presenting spot, picked up her gavel, and tapped it to her desk. \u201cOrder. Order in the\u2026 room. Let Lola say her piece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll decide if she needs to be shoved up Lana\u2019s butt after the fact.\u201d Lori turned a warning look on the smaller blonde, giving her the chance to reconsider her position. Lola, to the surprise of none, stubbornly refused to back down. \u201cVery well. You may speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d Lola cleared her throat and addressed her audience. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not trying to suggest anything crazy like we should stop eating him. I think we can all agree that he\u2019s our favorite boy to swallow.\u201d That got a round of affirmatives from the sisters. \u201cBut he\u2019s more than just a yummy treat. He\u2019s our brother.\u201d She indicated her dress. \u201cHe just finished repairing my dress for me and all he wanted in return was a safe escort back to his room. And that\u2019s just the latest example. I saw all of you,\u201d she pointed between the three eldest sisters, \u201cand mom asking him for stuff earlier. You\u2019d basically cornered him with no way out except into someone\u2019s gut. Does that seem fair to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s prey, dudette. Going inside a predator is kinda his thing,\u201d Luna argued, not sounding like she fully believed her own words. \u201cUgh, speak up Leni. I don\u2019t want to be your translator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just saying that all I wanted was a tummy rub, and maybe a little naked snuggling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Lola said skeptically. \u201cMeaning you were gonna crush him under that giant gut of yours.\u201d Leni had no reply as Lola looked up to Luna. \u201cAnd you. Do you really have to say that you don\u2019t view Lincoln as a real man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon, dudette. He knows I\u2019m just foolin\u2019 around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat <i>is</i> a little on the mean side,\u201d added Luan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeak, fam,\u201d Luna griped. \u201cI was gonna shove the little dude up my pussy.\u201d She patted her swollen gut. \u201cHe\u2019d been looking down lately, so I thought I\u2019d do him a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy backing him into a corner?\u201d deadpanned Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna opened her mouth to argue her point, but nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori threw up her hands defensively. \u201cHey, whoa now. Before we get ahead of ourselves, I had a phone rattling around in my stomach. You all know how annoying that is. I really thought it was his, so it made sense for him to get it. Besides, he said it was nice of me to not digest what I thought was his.\u201d She folded her arms in vindication. \u201cSo there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is that we all push Lincoln around too much. He\u2019s more than just our prey and we need to show him how much we like him for more than his taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you proposing?\u201d Lori asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple ideas, but I\u2019d like to put it out to the floor. Let\u2019s think of something we can do for Lincoln to show how much he means to us\u2026 that doesn\u2019t involve vore.\u201d That last part got a round of whines and complaints, but ultimately they agreed. Now they just had to think of something.</span></div></div>",

Lincoln Loud here,\u201d he said, beginning the morning by breaking the fourth wall. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why my room looks so different. Well, that\u2019s because it is. It\u2019s actually my sister Lori\u2019s old doll house. See, I was born a minizora. That means that at a mere three inches tall, I don\u2019t have much chance of getting any bigger, but that\u2019s life. And really, my life is pretty great, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got loving parents, ten awesome sisters, and pets that actually don\u2019t want to chew on me. Then there are my clothes, a private TV, game station, comics, and pretty much all the essentials of life at a miniature size. I even have a private bathroom, though it\u2019s more like a tiny porta-potty that needs to be emptied once a week. Really, I\u2019m pretty lucky. Granted, being so small, I\u2019m pretty dependent on my sisters for a lot of stuff. I\u2019m basically not allowed to go anywhere outside the house unless one of them is carrying me. Worse, because I\u2019m so small and cute, most of the time they insist on carrying me inside their clothes. That can get pretty nasty when one of them has a gas attack. Bleh. But usually it\u2019s fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom and sisters have really soft, warm bodies, so except for a bad gas attack, I don\u2019t mind being carried around in someone\u2019s bra or even panties. And being a minizora, I\u2019m durable enough that I can take pretty much whatever life throws at me, even my family using me as a communal sex toy. Again, not usually a problem. My family does so much for me and it\u2019s nice that I can give something back. It\u2019s like my household chore. Certainly beats taking out the trash, I can tell you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock at the dollhouse door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it looks like my day is about to get started.\u201d Lincoln casually headed over to the red plastic door, ready to greet the world with a smile on his face, but who was there to greet him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood morning, baby bro,\u201d greeted the eldest Loud sister as she opened the wall of the doll house. Lori was blonde, like their mother, and took after her in a lot of other ways. Blessed by Rita\u2019s genes, she had the same curves, full chest, and hips that just wouldn\u2019t stop as the woman who birthed her. Her smile was kind, but also a little condescending as she looked into her younger brother\u2019s little apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lori,\u201d Lincoln replied casually, waving as he sat on the edge of his bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts breakfast time, dork. And it\u2019s my turn for Lincoln duty today, so you know what that means,\u201d she said with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln scratched his chin, rubbed the back of his neck, and went through several other thoughtful poses as he paced, pretending to wonder. \u201cLet me see here. Hmm. Does it mean\u2026 I\u2019m going in your underwear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori tittered, reached into the doll house, and scooped up her littlest sibling. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer before depositing him into her cleavage. It was the most convenient position for all involved, keeping the carrier\u2019s hands free while affording Lincoln a decent view. Not to mention he felt really good wiggling against a pair of sensitive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s bosoms were soft and just a little bit squishy, making them ideal for reclining. Lincoln did just that, or at least as best he could while his lower half was wedged within boob flesh. He gave a contented sigh and spread his hands out, feeling the way his sister\u2019s skin bristled with goose bumps. It was a nice feeling. \u201cOh, you know. Just a feeling,\u201d he replied blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey!\u201d whined Leni. Second oldest, her figure was almost as curvy as Lori\u2019s, though she had more of a ditzy charm that tended to draw in more boys. \u201cHow come you get Lincoln today? I thought it was supposed to be my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, before we made that bet, remember?\u201d Lori reminded smugly. \u201cYou lost, which means that your day now belongs to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was broken from his relaxation by the sight of his sad sister. Leni in particular was such an innocent soul that it actually hurt to see her upset. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what do you care? My boobs are bigger than hers, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had to struggle to twist around and face the tyrannical sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not about boobs. It\u2019s about being a good brother. Today was Leni\u2019s turn and you shouldn\u2019t have made that bet in the first place. Besides, just because it\u2019s your turn, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got me exclusively. Clyde\u2019s coming over today, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but I don\u2019t see the problem,\u201d Lori dismissed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be just fine doing whatever it is you guys do while staring at my chest all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grimaced. \u201cOkay, probably; but my point still stands. Besides, it\u2019s not like you asked me about this dumb bet. I might be a minizora, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat me as an object to be passed around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori scoffed down at the boy in her cleavage. \u201cLincoln, that\u2019s literally what being a minizora is all about. You can\u2019t look after yourself, so it\u2019s up to your family to keep you safe. And, as a part of this family, that means you\u2019ve got to pull your weight around here, bucko.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, I know, which is what I\u2019m arguing for. Today is supposed to be Leni\u2019s turn. She\u2019s been waiting over a week for this; and honestly, so have I. How can you just take away our day together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were going to go shopping,\u201d Leni sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Leni. You\u2019re too nice for your own good sometimes. Time with Lincoln is like time in the bathroom. You want it; you\u2019ve got to seize it when the other\u2019s aren\u2019t looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln heaved a heavy sigh. Lori wasn\u2019t wrong. He loved his sisters and liked spending time with them. The turns system was supposed to keep things fair. But alas, too often his sisters would get impatient. One minute he might be critiquing Lucy on her latest poem, and then she\u2019d turn her back and he\u2019d find himself in the audience of Luan\u2019s latest joke routine. And then there were all the things that happened outside the turns. Even if it was Lola\u2019s turn, Lyn would still get to borrow him by shoving him in her jockstrap and going through an elaborate exercise routine as part of her superstitious sports rituals. Then there were the deals. Sometimes it was a bet, but others it was like when Luna offered to do Lana\u2019s chores for a week if she got to bring Lincoln along for her date with Sam. That\u2026 had been a nice night. Admittedly, the system was pretty broken, but it was still preferable to total anarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Lincoln, it was actually Leni who delivered the winning argument. Not with eloquent words, as those had never been the blonde airhead\u2019s strong suit, but with action. Specifically, she started whimpering like a kicked puppy. Lincoln had to shield his eyes, for no one with a soul could withstand Leni\u2019s unparalleled pitifulness. Lori, however, wasn\u2019t so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d groused the eldest. \u201cI still won, so I\u2019m keeping Lincoln until lunch. You can have him after that. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni perked up immediately and rushed over, wrapping Lori in a constrictive embrace. \u201cThank-you-thank-you-thank-you! You\u2019re the best!\u201d As she gushed, she also unknowingly smothered her chest against Lincoln, compressing him between a boob and a soft place. Fortunately, he was used to this kind of treatment. The only surprising thing was that when Lori finally pushed Leni away, Lincoln was still wedged in Lori\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I know I\u2019m great,\u201d Lori replied, nonchalantly checking her nails as her free hand adjusted her bra. Though it was really an excuse to coax Lincoln into wiggling more. As every Loud sister knew, his little body was a boundless source of stimulation. \u201cOkay, Stinken,\u201d she said down to her boobs. \u201cReady to get this Saturday started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Start with the Louds at breakfast<br>\r\n2 Skip to something special Lori had planned</span></div></div>",

Lincoln Loud here,\u201d he said, beginning the morning by breaking the fourth wall. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why my room looks so different. Well, that\u2019s because it is. It\u2019s actually my sister Lori\u2019s old doll house. See, I was born a minizora. That means that at a mere three inches tall, I don\u2019t have much chance of getting any bigger, but that\u2019s life. And really, my life is pretty great, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got loving parents, ten awesome sisters, and pets that actually don\u2019t want to chew on me. Then there are my clothes, a private TV, game station, comics, and pretty much all the essentials of life at a miniature size. I even have a private bathroom, though it\u2019s more like a tiny porta-potty that needs to be emptied once a week. Really, I\u2019m pretty lucky. Granted, being so small, I\u2019m pretty dependent on my sisters for a lot of stuff. I\u2019m basically not allowed to go anywhere outside the house unless one of them is carrying me. Worse, because I\u2019m so small and cute, most of the time they insist on carrying me inside their clothes. That can get pretty nasty when one of them has a gas attack. Bleh. But usually it\u2019s fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom and sisters have really soft, warm bodies, so except for a bad gas attack, I don\u2019t mind being carried around in someone\u2019s bra or even panties. And being a minizora, I\u2019m durable enough that I can take pretty much whatever life throws at me, even my family using me as a communal sex toy. Again, not usually a problem. My family does so much for me and it\u2019s nice that I can give something back. It\u2019s like my household chore. Certainly beats taking out the trash, I can tell you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock at the dollhouse door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it looks like my day is about to get started.\u201d Lincoln casually headed over to the red plastic door, ready to greet the world with a smile on his face, but who was there to greet him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood morning, baby bro,\u201d greeted the eldest Loud sister as she opened the wall of the doll house. Lori was blonde, like their mother, and took after her in a lot of other ways. Blessed by Rita\u2019s genes, she had the same curves, full chest, and hips that just wouldn\u2019t stop as the woman who birthed her. Her smile was kind, but also a little condescending as she looked into her younger brother\u2019s little apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lori,\u201d Lincoln replied casually, waving as he sat on the edge of his bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts breakfast time, dork. And it\u2019s my turn for Lincoln duty today, so you know what that means,\u201d she said with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln scratched his chin, rubbed the back of his neck, and went through several other thoughtful poses as he paced, pretending to wonder. \u201cLet me see here. Hmm. Does it mean\u2026 I\u2019m going in your underwear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori tittered, reached into the doll house, and scooped up her littlest sibling. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer before depositing him into her cleavage. It was the most convenient position for all involved, keeping the carrier\u2019s hands free while affording Lincoln a decent view. Not to mention he felt really good wiggling against a pair of sensitive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s bosoms were soft and just a little bit squishy, making them ideal for reclining. Lincoln did just that, or at least as best he could while his lower half was wedged within boob flesh. He gave a contented sigh and spread his hands out, feeling the way his sister\u2019s skin bristled with goose bumps. It was a nice feeling. \u201cOh, you know. Just a feeling,\u201d he replied blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey!\u201d whined Leni. Second oldest, her figure was almost as curvy as Lori\u2019s, though she had more of a ditzy charm that tended to draw in more boys. \u201cHow come you get Lincoln today? I thought it was supposed to be my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, before we made that bet, remember?\u201d Lori reminded smugly. \u201cYou lost, which means that your day now belongs to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was broken from his relaxation by the sight of his sad sister. Leni in particular was such an innocent soul that it actually hurt to see her upset. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what do you care? My boobs are bigger than hers, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had to struggle to twist around and face the tyrannical sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not about boobs. It\u2019s about being a good brother. Today was Leni\u2019s turn and you shouldn\u2019t have made that bet in the first place. Besides, just because it\u2019s your turn, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got me exclusively. Clyde\u2019s coming over today, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but I don\u2019t see the problem,\u201d Lori dismissed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be just fine doing whatever it is you guys do while staring at my chest all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grimaced. \u201cOkay, probably; but my point still stands. Besides, it\u2019s not like you asked me about this dumb bet. I might be a minizora, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat me as an object to be passed around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori scoffed down at the boy in her cleavage. \u201cLincoln, that\u2019s literally what being a minizora is all about. You can\u2019t look after yourself, so it\u2019s up to your family to keep you safe. And, as a part of this family, that means you\u2019ve got to pull your weight around here, bucko.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, I know, which is what I\u2019m arguing for. Today is supposed to be Leni\u2019s turn. She\u2019s been waiting over a week for this; and honestly, so have I. How can you just take away our day together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were going to go shopping,\u201d Leni sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Leni. You\u2019re too nice for your own good sometimes. Time with Lincoln is like time in the bathroom. You want it; you\u2019ve got to seize it when the other\u2019s aren\u2019t looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln heaved a heavy sigh. Lori wasn\u2019t wrong. He loved his sisters and liked spending time with them. The turns system was supposed to keep things fair. But alas, too often his sisters would get impatient. One minute he might be critiquing Lucy on her latest poem, and then she\u2019d turn her back and he\u2019d find himself in the audience of Luan\u2019s latest joke routine. And then there were all the things that happened outside the turns. Even if it was Lola\u2019s turn, Lyn would still get to borrow him by shoving him in her jockstrap and going through an elaborate exercise routine as part of her superstitious sports rituals. Then there were the deals. Sometimes it was a bet, but others it was like when Luna offered to do Lana\u2019s chores for a week if she got to bring Lincoln along for her date with Sam. That\u2026 had been a nice night. Admittedly, the system was pretty broken, but it was still preferable to total anarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Lincoln, it was actually Leni who delivered the winning argument. Not with eloquent words, as those had never been the blonde airhead\u2019s strong suit, but with action. Specifically, she started whimpering like a kicked puppy. Lincoln had to shield his eyes, for no one with a soul could withstand Leni\u2019s unparalleled pitifulness. Lori, however, wasn\u2019t so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d groused the eldest. \u201cI still won, so I\u2019m keeping Lincoln until lunch. You can have him after that. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni perked up immediately and rushed over, wrapping Lori in a constrictive embrace. \u201cThank-you-thank-you-thank-you! You\u2019re the best!\u201d As she gushed, she also unknowingly smothered her chest against Lincoln, compressing him between a boob and a soft place. Fortunately, he was used to this kind of treatment. The only surprising thing was that when Lori finally pushed Leni away, Lincoln was still wedged in Lori\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I know I\u2019m great,\u201d Lori replied, nonchalantly checking her nails as her free hand adjusted her bra. Though it was really an excuse to coax Lincoln into wiggling more. As every Loud sister knew, his little body was a boundless source of stimulation. \u201cOkay, Stinken,\u201d she said down to her boobs. \u201cReady to get this Saturday started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Start with the Louds at breakfast<br>\r\n2 Skip to something special Lori had planned<br>\r\n3 Skip to Leni getting her turn<br>\r\n4 Clyde comes over</span></div></div>",

The boy\u2019s only solace were his fairies, Cosmo and Wanda, who could grant him just about any wish he could think of. There were rules, of course. No killing, no messing with true love, no cheating in official competitions, yada-yada. However, in ruminating over Da Rulez, Timmy had a small epiphany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Wanda. I\u2019ve got a question,\u201d he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goldfish with pink eyes swam out from the little castle in the fish bowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, sport?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just thinking about Da Rulez. Specifically the part that says I can\u2019t wish anyone in or out of love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, sport. Even fairies can\u2019t go messing with stuff that powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, and I get that, but what about lust?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Say what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLust. Like, I can\u2019t wish someone would fall in love with me, but can I wish that they fell in lust with me? You know,\u201d his eyes shifted guiltily, \u201cjust curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Wanda pulled out a copy of Da Rulez and began flipping through the pages. Her expression paled as she read the book backwards and forwards. In time she noticed Timmy giving her an expectant look and figured that there was no point delaying the inevitable. \u201cUh\u2026 no. There are no rules on anything related to sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy rubbed his hands together. \u201cSweet. In that case, for my first wish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWish for sex.<br>\r\nWish for something more kinky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miguel and Tulio had been venturing through the strange jungle for days atop their nobly stolen steed, Altivo. Miguel was ever the optimist and even Tulio, after seeing how many land marks lined up perfectly with the map, was starting to come around. The pair eventually came upon a carved stone in front of a waterfall; the last marker on the map. However, there was no El Dorado, no city of gold. Tulio was infuriated that they\u2019d wasted their time and insisted that they should just get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as if by fate, at that exact moment a group of dark skinned natives emerged from the waterfall. In the lead was a woman who seemed to be struggling to escape. When the Spanish pair saw that she was being pursued by big men armed with spears, they tried to get Altivo to run, but the horse panicked when the woman ran into him. She was in a state of fear, understandably, but was still a lovely thing with long black hair that reach down to her shapely hips, clothing that showed an ample amount of skin, and a luscious full figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they\u2019d been surrounded, the men with spears said nothing, but motioned the trio and their animal to follow. They went behind the waterfall to reveal a dark cavern and a river. All boarded into boats and traveled a short distance. Those who thought themselves prisoners didn\u2019t say a word with guard monitoring them. However, the Spanish pair did notice how said men would stare with greater interest at them, only to turn away when caught. Maybe they were just intrigued by the newcomers. That seemed logical, although the con artist pair sensed that there was more to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the boats came out into the open and the Spanish pair was left in awe. El Dorado \u2013 for there was nothing else they could call it \u2013 was everything they\u2019d ever dreamed and more. Temples as tall as castles sparkled with golden light. Even lesser buildings made of stone and clay had a fondness for gold trimming. Now that they were out of the waterfall\u2019s fog, it was also clear that gold was a favorite jewelry for the people with most wearing gold necklaces or earrings. The people took just as much interest in the newcomers, if not more so. All gathered along the water\u2019s edge to get a look at these two who bore a remarkable resemblance to images carved on their holy walls. The girl, when noticed, was regarded with scorn for her blasphemous desecration, which she still cradled in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon docking, the prisoners were made to disembark. The Spanish duo mounted their horse while the girl trailed behind them. Then, as they were coming to terms with what would surely be their doom, both were surprised when an important looking native began to speak\u2026 and they understood him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold! As the prophecies foretold. The time of judgement is now!\u201d he said while gesturing dramatically as a fat man came up beside him, also looking very important. The first man continued and descended the stares to approach the \u2018prisoners\u2019. \u201cCitizens! Did I not predict that the gods would come to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel and Tulio were natural con artists. It had been their trade for most of their lives. Upon hearing the murmurs of the crowd and seeing where all eyes were focused, it didn\u2019t take long for them to read the room and concoct a scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lords,\u201d greeted the first man with gracious enthusiasm. \u201cI am Tzekel-Kan, your devoted high priest, and speaker for the gods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Chief Tannabok,\u201d introduced the fat man wearing a golden crown. \u201cWhat names may we call you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntroductions followed with Miguel and Tulio adopting regal poses and trying to sound authoritative. That seemed to please the audience. Then Tzekel-Kan grabbed the woman by the wrist, calling her a temple robbing thief, and asked the \u2018gods\u2019 how she should be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-no, my lords,\u201d she begged. \u201cSee, th-the gods sent me a vision to bring them tribute to the temple to guide them here. My only wish is to serve the gods.\u201d She bowed her head in submission, but also shot a pleading look to the Spanish duo. And with even Tzekel-Kan looking at them, it was evident that they had this woman\u2019s life in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will they do? Will they have her released to follow a similar dynamic as in the movie? Or will they keep her as their servant?</span></div></div>",

The priest shoved the thing the thief had been holding back into her arms.  Now that Miguel had a better look at it, the object that had been stolen looked to be a golden head, probably belonging to a statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you return <i>this</i> to the temple,\" sneered Tzekel-Kan, shoving the female thief roughly out of the way.  The thief stumbled for a few steps but managed to remain on her feet.  As she walked away, both Tulio and Miguel noticed the way the hips of the thief swayed back and forth.  If Tzekel-Kan or the chief noticed this, they chose to ignore it. Tzekel-Kan looked to be too busy glaring at the retreating female thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lords. I am Chief Tannabok,\" he introduced himself. \u201cWhat names may we call you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Miguel\" said Miguel in a bold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Tulio\" said Tulio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmurs around the audience surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lords, how long do you intend to stay in El Dorado?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTzekel-Kan turned sharply around and rolled his eyes.  Before Miguel and Tulio could respond, the priest spoke. \"Enough!  You do not ask the gods such questions!\" said Tzekel-Kan  shoving Tannabok as hard as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing his folly, Tannabok humbly bowed his head. \u201cI apologize, my lords. Might we show you to your temple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr would you prefer to show us your power?\" asked Tzekel-Kan.  \"As proof of your divinity?  We are all eager to witness your wondrous powers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Divinity.... right,\" said Tulio.  The Spanish man gave a nervous laugh.   \"Give us a moment\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTulio and Miguel walked a few feet away.  The two gods were having a quiet conversation that Tzekel-Kan and Tannabok couldn't hear.  As the conversation continued, the nearby volcano started to rumble ominously.  This naturally grew the attention of the entire population of the city, save for the two gods having a discussion of all things.   At one point, the one named Miguel was softly hitting Tulio with  his open palm while the other had his eyes tightly closed.  Tannabok and Tzekel-Kan exchanged bewildered glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Stop</b>!\" yelled Tulio in a commanding voice that echoed across the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volcano had been about ready to erupt when it suddenly stopped.  Everyone in the crowd gasped at this occurrence and immediately prostrated themselves.<br>\r\nTulio and Miguel had finally noticed what was happening and opened their arms to bask in the reverence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make us start it up again\" said Miguel when a guard tried standing.  \"Because we <i>will</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

The last remnants of the morning dew fell from the tips of leaves down to the forest floor. The grass shook as animals of all shapes and sizes stalked, scurried, and foraged. The gentle lapping of a nearby stream flowed into a nearby pond filled with the croaking of rainbow frogs.

She enjoyed their company, since she had been completely alone until she found them wandering helplessly in her part of the jungle. When she found them they were without shelter during a powerful thunderstorm and looked like they haven't eaten in days, she has taken care of them ever since. They were lucky that it was her that found them and not a big cat or poisonous snake. They also happened to be in  the relatively safe part of the jungle that Megan called home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeighboring this oasis of safety was a hostile world. To the south the jungle grows denser and is populated with predators, until the jungle suddenly stops and massive metal and glass structures climb into the sky, she knew the area was populated because the spires would light up at night from electric lights, like the ones in her home, but because of a gut feeling of dread and the alien look of the buildings she stayed away. To the north was a different matter. After a weeks journey through a  inhospitable swamp the jungle was filled with an evil amazon tribe, that would kidnap any that dared enter their land, or so Megan had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had also seen was that the hunters of the amazon tribe were only 6 feet tall at best, suggesting that Megan was the tallest person in the land at 9 feet high. Megan also saw that the amazons wore animal skins around their chests and over their pelvic areas, as opposed to herself, Kate, and Mark lacking any such fabrics to cover themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn these last months she has learned much about her guests, they were both barely adults with Kate just a year older than Mark. Kate was like Megan in having dark hair and deep blue eyes, though being much smaller and standing only 5 and a half feet tall. Kate looked up to Megan wanting to be as strong and independent as the amazon and hardly left her side. Her brother, as Kate referred to him, was taller than Kate and had short black hair, though having only seen a few Amazons, the first thing Megan noticed was that Mark was unlike herself and Kate. She later concluded that there were probably other males like him in the city to the south, and that there wouldn't be any in the amazon ruled jungle, although she still couldn't figure out what males were for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared of into space at the table, reflecting on the time the three had spent together, fishing, hunting, teaching them how to survive, and just staring up at the night sky looking at the stars. She is suddenly brought back into reality by a loud bang in the distance. Megan ran out of the cabin and onto the deck and scanned the horizon to the south.  the sky was lit up with fire and columns of smoke towered into the sky. After a few moments another bang echoed through the jungle and another fire appeared, this one closer than the last. As the night went on the sound of explosions and fleeing animals filled the air, and the fires grew closer. Megan held Kate and Mark close as the two watched the inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate looked up to Megan and in a confused voice asked, \"What's going on? What's causing all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's the people to the south, clearing the area to expand were going to have to leave the area it won't be safe for much longer. The only question is where should we go.\" Megan said as she carefully considered her options.</span></div></div>",

Megan embraced Kate tightly and comforted her. \"Stay calm Kate, if you lose your nerve you won't make it far. We're going to follow the animals' lead and head north, then look for a new home after we cross the swamp. This is dangerous territory so I need you to stay strong for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stared into Megan's deep blue eyes and was filled with hope from the confidence in the amazon's expression. \" I'll be strong for you.\" Kate said, the fear in her voice now replaced admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women break their embrace just as Mark enters the room. Megan motions towards the door and they take the first steeps of their long journey. Outside they are greeted by a completely different world. Smoke clouds their vision, with what little they can see tinted in a red hue from the fires. The peaceful sound of birds now replaced by the screaming and growling of animals and an metallic inhuman screech growing louder. Megan lead the group away from the fire, walking at first then frantic sprinting as the screech grew closer and closer. Moving north was difficult with no cleared path the group was forced to push through dense jungle, resulting in minor bruises and cuts on their bare skin. After clearing a few miles of rough terrain and climbing a steep hill the group turn around and and look at their former home. Near the cleared land, that the cabin was built on,  the tip of a metal object could be seen above the tree line. The object slowly walked into the clearance, each step causing the earth to shake slightly. The object now stood exposed, A large spherical body held up by six large spider like legs, a portion of the sphere  opened  revealing a large blue crystal. The crystal glowed bright and in a flash a red beam of light appeared and scorched the earth everywhere it touched. The group watches in awe as their home is devoured by fire. They were so entranced that they failed to notice as a large figure slowly  creep towards them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the group watched the mechanical being burn the jungle, a large black panther watched them from the shadows. Megan had unknowingly lead the group straight into the panther's territory. Unlike the other animals this predator held its ground against the advancing threat, and considered the group's trespassing an act of aggression. It moved slowly and silently until it was within striking range. Letting out a low growl  the panther pounced.  Megan heard the growl and turned around, and she saw the beast leaping through the air towards Mark, with little time to act Megan was able to knock Mark out of the way. Mark was now safe, however Megan was now in the panther's path. Megan hit the ground with a loud thud, as her vision focused she saw  the beast's massive maw lowering towards her. Megan quickly jabs the wooden shaft of her spear on the panther's neck to keep its razor sharp teeth away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline pumped through Kate as she watched the powerful amazon struggle underneath the panther's weight. Kate let out a roar of primal fury and ran to Megan's aid, driving her spear into the panther's neck.  The panther recoiled in pain, giving Megan an opening to kick the colossal beast off her. The panther cried out in pain before returning to its feet and darting away.  Now standing in clear sight for the first time the group saw the behemoth in all it glory, standing as tall as Megan showing teeth that could easily be larger than a normal man's face. Megan picked herself up off the ground just as the panther circled around readying itself for another attack. The beast jumped through the air once more, but this time Megan was prepared, she dropped to one knee and thrust her spear forward  causing the beast to impale itself. The spear drove straight through the panther's chest striking the heart and killing it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan are you alright?\" Mark asked as he ran to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine thanks to Kate, she is turning into quite the amazon.\" Megan said while smiling at Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's face turns red and she averts her eyes away from Megan. \"... I... just didn't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dusting herself off, Megan once more leads the group north wanting to stay as far away from whatever the machines from the south. The next few days pass without incident, but as they reach the border of the swamplands they come across the remains of a camp site. The fire pit is cold and empty, only one tent stands, wrecked though it may be, yet marks on the ground indicate more tents once stood, the most disturbing image however is the drag marks and trail of dry blood that start from the wrecked tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" Mark asked as he raised his spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan held her spear tight and slowly followed the trail of blood. \" I'm not sure just be rea...... oh my god.\" Megan finished. At the end of the drag marks the half eaten carcass of a man laid on the ground still rotting, tightly clenching a book in its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate puts her hand over her mouth in disgust, but overcomes the gruesome sight and retrieves the book. \"It's a diary, detailing a trip into a cave down the road.\" Megan said while pointing then began reading from the last entries in the book. \" Day five and we're still lost, we thought this could be a safe route past the marsh of the dead, but its a damn labyrinth down here and I fear we are going in circles. Took make matters worse some of the guys are losing their grip on reality, claiming to see a monster stalking us its probably just the near black lighting  playing tricks on overactive imaginations. Day six, We should leave, we should turn back and exit the way we came in, but something is drawing me in, A voice in the back of my head calling to me from the center of this maze. I'm seeing it now too and hearing a growl, It's watching us waiting for a moment to strike. I shouldn't be taking my eyes away from the shadows even to write, but I find it is the only thing that can calm my nerves.  Day seven, oh god oh god, their dead all of them, I know it. It sprang from the shadows and started to rip us apart, and ... and I ran, I just left them. The only thing keeping me going is a light in the distance I must reach it. Day eight, I've made it out, I'm safe now. However it's as I feared I came out the way we entered, and whats worse I can still feel that thing's eye burning into my soul, watching me, waiting. \" At this point Kate looks up with a grim look and said \" This next part is written in his own blood....., It followed me out, and started to eat me alive, before leaving me to die a slow painful death. I write this now as a warning to all that may find this, if you go into it's lair it will never stop hunting you... Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The marsh of the dead, that's what the swamp is called! So are choices are this swamp of the dead or, from how that book describes it, the gates of hell, that's just wonderful.\" Mark says hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing the gruesome corpse Megan wanted nothing to do with the cave, but just like the dead man, a voice in her head beckoned her to enter.</span></div></div>",

Megan takes one last look at the body, before leading everyone away from the cave and towards the marshland. As they get closer to the swamp, the jungle becomes less dense until it reaches the point where the only vegetation is patches of tall grass and everything became silent after they reached the border of the swamp. Fog clouded their vision, but from what they could see showed how inhospitable the landscape was. The water was murky and near black, and it was devoid of life, with the exception of plants Megan recognized as poisonous. Megan walks into the murky water and continues forward with ease, but for Mark and Kate the water reached their waists. Mark kept his spear ready to strike, and attempted to scan the water as he moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this the fog is limiting our visibility and the water is to dark to see into. Anything could be out here.\" Mark said quietly in case anything dangerous was near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've crossed this swamp before nothing lives here.

Mark lowered his spear and speed up to keep up with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when did you come through here Megan, I mean you haven't left our side since you found us. How long ago was it?\" Kate asked as she speed up so that she could walk side by side with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure exactly when, but it was as far back as I could remember. I just woke up remembering barely anything, I only knew my name and that I wasn't always like this.\" Megan said motioning to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't always have that amazing amazon body.\" Kate said shortly before turning red, realizing how her statement could be interpreted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked down at her young companion and smiled innocently before continuing her story. \"No, but I'm not sure what changed me. Then shortly after gaining consciousness I was hunted through the jungle by other amazons. They finally stopped chasing me when I reached the swamp\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group presses forward as Megan details how she crossed the marsh, explored the jungle and, built her home. Three days have passed and the three continued to struggle forward despite their lack drinkable water. At this point even the disgusting, black, murky water seemed welcoming, the only thing holding the group back was the knowledge that drinking it would cause an agonizing death. The thirst had lead to conflict in the group, Mark having grown angry at the situation blamed Megan for taking them into the swamp. Kate stood up for Megan leading to the two to grow distant and causing the group to continue in tense silence. As the group approached a sandbar Mark saw something small dart through the water and over a near by hill. \"I just saw something over there.\" Mark said raising his spear,\" if we catch it it will help us a little.\" Megan and Kate nodded and followed Mark over the hill on the sandbar. As the three cleared the top of the hill they moved right into a pool of quicksand, and were quickly pulled in up to their chests. The three struggled but they soon realized they couldn't get free on their own. Then when the group seems to have lost all hope, a wooden object is lowered to their arms. One by one they grab on and are pulled out, Megan looks up at their savior and sees that the wooded stick was.</span></div></div>",

Due to a cosmic event bringing the universes very close together, random portals have begun opening in different places around the world, sucking people in and dumping them into Equestria at a greatly reduced size. Many denizens of Equestria are surprised by this sudden development but are quick to help/take advantage of the stranded humans. You are a human male who gets pulled into a portal and sent into the home of a pony and has to survive until you can find some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Humans were once bigger like ponies and lived in a separated kingdom next to Equestria, they were essentially the elves and dwarves of the world for their intellect, mastery of magic, and craft-making but one day, a curse befell the entire species turning them about 4 inches high. When Humanity became cursed, a group of humans sought to become scavengers in the giants' societies and return to their small dwellings with the food and supplies. Over the centuries, these scavengers became Borrowers as they began living within the houses of the giants' equines without them noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day, they were discovered. However, because of Pony society being new and pretty welcoming to foreigners, they understood their plight and allowed them to live beside them. Living in harmony in a symbiotic relationship over the passing centuries, the Borrowers work on jobs and complete tasks usually not possible for ponies but possible for their small and practical size in exchange for living space, supplies, and food although some still do live on those unaware that belief doesn't have any Borrower in their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. One day, hundred of giant portals opened simultaneously and hordes of ponies began pouring out, seeking to abduct as many noncombative human men and children as possible and take them back to their home plane. This is at the forefront of a <i>massive</i> invasion with the goal of correcting a perceived egregious error in the treatment of men by human women (which is not completely unwarranted), to \"rebalance the scales\", so to speak. Even though the society would be ostensibly run by mares it would not at all lessen the status of human men, nor would they be reduced to slavery. In fact, I think it likely they will be coddled and pampered by their new governors. The transition will be quick and quiet, with many waking up in the morning to find that the world they thought they knew had suddenly and irrevocably changed. Some may not even realize it even then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen will be allowed the same rights as men so long as they abide by the new rules, and the ideology of \"Feminism\" while being on the surface similar to their own is completely incompatible with Equestrian sensibilities and will be quickly stamped out, and any of them who try to resist or make trouble will find themselves entrapped in a fate... most unpleasant.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes the 100-foot tall monster kicked a building over but Duck Kong preferred using his fists to punch giant holes in buildings.  Some buildings collapsed on the spot when punched by Duck Kong while others still stood. <br>\r\n           Duck Kong walked passed a freeway that was filled with traffic.  Pausing in his rampage the giant looked down at the freeway and smashed a section of the freeway.  Then the monster leaned forward and placed his open mouth at the end of the freeway making a tunnel that led directly to his stomach.  The cars and trucks on the freeway were going too fast to stop in time to prevent themselves from being eaten.  Nearly three dozen cars and trucks ended up as snacks for the giant Duck Kong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Duck Kong decided to move on when there were no more cars and trucks for him to eat.  That was the beginning of the great feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Duck Kong walked for several blocks until he spotted an all-night grocery store.  Smiling down at the crowded store, Duck Kong got down on his hands and knees and simply shoved his entire head in the store which was a superstore.     Duck Kong opened his mouth and inhaled.  Entire aisles of food and shoppers went into the monster's hungry maw.   Shoppers tried to save themselves but in vain.   Everything and everyone in the store ended up going down the throat of the hungry monster.   Duck Kong swallowed whole mouthfulls of people and food.  <br>\r\n             The entire store was empty in a matter of minutes.  Nothing was left in the store, absolutely nothing at all.   <br>\r\n              Duck Kong pulled his head from the store.  The monster then belched rather loudly.   The monster stood at his full height and moved on.<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n         Duck Kong then picked up a bus.  The monster lifted the bus high in the air and examined the people within it.<br>\r\n        \"Next stop: My stomach\" said Duck Kong.  \"Enjoy the ride\"<br>\r\n        Duck Kong swallowed the bus in one gulp.  After that Duck Kong decided to eat all the people he saw running down the street trying to escape from the rampage. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Camp Campbell was a special kind of place. It was the kind of place that should be shut down for hundreds of laws it\u2019s broken, from tax fraud to animal-related terrorism. It was the kind of place where bad parents that didn\u2019t know how to tie their own shoes would send their kids. It was the kind of place where the inclusion of a masked serial killer would more likely improve the atmosphere of the camp. It was Camp Campbell, and if you\u2019re there, we\u2019re sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright campers, everyone back from their super fun nature walk?\u201d The one asking the question was David, the Camp Campbell counselor who always tried to make camp fun and safe for everyone. He often failed. Behind him, trying to sleep against a tree was Gwen, another camp counselor who always tried not to be completely depressed about her crappy job. She often failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, is everyone here? Nurf, Preston, Nerris, Dolph, Neil, Maaaa\u2026MAX!\u201d David\u2019s rollcall was stopped as he screamed out the name of the resident troublemaker, a small, tanned young man with black hair and an even blacker soul. The reason for David\u2019s alarm had to do with a big, squirming gut on the young boy\u2019s body that was most likely another camper. Max had devoured someone alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you know what I said about eating campers. It is strictly forbidden for any camper to devour another camper in any way shape or form,\u201d David calmly explained like this was a conversation he had with Max a hundred times before, probably because he had. There were certain people in the world that could eat other people. They could do it safely or they could make it fatally with the person being digested alive. One of the only \u2013 ONLY \u2013 good things anyone could say about Camp Campbell was that they made it very hard for the campers to get eaten and digested. It helped that only three people present could eat people whole and that was Max, Gwen, and David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit. I thought you would be too stupid to notice my stomach,\u201d Max grumbled, pissed at getting caught once again. He liked to eat people and thought a lot of the campers looked tasty. He wasn\u2019t going to digest them, not all of them at least. He thought it was just so unfair. The one thing he wanted to do at the stupid camp and his most hated enemy \u2013 fucking  David \u2013 was fucking stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I did notice. Now spit out whoever it is you ate,\u201d David firmly, but also as kindly as he could, said as he patted Max hard on the back. Max tried to avoid regurgitating his meal, but David knew the exact spot to hit to get him to hurl. His mouth widened as a wet, naked form spilled forth from his insides and splattered on the ground. A disorientated but giddy Nikki stood up instantly, uncaring that she had been eaten or that she was buck naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki, go grab some clothes,\u201d David said as the girl laughed and ran off, leaving the counselor to deal with the troublesome pred. David looked like he had a lecture ready, but instead, he just sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cMax, why do you have to try and eat everyone? It\u2019s dangerous and not very friendly. Vore should be a gentle, private thing that is shared willingly, and only done when you're fully mature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck your PC bullshit, David. I can eat people, you can eat people, and even Gwen can eat people, so why don\u2019t we just do it? Vore isn\u2019t some touchy-feely crap. Its power, its sex, and its awesome!\u201d Max shot back, not willing to take this. He wasn\u2019t some weak little boy afraid to be eaten. He ate people, and if he was able to he\u2019d eat David. That would show him who was at the top of the food chain. Too bad he was just too God Damn Lanky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your opinion, but I\u2019m still going to have to punish you. You eat someone so you get eaten for an hour. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be nice and safe,\u201d David assured the rather rude, violent, and very troubled boy as he patted him on the head. Max snarled at the counselor, not happy to be the one being devoured instead of devouring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat a dick, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically he\u2019s about to,\u201d Neil pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, a good one,\u201d Gwen said as she seemed to finally be paying full attention again. Honestly, she was all for letting the kids eat each other and maybe eating a few herself. It was like the one benefit of being a camp counselor, getting your pick of the tasty campers. The rules said otherwise, and Gwen was worried she might lose her job if she was caught with a kid in her stomach, at least without some flimsy justification. Luckily, there was no rule about going out of camp occasionally and finding someone tasty to gobble up. It did mean leaving David to handle this Hellhole alone, but Gwen tried to make it up to him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, let\u2019s not make this even worse than it has to be. Max, I\u2019m going to eat you now,\u201d David said, reluctant to devour the young boy, but needing to. He always felt so uncomfortable eating Max, knowing deep down that Max was sensitive and needed his support, but this was the only way he would learn. Well, maybe there was another way. \u201cOr I could sing you a song I\u2019ve been working on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo song. I\u2019d rather be eaten than have to listen to another fucking camp song,\u201d Max quickly said before David could pull out his guitar. David seemed disappointed and was about to argue about the healing benefits of music, when Max suddenly jumped up and dove into his mouth. Shoving his arms, head, and shoulders in to shut the counselor up. David stumbled back as he had Max sticking out of his mouth, the boy\u2019s tiny legs kicking in the air. Grabbing his sides, David took a deep breath through his nose and started swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax cringed as he felt the mouth around him surge back as he was swallowed. He hated this so fucking much. It was so tight and slimy, pressing in on his puny body in ways he really didn\u2019t like. The undulating surroundings would gently massage him down, caressing every inch of him. It felt nice, which was exactly the reason he hated it so much. There was no way he\u2019d ever enjoy being eaten by David, not that guy. Max grit his teeth as he felt himself getting taken in, David as always being careful as he lightly sucked on him and rolled his body around to get him nice and wet. It would have been better for both of them if Max was naked, but the boy refused to make anything easier for David, ever. He felt the young man gripping his legs firmly as he tilted his head back, taking in more of him with a solid gulp. David was a capable predator, with strong throat muscles, and a lot of give in his flesh, but he was still a pussy and that just pissed off Max even more. Max\u2019s crotch entered the mouth, covered up but still feeling the heat and wetness of the maw. The kid bit his lip to keep from getting aroused, his stubbornness to remain hostile so strong. He\u2019d get through this as miserably as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating Max was easy for David, so easy he could have taken the boy down nearly instantly. However, it was important that he took his time and let Max get used to this so he wasn\u2019t scared. He once told Gwen this. She rolled her eyes and called him a moron, which the sunny young man thought was very rude. David was nearly done with Max, only his little legs were left to swallow and he could feel the boy inches from slipping into his stomach. While this was about teaching Max a lesson, there was no doubt that there was something very addictive about the way he tasted. David wanted more, but he would control himself. He was a role model, after all. He hoped that one day Max saw this as what it was; an attempt to help him overcome his bad behavior and be happy like the counselor. With a final swallow, a large bulge traveled down David\u2019s throat as he took in the last of Max. His gut expanded, slightly pushing up his shirt as the big, angry meal landed inside. David knew Max was fully settled when he felt him try to punch the stomach wall towards his heart with his tiny fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay everyone, back to camp,\u201d David said, smiling brightly as his big, round stomach wobbled. Inside him, Max seethed and plotted. He was going to get David one of these days and then they\u2019d see who was inside whom. He\u2019d make the sweet bastard pay for trying to make him act like a decent person.</span></div></div>",

It was dinner time, so everyone had gathered in the mess hall for the miserable excuse for dinner. The counselors ate separately from the campers, so as not to upset anyone, but Max had no such consideration as he shoveled down the small mountain of food. It was still the same crap everyone else got, but just in greater quantities befitting a predator. The campers were used to that, however. Yet all still gave him more space than usual, even the two people he hated the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you not smell that?\u201d griped Neil, his voice even more nasally than usual as he pinched his nostrils and fanned his hand. \u201cSmells like the south end of a northbound cow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki, finally dressed, took several tentative sniffs. \u201cHey, it does!\u201d she cheered. Now that things had been recontextualized for her, she scooted closer to Max, who just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cuz I literally came out of David\u2019s ASS!\u201d he growled. \u201cStupid jerk ate me, shit me out, and told me to go clean myself off in the lake. Bastard even gave me a bar of soap that not only disintegrated the moment it touched the water, but it turned my clothes tie-dye. How the fuck does that work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few reasons,\u201d Neil replied. \u201cMost I\u2019m pretty sure are illegal in this state. Still, at least you\u2019ve got your spares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and now they\u2019re gonna smell like shit until this stupid camp can get a decent bar of soap.\u201d Miserably Max rested his cheek in his palm while his other hand popped what might have been a sausage in his mouth, though it tasted unsettlingly like broccoli. \u201cI hate this stupid camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa knowww,\u201d Nikki began as her head whimsically swayed. \u201cSmelly clothes wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal if this were a proper nature camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d Neil asked, wary of any ideas that came from the hyper girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nature sounds like naturalist, which is another word for nudist. If we went around naked all the time, we could just burn our clothes and frolic freely through the woods, just like mother Gaia intended.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHippy garbage aside, that\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Max allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d whined Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously. The temperature\u2019s pretty mild morning, noon, and night, we\u2019d only need rain coats for rain, nudity is pretty liberating, and it saves me the trouble of stripping you people down before I eat you. So far I\u2019m not seeing a downside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d questioned Neil authoritatively. \u201cDid you forget about David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax blinked. \u201cI did, actually. Dammit. It was nice picturing a world without him around to always mess with my fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon my intrusion,\u201d boomed the deep voice of Quarter Master; real name, age, and possibly species all unknown. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help but overhear your proposal for camp-wide nudity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? What of it?\u201d Max asked defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo carry out such a policy change, you\u2019ll need signatures from all the campers\u2019 parents, plus Cameron Campbell and at least two other camp staff.\u201d QM produced an official looking petition to make the camp clothing optional, already complete with his and Cameron\u2019s signatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, why do you have this?\u201d Neil asked, backing away from the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQM blinked and snorted. \u201cTo make this a reality, I suggest you work on your sales pitch for your fellow campers. Either that, or find someone who can forge some signatures.\u201d He then set the petition down on the table and walked off without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax picked up the paper and read through the lines of big but manageable words. His face lit up with the almost alien expression of enthusiasm. \u201cAlright! Finally something to make camp tolerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still not sure,\u201d Neil said. \u201cI mean, this is Quarter Master we\u2019re talking about. Even his signature is sketchy.\u201d He pointed to the scratch marks on the page that looked like they\u2019d been drawn with the man\u2019s hook hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a wet blanket, Neil,\u201d urged Nikki. \u201cBesides, its clothing <i>optional</i>. If you\u2019re too chicken to show us you\u2019re naked butt, then go right ahead and hide in the prison of clothing. As for me, I look forward to embracing the call of the wild!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax set a hand on Nikki\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHold your horses there, girl. It says here we need signatures from <i>all</i> the parents. Hmm. How do we make this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil hummed thoughtfully. \u201cWell, so long as this is only optional nudity, we could try breaking into the counselor\u2019s cabin and finding our application forms. Those have our parent\u2019s signatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking, Neil.\u201d Max really must\u2019ve been optimistic about this plan. He almost never complimented anyone. \u201cSo, who here\u2019s got the least shitty handwriting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki raised her hand. \u201cOh-oh. How about Dolf? He\u2019s an artist. That\u2019s basically the same thing, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, yeah,\u201d agreed Max, his grin growing, only to shrink again. \u201cBut even if we tricked him, we run the risk of the others complaining and getting things changed back to normal. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Quarter Master\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got to convince everyone that this is for the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil rolled his eyes. \u201cBest for you two, maybe, but how are you going to convince everyone else. Space Kid never takes his suit off, and just about everyone else has some kind of weird attachment to some specific article of clothing, like Magic Kid\u2019s hat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax stroked his chin. \u201cSpace Kid we could probably convince that it\u2019s just a new level of training, and Magic Kid <i>only</i> needs his hat and wand. We could say it\u2019ll improve the trick if he literally has no sleeves to hide things in. Oh yeah! This is gonna happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEred\u2019s so cool, she\u2019d look cool in anything, even her birthday suit,\u201d swooned Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax nodded. \u201cGood angle. So we\u2019ve got the parent signatures, we\u2019re working on the campers\u2019 compliance, so all we need is one other camp worker to make things happen.\u201d Max\u2019s smile finally fizzled. \u201cDavid\u2019s a bust. I can already hear his stupid lecture about comfort and maturity and bleh. Makes me sick just thinking about it, so I\u2019m not even gonna bother. So how are we gonna sell this to Gwen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a pred, just like you,\u201d Nikki reminded. \u201cMaybe you can tell her that it\u2019ll be like having her food already unwrapped? That sounds like something a pred would like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt definitely is,\u201d Max agreed, his good mood returning. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got some base pitches going. Let\u2019s work on them tonight, see what we come up with in the morning, and put our plan into motion to make Camp Campbell tolerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just gonna say better, but that works too,\u201d agreed the ever chipper Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil shrugged. \u201cEh. We were due for another adventure anyway. This actually seems like it\u2019s on the tamer side of things, so why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do our rambunctious campers go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone is skulking around the camp at night.<br>\r\nSomeone is skulking around the camp at night\u2026 who doesn\u2019t belong.<br>\r\nSkip to the morning and try to sell their plan to the campers.<br>\r\nSkip to the morning and try to sell their plan to Gwen.</span></div></div>",

How can you stand it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Gwen, as I just told Max, vore is-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen held up a hand to stop David\u2019s lecture. \u201cCaring, cuddly, and blah-blah-blah, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be gross and uncomfortable. For god\u2019s sakes, David. The shoes!\u201d She pinched the bridge of her nose and took a calming breath. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing this as punishment, don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be more <i>punishing</i> if he were naked? Sure, slobber covered clothes is icky, but we both know that it\u2019s just as bad for the eater.\u201d She paused and added, \u201cYou do know that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid huffed his exasperation. \u201cWell of course I do, but I\u2019m not just punishing Max. I\u2019m trying to teach him to be a responsible pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen demand he follow basic predator etiquette and get naked before he goes in. Otherwise, if enforcing the rules is just as unpleasant for you as it is him, he\u2019ll keep breaking the rules just to spite you,\u201d Gwen argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d said Max, his irritable voice muffled through the walls of David\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen motioned insistently between David and his gut, silently demanding that he see reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Gwen. What have we said about using our words?\u201d David spoke as if to a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrr!\u201d Gwen stomped her foot and marched off, only able to take so much of David\u2019s Davidness in one sitting. She moved out of earshot, muttering about the miserable life choices that led her to this miserable camp, before finding a nice tree to sit under and pull out her journal. Writing erotic fanfiction always helped to calm her nerves, though what she\u2019d really like right now was a nice, full belly. Speak of the devil, she heard tiny footsteps approaching and looked up. \u201cOh, hey Nikki,\u201d she said disinterestedly. \u201cUh, why are you still naked? David told you to get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scrawny preteen girl was briefly distracted as the wind rustled the trees and tugged at her long blue hair. Her skin was dry, so at least she\u2019d cleaned off Max\u2019s slobber. \u201cAhh, feel that breeze. The sounds and smells of nature all around us. Nothing like what\u2019s in the city. That\u2019s why I love this camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes one of us,\u201d Gwen grumbled. \u201cBut David still told you to get dressed. You don\u2019t want to trigger another of his lectures, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019ve learned to tune him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, two things. He said to grab some clothes, which I did, before dropping them. Also-also, he\u2019s dealing with Max right now, meaning he won\u2019t have time for me for at least a few hours,\u201d Nikki reasoned, showing a dangerous level of cunning for such a chaotic child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded, almost went back to her writing, only to take another look at the girl. She was scrawny, but pretty leanly built for her age, probably a result of her running around so much. Good. Gwen had a preference for the better built people. Wait, no. The rules of the camp forbade counselors from eating the campers without reason\u2026 Then again, David <i>was</i> preoccupied at the moment. Still, Gwen needed to be sure. \u201cSay, why\u2019d Max eat you, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was the game we were playing. Survival of the fittest. Whoever could eat the other first, wins. Max won, as always.\u201d Nikki rolled her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a good feeling about next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sadistic, grinchly grin grew across Gwen\u2019s face. On any other day she\u2019d chide the girl for her gullibility. But right now\u2026 \u201cSay, how about we play? You know, so you can practice for next time with Max.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki\u2019s face lit up and she threw herself on Gwen with a hug. \u201cThat\u2019d be great. Thanks Gwen. You\u2019re the big sister my mom always wished she had to look out for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s really sweet, I think,\u201d Gwen said as she patted the girl\u2019s bare back. Her hand rubbed up and down until it descended to her pert little bottom and gave it a playful squeeze. Nikki just laughed, viewing it as just part of the game. Gwen might have actually felt bad about taking advantage of her, if she weren\u2019t currently spilling drool from her lips. \u201cAlright, so let\u2019s go in turns. You can try eating me for starters, and then I\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d she said while offering her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pumped her fist. \u201cYes! Oh-ho, get ready, Gwen. You\u2019re about to take a one way trip to belly town.\u201d Grabbing the teen\u2019s hand, Nikki licked her lips and shoved the fingers into her mouth like it was a cheeseburger. She gagged almost instantly, but fought to press on. Alas, since she wasn\u2019t a predator, her mouth just wasn\u2019t built for big meals. Her bones lacked the flexibility and her muscles lacked the elasticity. Even so, her effort was commendable, if a bit na\u00efve. Finally she gave up and yanked the hand from her lips. \u201cDid I do good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely room for improvement,\u201d Gwen offered as she set her hands on the child\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLet me show you how a pro does it.\u201d Licking her lips, Gwen opened wide and wrapped her mouth around the girl\u2019s face. Nikki laughed as her face was licked, wiggling a little from the tickling sensation. Gwen hummed her delight from the flavor. The aftertaste of Max\u2019s stomach juices was tolerably faint, but more pleasing was the sweetness of flowers that the girl had no doubt been frolicking through. Nikki always had surprises like that whenever Gwen ate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pred opened wider to pull more of her prey\u2019s head in. She got another nice surprise when she felt Nikki\u2019s hands push their way inside. Gwen smiled gratefully around her mouthful as she made her first swallow. It was always best when prey was willing. She pulled Nikki\u2019s shoulders past her lips as the girl\u2019s head entered her throat. Her tongue never ceased its exploratory assault in tasting every square inch of her eager meal. Another swallow brought the girl\u2019s torso into her consumer\u2019s maw. Gwen\u2019s moans grew in volume as she tasted the prepubescent girl\u2019s undeveloped chest nubs, which just made her kick all the more frantically from the stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome might have called this child molestation; probably because that\u2019s what it was. However, predators were held to a different set of standards to regular people, aka prey.  Socially speaking, what Gwen was doing was no worse than leaving a subpar tip to her waiter. Arguably douchey and generally frowned upon, but nothing actually bad. That was Gwen\u2019s mentality as she took several more swallows and reached Nikki\u2019s pelvis. Her tongue almost reflexively went to the little girl\u2019s little slit. That really got her wiggles going as her laughter turned into moans. She was likely too young to fully grasp the signals her body was sending her, but the flavor of underage pussy was too much for Gwen to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counselor plunged deeply to sample as much of the minor\u2019s vaginal fluids as possible. Nikki\u2019s incoherent cries reverberated through her throat, but Gwen just took that as incentive to go on. Nikki might have been gullible, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew what she was getting into when she agreed to an eating game with Gwen. After growing complacent with pussy juice, Gwen extended her tongue to the bitter but still pleasurable girl butt. Nikki thrashed all the harder, which only built her consumer\u2019s arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking to make sure the coast was clear, Gwen slipped both hands into the front of her shorts. One hand rubbed her clit between her fingers while the other penetrated her pussy. Closing her eyes, she imagined herself being forced upon by some tentacle beast trying to impregnate her. Said beast just so happened to have a tentacle that resembled a little girl with a functioning pussy and ass. The beast gurgled its strange fishy language, but Gwen was able to make out words like \u2018mine\u2019, \u2018egg slut\u2019, and \u2018forever\u2019. As the fire within her loins roared, she threw her head back and attempted to cry out. In so doing, she accidently gave a hearty swallow and pulled her meal\u2019s pelvis into her throat. Nikki\u2019s kicking petered out after that, likely due to exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen maintained the mental image of tentacle rape as she took only lighter swallows and masturbated more furiously. When only Nikki\u2019s feet were left outside, Gwen clamped her hand over her mouth to muffle her orgasmic screams. Her reward was the varied flavor of everywhere Nikki had been walking in the last few minutes, which the counselor relished to prolong her bliss. Feeling that things had run their course, Gwen took one final swallow and pulled the girl into her stomach. She rested back against the tree and her hand moved of its own accord to stroke her pregnant looking belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun, kiddo?\u201d Gwen asked contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it. You might\u2019ve gotten me this time, Gwen, but don\u2019t let your guard down. Someday\u2026 Someday Nikki\u2019s gonna be at the top of the food chain!\u201d avowed the wannabe pred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed and rubbed her belly adoringly. \u201cHehe. Sure thing, kid.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>       The chemical plant was on the edge of a town called New Hampton.  It once had been a mining town back in the late 1800s.  Like all mining towns it died when the silver mines went dry.  The Great Depression effectively killed it and the population had been dwindling ever since.   New Hampton had a population of around 40,000 in its hayday.  These days the population hovered around 2,000.   There were a lot of abandoned buildings and condemned mining buildings and shafts.  <br>\r\n              New Hampton was haunted by a ghost known as the Mining Phantom that haunted a particular mine that was close to the old chemical plant that had been abandoned some 50 years prior due to mysterious circumstances.  There were rumors about the reason why the chemical plant was closed but nobody knew the real reason.  <br>\r\n              <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A green van with the words \"Mystery Machine\" written on it was parked in the otherwise empty parking lot.  There was no movement save for the trees that was waving in the breeze.  It had been a high wind day where the wind decided to remain blowing at 20 mph with gusts sometimes exceeding 40 mph.  Now that it was night the wind had died down considerably.  <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n      The two occupants of the van was a tall teenager by the name of Shaggy and a great dane known as Scooby Doo. The two had refused to enter the chemical plant while the others had went inside to search for the supposed phantom.  The gang had only seen a brief glimpse of the Mining Phantom earlier in the day.  The phantom was an old man with a long beard wrapped up in chains, armed with a wicked-looking pickaxe.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n       Shaggy sat in the front seat at the driving wheel while Scooby was seated next to him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"See anything, Scoob?\" asked Shaggy as he ate at a bag of Scooby Snacks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The great dane was looking directly at the entrance to the plant perhaps 40 feet away.   The entrance was lighted by a bare light bulb that was directly above the entrance.  Apparently the abandoned plant still had electrical power.   The plant was dark for the most part.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Uhh uhh\" grunted Scooby Doo shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's been over a hour\" said Shaggy, glancing at his watch.  \"Think the others are okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Before Scooby could respond the Mining Phantom came into view.  The Phantom was heading straight towards the entrance to the plant.  Both Shaggy and Scooby ducked low trying not to be seen.  Several moments went by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Shaggy peeked over the dashboard to see the great double doors that served as the entrance to the plant were wide open.  <br>\r\n       Shaggy peered around the parking lot without leaving the van.  There was no sign of the Mining Phantom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Like, I thought the Phantom was here already\" said Shaggy.   \"Unless....the Phantom has a brother\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Ragggy, look!\" said Scoob pointing at a broken window at the far end of the plant.  Shaggy had to squint his eyes to see that Velma was signaling for the pair to come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well, here we go, Scoob\" said Shaggy opening the door of the van.  He walked to the passenger door and opened it.  Scooby-Doo hesitated and then climbed out of the van.  Scooby was clearly shaking in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Calm down will ya, Scoob?\" asked Shaggy.  The pair started to walk towards the entrance to the plant.   \"I know you're scared and so am I but you know the routine\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Scooby glanced up at Shaggy and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The two entered the chemical plant.            </span></div></div>",
