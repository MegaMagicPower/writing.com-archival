The creature slowly stalked toward you and bared its cruel fangs. You had no weapons, so you decided to create as much ruckus as possible in hopes of scaring the beast away. You unleashed the most terrifying growl in your repertoire, but the wolf-monkey only barked harsh laughter, and began to charge you. Thinking quickly, you reached behind you to the salt rock, scratched away small crystals with your fingernails, and flung them into the aberration's eyes. The family of otters watched in horror and fascination as the wolf-monkey howled in anguish, and ran off into the forest. The otters ran to their fallen companion, and reared up on their hind legs in an effort to keep you away from the body. However, your plan was never to use the dead otter for a snack, you were simply defending a nice creature that had helped you when you needed it. You told the otters to back down, and that you meant them no harm, and in a strangely human manner, they nodded, as if they understood your words, and crawled away with sullen gaits.<br>\r\n       You carried the dead otter for hours until you found a spot you thought would be good to bury your fallen guide. The other otters still trailed, and you could feel their defeated spirit. You thought the otter that was killed may have been their father. With their help, you began to dig a small hole, and in a matter of minutes, a shallow grave was created. You gently placed the deceased otter inside, and listened to the chirps and growls of its family, singing their last words in a heartbreaking manner. You shoveled the dirt back over the body, and packed the earth with your bare feet. You turned  around to see two of the otters carrying a beautiful green pine-cone, and they pressed the seed into the top of the loosened soil. \"What is going on here?\" you asked, \"What was that thing? Where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n        The otters stood on their hind legs once more, lifted their little furry paws, and pointed behind you over the tree-line. You saw a large plume of unhealthy smoke, and heard a faint grinding of gears. You also heard the faint sound of human voices. You thanked the otters, and they scampered off, back into the water, and swam in the direction of the forest. One last otter was left behind, and it grabbed your leg, as if beckoning you to follow it.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly it grew louder and Joseph watched as one of the trees began to fall. His immediate observation was that the tree wasn\u2019t heading his direction, so he decided not to run. Joseph watched as the tree fell upon the distracted beast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the mighty wood hit the ground with a thud, two screams were let out. One came from the animal as the tree crushed its lower half, the other came from Joseph. He clutched his head with both hands, clenching his to prevent another scream. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Joseph finally came to, his mind was overflowing with images of people, places and things that previously he could not even imagine. He did his best to hold onto these fantastic images, but it was futile. No matter how hard he grasped at them, they all just slipped away into the recesses of oblivion.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph was brought out of his mental trance only by the sound of the gralder\u2019s whaling. \u201cGralder, is that what they\u2019re called?\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cHow did I know that? Did that flash\u2026?\u201d The creature called out even louder than before, bringing Joseph back to his senses. Making his way over to the source of the whaling, he saw that the gralder had dropped the megel as it continued to writhe on the ground. He approached the creature with a solemn expression on his face. He met eyes with the creature as is stopped struggling. At that moment, an understanding came between the two. The gralder\u2019s back leg was being crushed beneath the tree. It was fully aware that Joseph could find a large rock, smash its scull and eat the remains. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amongst the twigs, leaves, and brush there was a fairly thick, five foot long, white branch. He knelt down to examine it, gently caressing its rough surface with the tips of his fingers. Along its length, every few inches, he tested its strength by applying minor force to bend it. When at last he was satisfied with its strength, Joseph lifted his uncut spear and with the blunt end, he stabbed the ground as if posing for a painting. <br>\r\nThe gralder cried out again. Joseph couldn\u2019t tell if it was calling for help, begging for mercy, or just crying in pain. As Joseph approached for a closer look on the flailing yelping creature, he couldn\u2019t help but pity the poor thing. Trying to get closer proved too hazardous as the thing slashed its claws at him. Even injured the damn thing\u2019s dangerous, Joseph thought to himself. Well of course it is you moron. He rebuttled. Frightened animals are always dangerous. That\u2019s why venomous snakes strike things they can\u2019t eat.<br>\r\nPulling himself back to reality, Joseph realized that the tree wasn\u2019t that thick. And from what he could see, the gralder didn\u2019t appear that injured. It could limp away and hunt otters until it healed. However, left in its current state it would probably attract all manner of predators looking for an easy meal. Joseph met eyes with the creature and marveled at its defiance against certain death. <br>\r\nIt was decided. Joseph found a suitable rock and placed it beside the tree. Then, jamming the branch beneath the tree to use as a wedge, applied all his strength onto the branch, and finally forced the tree to move. </span></div></div>",

She rose to her maximum height and immediately noticed that her right leg had reflexively pulled itself up. Knowing that she needed to test the extent of her injuries, she swayed from side to side, and rolled her shoulders. These movements were done with such a surprising rhythm that it could easily have been mistaken for dancing. Finally, she decided it was time to test her leg. With the will of a coyote who chews off its own captured leg and the bravery of a child going in for their annual shot, she lowered her leg to the ground. Placing her weight over it for all of an instant, she immediately pulled the broken leg back into the air with a yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph, who had been watching amusedly as the wild animal did it\u2019s jig, couldn\u2019t help but give a light chuckle at this new development. Especially upon the discovery that the creature was in fact not an it, but a her; given that nothing shook between its legs as it danced. Not to mention the six nipples on her chest that never shows up on males.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This caused the gralder to look up at Joseph. Its face was blank as its eyes surveyed the man whom spared her. Her eyes darted between him and the tree branch that he held between them. She realized that even if she weren\u2019t hurt, this was not a beast that she could hunt. Confused that he had not yet attacked, and even more confused that he had saved her, she turned from him and began sniffing through the twigs and found her way to the place where the otter had dropped. Picking it up with her still firm jaws, she turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With seemingly intelligent and humble movements, she approached the large pink thing. Seeing the stick lower in his relaxing hands, she assumed that he had guessed her intentions. However, this did not mean that he had ever stopped aiming the sharper end of the stick at her. She continued her approach until she was mere inches outside of the stick\u2019s range. Opening her mouth slightly, she let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naked pink thing almost completely relaxed his stick. He was in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position, when the gralder did something to make them both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

She flinched at the sound of his voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept winning their little staring contest game.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At first she seemed to be offering the otter out of gratitude, or some manner of peace offering. If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. Joseph thought to himself. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. They were in each other\u2019s territory now; her within reach of his spear/club, and him within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph got his answer as the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If this weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With his spear still trained on her head, Joseph pondered this for a few moments. Finally, he decided to do the only practical thing he could think of. Very slowly, Joseph lowered his spear, its tip descending from her forehead to her nose, her throat, chest, stomach, and at last falling upon the long dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a single motion he jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back, ready to fight off the gralder should this all have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. Joseph took another step back then another. Once he had reached twelve foot distance, he decided that it was safe to turn his back. Almost immediately the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following him, limping the whole way. It didn\u2019t take long for Joseph to notice. When he stopped she did as well. When he turned around she bowed her head. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game of stop and go continued for almost an hour before Joseph decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. He slowed his pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. He found another berry bush, eating his fill and then some, since he was unable to carry any with him. Then, looking at the dead otter still in his hand he confessed \u201cI\u2019m gonna make you into a berry pack.\u201d Joseph walked far enough forward so that the gralder stood where he had squatted to eat the berries. He waited a moment to see if she would eat any. To his relief she did.  At last the house was in sight. Still walking, Joseph decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning his head to face her, he called out \u201cHurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He even found an impressively strong vine and a stick that looked like it would make a suitable splint. Another stick looked like it would make a good spit. He also found stones that would make excellent spark rocks. After he completed his foraging outside, he pointed at Gimp, telling her \u201cGimp. Stay.\u201d Joseph then stepped inside to see if there was anything he could use that he had missed from this morning. To his great surprise, there was. At first figured that it would be fruitless to check the drawers a second time, but it was still a necessary precaution. But when the first drawer opened, he practically leapt for joy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Only a total of eight cabinets and drawers had opened across the house. This might have been disappointing, had it not been for the fact that almost everything he found was of use. Joseph\u2019s new treasures included four boxes of matches, eighteen kitchen knives and two that could be useful in a fight, a bag full of various medicines, rags, towels, twelve spoons, two tool belts with holsters, a sewing kit, an ax, and much more. The final treasure he discovered was book containing detailed illustrations on the plants, creatures, and minerals of the forest. The title was Survival in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Joseph had come down from his present high, he remembered that he was hungry. The growls of his stomach grew ever louder as he began his work. He started by designating a spot for the fire by setting a circle of rocks and filling it with most of the dried wood he had collected earlier, with the exception of the pieces he had labeled the spit, splint, and the support for the spit which he set on either side of the fire pit. To Joseph\u2019s immense pride, it only took him four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire. Following the fire, he bled the otter, followed by skinning it with one of the more peculiar shipped knives. Once the skin had been cleaned and the meat gutted, Joseph proceeded to jam the spit through the otter\u2019s mouth and out the other end. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gimp sat a few yards away from the fire, but with each gust wind she was reminded of the delicious smell of cooked meat and inched her way forward. Joseph noticed this and considered the ways he could hide the smell from any unwanted guests. Setting his spear on the ground next to him, Joseph picked up the book read to the fading light of the setting sun. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia were categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. Before reading up on the goodies of Naxia, he decided to first look up its dangers. There were few venomous plants or animals and no threatening aquatic creatures. The chapter on the otters described them as adequately nutritious. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The meat finally seemed ready. Placing the book down, Joseph grabbed one end of the spit and brought it to his mouth. \u201cDelicious!\u201d The book failed to describe how good they tasted. As Joseph finished off the last bit of flesh, he thought to himself that it could have use a tiny bit of salt, but that could be handled tomorrow. Joseph used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After wiping his hands on a towel, he poured dirt onto the fire, packed up his gear and made his way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. Joseph climbed into bed while Gimp curled up beside him and they both enjoyed a nice long sleep.</span></div></div>",

A nice comfortable bed with 3 layers of blankets, 2 pillows, and a quilt on top.\u201d He did his best to recount as much detail as possible to keep the story going. \u201cRight away I knew that I had no idea where I was or who I was, so I pulled myself up. Once I saw that I wasn\u2019t wearing anything, I tried to cover myself up, but after a couple minutes of listening to the singing birds outside, I figured that there wasn\u2019t anyone around to see me. I knew that the first thing I needed was to get my bearings, so I surveyed the room for anything of interest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll in all, there was a dresser, three large empty book stands, a chair, desk, and two windows with their blinds shut. There are still a few contraptions in there that I haven\u2019t quite figured out yet. Maybe when you get better you could give them a look-see.\u201d Felecia drifted in and out of consciousness, but Joseph knew he could keep her with him with the sound of a familiar voice. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI noticed that there was some kind of switch on the wall to my left. I gave it a flip, but nothing happened. There were three doors, but only one was open. I got up to test the closed doors, but they were all locked. After trying the dresser and a few other cabinets around the room, I started thinking that maybe everything closed was also locked. Once I had finished a brief expedition of the hall way, living room and kitchen, I found that my theory was correct in every regard except one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe only other open door was to the forest. Looking through the glass windows, the word \u2018backyard\u2019 came to mind. Not sure why but it seemed appropriate. Despite sunlight shining through the blinds in all other windows, the backyard was surprisingly dark. I guess it\u2019s due to the thickness of the canopy. Anyway, since I had nothing better to do indoors, and a warm refreshing breeze was blowing in through a partially opened window, I figured I might as well go outside and enjoy the day. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAfter about fifty feet of what some might consider stalking, probably not you, I decided to look back at the place where I had woken. The house itself seemed fairly normal, but the really freaky thing was directly on top. An enormous metal wall with some kind of glowing array of opaque lights shooting out above it seemed to run right through the house. Seriously though, part of that damn Fence makes up a huge barren dead end of a wall. I swear it\u2019s like we\u2019re cut off from the other end of the house. But I digress, the Fence stretched out endlessly in either direction; or at least it would have if all the trees hadn\u2019t blocked my view.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRemember when you told me about the Fence?\u201d Joseph inquired while he set various items beside his patient as per the directions in the book. When Felecia didn\u2019t answer, Joseph just continued talking. \u201cYour right. I guess it\u2019s not really relevant to this part of the story anyway. You don\u2019t come in until much later. I\u2019m just letting you know that I haven\u2019t forgotten you.\"</span></div></div>",

The only thing to grab my attention was throat becoming quite dry. Finally I found myself some water at Gigigly. We\u2019ll get into how that place is relevant a bit later. Anyway, the Fence ran straight through clear sparkly pond. Regardless of whatever you might think, I am not now, nor was I ever <i>completely</i> devoid of common sense. I found a long stick and proceeded to poke into the water. I wasn\u2019t just testing the depth; I was also making sure that there wasn\u2019t anything lurking beneath the surface. Once I found a sufficiently shallow pool, I dipped my hands in for several refreshing gulps.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen a splash came from out in the pond, it made me jump back and fall on my butt.\u201d Joseph smiled to himself as he watched her eyes move beneath their lids, \u201cYou know, if you were awake right now you\u2019d be laughing too. Anyway, I scanned the surface of the water for any signs of movement. About half way across the lake, were four small heads poking out of the water and swimming towards land. I hid behind a tree until I saw that the creatures crawling out of the pond were some kind of green otters. They were really small, so I saw no harm in stalking them for a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI figured if critters that small were moving around in broad daylight, then surely it meant that there were no predators to worry about. It would be nice to bathe in the pond without any worries of being torn in half. With the stick still in hand, I followed the otters for most of the day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d Joseph began as he filled a syringe with a pink liquid \u201cfollowing a gaggle of otters through a forest, buck naked for several hours sounds pretty exciting. But after a while, I gave the otters a silent \u201cthank you.\u201d After all, they had taught me so much about the place I now call home. I got to see which berries were safe to eat. I saw some weird ants that apparently like fecal matter. At which I thought: <i>Nice. Now I don\u2019t have to worry about stepping in anyone\u2019s crap, especially my own.</i> I even saw a boar carcass, which was a lot more interesting than it sounds. Based on its flat teeth, I managed to deduce that I could hunt them if I managed to get a better stick. Don\u2019t get me wrong, but those things are pretty damn big. No offense.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Joseph injected the pink liquid into Felecia\u2019s forearm, he couldn\u2019t help but marvel at his own skills. It was as if his hands instinctively knew what to do, and were operating independent of his own mind. He had the hands of a forty year medical veteran even though stubble was just beginning to grow on his chin. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnyway, the remaining discoveries of the day included a patch of plants that the otters dug up. I gave em a try and they weren\u2019t too bad. There was also a rock that they licked. I used my finger to give it a taste. It had this really weird flavor. It was nowhere near as weird as what went on in my head. A moment after the stuff had dissolved in my mouth, I thought the word: salt. A flood of images then poured into my head, showing me things like how I could grind up the salt rocks and use them to preserve dead animals for later use. It was easily the trippiest moment of the day.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph followed the next few steps in the medicine book. He grabbed two small rags. The first he folded and maneuvered into her mouth. The second he soaked in alcohol.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI might have kept on following those cute little guys were it not for what happened next. A solitary predator about half the size of the pig, jumped out of the bushes, grabbed an otter and snapped its neck all in the blink of an eye. It had kind of a wolf\u2019s head, monkey\u2019s body, long arms with long claws, and fairly sharp teeth. As I sat there and watched the thing fling the corpse around, giving little roars of victory, I wondered what to do next. Should I avoid it and not make any enemies, or steal the dead otter for myself?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBy the way, I take no enjoyment in this whatsoever.\u201d Joseph concluded his speech as he gently placed the alcohol drenched rag against her wound. Felecia\u2019s eyes flew open, her screams muffled under the rag. Upon seeing such a powerful creature reduced to relying on his care, Joseph gave a quick snicker before continuing.</span></div></div>",

As her body slowly began to relax, her half closed eyes wandered the room before falling on Joseph. Upon seeing Joseph\u2019s face, she was greeted with a relieved smile. \u201cHey there sleepy head. Welcome back to the world of the living.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia moaned groggily and made muffled sounds through the rag that sounded vaguely like \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Her voice was deep and almost sensual. Taking into account the rag in her mouth and her severe loss of blood, her voice might as well have been a whisper compared to her usual volume.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Continuing to apply pressure against the rag on her side, Joseph asked \u201cWe\u2019re in my house. Are you feeling any better?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Using her left and severely less bruised arm Felecia removed the cloth from her mouth.  \u201cThere\u2019s less pain, but my head\u2019s all fuzzy. Why am I here?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph grabbed her right hand and placed it over the cloth on her wound, telling her to keep up the pressure while he got something out of a med-kit. \u201cYou were attacked, remember? You said that you were ambushed on patrol so you came here looking like that. I managed to walk you to this room and started working on your injuries. We\u2019ll be talking about how you look later.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you\u201d Felecia wheezed as she rested her eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, cause right now we got more pressing issues. Tops on the list: won\u2019t they be able to track you here? Why didn\u2019t you go back to your cave?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Doing her best to formulate words despite her loss of blood, Felecia did her best to answer his questions. \u201cMy cave was too far from where they ambushed me. Even if it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the most defendable of positions, especially in my present state.\u201d Felecia hissed as Joseph applied medicine soaked cotton balls against her various scratches. \u201cBesides, this is the most secure place I know of.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he asked, extending his arm in the direction of the living room. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wall that\u2019s made up of mostly glass. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard but glass is pretty flimsy.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia gave a light chuckle. \u201cThis place may have the look and feel of wood, glass, and carpet, but trust me when I say that this place is impenetrable.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lifting her eyelids slightly to see Joseph\u2019s stress, Felecia answered \u201cI nearly dislocated my shoulder trying to smash through that \u2018flimsy\u2019 glass not three months before you appeared. It\u2019s likely that nothing short of a falling tree is capable of breaking through these walls.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026ok\u201d Joseph said. Felecia\u2019s calmness even in the face of certain death was most reassuring. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure there\u2019s no way for them to get in.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe only way I know of is through the locked door.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph\u2019s eyes widened as he faced away from Felecia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou did lock the door, didn\u2019t you?\u201d </span></div></div>",

Looking back he instructed \u201cjust keep putting pressure on that cloth and you should be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he walked out the archway to the room where the weakened Felecia still lay, Joseph began going over the configuration of the house in his mind. To his right was the room where he use to sleep. He gave a quick peek inside. Satisfied that there were no predators small enough to hide in there he turned his attention to the left. After seeing no immediate danger, Joseph made his way down the hall. At the other end of the hall was the living room and the only door in and out of the house. Between him and the door rested a large couch and two recliners. They would provide decent cover to approach the door unnoticed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The problem lay in uncertainty; the uncertainty as to whether or not the door was already locked, and the uncertainty about the condition of the blinds. Normally Joseph left the blinds open during the day to help warm the house. As per Felecia\u2019s advice, he started closing the blinds at night to keep his privacy. It was a new habit that had yet to completely sink in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally coming to the end of the hall, Joseph knew his next step would be to peek around the corner to check on the blinds and the door. If the blinds for the window wall were closed then he could probably head straight for the door without pause. Open blinds would call for a much more subtle approach, especially if there was movement outside. However, the biggest issue wasn\u2019t whether or not the door was locked, but whether or not it was closed. Even if it wasn\u2019t locked the only way to open it was to turn the handle and the only predators in Naxia with opposable thumbs were him and apparently Felecia. If he hadn\u2019t closed the door completely and it had been blown open by a gust of wind, then something may have already wandered in. something that Joseph wasn\u2019t confident he could take with just a spear and knife.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment of truth.</span></div></div>",

In this poor light, the door seemed as closed as it could get, but the blinds were open. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t move fast\u201d Joseph muttered to himself as he ducked down, ready to jump behind the couch. \u201cGotta be cautious.\u201d The storm continued to rage outside. The songs of nocturnal birds drowned out by the constant thud of raindrops and the occasional boom of thunder. The dangerous part was the lightening. If he peeked out during a flash then he might be able to see outside movement, but if anything was out there they\u2019d certainly be able to see him, flash or no flash. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Staying as low as possible, Joseph tucked and almost rolled behind the couch. Still in crouching position he moved swiftly behind the couch. Arriving at the edge, weapons still in hand, Joseph made another jump, this time for the first recliner. As he did so a flash of light filled the room. While taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph felt the rumble of thunder move through his entire body, accompanied, shortly after, by distant howls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With each breath, Joseph\u2019s heart seemed to beat faster. At this point he was actually to the right of the door. Directly in front of him was the brick and wood part of the wall. He continued to hide behind the recliners until he was completely against the wall. Pressing himself against it, Joseph made good time to the door. Confirming that it was indeed unlocked, he considered the next challenge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph still didn\u2019t know whether or not the predators were near yet, the door was half made of glass, and the door-knob. He would have to reach out across almost two feet of transparent glass, provoking anything within twenty meters to charge.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fearing that the sound of his racing heart could be heard over the sound of the storm, Joseph attempted to calm himself. \u201cThey\u2019re just dumb animals you moron. Even if they do see you they don\u2019t know how doors work.\u201d Starting to laugh a bit, Joseph continued muttering to himself. \u201cBesides, if the door\u2019s closed enough to endure the wind then it could probably take a direct hit from a charging rhino. Right?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making up his mind, Joseph discarded the notion of reaching slowly across the door. Instead he dropped his weapons and made one last jump in front of the door, turning the lock until he heard the click.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he stared outside, the constant splatter of drops continuing to bombard its glass, Joseph felt a wave of relief wash over him. Bursts of laughter were interrupted by brief but deep calming breaths. All was right in the world as lightning flashed again, illuminating the swaying brush outside and covering it in an instant with a mass of fur and teeth.</span></div></div>",

The giant wolf\u2019s body and face was covered in long black fur, a pair of horns as thick and long as a human arm protrude threateningly from its head and eyes, as bright and yellow as the sun, glared level with Joseph\u2019s. The monster\u2019s long fangs had such strength and sharpness that they made Joseph\u2019s spear the equivalent of a tooth-pick. This thought provoked a most unpleasant image in Joseph\u2019s mind. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The latest resident of Naxia might have gone on to examine other intimidating features of this vicious beast; he might even have noticed an entire pack pacing back and forth just behind it. However, Joseph was far too preoccupied with the rows of flesh rending teeth that were revealed by the drom\u2019s partially opened mouth. There were also the drom\u2019s eyes to consider; those deep golden eyes that seemed to consume all those who lost their way in them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Out of nowhere the beast moved, opening its mouth several inches before closing to its original position, almost like a silent bark. A startled Joseph took several steps backward. The scare tactic had effectively broken him out of thed trance. Able to think again, Joseph started remembering Felecia\u2019s teachings. The first was in regards to large predators and how to never look them in the eye. After that, the dam in his mind collapsed and al his lessons came rushing back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph recounted one of Felecia\u2019s earliest lessons. He remembered the way she would stare out across the forest as she lay sunning on one of the large rocks outside her cave, her cat like tail swaying from side to side. A gust of wind brought with it a flurry of pollen, causing Joseph periodic sneezes. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without even glancing at him, she said \u201cShow no fear. It is the defining feature of prey when they are afraid; especially in the minds of the scavengers. To show fear is to admit weakness to a harsh and unforgiving world. A beast may not have fang, claw, or horn to boast of, but if they are not afraid then they likely have just reason to be so. Be it out of ignorance or confidence, it is a dangerous gamble to charge the one who is not afraid.\u201d It was then that Felecia turned her head and looked him straight in the eye. \u201cProve yourself and do not blink\u201d she said as she continued staring right through him. \u201cShow no fear. Show no weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph had failed the first test, but after weeks of practice all his hard work seemed to have paid off. Just as Felecia told him, Joseph stood his ground, choosing to stare between the beast\u2019s eyes rather than into them. He crunched his brow, tensed his muscles threateningly, and bore his teeth with a low growl. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The drom attempted another bark, this one less silent. It took every ounce of Joseph\u2019s will power not to budge as he stared past the razor sharp teeth into the gaping maw that could swallow him whole.  The beast stared into Joseph\u2019s eyes in an effort to lock him in another trance, but to no avail. It could find no fear to latch on to, only courage. Slowly it began to dawn on the drom that perhaps the naked pink creature it stared at wasn\u2019t prey. No prey could stare into his eyes without shaking in fear. The over-fluffed puppy lowered its gaze as he cautiously backed away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Satisfied that both he and Felecia were safe, and that he had stood his ground, Joseph started to move again. Without ceasing to stare through the glass, Joseph collected his weapons, confirmed one last time that the door was locked and proceeded to close the blinds. With everything set and secure, Joseph used the remains of his strength to move himself out of the living room and into the hallway. There he collapsed, tears of fear flowing from his eyes. Joseph remained this way for several minutes.</span></div></div>",

As he fell to his knees by her side, Felecia looked up into his red watery eyes. Without needing to ask why, she reached out and touched Joseph\u2019s knee. \u201cNice job kid.\u201d Felecia said proudly, giving him the necessary strength he needed to continue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wiping away the remains of his tears, Joseph smiled back at Felecia. \u201cRight. Well, I hate to leave things unfinished, so why don\u2019t I pick up where we left off.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWonderful\u201d Felecia said rolling her eyes and pulling her hand back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trying to remember where he had last stopped, Joseph dived back into his tale. \u201cUm, this next part\u2019s a bit fuzzy, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Joseph said hesitantly. \u201cAs I weighed my options I noticed some mysterious crackling sound that seemed to reverberate throughout the woods. It grew louder and louder until it sounded like thunder, and I watched as one of the trees started to fall. It wasn\u2019t falling towards me and that was good, especially since I was so freaked that I couldn\u2019t move. The creature I was watching seemed to be in the same boat. The only difference was that the tree fell on her instead of me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis part is also a bit fuzzy. All I can really remember is this unbearable stabbing headache. I pressed my hands against my head for all the good it did me. The only other thing I remember before passing out was some kind of flash inside my mind; so many lights and shapes.\u201d Joseph had to look away for a moment. Every time he thought about his headaches, he seemed to cause them to come back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen I finally came to, I saw that the creature was writhing underneath the tree. I looked at her and immediately the word \u2018Gralder\u2019 came to mind.\u201d Joseph smiled exhaustively and shook his head. \u201cI started wondering how I suddenly knew what the gralder\u2019s name was when I hadn\u2019t a clue only a couple minutes ago. The only thing that really came to mind was that flash in my head. Thankfully before I could put in any serious thought and cause a relapse, the gralder decided to cry out and snap me back to my senses. I walked over to the squirming monkey-thing and noticed he saw that she had dropped the otter a few feet away. As I got closer, I met eyes with her and she stopped struggling. I can\u2019t really explain it, but I think we share a little moment of understanding. The gralder\u2019s back leg was being crushed beneath the tree and there was no way for her to escape. She was fully aware that I could find a large rock, smash her skull, and eat the remains. </span></div></div>",

And to make a long story short I broke off a thick branch from the fallen tree and used it as a lever to move the tree just enough for the gralder to escape. All the while a voice in the back of my head kept screaming at me, calling me an idiot. So you see, I really don\u2019t need your help in that regard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce she was free, I immediately took several steps back. She rose to her maximum height and started stretching her various extremities. For some reason she felt the need to start doing a little dance, it was like she was celebrating her survival. Eventually she decided to test her leg. She put her weight on it for barely an instant before immediately pulling her broken leg back into the air. She gave a light yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think I must have laughed or something, cause then the gralder looked at me. Her face was blank as her eyes seemed to survey me. I watched her eyes dart between me and the tree branch that I held between us. I guess she was confused at the fact that she was still alive, and more so that I had spared her. She turned away from me and buried her face in the brush on the ground, sniffing through the twigs until she found her way to where the otter had dropped. She picked it up with her jaws and turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.\u201d Joseph\u2019s eyes darted to Felecia\u2019s face. He could have sworn that she had just smiled, if only for a second. Joseph continued telling his story, confident that his words were indeed getting through to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith seemingly intelligent and humble movements, and the otter still in her mouth, the gralder started moving closer and closer to me. Guessing her intentions, I lowered my stick a bit as a sign of good will. But I never stopped aiming the sharp end at her. If it was a trick, I wasn\u2019t going to fall for it. She continued to approach until she was mere inches outside of my stick\u2019s range. She opened her mouth a bit and let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt could have ended there, but it didn\u2019t. I had almost completely relaxed my stick and everything. I was even in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position. That\u2019s when the gralder did something to make us both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

I even yelled \u2018Back\u2019!\u201d Joseph raised his voice a bit to try and match his original volume. \u201cShe flinched a bit at the sound of my voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept taking baby step after baby step.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI thought to myself: If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. We were in each other\u2019s territory then; her within reach of my spear, and me within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured, I said to myself. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI got my answer when the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I thought, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If that weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With my spear still trained on her head, I pondered this for a few moments. Finally, I decided on the only practical option available. Very slowly, I lowered my spear past her until it was pointing at the dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith a single motion I jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back. I was ready to fight off the gralder if it had turned out to have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. I kept moving back until I was about four meters away, and decided that it was safe to turn my back. The instant I did so the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following me. She limped the whole way. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was pretty weird. When I stopped she did as well. When I turned around she bowed her head. We played this game of stop and go for almost an hour before I decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. I slowed my pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. I found another berry bush and ate my fill since there was no way to carry any with me. I even let the gralder eat her fill after I had walked far enough forward. It was kind of relieving to see her eat. Once the house was finally in sight, I decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning around to face her, I called \u2018Hurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper\u2019.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I even found some material that looked like it would make a suitable splint for Gimp. I also found stones that made excellent spark rocks. Once I was done foraging outside, I told Gimp to stay put while I ventured inside to find anything of use that I might have missed earlier. Surprisingly, there was plenty. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnly a fraction of the cabinets and drawers had opened around the house. This might have been disappointing, had it not been for the fact that almost everything I found was of use. My new treasures included four boxes of matches, kitchen knives, two of which looked like they could be useful in a fight, rags, towels, silverware, two tool belts with holsters, a sewing kit, an ax, a small case full of various medicines and bandages, and much more. My final treasure that day was book containing detailed illustrations on the plants, creatures, and minerals of the forest. The title was Survival in Naxia.\u201d Pausing for a bit, \u201cYes I know, we\u2019ll be getting to the book in a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI finally remembered that I was hungry. The growls in my stomach were growing ever louder as I began my work. I started by designating a spot for the fire, setting the rocks in a circle, filling it with most of the dried wood I had collected earlier, and set the other pieces in their respective locations. It only took me about four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire; I was so proud. Then I bled, skinned, cleaned, gutted, and finally roasted the otter. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith Gimp sitting a few yards away from the fire, and my spear resting next to him, I picked up the book and read to the fading light of the setting sun. It was a very detailed book; with its categorizations and big words that I still don\u2019t fully understand. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia are categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. I didn\u2019t make it very far that night, but I did skim through some of the edible and poisonous plants. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce the meat seemed ready, I put the book down, grabbed one end of the spit and took a big bite.\u201d Joseph paused for a moment as he recounted that first bite. \u201cIt was freaking delicious. After I had my fill I used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After putting out the fire I packed up the gear and made my way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. I climbed into the old bed while Gimp curled up beside me and we both drifted off to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The drumbeat of my heart overwhelmed the songs of birds which had greeted me the previous day. I tried to recount exactly what had scared me so much; what my nightmare had been about.\u201d  Joseph began to shutter. It was like standing in front of that damn Drom all over again. Joseph was always a bit shaky when it came to thinking about sleep and dreams. \u201cBut as with most dreams, it quickly escaped me. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI felt a sudden pressure around my arm and jerked, only to see that it was a concerned Gimp.

Chirping insects, singing birds, and the occasional howl in the distance, gave the forest an overwhelming and almost soothing thrum. I could hardly keep his eyes open as I sat up against the red tree. I sat beneath an exceptionally large hole in the canopy, enjoying the feel of the warm sun against my wet skin. I had just finished a nice swim in the pond. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven the rumble of a nearby snoring Gimp was lulling me to sleep. She had been so relieved at having her cast removed that she wore herself out in celebration.\u201d Joseph smiled as he recounted how the fuzzy creature had galloped and bounded around the pond while he swam. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was on the verge of taking a nap, but I managed to pull myself out of it.\u201d Joseph shuddered. \u201cI had kinda made a commitment to sleep only as much as my body needed and not a second more. I looked around to find something to keep my mind occupied. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA newly carved and hardened spear lay by my side. It seemed to be waiting impatiently for the next hunt when it would again taste blood.\u201d Joseph smiled as he noticed the empathy in Felecia\u2019s expression. \u201cHanging from a nail directly overhead was my old pack holding a few pieces of red fruit, the guide book, a cutting knife, about 20ft of poorly crafted rope if I do say so myself, and a pair of trunks I had made from that first pig. I could have taken the trunks swimming with me, but they itched something awful. So they were left hanging while I got my bare ass dirty again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was about that time that I thought of the book.

He knew that he had power over her, at least in this particular situation, and he was going to milk it for all it was worth. Felecia averted her eyes, signaling that he had permission to go on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo. As I flipped through the pages of my personal bible, I recounted what a marvelous and useful tool it was. It had taught me what I could and couldn\u2019t eat, which things were poisonous, some crap about fertile soil, and a lot more stuff that even you can\u2019t tell me. The opening two pages held a detailed fold out map of all Naxia. As you might have already known, this land was shaped like a perfect square. I was able to make out where my house was in relation to trails, bodies of water and a suspicious labyrinth of stone in a place called Naxia\u2019s Teeth. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe bulk of the book seemed more like one giant glossary than a guide. It was divided into several volumes. Each detailed the different species in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHowever, amidst sea of words of the first few Volumes, I discovered some highly unusual marks. While the majority of the book was quite readable, every now and then a string of unfamiliar symbols would replace words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it cuz I was still shocked that I could even read. But these marks really got my attention when I noticed a substantial increase within the chapter on deadly diseases.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let it bother you too much\u201d Felecia comforted. \u201cI\u2019ve read that book and I\u2019ve seen those grey areas. Trust me that I can fill in most of those gaps through life experiences. After all, I\u2019ve been here a lot longer than you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes\u201d answered Joseph sarcastically. \u201cThe almighty Felecia rushes in yet again to save the day. Anyway, Volumes Three and Four described the fungus and plants of the forest. I skimmed through this section rather quickly, so the only things to catch my attention were a picture of a patch of long grass with a large rock resting behind its rows and an orange moss with the ability to decompose fecal matter. If I\u2019m using too many big words, it means that you can crap on it one day and come back the next to find a bigger clump of moss.\u201d Joseph laughed to himself as he remembered the first time he read this and how he had found a patch of moss near his house and tested it.</span></div></div>",

While they had neither teeth nor venom, they secreted hallucinogenic mucus from their skin when frightened. A quote from the author directly following this fact still confuses me. \u2018Don\u2019t even think about it.\u2019 Weird huh?\u201d Felecia chuckled to herself, gaining Joseph\u2019s attention. \u201cIs there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia shook her head. \u201cOf course there is.

Just do what the damn book says and try not to think about it.\u201d Felecia waited a moment while Joseph attempted to stare her down. She half-smiled at his newfound boldness. Rather than do the same back to him, she merely gave him a look that said that she could but chose not to. Staring into her deep golden slit eyes, Joseph was the first to back down. \u201cJust don\u2019t go sticking the damn things in your mouth without cooking them first. You\u2019ll live longer.

I practically threw that book to the ground and screamed like a girl at the sight of those scaly heads. It took me a little while to recover, but I managed. I found the place where I left off and immediately folded the page over before continuing.\u201d Laughing to himself \u201cAnd I thought the nightmares were bad.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNext came the birds. While the beautiful and bizarre fouls of Section Four were pretty to look at, I was growing ever more fretful at the increasing frequency of the unreadable glyphs. It seemed that the closer I came to the end of the guide, the more they seemed to creep up on me. The other unnerving detail of this section was the final entry depicting a very large bird. The five foot Kresht had brownish green feathers for camouflage, could reach speeds that surpassed the any other land creature thus far. It could certainly give you a run for your money. And it had a sharp beak for rending the flesh from its prey. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReading that, I was so freaked out I had to put the book down for a sec and take a look around. When I was satisfied by the unbothered stir of the forest and the still resting Gimp, I pulled my spear in a bit closer and uneasily resumed reading to Section Five. Looking back, I guess I failed to consider the distant warning cry of the zimzim; easily the brightest and loudest bird in all Naxia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was almost laughable that something as dreadful as the kresht could be followed up by the most adorable little mouse anyone had ever seen. At the time, I thought it was some kind of positive omen for the rest of the volume. Or rather, I tried to think of it that way. As I read through the remaining creatures, a sense of unease was growing in my gut, almost like I could feel time was running out.</span></div></div>",

I started to think that the book was teasing me and I still stand by that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat followed was a trio of predators of ever increasing size that made my heart run a marathon. The first resembled a gralder, except this one was twice as large and had wings. Next came the Droms; aka, those giant dogs that I saved you from. The third and final beast was some manner of big cat with long fangs extending below the roof of its mouth. My heart might have exploded out of my chest were it not for the suspiciously glaring fact that all of these large predators were situated in and around Naxia\u2019s Teeth, all the way at the opposite end of the map.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph paused and looked up for a moment. \u201cIn fact, almost all of the larger animals seemed to make their home in the top two thirds of the map; a most puzzling phenomenon that I couldn\u2019t help but ponder.

It was a picture of me. Me! But it wasn\u2019t me, not really. The man in the picture was almost ten years older. He wore thick fur garments that vaguely resembled the fur of the big cat with the saber teeth. His body was hunched over as he stalked through the forest. In his right hand he gripped a spear with some kind of stone tip tied to the end. The hair on his face and head was surprisingly trim, especially in comparison to these mats.\u201d Joseph tilted his head and stroked his hair so that Felecia could see his rat\u2019s nest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOver half of the descriptions in the entry were written in the unreadable glyphs.

I was certainly relieved that the creature I saw didn\u2019t remotely resemble the abomination I was expecting. Standing majestically atop a large stone at the border of Naxia\u2019s Teeth, a great lilac purple cat gazed out upon her territory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn an effort to ignore the anxiety from my thunderous heartbeat, I started back through the guide. If I remember correctly, it described the creature as an Utek, or Panthera Sapien. It also said that this giant cat was more physically powerful than any human on record with the exception of three, and then came more glyphs. Wonder who they might have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia gave a light chuckle at his words. Joseph decided not to push the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn-between the glyphs were all kinds of useless footnotes; a lot of which included it enormous size and weight. Apparently an Utek can stand about 3.5 meters tall with its head fully raised. Go figure, huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers talked about the fact that since the Utek seemed like such a freakishly powerful super predator that it probably originates somewhere other than Naxia.

Low and behold all remaining text had been replaced with the glyphs. But I didn\u2019t notice this until much later. My attention was focused on the second appearance of a second picture in a single entry. Damn that thing was freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seemed like an unremarkable sketch of some kind of dark rock partially hidden behind layers of a familiar batch of long grass. After pondering this for a few seconds, I finally realized where I had seen it before and turned back to the Volume on plants. I skimmed through the pages a bit before finally finding it. It was little more than a photo of a common kind of grass called Emel. I was holding the pages with his left thumb and forefinger so I could hold my place. I flipped back and forth between them in an effort to compare the two images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe image in the plant Volume, like every other picture in the guide, was a photograph. While the Volume Five version was the one and only sketch, and a pretty well drawn sketch at that. As I continued to stare at the sketch trying to deduce its purpose, I gradually became aware of two small yellow blotches on the rock. Pulling the book closer, the blotches becoming ever clearer, I at last he noticed their symmetric positions and shapes. As I drew the book ever closer to my face, I was able to make out lines that seemed to take the shape of a nose. From there an image of a face was formed, followed soon after by teeth, a lower jaw and a crouching body. But always I kept going back to those yellow hypnotic cat eyes.\u201d Joseph\u2019s heart continued to race just as it had done that very day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sudden nearby rustle caused me to jump. I fumbled to recapture the loose book, but to no avail. Turning to the source of the sound, I saw that Gimp had woken from her nap. She was sitting up, her ears perked, fur standing on end, and eyes glued somewhere off in front of her and I. As I stared at her, at last it dawned on me that the forest was dead silent. Not a chirp, squawk, or squeak for miles. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTurning my head to face the same direction as Gimp, I immediately noticed a small rustle in a patch of Emel not 30 meters in front of me. And in that Emel were those same cold yellow eyes as depicted in the sketch.\u201d</span></div></div>",

How the hell would you have felt?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia crunched her brow. \u201cI felt scared. If you recall, I was no older than you are now when I first woke up in this place. My early years were filled with running, escaping, and glares from hungry predators. It wasn\u2019t until much later that I became strong enough not to run.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph calmed down and continued. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what I was looking at. But I wasn\u2019t exactly in a thinking state of mind. Those eyes\u2026 it felt like they were swallowing me alive. I might have stayed lost in those eyes if it weren\u2019t for Gimp. And you\u2019ll never guess what she did,\u201d Joseph said sarcastically. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh I don\u2019t know\u201d Felecia answered acerbically with a false smile. \u201cDid she do the only intelligent thing and run away?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah\u201d Joseph exhaled. \u201cI heard a rustle from where she was lying which broke me out of that trance. It took me a bit but the sound of claws scraping against wood forced me to look up. The bitch was half way up the damn tree by then. Course, in her position, guess I would\u2019 a done the same.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI quickly faced forward again to see if the Utek had come any closer. It hadn\u2019t. It just stayed in the long grass in what I assume was a crouching position, ready to spring up and pounce on me in a second. Fortunately, I knew better than to get myself trapped in its eyes again. I glanced down hastily and immediately remembered the spear. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe gears started winding in my head. The Utek outmatched me in strength, speed, and size, but there was a chance that I had a superior intellect. I could use my small size and low center of gravity to my advantage. If I could manage to get the spear in just the right position, then it might be possible to use the beast\u2019s own momentum against it; essentially I would make the Utek impale itself. It wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but I knew that it was my only chance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlacing my hand just over the spear, I looked back up and faced the Utek. I guess my expression gave away the fact that I had a plan, because it was then that the Utek decided to show herself. It wasn\u2019t her full height mind you, but the grass she stood in, the grass that could conceal my stomach, barely brushed her elbows. Disregarding this I grasped the spear in my hand and got to my feet. I turned backwards for all of a full second before I found a suitable notch in the tree in which I could use as leverage for the spear. As I turned to face forward again, a short, heavy, warm gust hit my face. A dark fuzzy wall eclipsed my view as the air around me suddenly reeked of fresh animal carcasses. And when I looked up, all I could see was that giant maw surrounded by teeth.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The beast\u2019s body covered in that dark violet, almost black fur. Finally I saw my spear. The tip was barely an inch away from her fur, and I\u2019d guess two inches from her skin. It must have been about here,\u201d Joseph said while pressing against the soft gap at the front of his collar bone, \u201cjust below the voice box, where the neck meets the torso.

Once he began thinking deeper into what he said and how he had said it, he gave silent gratitude to the gods that the light was dim enough to hide his blushing cheeks.

Pathetic.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHold on there,\u201d Joseph held out his hand and got to his feet. \u201cI think I might have read it in the Guide, why don\u2019t I just take a look?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis only strengthens my point.\u201d Felecia called out as Joseph walked away. \u201cYou seem to remember everything else about your life and that book, but the one thing I want to know is the one thing you can\u2019t offer.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph exhaled heavily. \u201cI can\u2019t be expected to remember ever single freaking thing.

Joseph knew it was a dangerous gamble to pressure her, but he was confident that Felecia would blink before him. He gained a further confidence boost<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cit would be nice to know the context of what you said. I mean, is a sea really that deep and full? And besides\u201d she whimpered, pushing her bottom lip out, \u201cI wanted to know.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph cursed Felecia. He knew what she wanted to ask but wouldn\u2019t. After finally finding the section in the book that talks about the sea, the only answer he could give to the unasked question was \u2018yes\u2019. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d Joseph responded, turning around to face Felecia. \u201cEyes as deep and full as the sea does mean beautiful.\u201d He looked down at the open pages of the book as he walked back to his place at her side. \u201cThe passage goes on and on about how the sea sparkles. \u2018Billions of fish in millions of colors can make the sea indistinguishable from a living rainbow.\u2019 Shame there aren\u2019t any in Naxia. Guess I\u2019ll just have to make do with something just as good. \u201cJoseph smiled. He knew that he had blinked first, but wasn\u2019t too sore about his loss.</span></div></div>",

They're durable enough to be stepped on and even survive stomach acid, but not invincible. Based on the story by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2198917-Minizora-Mayhem\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper had had an eventful last few hours to say the least. After being dropped off by their folks in this tourist trap town, he and his sister Mabel had a bit of an incident. And by incident, he\u2019s obviously referring to Mabel being kidnapped and almost forced into marriage with 1,000 gnomes, followed by an epic chase in a golf cart from a composite gnome monster, and ending with the defeat of said monster with a leaf blower. However, now that the adrenaline had fallen and they were up in the attic for the evening, Dipper took greater interest with his initial big discovery: a mysterious journal with a six fingered hand on the cover. Of particular interest to the three inch tall boy was that the book was sized to minizora like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ch\u2019ya readin\u2019 there, bro-bro?\u201d asked Mabel. The regular sized twelve year old was hanging upside down off the edge of her bed. She wore her usual purple sleeping sweater as her feet kicked idly in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe journal about the mysteries of Gravity Falls,\u201d Dipper explained. \u201cYou know, the one I showed you a few hours ago back when I thought the gnomes were actually a zombie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gave a snorting laugh. \u201cYeah. Great job being the smart twin. Can\u2019t even tell the difference between gnomes and zombies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper narrowed his eyes on his sister. \u201cOh yeah? Well you followed a strange guy you\u2019d only just met out into the woods where anything could have happened! Honestly, it turning out to be gnomes was pretty lucky on your end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault! I thought he was a vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that makes it better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel folded her arms and turned away in a huff, still upside-down. \u201cI won\u2019t even dignify that with a response.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been out in the sun all day wearing only a hoodie,\u201d reminded Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe could be using super vampire sunblock. You don\u2019t know,\u201d Mabel whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, that makes literally no sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it does. In fact, I know how to settle this. You\u2019ve got a journal full of weird stuff, right? Go ahead and check.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gave a soft chuckle as he flipped through the pages. \u201cYou know, that was a lot more mature than what I was expecting from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean? I\u2019m super mature! I\u2019m the most maturest mature person to ever\u2026 mature! Also I\u2019m a girl, and everyone knows girls mature faster than boys,\u201d she finished with a dignified huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cRiiight. Mabel is sooo mature. She shops for teddy bear undies in the big girl isle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheeks flushed, Mabel\u2019s hands shot down (relative to her perspective) to cover her sweater over her unmentionables. \u201cYou saw nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Dipper said with a dismissive wave. \u201cYou and your\u2026 wait a minute.\u201d He stopped flipping through pages and brought the book up to his face. \u201cI found it! The section on vampires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me!\u201d Mabel tried to stand, but only managed to flip onto her face with a thud. \u201cOw. Ugh. Just read it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Well I\u2019ll be. It says here that vampires do sometimes use a super sunblock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ha!\u201d Mabel shot a fist up in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuut,\u201d Dipper continued, \u201cit\u2019s made of ingredients considered repugnant by vampires. If a vampire were actually using the stuff, they\u2019d also have to wear nose plugs so they don\u2019t gag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s arm fell limp. \u201cAh poo.\u201d Once she grew bored of lying on the floor, Mabel sat up and walked across the room to the side of Dipper\u2019s regular sized bed and planted her chin on the sheets. She looked down at him with curious and thoughtful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel,\u201d Dipper said warily as the big face loomed over him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing. Just thinking how lucky I am to have a little,\u201d she snickered, \u201cbrother like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ha-ha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it. You\u2019re so tiny, but you still came after me even when you thought I was about to be eaten by a zombie. You also drove a golf cart like a total pro. How\u2019d you do that again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecially modified for minizora drivers,\u201d Dipper explained, trying to focus on his reading. Now that he\u2019d started, there were just so many interesting factoids about vampires he\u2019d never considered before. \u201cBesides, you\u2019d have done the same for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell duh! But that\u2019s different. You were in, like, way more danger than me back there. What if one of those creepy gnomes stepped on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been stepped on before. Not that big a deal,\u201d Dipper explained dismissively. \u201cAlso, I wasn\u2019t the target for what I assume to have been an attempted gang bang by said creepy gnomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel pouted cutely. \u201cYou\u2019re making it really hard to give a heartfelt thank you for saving my life, you know. You put your life on the line for me when you didn\u2019t have to, and that means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper finally closed the book. \u201cActually, I did have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when someone\u2019s driving and a rabbit runs out in the middle of the road. Technically they don\u2019t <i>have</i> to slow down and let the fluffy adorable critters live, but if they don\u2019t slow down, then they just end up feeling awful all day. I wasn\u2019t about to spend the rest of the summer feeling awful about myself, so there really wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes shimmering, Mabel shot out a giant hand and snatched up her diminutive brother and pressed him firmly against her cheek in her closest approximation of a hug. \u201cI love you Dipper. You\u2019re the best brother ever! I don\u2019t ever want to let you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a tapping from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, keep it down up there!\u201d groused the gruff voice of their Grunkle Stan. \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear what a couple of preteens are doing so late at night alone in their room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, gross!\u201d growled Mabel as she stomped the floor in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper began to laugh as Mabel continued to hold him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a half bad sister, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch it, bro-bro.\u201d Suddenly serious, Mabel pointed an accusing finger at Dipper. \u201cIf you make me mad, then I\u2019ll show you just how immature I can really be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Dipper asked in taunting. \u201cWell that would certainly be a change of pace.\u201d Even as Mabel fumed, Dipper couldn\u2019t help himself and laughed at her expense. As her brother, he had a moral imperative to tease her at every opportunity, regardless of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! If you like my teddy bear panties so much, then maybe you\u2019d like to get acquainted for the rest of the night,\u201d she warned, giving him a chance to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s eyebrow climbed up his forehead. \u201cYou realize that\u2019d just prove Grunkle Stan right, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIre gone, Mabel blinked like a deer caught in the headlights. \u201cShoot!\u201d She kicked impotently at the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s no fair. How can I be a good big sister and keep my little brother in line if I can\u2019t use my go-to for punishment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cAre you actually asking, or are you just thinking out loud? Because if the latter, can I get the journal back?\u201d He pointed back down at the bed. \u201cI dropped it when you grabbed me.\u201d When he caught a devious glint in his sister\u2019s eye, Dipper knew he had to act quickly. \u201cKeep in mind that this journal has all kinds of information regarding the dangerous secrets of this town. If it weren\u2019t for that thing, I might not have gone after you in the first place. If anything bad happens to that book, I might not be able to save you next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel deflated and blew a raspberry. \u201cDouble poo.\u201d She turned a longing eye on the mini boy in her hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything I can do to punish you?\u201d she pleaded pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re seriously asking <i>me</i> that?\u201d Were this anyone but Mabel, Dipper would be floored by the audacity of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019ve got some pretty good ideas sometimes. What\u2019s something I can do to assert myself as the dominant twin that doesn\u2019t cross the line into, you know, weirdness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s never bothered you before. I think I\u2019ve completed, like, half my homework while stuffed in your clothes somewhere.\u201d He gestured up and down her body. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s not even really a punishment. More like my second room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleaaase!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine. Let me think.\u201d Dipper tapped his chin in thought, silently cursing himself for being unable to resist his sister\u2019s cute antics. \u201cHmm. I guess we could\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After settling into this den of weirdness, Dipper and Mabel were in the Mystery Shack\u2019s dining room having just completed an epic syrup race. Mabel had won, much to her regret, and Dipper was reading the towns\u2019 newspaper; scaled down for minizora of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mabel. Look at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger \u2013 but not older \u2013 sibling peered down at the tiny article. \u201cHuman sized hamster ball. Wait a minute\u2026 I\u2019m human sized!\u201d She sucked in a shocked breath. \u201cAnd so are you! But with a regular hamster ball. We can be hamster ball twins!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes and pointed to what he actually wanted to show her. It was a contest for photos of monsters. The winner got $1000. \u201cWe see weirder stuff than that every day. Did we get any photos of those gnomes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Just memories.\u201d Mabel waited a second before holding up a tuft of white hair. \u201cAnd this beard hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you save that?\u201d asked Dipper, backing away in revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of revulsion, that was when Grunkle Stan came in dressed in a pair of boxers and a night shirt with stains that were better left not thought about. The old man wanted to close the shop early and have a bonding day with the family. He promised that this would be nothing like the last time in which they made counterfeit money, which was followed up by a trip to the freezing county jail. With assurances like that, how could they refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a harrowing blindfolded drive across town, the twins were finally allowed to uncover their eyes and behold the lake, where apparently fishing season had opened. Said lake was positively lousy with the town\u2019s colorful denizens doing all sorts of wacky antics. Watching some of the rougher antics led to Mabel grabbing Dipper and setting him on her shoulder for safe keeping. But just as Grunkle Stan was finishing his less than stellar sales pitch for fishing for the next ten hours, that\u2019s when another old man started going off about some monster called the Gobblewonker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Mabel cooed. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a happy jig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when old man McGucket grabbed her shoulders and started screaming. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a jig of grave danger!\u201d warned the guy who had earned the title of town kook. He gave a far more convincing pitch for why the gobblewonker was real, pointing a boat that looked to have been bitten in half and offering a pretty detailed description of the creature. Alas, everyone else was entirely dismissive of his claims and soon the crowd dispersed, including his own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, did you hear what he said?\u201d Dipper asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, donkey spittle,\u201d she said in approximation of the old man\u2019s funny way of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the other thing. The monster. If we can snag a photo, we can split the prize fifty-fifty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s two fifties!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine what you could do with $500,\u201d Dipper encouraged, not bothering to correct her math. He then sat back as his sister\u2019s pupils went wide. Clearly she\u2019d been kidnapped by her own imagination again and it was just a matter of waiting for her to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper. I am one million percent on board with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Grunkle Stan delivered an inferior sales pitch for fishing, although this time he lost to Soos who\u2019d just driven up in a far superior boat. It wasn\u2019t a hard choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna find that gobblewonker!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna win that prize!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the excitement tempered a bit, the team of a pair of twins and the pair shaped chipmunk faced guy set about their plan. They\u2019d gone and bought an excessive amount of disposable cameras, which made a lot of sense given that none of them wanted to risk their expensive phones. As the boat neared Scuttlebutt Island, an ominous fog descended upon them. The island itself was just as creepy, but spirits were still high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you carry him around with you everywhere?\u201d Soos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel shrugged. \u201cNot everywhere. Just most wheres. Hehe. Saves him the trouble of getting lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, lost? You once got lost on the way to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is that it\u2019s just easier this way,\u201d Mabel insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s like a knight riding atop his elegant and beautiful steed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d agreed Dipper. \u201cThe real steed\u2019s at the shop for repairs, so they gave me this,\u201d he gestured with his thumb, \u201ccheap rental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. Good one, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheap? I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m about to be a five hundred-naire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well so am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy to tag along,\u201d Soos offered. \u201cSpeaking of tagging, I\u2019ve never really known a minizora before. What\u2019s it like being so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible. No matter what I do, I can always look up people\u2019s noses and see the horrors that lie within.\u201d That got everyone chuckling. \u201cBut seriously, it\u2019s not too bad. It doesn\u2019t hurt that I\u2019ve got a nice steed to take me places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee. He admits I\u2019m a steed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just easier than saying rented mule-ow!\u201d Dipper groaned as his head was pinched. \u201cSomebody help! A pair of sausage fingers are crushing my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure that\u2019s safe, dude?\u201d Soos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he\u2019s fine,\u201d assured Mabel. \u201cFirst day here that lumberjack guy stepped on him and he just walked it off. This,\u201d she tightened her pinch, \u201cis nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper finally stopped yelling, showing that he was just putting on a show. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s right. There\u2019s a reason so many stunt men are minizora, you know. We can handle just about anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything,\u201d Dipper affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much can you bench-press?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI once saw him lift up a whole pizza crust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, dude. You\u2019re like a super hero. Got the proportionate strength of an ant, only you\u2019re already pretty small, so it\u2019s not that impressive, but it\u2019s still pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Thanks a lot, Soos,\u201d Dipper said, feeling genuinely moved. Part of why he was the bookish type was because most kids his own age just made fun of him for being small. It was a refreshing change of pace to actually hear praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel grinned from ear-to-ear. She\u2019d already liked Soos. They got each other\u2019s humor. But in seeing how nice he was to Dipper, Mabel knew she\u2019d made a new friend for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a roar echoed through the woods. Birds were sent cawing in terror as the team finally had a direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it. This is it!\u201d Dipper said in whispered excitement. Still sitting on his sister\u2019s shoulder, he kicked at her through her sweater and urged her onward. \u201cYa, mule! Ya-ya, mule!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude. That\u2019d be so offensive\u2026 if it weren\u2019t so hilariously accurate,\u201d commented Soos as he grabbed a long and sharp stick. Perfect for stabbing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, it all turned out to be a false alarm. What looked like the gobblewonker through the fog was really just a derelict rotted out boat covered in cute beavers. And what sounded like the gobblewonker was actually an old chainsaw engine being messed with by a beaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 I was so sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there, little bro,\u201d consoled Mabel, petting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. At least we got to see a beaver with a chainsaw. That\u2019s pretty sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that old guy was crazy after all.\u201d Dipper slumped on his slumping seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did use the word \u2018scrap-doodle\u2019,\u201d Mabel agreed, just as despondent. While Soos was preoccupied with the beaver, the preteen girl decided to make some distance to give her brother some \u2018alone\u2019 time; which of course meant that she stuck nearby at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sucks. We didn\u2019t find the gobblewonker, and what are we gonna say to Grunkle Stan? We ditched him over nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s pretty bad,\u201d agreed Mabel. \u201cHe seemed really excited just to hang out with us and we left him high and dry\u2026 in that dinky little boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel. Did you feel-whoa!\u201d Dipper slipped, but thankfully caught himself on Mabel\u2019s lifejacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Mabel screamed, pointing out into the water where something big was swimming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d cheered Dipper, pulling out one of their last few cameras. \u201cI just have to-agh. Mabel, hold still. I can\u2019t get a good shot with you moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, dude,\u201d intoned Soos worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the few seconds since Dipper had taken his eyes off the lake, the gobblewonker had come up to the shore, rose it\u2019s long neck out of the water, and loomed menacingly over the trio. And then, just as Dipper turned back around, it roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuuun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn complete disregard to logic, the aquatic gobblewonker flopped its mighty frame onto land and used its flippers to give chase after the trio. Dipper couldn\u2019t run on his own, but he could stare into the jaws of death and warn the others where and when trees were falling on them. And while Soos was able to get them to the boat, the gobblewonker just hopped back in the water, where it was significantly faster. What followed was an exciting chase across the lake, overturning many boats and causing general mayhem. Grunkle Stan would have found it hilarious, were he not on the business end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! Beavers!\u201d cried Mabel as beavers began raining down on the boat. With their home just destroyed, the little fuzz balls were understandably agitated and were biting at anything they could reach. \u201cAhh! My brother!\u201d Before one of the overgrown rats could chomp the little guy, Mabel beat him to it and stuffed Dipper in her mouth for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hardly a new experience for Dipper. He\u2019d been eaten by his sister more times than he could count, though usually it was under less life threatening circumstances. The air was humid, Mabel had apparently forgotten to brush this morning, and saliva was creeping into his clothes. Keeping her lips shut, Mabel was still screaming as Dipper bounced around on the soft tongue. In a brief respite, he caught himself thinking that this wouldn\u2019t be so bad if only he weren\u2019t wearing sticky clingy clothes, but that was neither here nor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a flashlight, Dipper opened the journal and quickly searched for anything related to the gobblewonker, but instead found a very interesting map of the lake. He tapped at Mabel\u2019s teeth and signaled her to open her mouth. She did, screaming as she\u2019d taken over the steering after Soos had been incapacitated by a beaver. \u201cHead for the waterfall!\u201d Dipper instructed as he clung to the tongue for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel did, and everyone braced themselves for the worst. Fortunately, the journal proved true. There was a cave on the other side. Even better, it was too small for the gobblewonker, rendering it stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s stuck!\u201d Dipper cheered, patting himself down within his sister\u2019s maw. \u201cWait, I don\u2019t have any more cameras!\u201d he exclaimed in a sudden panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah.\u201d Mabel extended her tongue with her brother upon it and removed his hat, where he still had one tiny camera left. How lucky were they to find a place that sold tiny cameras? \u201cZare,\u201d she said helpfully with her tongue still occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed with elation, Dipper danced around on the tongue as he ran through the entire roll of film. \u201cThis is it! We finally got the picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Mabel also cheered, ignoring the taste of fabric. It was more fun to play with a naked brother in her mouth than a clothed one. This would be important information to consider for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while everyone was cheering, the gobblewonker\u2019s flailing caused a light cave in, leading to a large rock crushing its head and making some odd metallic sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d Mabel started to ask. \u201cAhh, Dipper!\u201d She reached out, but the little guy was already hopping down the cliff with the speed of a goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Quick little dude, ain\u2019t he,\u201d observed Soos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Mabel grumbled irritably. She hated when Dipper ran away from her, especially towards something so obviously dangerous. Her own efforts to follow were slower and more careful. Oh, Dipper was going to pay for making her worry like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, come check this out,\u201d Dipper called from atop the creatures back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they\u2019d arrived, they found one of those spinning door cranks. It was on Mabel and Soos to open it up, revealing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld man McGucket!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town kook was at some kind of control panel. It was defunct now, but clearly he\u2019d been piloting the gobblewonker. As it turned out, he\u2019d built this behemoth killing machine because he felt neglected and wanted some attention, especially from his family. While even he admitted that it was pretty contrived, his story did move the kids to sympathy for their own old person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, they all decided to make up with and spend the rest of the day with their favorite Grunkle. Fishing turned out to be a lot of fun. Even fleeing the lake police was enjoyable. All was well, except that there was an old man in a cave with a history of building death machines and the stated intent of making a death ray. Not to mention that Dipper never finished reading the lake segment of the journal, which had a good many pages devoted to the real life gobblewonker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun set and the day concluded, the Pines family and Soos departed the lake for their respective homes. Mabel held Dipper in her lap all the while, wondering how she was going to deal with her brother\u2019s reckless behavior.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following dinner at the Mystery Shack, Dipper and Mabel decided to wash up before heading to bed; especially Dipper who was all too eager to discard his saliva drenched clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mabel, could you get a cup of water or something?\u201d asked the naked twelve year old of his undressing twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Standing in the bathroom, Mabel was down to just a pair of blue panties. She stared at her tiny naked brother, free of any sense of shame. They\u2019d been bathing together since they were born, so the sight of the other\u2019s naked body was nothing new to either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just I don\u2019t want these,\u201d Dipper gestured to the clothes in his arms, \u201cto dry and get all crusty before they can get washed. You know what crusty clothes are like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Only cuz you won\u2019t shut up about it,\u201d grumbled Mabel as she picked up the pile of garments and reached over the sink to ready a glass of water. This brought her bare and underdeveloped chest awfully close to her brother, but Dipper\u2019s eyes were on something more important than her little nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong, Mabel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. Of course not!\u201d She kicked at the carpet. \u201cWhy would you think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper cringed. \u201cOh, you know, no reason. Just being a concerned brother is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConcerned brother, huh? Is that what you call it when you leave me behind and run straight towards a giant monster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, give me a break. I was curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurious, huh? Curiosity killed the cat, Dipper!\u201d she said like it was some scathing accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my defense, a giant rock just fell on the thing\u2019s head. It was either dead or concussed. Either way, I\u2019m too small to be looked at as prey. I was perfectly safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing safe about giant sea monsters, <i>little</i> Dipper. You could have been hurt. Do you have any idea how worried I was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was taken aback when he caught his sister sniffling. Her eyes glistened before she turned her back on him. He reached out for her. \u201cMabel\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a shower,\u201d she huffed, slipping off her panties and discarding them to the side. Her immense hair shielded the back of her body as she marched off to the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh, Dipper turned back to the sink. He\u2019d have preferred to shower with his sister like usual, but there were accommodations in the nozzles for a minizora to handle, so at least he could pour himself a steamy bath. The little boy dove in like it was a pool and swam around idly. Every now and then he\u2019d turn to the silhouette of his sister in the shower, but she said nothing. She wasn\u2019t even singing the latest awful boyband hit, but the only thing more awful than that was the ongoing silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Mabel,\u201d Dipper called, but got no answer. He heaved a sigh. \u201cLook Mabel, I\u2019m sorry I made you worry, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being very fair right now. We were <i>both</i> in danger you know. How do you think I felt with everyone running for their lives and me being able to do nothing to help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Mabel tossed the shower curtain aside and turned the water off. \u201cThat\u2019s not your job, Dipper. I\u2019m the <i>big</i> sister, so that means I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, right there!\u201d Dipper accused. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s not fair. We\u2019re twins, but you\u2019re always putting it on yourself to protect me even though I\u2019m just as worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept it is. That whole gnome debacle could have been avoided if you\u2019d just listened to me from the start. I tried letting you do things on your own, and look where that got us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel scoffed in disbelief. \u201cSo what? You want to be the big sibling and look after me from now on? Ha! I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s unfair of you to think you\u2019re the only one that gets worried. You\u2019re my sister and I want to see you safe, but I still let you go out and make your own mistakes. I don\u2019t smother you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blinked. Dripping naked, she stepped out of the shower and over to the sink. \u201cIs that how you feel about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sheepish, Dipper grabbed his arm and averted his gaze. \u201cSometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess it was kind of unfair of me to forget that you get just as worried as I do,\u201d Mabel conceded. \u201cAnd maaaybe I overreacted just a tad this time with the gobblewonker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot during the attack, though. Only after,\u201d Dipper corrected. \u201cWhen that thing was after us, you actually listened to me. You trusted me to make the right call and that\u2019s what pulled us through.\u201d He reached out and motioned for Mabel to come down to his level. She did, lowering her chin to the counter and extending a hand; whichever he\u2019d prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper went for Mabel\u2019s cheek and gave it an affectionate pat. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that you trust me a bit more. Trust me like I trust you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sniffled and stroked a finger down Dipper\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m still going to be worried about you, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I could stop you,\u201d chuckled Dipper. \u201cHey, you forgot to tell Soos the whole story with the lumberjack guy. You know, where you started attacking him like you had rabies or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled. \u201cHey, I was just trying to teach him a lesson about watching his step.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnimal control was called and the guy\u2019s shoes were ruined,\u201d Dipper deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sighed fondly. \u201cYeah. I think I hate the taste of shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone does, Mabel. But you\u2019re one of the few people who takes the time to make sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming contentedly, Mabel picked her little brother up and carried him to the shower. \u201cWant to join me?\u201d she asked while stepping back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Though Dipper just expected their typical mutual wash, his sister had something else in mind as she casually tossed him in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh yesh,\u201d Mabel said through her mouthful. Naked Dipper was so much better than clothed Dipper. She couldn\u2019t quite put a name on his flavor. She\u2019d licked skin before, her own and that of others, but in those cases it had been tasteless at best and gag inducing at normal. But with Dipper, there was just some intangible quality that made him absolutely delicious. She was content to just chalk it up to being another minizora thing and leave it at that, but for right now she had the more pressing priority of running her tongue over every square inch of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel licked over Dipper\u2019s face, feeling him smile. She licked under his armpits, which made him thrash about from being tickled. Over his butt got a similar result, but by far the most exquisite part of her brother\u2019s body was his groin. Somehow that tiny penis and pair of balls had the strongest flavor of any part of him. And when she devoted special attention there, she giggled at how he grew erect. She loved how she could do this to him. For all their talk of trust and respect, Mabel would never relinquish the power of being the <i>big</i> sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the moist maw, Dipper was moaning as he was pelted on all sides by soft flesh. When it was just his bare skin, the stickiness didn\u2019t bother him as much. In fact, he rather enjoyed being in his sister\u2019s mouth. He enjoyed being played with, of being tossed around and toyed with. Mabel knew all the right ways to touch him that just felt so incredible. And now that she was focusing on his penis, the little boy cried out in rapture as he bucked his hips into the slimy organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel continued her affectionate tongue bath until she\u2019d achieved her reward. A tiny but potent sprits of sweet and sour flavoring. It was the perfect dessert after a long day of monster hunting, a treasure that was hers alone to enjoy. She hummed, continuing to toss her brother around her mouth until finally that extra special flavor disappeared and she spat him back out. \u201cHave fun?\u201d she beamed, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting from his ordeal in Mabel\u2019s hands, Dipper looked up and gave a weak-armed thumbs up. This was their way of saying that all was forgiven. From there they got cleaned up properly, dressed for the night, and went to bed. All was as it should be, with not a care in the world devoted to the old man and his death ray, nor the mysterious triangular constellation that briefly appeared in the night\u2019s sky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the TV room, Dipper sat on his sister\u2019s shoulder while they ate popcorn and watched the latest episode of Ducktective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat duck is a genius,\u201d awed Mabel as she went through the motions of giving a single corn to her shoulder occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper shrugged, unimpressed. \u201cEh. It\u2019s easier to find clues when you\u2019re that close to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking from experience?\u201d teased Mabel as she poked him in the gut. \u201cLike you could actually outwit Ducktective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I have very keen powers of observation,\u201d Dipper boasted. \u201cFor example: Just from smelling your breath, I know that you\u2019ve been eating\u2026 an entire tube of toothpaste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was so sparkly,\u201d Mabel confessed, sounding just a bit sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dudes. You\u2019ll never guess what I just found!\u201d declared Soos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBur-\u201d Dipper was silenced by a finger over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuried treasure!\u201d exclaimed Mabel. \u201cHa. I win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the \u2018buried treasure\u2019 was a secret door hidden behind the wallpaper. Within was a room filled with wax dummies of various historical figures. Grunkle Stan told the story of how he\u2019d \u2018purchased\u2019 the figures years ago, but then locked them in here after the wax museum stopped being profitable, and also he\u2019d just forgotten about them. When it was discovered that wax Abraham Lincoln had melted, Mabel had jumped at the chance to remake it into something new. When being offered free labor to resurrect an old and potentially profitable attraction, Stan was all too happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Dipper was enjoying a rare instance of independence without being carried around by Mabel. It felt good to stretch his legs and do little things like get his own soda. Walking down the hall, he was enjoying a few sips when Mabel sprung out of nowhere, causing him to drop his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, I have to show you my ideas.\u201d She held up a sketchbook. \u201cShe\u2019s part fairy princess, and part horse fairy princess,\u201d she described of the abominable centaur monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmaybe you should carve something from real life,\u201d Dipper suggested, not wanting to crush his sister\u2019s artistic dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of trial and error, but eventually Mabel settled on sculpting a very special member of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, dude. Your sister\u2019s, like, really good at this,\u201d Soos commented from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Once she gets in one of these artsy moods, basically nothing can stop her.\u201d Then Dipper got an idea. \u201cHey, Soos. I\u2019ll pay you five bucks to go in there and tell her to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoos glowered down at the little dude. \u201cDude, I\u2019m no Albert Einstein, but I\u2019m not stupid. I heard the full story of what happened to Manly Dan and there ain\u2019t no way I\u2019m sticking my hand in a fish tank filled with piranha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper chuckled. \u201cYeah, fair point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater still, there was a big ceremony for the reopening of the wax museum. At the ticket booth, Dipper sat alongside Wendy. She was the fifteen year old ginger who worked the Shack\u2019s counter most days. Her body was leanly built with well-defined muscle, a modest chest for her age, and a rump that was nothing to scoff at. She had a fondness for flannel shirts and wore a fur hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was pretending not to notice the afore mentioned details as he sat in a tiny chair on the table. Technically his job was to guard the money jar, but he had the feeling that he was actually being used as just another oddity to attract customers. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how many people showed up for this. It looks like half the town is here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right,\u201d agreed Wendy in her usual laidback demeanor. She was also pretending not to notice Dipper. She\u2019d never seen a minizora before and there was something about this little cutie that kept drawing her eye. \u201cFolks around here must be super bored. Either that or Stan bribed them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper unfurled a green bill from his jacket. \u201cHe bribed me.\u201d Wendy pulled out her own bill and they shared a laugh. This was nice. Aside from his mother and sister, Dipper had never really hung out with a girl before, especially not one this pretty. It wasn\u2019t weird that he thought she was pretty, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the unveiling finally got underway, it was tragically met with a lukewarm response from the audience. Fortunately, Mabel was not so easily deterred. \u201cThank you all for coming. I made this sculpture with my own two hands. It\u2019s covered in my blood, sweat, tears, and other fluids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the audience gagged at the implications, Wendy stole a wary glance at Dipper. Reluctantly, the minizora nodded that this was the case, to which Wendy commented, \u201cHehe, gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will now take questions!\u201d Mabel announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld man McGucket. Local kook,\u201d he introduced himself. \u201cAre the wax figures alive and \u2013 follow-up question \u2013 can I survive the wax man uprising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 yes! Next question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more questions followed before Shandra Jimenez spoke up. In this one horse town, she was considered the only \u2018real\u2019 reporter. She was Hispanic with dark skin, high cheek bones, and one of the finest bodies in all of Gravity Falls. \u201cYour flyer promised free pizza with admission to this event. Is this true?\u201d Despite her dispassionate tone, this questions seemed to wake the audience up as everyone was up in arms. Literally. Some people had actually brought pickaxes and pitchforks to a wax museum opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis probably isn\u2019t good,\u201d Wendy observed, bracing herself to run. She then remembered her table companion and suddenly felt awkward. Was it okay to pick up a minizora without asking, even in an emergency? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Stan dismissed what had apparently been the primary interest of the audience and attempted to flee with the money. This in turn led to a small riot in which chairs were thrown and poles were punched. Wendy, ever a girl of action, snatched Dipper off the table, stowed him in her breast pocket, and ferried him out of the danger zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper wasn\u2019t too worried about his predicament. He\u2019d been picked up by strangers before, but Wendy wasn\u2019t exactly a stranger. She\u2019d never been overtly hostile and generally treated him with better courtesy than she did most patrons of the Shack. The inside of her breast pocket was hot and the fabric was a little itchy. It also smelled. Dipper knew that there was only one thing he could be smelling at this time and wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! No punching the banner poles!\u201d Mabel snapped, pointing at Manly Dan the lumberjack. As soon as the pair\u2019s eye\u2019s met, the man who resembled a shaved red yeti decided to be anywhere but near that sack of adorable crazy. Once the audience dispersed, Mabel casually walked over to Wendy and with her eternal cheerfulness, held out her hand in a gi-me gesture. Wendy obliged and surrendered the tiny twin. \u201cI think that went well,\u201d Mabel commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yeah,\u201d agreed Wendy. \u201cCompared to how these things usually go, there\u2019s almost no damage. Oh, and sorry little dude,\u201d she said to Dipper. \u201cFor picking you up without asking, I mean. It was kind of a spur of the moment thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey,\u201d Dipper laughed nervously. \u201cIt was no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot big, but adequate sized,\u201d Mabel commented to the confusion of the others. \u201cYou acted quick and decisive, prioritizing safety over personal autonomy. And for that, you have my respect.\u201d She extended her other hand, which Wendy happily shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s\u2026 unsettlingly authoritarian, but whatever.\u201d The red head shrugged. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want the little guy hurt is all. Oh well.\u201d She set her hands on her hips and surveyed the mess. \u201cLooks like a lot of work to do. Think I\u2019ll clock out early.\u201d And she beat a lazy retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel grinned as she watched the taller girl go. \u201cI like her.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, Dipper and Mabel were upstairs brushing their teeth. Mabel had just suggested a tooth brush race when they heard the cries of horror from downstairs. Being a couple of twelve year olds who\u2019d already faced down two horrifying monsters in less than a week, they decided to run towards the sound of danger. That\u2019s where they found the source of the commotion. Wax Stan had been murdered via decapitation and his head was nowhere to be found. It was so gruesome that Mabel fainted; (accidentally) crushing Dipper under her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police arrived in short order, given that this was probably the biggest criminal activity they\u2019d seen in weeks. Even so, the sheriff seemed reluctant to even do minimal investigation, so Dipper volunteered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Dipper,\u201d squeed Mabel, hugging him to her cheek. \u201cI knew I could count on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well would you look at what we got in here,\u201d taunted Sheriff Blubs. \u201cCity boy gonna solve the mystery with his fancy computer phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCity boooy!\u201d called the deputy. \u201cCity boooy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are adorable,\u201d Blubs added, leading the both of them to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdorable?\u201d Dipper asked. He\u2019d been called a lot of names over his life and had learned to shrug off most of them, but for some reason this one really dug under his skin. When the cops left, Dipper was filled with righteous indignation. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Mabel, you and me are going to find out who did this and get back that head. Then they\u2019ll see who\u2019s adorable,\u201d he snarled, trying to look as tough as possible. Then he sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. You sneeze like a kitten,\u201d Mabel cooed, finding his wrathful glare all the more endearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the investigation was underway. The twins were taking photos for evidence, compiling a list of suspects, and consulting the journal for anything supernatural that might be related. Yet it was Mabel who found the first clue in the form of shoeprints in the shag carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang. How did I miss that?\u201d Dipper grumbled. \u201cSo much for being closer to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome things you can only see from high up,\u201d Mabel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. The point is that these shoeprints have a hole in the left shoe. That\u2019s pretty unusual. And they lead to\u2026\u201d An axe was found just behind the chair. Dipper just glowered at the axe for a solid few seconds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here literally five minutes and already found the murder weapon, but a couple of \u2018professional\u2019 cops didn\u2019t do jack,\u201d Dipper ranted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, maybe they were tired,\u201d Mabel excused. \u201cOr, you know, I hear towns like these include playing FPS games as part of their police exams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned. \u201cNow it feels like I\u2019m racing against someone without arms or legs.\u201d He then slapped himself for daring to pity the enemy. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve still got a mystery to solve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter conversing with Soos, the axe was connected to Manly Dan, who frequented an intense biker joint downtown. Soos also tried coining the term \u2018mystery twins\u2019, but Dipper was in no mood for cute names. Grunkle Stan, upon seeing the kids with an axe and plans on confronting the possible murderer, cheered them on to \u201cAvenge meee!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was suffering an increasingly low opinion of the town\u2019s collective IQ after Mabel\u2019s fake IDs actually got them into the bar. Inside there were all manner of ruffians punching one another for no discernable reason. Still the picture of perkiness, Mabel deposited Dipper in her sweater collar and attempted to hold him close. However, much to her consternation, he wiggled free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mabel. We talked about this already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow? You want to go off and do your own thing <i>here</i> of all places?\u201d When Dipper just crossed his arms and impatiently tapped his foot, Mabel gave a conceding groan. \u201cOkay, fine. But if you get stepped or sat on, that\u2019s on you.\u201d And they split up. Dipper went straight for Manly Dan while Mabel decided to destress by chatting up a very tattooed and burly man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cManly Dan, just the guy I wanted to see,\u201d Dipper greeted, trying to look tough as he stood on the arm wrestling machine Dan was playing. \u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPunching the clock,\u201d growled the lumberjack, sounding like he was perpetually on the verge of going into a blood rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were at work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was punching that clock.\u201d He pointed out the window to a clock atop a crooked post. \u201cIt offended me with its incessant ticking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen o\u2019 clock, the time of the murder,\u201d Dipper mumbled. He then regretted not bringing Mabel along as he dragged the axe over for inspection. \u201cSo I guess you\u2019ve never seen this before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here, little girl,\u201d Dan barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, actually-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t pick my teeth with that axe. It\u2019s left handed. I only use my right hand.\u201d He demonstrated this by ripping the arm off of the machine. \u201cThe MANLY hand!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Manly Dan proceeded to beat the snot out of what remained of the machine, Dipper backed away, feeling that he\u2019d been sufficiently emasculated for one day. He caught up with Mabel doing some weird school yard fortune telling thing and gave her the update. They just had to run through the list of suspects and see who was left handed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that proved easier said than done. One montage later and it turned out that there wasn\u2019t a single leftie in the whole town. Even when the twins thought they\u2019d cornered someone, they learned far more than they ever wanted about Toby Determined. They did get an extra clue that the axe had no prints at all, but that just deepened the mystery. Worse, the cops laughed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, the twins returned to the Mystery Shack to attend the funeral of Wax Stan. It was a tasteful ceremony held in the wax figures\u2019 old room with all of their lifeless forms in attendance. To Soos and Stan it looked like the twins were down about the murder, but they were mourning another loss as the adults left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose cops were right about me,\u201d Dipper grumbled in Mabel\u2019s lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Dipper,\u201d Mabel encouraged, petting Dipper with one hand and holding the axe in another. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far. We can\u2019t give up now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed, hopped down to the floor, and headed for the casket. \u201cBut I considered everything. The weapon, the motive, the clues\u2026\u201d He climbed up to get one last look at the dearly departed, where he noticed something odd. \u201cHmm. Wax Stan\u2019s shoe has a hole in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the wax guys have that,\u201d Mabel explained plainly. \u201cIt\u2019s where the pole thingy attaches to their stand dealies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat has holes in its shoes and no finger prints?\u201d It didn\u2019t take much before Dipper\u2019s eyes went wide and his pulse quickened. \u201cUh, Mabel!\u201d he whispered in alarm. \u201cI think the murderers are-\u201d</span></div></div>",

Naturally, Mabel responded by immediately pulling her brother close for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations my two amateur sleuths. You uncovered the truth,\u201d patronized the detective. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re going to bury you.\u201d He pointed his magnifying glass like a weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 how is this possible?

Like if you were the real guys who were turned into wax. That\u2019d be a curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d agreed Mabel. \u201cBeing able to come to life sounds like a blessing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock, unable to think up a counterargument, decided to tell their backstory. After they were stolen from their previous owner, they were set up here for the wax museum. By day they were overpriced attractions, but at night they were free to do as they pleased. It was a pleasant life, all things considered, right up until the money stopped coming in and they were locked in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just say one more thing?\u201d asked Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine. Go ahead,\u201d allowed an annoyed Wax Sherlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora pointed at Wax Lizzie. \u201cYou have an axe. If you didn\u2019t like being locked up, you could have just broken out at any night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd go where, hmm? You want us to be caught out in the sunlight just like Wax Lincoln?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m also not seeing how the wax museum stopped making money,\u201d Mabel added. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t take much to maintain you guys. Stan would have just had to do a minimal cleaning, like, once a week, which isn\u2019t that expensive. You\u2019ve been locked up for years and you all look in pretty good shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Wax Shakespeare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 I really don\u2019t see why you guys would be locked up in the first place. At the very least you\u2019d be making enough money to cover the cost of cleaning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s because your uncle is a big fat jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranted,\u201d allowed Dipper. \u201cHold on. You guys ever see Night at the Museum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI loved that movie,\u201d gushed Mabel. \u201cRobin Williams makes everything good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this movie about museum exhibits that also come to life at night,\u201d Dipper explained to the intrigue of the figures. \u201cThe museum was about to be shut down, so they solved the problem by the end by opening the museum to night guests. That way it\u2019s like there\u2019s a big animatronic t-rex skeleton in the front lobby and a Wax Teddy Roosevelt who can talk with people about the real Roosevelt\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPipe in one hand and Wax Stan\u2019s head in the other, Sherlock\u2019s brow made a climb up his forehead. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you guys could do the same. Show Grunkle Stan that you\u2019re really alive. We can basically employ you guys and extend the Shack\u2019s open hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, yeah!\u201d cheered Mabel. \u201cYou can be the evening crew. Give tours, talk about yourselves, and jack up prices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you guys would be able to walk free at night, and the Mystery Shack would make more money. Everyone wins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hold that thought.\u201d Sherlock motioned for the other wax figures to all gather at the far end of the room while they discussed this alternative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll buy it?\u201d Mabel whispered through a forced grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo clue, but try scooching closer to the fire,\u201d urged Dipper. \u201cTheir wax, so we can just melt them if things get bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea.\u201d And she discretely shuffled her way over to the fireplace to await the figures\u2019 verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They refuse and things go mostly like in the episode.<br>\r\n2. They agree and become integrated into the Shack</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wax conference concluded as the figures approached the twins. \u201cSorry kids, but no dice. We\u2019ve been waiting ten years to get our revenge,\u201d he flipped the Wax Stan head around in his hand, \u201cand next time we won\u2019t miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were trying to murder Grunkle Stan for real?\u201d asked Dipper in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, you little pipsqueaks! Now that you know our secret. You must die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou first!\u201d Mabel then wielded a fire poker like a javelin, hurling it at Wax John Wilks Booth\u2019s head and spearing it to the wall. \u201cHaha, got\u2019ch\u2019ya!\u201d Her cheer was short lived when the body kept moving and the remaining wax figures just looked peeved. \u201cOops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe candles!\u201d Dipper pointed over to where Grunkle Stan had set up a refreshment table, including a pair of electric candles. Mabel wielded hers like a sword easily enough. Dipper, through much effort, wielded his like a human trying to manage an artillery cannon without wheels. \u201cGet back or we\u2019ll melt you into candles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDecorative candles,\u201d Mabel added threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wax figures were intimidated at first, but then they remembered that they had the advantage in both size and numbers. \u201cYou really think you can defeat us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Worth a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo be it. Attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first casualty of the battle was Dipper\u2019s footing as the weight of the candle threw him off balance and he fell to the floor. When Mabel turned to retrieve him, she accidentally severed Shakespeare\u2019s arms. Dipper recovered to find the wax figures closing in on Mabel from all sides, clearly judging her to be the bigger threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever underestimate the little guy,\u201d Dipper muttered before rolling his candle with all due haste, melting a good many feet all the way up to the ankle. In one case, Wax Robin Hood tripped and knocked Wax Larry King over, who then fell neck first onto the candle and was subsequently decapitated. \u201cHa! Interview that, Larry King! You alright Mabel?\u201d He turned to his sister, and were they not in mortal danger, he would have burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel was using the severed Coolio\u2019s head like a mace, swinging it by the hair to bludgeon the other figures, knocking them back while she retrieved her candle. With her primary weapon retrieved, the little girl made a lunge for Wax Lizzie, but came up short and only tore her dress open. The adrenaline evaporated almost instantly as everyone paused to gawk. \u201cUh\u2026 wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Lizzie\u2019s hands shot down to cover her exposed groin. \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026 damn. I knew shaving down there was kind of a more recent thing but\u2026 wow. You\u2019d need a freaking lawnmower to trim that bush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-shut up!\u201d cried the wax woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned that someone took the time to sculpt her that way,\u201d commented Dipper. \u201cAll these other guys have their clothes as part of their bodies, but her\u2026\u201d He gestured. \u201cSomeone sculpted her to not only go commando, but also have a bush big enough to hide a whole person. Someone fetishized an axe murderer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other wax figures began snickering at Lizzie\u2019s plight, her cheeks began to burn from embarrassment. They burned so hot that she ended up melting herself. Once everyone got the giggles out of their system, the fight resumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock finally did something smart by tossing the Stan head aside and grabbing a real sword off the wall. Dipper\u2019s candle was smashed in short order. In response, Mabel found a broken sliver of metal near the fire place and threw it to Dipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hot on both ends, but not enough to harm minizora skin. \u201cUh, thanks, but how do I fight a sword with a toothpick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigure it out,\u201d Mabel urged, once more being swarmed by the remaining figures. \u201cDie Nixon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Wax Sherlock in pursuit, Dipper could only avoid and evade his strikes. Thankfully he had a lifetime of experience to help him through, but he was ever on the retreat. He knew there was only one chance. The minizora dove out the window and began ascending the Mystery Shack\u2019s roof, once more demonstrating the climbing skills of a mountain goat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can outwit me, boy? I\u2019m Sherlock-bleeding-Holmes! Have you seen my magnifying glass? It\u2019s enormous,\u201d ranted the wax man as he haphazardly swung his sword around and dislodged the big S from the sign. Eventually he cornered Dipper, pinning him to the shingled roof with his shoe. Wax Sherlock tried increasing the pressure to crush the boy like a bug, but the minizora only laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat the best you got?\u201d he wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrr. So be it.\u201d Wax Sherlock raised his sword high. \u201cAny last words?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, actually. Got any sunblock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any-?\u201d Wax Sherlock was cut off by the drip-drop of wax dripping onto his nose. His hands were liquefying and he lost his grip on the sword. He then turned and beheld the golden glow of the sun peeking over the forested horizon. \u201c\u2026 no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLetting me lead you to the roof? Yeah, probably not your sharpest decision,\u201d Dipper taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutsmarted by a child in short pants, and a minizora at that. Nooo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny second thoughts Dipper might have had for killing a person were rendered null at that moment. \u201cSucks to be you, buddy. All my life guys like you have been looking down on me. But in just another minute, <i>I\u2019ll</i> be looking down on <i>you</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, with each passing second, Wax Sherlock lost more and more height, along with facial features. And then, just as the wax man was finally shorter than the minizora and Dipper was about to deliver the last word, he sneezed. \u201cHa-ha-ha. you sneeze like a kitten,\u201d ranted the wax puddle in a mad delirium. \u201cThose policemen were right. You\u2019re adorable. Adorablllllle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Splat*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thunder stolen, Dipper heaved a sigh and returned to the wax room. Mabel was just finishing up with chucking severed wax limbs into the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, you\u2019re okay!\u201d Mabel rushed over and scooped him up, holding him tight to her cheek. \u201cYou solved the mystery after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I told you I can handle myself,\u201d he strained to say. Mabel\u2019s grip was more constraining than Wax Sherlock\u2019s shoe, so he tapped her cheek to signal her to loosen up. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t have done it without my sidekick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled and picked up the Wax Stan head from the floor. \u201cNo offense Dipper, but you\u2019re the sidekick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Says who? Are-are people saying that? Who\u2019s saying that?\u201d Dipper asked self-consciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t be down. You\u2019re still the best sidekick a hero like me could ever want.\u201d And she gave him a big wet kiss that encompassed most of his head. \u201cEw. You taste like wax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grunkle Stan came in to the warzone of a room, he was immediately placated with the presentation of his missing head. His reward was some affectionate noogying. That was nice, but far more gratifying was when the police pulled up and the twins had evidence of having solved the case. It didn\u2019t matter that no one believed them about the wax people. What mattered was the hilarious sight of two cops spitting scalding hot coffee in one another\u2019s faces.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early morning in the Mystery Shack when Soos was on break and decided to join Dipper and Mabel in the TV room. Mabel held her brother in her lap as her fingers idly fiddled with his tiny form. So long as his vision was unobstructed, he made no complaint, not even when she poked his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s that commercial I was telling you guys about,\u201d Soos informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid commercial was for some self-proclaimed psychic over at the Tent of Telepathy. That there was an unflattering video of Grunkle Stan towards the end only confirmed that these people were his direct competition for, as their dear old Grunkle would so eloquently say: \u201cFleecing roobs.\u201d And when Stan forbid them from going to the show that evening, their childish rebellion left them with no choice but to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing better to do while they waited for the evening, the twins went up to their room to relax. After the door was locked and blinds closed, Mabel removed her sweater to give her chest some open air. \u201cAhh, much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? As far as summer days go, this one\u2019s pretty mild.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m just,\u201d Mabel tittered, \u201cone hot mamma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019ve heard worse,\u201d Dipper allowed as he opened up the journal. He didn\u2019t even make it to the second line before being picked up by his shirt. \u201cHey, what gives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust giving you an extra special study spot, bro-bro,\u201d Mabel graciously said as she laid on her back and rested her brother down atop her chest. \u201cHehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, uh, sure, I guess,\u201d Dipper accepted of his sister\u2019s silliness. Mabel\u2019s breasts weren\u2019t anything to write home about, but they weren\u2019t <i>completely</i> flat. There was enough there for Dipper to rest his head on like a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Comfy?\u201d she asked, using her elbows to try and press her breasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough,\u201d answered Dipper distractedly, trying to ignore the way Mabel pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph. I bet you\u2019d notice if Shandra Jimenez put you on her chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, she\u2019s like in her late thirties. Plus I\u2019d bet those things are plastic. There\u2019s no need to get-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you say it!\u201d Mabel accused, her finger pointed like a deadly weapon at the boy resting against her tiny boob. \u201cI am not jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if anyone around here is going to be insecure about their size, it\u2019s going to be me. Got that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel huffed and turned away. \u201cAt least you could show me a little affection now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow and then? Mabel, I was literally in your mouth this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was <i>me</i> showing <i>you</i> affection. I\u2019m always the one doing the petting, the hugging, the licking, and all that stuff. Maybe you could throw a little sugar my way once in a while.\u201d Her tone was pleading and her eyes were doing that shimmery thing that she knew Dipper couldn\u2019t resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine,\u201d Dipper surrendered, closing the book as he was clearly not going to get any reading done until Mabel was satisfied. \u201cFirst, put this up so it won\u2019t get damaged.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel happily obliged and set the book on her dresser. As she did, her frown started to turn upside down as Dipper undressed. She clapped her hands and kicked her legs in anticipation of the fun that was coming. \u201cEe-he-he! Naked Dipper is best Dipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Sure,\u201d Dipper agreed dispassionately as he threw his underwear off to the side. Standing there in the buff atop his bare-chested sister, the minizora was still as soft as a noodle. Just being naked and looking at his half naked sister did nothing for him. It\u2019d take some serious stimulation to give Mabel what she wanted, but that got Dipper to thinking. \u201cSo if you want me to show some affection for a change, then you\u2019re gonna have to commit to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you gotta sit on your hands. Literally. If we\u2019re doing this, then I\u2019m in charge. You can\u2019t do anything. For once, you\u2019re the one who just has to sit back and let your twin have their way with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow. So forceful,\u201d giggled Mabel as she slid her hands under her bottom. \u201cI like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gave a curt nod. \u201cGood. Now, let\u2019s see here.\u201d After a second of surveying the smooth landscape beneath his feet, deciding a course of action, the minizora returned to his sister\u2019s chest lumps and climbed up onto the nipple. Mabel moaned quietly, but that was just a taste of what he had planned. Dipper dropped down onto his belly, pressing his limp dick against the little girl\u2019s nipple. \u201cOhhhh,\u201d he shuddered, having not expected it to feel that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel it,\u201d Mabel moaned. \u201cI feel your itty bitty weewee against my nippy. Tee-hee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby talk only makes this weirder,\u201d Dipper informed as he began experimentally grinding himself against the nub. He rotated his hips around in circles, trying to cover as much surface area as possible with his crotch. The texture of her nipple skin was different than her hands in a way that Dipper couldn\u2019t put into words. It felt amazing, though. Mabel moaned all the louder as she fought to keep her body still. A grin grew across Dipper\u2019s face as he came to terms with the control he now exerted over his sister. \u201cWow. So this is what it\u2019s like to be in charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty great, huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d he agreed while pressing his erection into her hardened nub. The friction of foreign skin against his sensitive prick combined with the knowledge of who he was humping; all added up for some pretty amazing stimulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dipper,\u201d moaned Mabel. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in my mouth, and I make you cum with my tongue, you taste sooo gooood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 figured,\u201d Dipper panted, now getting into the swing of things. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your tongue, though. I think every part of you is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?\u201d Mabel had never done much with her flat chest before, having always dismissed it as too underdeveloped to play with. However, as Dipper was demonstrating, she was a lot more sensitive around there than she\u2019d initially believed. \u201cC-can I play with the other one?\u201d she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora shook his head. \u201cUh-uh. This isn\u2019t about you feeling good. This is about me showing my sister some affection, remember. I\u2019m showing you what a minizora can do, and you\u2019re gonna sit back and take it,\u201d he growled, trying to channel some of Manly Dan\u2019s authority. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-harder!\u201d Mabel begged. With Dipper\u2019s stupid rule in place, she was powerless to do much. However, with him preoccupied with her chest, she was able to arch her back just enough to slip both hands beneath her skirt. The angle wasn\u2019t ideal for doing much and still maintain discretion, but it would have to do. Unable to think clearly, Mabel attacked both her ass and pussy, make believing that her fingers were Dipper. Lots of little Dippers, all rubbing and humping to their little hearts\u2019 content, and all at her command. They were doing this for her. The little Dippers were rubbing their little bodies against her most sensitive parts because she wanted them to, because they loved her and wanted to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHegakurgurk!\u201d Dipper gasped, his ejaculation jumping out at him like a snake. His body spasamed and he lost his grip, collapsing onto the erect nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Mabel was able to feel that tiny splash of liquid onto her nub. That combined with the stimulation from her hands to push her over the edge. Reflexively, she broke the rule by bringing the hand from her ass up and clamping it over her mouth to keep herself silent. It was a habit born out of having done this so many times at their parents\u2019 home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings, naked and half naked, laying atop the other and the bed respectively, panted. Their chests rose and fell with labored breaths, their bodies were all sweaty, and their groins were especially sticky. Dipper, to the surprise of no one, called upon his minizora endurance to recover first and stand. Hands on his hips and cock contentedly soft, he proudly surveyed his good work before smirking up at Mabel\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cheated,\u201d he playfully pointed out, indicating her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel, still recovering, scowled down at the minizora. Through her fingers she said, \u201cScrew off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper scratched his chin, pretending to think. \u201cHmm. Sure.\u201d And he began walking off. \u201cI need a shower anyway.\u201d But before he could jump from the little girl\u2019s body, a hand snatched him up and brought him to the little girl\u2019s big glowering face. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to be a sore loser about this,\u201d he said with a punchable smirk. \u201cFair\u2019s fair. You agreed to the rules, so that means-agh!\u201d His lecture was cut short after being tossed in his sister\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNom!\u201d Mabel pushed him into her cheek like a chipmunk storing food, not really up to a proper taste session. She just casually licked and sucked as strength returned to her body. When feeling returned to her legs, she headed for the bathroom and poured herself a glass of water. With Dipper secured by her tongue, she drank around him in an effort to punish him. Now internally refreshed, she looked herself in the mirror and did her best to speak around her mouthful. \u201cYou\u2019re the best brother ever, and I hate you for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible for Dipper not to grin.</span></div></div>",

Lincoln Loud here,\u201d he said, beginning the morning by breaking the fourth wall. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why my room looks so different. Well, that\u2019s because it is. It\u2019s actually my sister Lori\u2019s old doll house. See, I was born a minizora. That means that at a mere three inches tall, I don\u2019t have much chance of getting any bigger, but that\u2019s life. And really, my life is pretty great, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got loving parents, ten awesome sisters, and pets that actually don\u2019t want to chew on me. Then there are my clothes, a private TV, game station, comics, and pretty much all the essentials of life at a miniature size. I even have a private bathroom, though it\u2019s more like a tiny porta-potty that needs to be emptied once a week. Really, I\u2019m pretty lucky. Granted, being so small, I\u2019m pretty dependent on my sisters for a lot of stuff. I\u2019m basically not allowed to go anywhere outside the house unless one of them is carrying me. Worse, because I\u2019m so small and cute, most of the time they insist on carrying me inside their clothes. That can get pretty nasty when one of them has a gas attack. Bleh. But usually it\u2019s fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom and sisters have really soft, warm bodies, so except for a bad gas attack, I don\u2019t mind being carried around in someone\u2019s bra or even panties. And being a minizora, I\u2019m durable enough that I can take pretty much whatever life throws at me, even my family using me as a communal sex toy. Again, not usually a problem. My family does so much for me and it\u2019s nice that I can give something back. It\u2019s like my household chore. Certainly beats taking out the trash, I can tell you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock at the dollhouse door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it looks like my day is about to get started.\u201d Lincoln casually headed over to the red plastic door, ready to greet the world with a smile on his face, but who was there to greet him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood morning, baby bro,\u201d greeted the eldest Loud sister as she opened the wall of the doll house. Lori was blonde, like their mother, and took after her in a lot of other ways. Blessed by Rita\u2019s genes, she had the same curves, full chest, and hips that just wouldn\u2019t stop as the woman who birthed her. Her smile was kind, but also a little condescending as she looked into her younger brother\u2019s little apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lori,\u201d Lincoln replied casually, waving as he sat on the edge of his bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts breakfast time, dork. And it\u2019s my turn for Lincoln duty today, so you know what that means,\u201d she said with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln scratched his chin, rubbed the back of his neck, and went through several other thoughtful poses as he paced, pretending to wonder. \u201cLet me see here. Hmm. Does it mean\u2026 I\u2019m going in your underwear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori tittered, reached into the doll house, and scooped up her littlest sibling. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer before depositing him into her cleavage. It was the most convenient position for all involved, keeping the carrier\u2019s hands free while affording Lincoln a decent view. Not to mention he felt really good wiggling against a pair of sensitive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s bosoms were soft and just a little bit squishy, making them ideal for reclining. Lincoln did just that, or at least as best he could while his lower half was wedged within boob flesh. He gave a contented sigh and spread his hands out, feeling the way his sister\u2019s skin bristled with goose bumps. It was a nice feeling. \u201cOh, you know. Just a feeling,\u201d he replied blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey!\u201d whined Leni. Second oldest, her figure was almost as curvy as Lori\u2019s, though she had more of a ditzy charm that tended to draw in more boys. \u201cHow come you get Lincoln today? I thought it was supposed to be my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, before we made that bet, remember?\u201d Lori reminded smugly. \u201cYou lost, which means that your day now belongs to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was broken from his relaxation by the sight of his sad sister. Leni in particular was such an innocent soul that it actually hurt to see her upset. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what do you care? My boobs are bigger than hers, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had to struggle to twist around and face the tyrannical sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not about boobs. It\u2019s about being a good brother. Today was Leni\u2019s turn and you shouldn\u2019t have made that bet in the first place. Besides, just because it\u2019s your turn, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got me exclusively. Clyde\u2019s coming over today, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but I don\u2019t see the problem,\u201d Lori dismissed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be just fine doing whatever it is you guys do while staring at my chest all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grimaced. \u201cOkay, probably; but my point still stands. Besides, it\u2019s not like you asked me about this dumb bet. I might be a minizora, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat me as an object to be passed around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori scoffed down at the boy in her cleavage. \u201cLincoln, that\u2019s literally what being a minizora is all about. You can\u2019t look after yourself, so it\u2019s up to your family to keep you safe. And, as a part of this family, that means you\u2019ve got to pull your weight around here, bucko.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, I know, which is what I\u2019m arguing for. Today is supposed to be Leni\u2019s turn. She\u2019s been waiting over a week for this; and honestly, so have I. How can you just take away our day together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were going to go shopping,\u201d Leni sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Leni. You\u2019re too nice for your own good sometimes. Time with Lincoln is like time in the bathroom. You want it; you\u2019ve got to seize it when the other\u2019s aren\u2019t looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln heaved a heavy sigh. Lori wasn\u2019t wrong. He loved his sisters and liked spending time with them. The turns system was supposed to keep things fair. But alas, too often his sisters would get impatient. One minute he might be critiquing Lucy on her latest poem, and then she\u2019d turn her back and he\u2019d find himself in the audience of Luan\u2019s latest joke routine. And then there were all the things that happened outside the turns. Even if it was Lola\u2019s turn, Lyn would still get to borrow him by shoving him in her jockstrap and going through an elaborate exercise routine as part of her superstitious sports rituals. Then there were the deals. Sometimes it was a bet, but others it was like when Luna offered to do Lana\u2019s chores for a week if she got to bring Lincoln along for her date with Sam. That\u2026 had been a nice night. Admittedly, the system was pretty broken, but it was still preferable to total anarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Lincoln, it was actually Leni who delivered the winning argument. Not with eloquent words, as those had never been the blonde airhead\u2019s strong suit, but with action. Specifically, she started whimpering like a kicked puppy. Lincoln had to shield his eyes, for no one with a soul could withstand Leni\u2019s unparalleled pitifulness. Lori, however, wasn\u2019t so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d groused the eldest. \u201cI still won, so I\u2019m keeping Lincoln until lunch. You can have him after that. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni perked up immediately and rushed over, wrapping Lori in a constrictive embrace. \u201cThank-you-thank-you-thank-you! You\u2019re the best!\u201d As she gushed, she also unknowingly smothered her chest against Lincoln, compressing him between a boob and a soft place. Fortunately, he was used to this kind of treatment. The only surprising thing was that when Lori finally pushed Leni away, Lincoln was still wedged in Lori\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I know I\u2019m great,\u201d Lori replied, nonchalantly checking her nails as her free hand adjusted her bra. Though it was really an excuse to coax Lincoln into wiggling more. As every Loud sister knew, his little body was a boundless source of stimulation. \u201cOkay, Stinken,\u201d she said down to her boobs. \u201cReady to get this Saturday started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Start with the Louds at breakfast<br>\r\n2 Skip to something special Lori had planned</span></div></div>",

The boy\u2019s only solace were his fairies, Cosmo and Wanda, who could grant him just about any wish he could think of. There were rules, of course. No killing, no messing with true love, no cheating in official competitions, yada-yada. However, in ruminating over Da Rulez, Timmy had a small epiphany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Wanda. I\u2019ve got a question,\u201d he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goldfish with pink eyes swam out from the little castle in the fish bowl. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, sport?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just thinking about Da Rulez. Specifically the part that says I can\u2019t wish anyone in or out of love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, sport. Even fairies can\u2019t go messing with stuff that powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, and I get that, but what about lust?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Say what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLust. Like, I can\u2019t wish someone would fall in love with me, but can I wish that they fell in lust with me? You know,\u201d his eyes shifted guiltily, \u201cjust curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Wanda pulled out a copy of Da Rulez and began flipping through the pages. Her expression paled as she read the book backwards and forwards. In time she noticed Timmy giving her an expectant look and figured that there was no point delaying the inevitable. \u201cUh\u2026 no. There are no rules on anything related to sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy rubbed his hands together. \u201cSweet. In that case, for my first wish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWish for sex.<br>\r\nWish for something more kinky.</span></div></div>",

She enjoyed their company, since she had been completely alone until she found them wandering helplessly in her part of the jungle. When she found them they were without shelter during a powerful thunderstorm and looked like they haven't eaten in days, she has taken care of them ever since. They were lucky that it was her that found them and not a big cat or poisonous snake. They also happened to be in  the relatively safe part of the jungle that Megan called home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeighboring this oasis of safety was a hostile world. To the south the jungle grows denser and is populated with predators, until the jungle suddenly stops and massive metal and glass structures climb into the sky, she knew the area was populated because the spires would light up at night from electric lights, like the ones in her home, but because of a gut feeling of dread and the alien look of the buildings she stayed away. To the north was a different matter. After a weeks journey through a  inhospitable swamp the jungle was filled with an evil amazon tribe, that would kidnap any that dared enter their land, or so Megan had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had also seen was that the hunters of the amazon tribe were only 6 feet tall at best, suggesting that Megan was the tallest person in the land at 9 feet high. Megan also saw that the amazons wore animal skins around their chests and over their pelvic areas, as opposed to herself, Kate, and Mark lacking any such fabrics to cover themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn these last months she has learned much about her guests, they were both barely adults with Kate just a year older than Mark. Kate was like Megan in having dark hair and deep blue eyes, though being much smaller and standing only 5 and a half feet tall. Kate looked up to Megan wanting to be as strong and independent as the amazon and hardly left her side. Her brother, as Kate referred to him, was taller than Kate and had short black hair, though having only seen a few Amazons, the first thing Megan noticed was that Mark was unlike herself and Kate. She later concluded that there were probably other males like him in the city to the south, and that there wouldn't be any in the amazon ruled jungle, although she still couldn't figure out what males were for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared of into space at the table, reflecting on the time the three had spent together, fishing, hunting, teaching them how to survive, and just staring up at the night sky looking at the stars. She is suddenly brought back into reality by a loud bang in the distance. Megan ran out of the cabin and onto the deck and scanned the horizon to the south.  the sky was lit up with fire and columns of smoke towered into the sky. After a few moments another bang echoed through the jungle and another fire appeared, this one closer than the last. As the night went on the sound of explosions and fleeing animals filled the air, and the fires grew closer. Megan held Kate and Mark close as the two watched the inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate looked up to Megan and in a confused voice asked, \"What's going on? What's causing all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's the people to the south, clearing the area to expand were going to have to leave the area it won't be safe for much longer. The only question is where should we go.\" Megan said as she carefully considered her options.</span></div></div>",

Megan embraced Kate tightly and comforted her. \"Stay calm Kate, if you lose your nerve you won't make it far. We're going to follow the animals' lead and head north, then look for a new home after we cross the swamp. This is dangerous territory so I need you to stay strong for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stared into Megan's deep blue eyes and was filled with hope from the confidence in the amazon's expression. \" I'll be strong for you.\" Kate said, the fear in her voice now replaced admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women break their embrace just as Mark enters the room. Megan motions towards the door and they take the first steeps of their long journey. Outside they are greeted by a completely different world. Smoke clouds their vision, with what little they can see tinted in a red hue from the fires. The peaceful sound of birds now replaced by the screaming and growling of animals and an metallic inhuman screech growing louder. Megan lead the group away from the fire, walking at first then frantic sprinting as the screech grew closer and closer. Moving north was difficult with no cleared path the group was forced to push through dense jungle, resulting in minor bruises and cuts on their bare skin. After clearing a few miles of rough terrain and climbing a steep hill the group turn around and and look at their former home. Near the cleared land, that the cabin was built on,  the tip of a metal object could be seen above the tree line. The object slowly walked into the clearance, each step causing the earth to shake slightly. The object now stood exposed, A large spherical body held up by six large spider like legs, a portion of the sphere  opened  revealing a large blue crystal. The crystal glowed bright and in a flash a red beam of light appeared and scorched the earth everywhere it touched. The group watches in awe as their home is devoured by fire. They were so entranced that they failed to notice as a large figure slowly  creep towards them.</span></div></div>",

Megan had unknowingly lead the group straight into the panther's territory. Unlike the other animals this predator held its ground against the advancing threat, and considered the group's trespassing an act of aggression. It moved slowly and silently until it was within striking range. Letting out a low growl  the panther pounced.  Megan heard the growl and turned around, and she saw the beast leaping through the air towards Mark, with little time to act Megan was able to knock Mark out of the way. Mark was now safe, however Megan was now in the panther's path. Megan hit the ground with a loud thud, as her vision focused she saw  the beast's massive maw lowering towards her. Megan quickly jabs the wooden shaft of her spear on the panther's neck to keep its razor sharp teeth away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline pumped through Kate as she watched the powerful amazon struggle underneath the panther's weight. Kate let out a roar of primal fury and ran to Megan's aid, driving her spear into the panther's neck.  The panther recoiled in pain, giving Megan an opening to kick the colossal beast off her. The panther cried out in pain before returning to its feet and darting away.  Now standing in clear sight for the first time the group saw the behemoth in all it glory, standing as tall as Megan showing teeth that could easily be larger than a normal man's face. Megan picked herself up off the ground just as the panther circled around readying itself for another attack. The beast jumped through the air once more, but this time Megan was prepared, she dropped to one knee and thrust her spear forward  causing the beast to impale itself. The spear drove straight through the panther's chest striking the heart and killing it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan are you alright?\" Mark asked as he ran to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine thanks to Kate, she is turning into quite the amazon.\" Megan said while smiling at Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's face turns red and she averts her eyes away from Megan. \"... I... just didn't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dusting herself off, Megan once more leads the group north wanting to stay as far away from whatever the machines from the south. The next few days pass without incident, but as they reach the border of the swamplands they come across the remains of a camp site. The fire pit is cold and empty, only one tent stands, wrecked though it may be, yet marks on the ground indicate more tents once stood, the most disturbing image however is the drag marks and trail of dry blood that start from the wrecked tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" Mark asked as he raised his spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan held her spear tight and slowly followed the trail of blood. \" I'm not sure just be rea...... oh my god.\" Megan finished. At the end of the drag marks the half eaten carcass of a man laid on the ground still rotting, tightly clenching a book in its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate puts her hand over her mouth in disgust, but overcomes the gruesome sight and retrieves the book. \"It's a diary, detailing a trip into a cave down the road.\" Megan said while pointing then began reading from the last entries in the book. \" Day five and we're still lost, we thought this could be a safe route past the marsh of the dead, but its a damn labyrinth down here and I fear we are going in circles. Took make matters worse some of the guys are losing their grip on reality, claiming to see a monster stalking us its probably just the near black lighting  playing tricks on overactive imaginations. Day six, We should leave, we should turn back and exit the way we came in, but something is drawing me in, A voice in the back of my head calling to me from the center of this maze. I'm seeing it now too and hearing a growl, It's watching us waiting for a moment to strike. I shouldn't be taking my eyes away from the shadows even to write, but I find it is the only thing that can calm my nerves.  Day seven, oh god oh god, their dead all of them, I know it. It sprang from the shadows and started to rip us apart, and ... and I ran, I just left them. The only thing keeping me going is a light in the distance I must reach it. Day eight, I've made it out, I'm safe now. However it's as I feared I came out the way we entered, and whats worse I can still feel that thing's eye burning into my soul, watching me, waiting. \" At this point Kate looks up with a grim look and said \" This next part is written in his own blood....., It followed me out, and started to eat me alive, before leaving me to die a slow painful death. I write this now as a warning to all that may find this, if you go into it's lair it will never stop hunting you... Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The marsh of the dead, that's what the swamp is called! So are choices are this swamp of the dead or, from how that book describes it, the gates of hell, that's just wonderful.\" Mark says hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing the gruesome corpse Megan wanted nothing to do with the cave, but just like the dead man, a voice in her head beckoned her to enter.</span></div></div>",

As they get closer to the swamp, the jungle becomes less dense until it reaches the point where the only vegetation is patches of tall grass and everything became silent after they reached the border of the swamp. Fog clouded their vision, but from what they could see showed how inhospitable the landscape was. The water was murky and near black, and it was devoid of life, with the exception of plants Megan recognized as poisonous. Megan walks into the murky water and continues forward with ease, but for Mark and Kate the water reached their waists. Mark kept his spear ready to strike, and attempted to scan the water as he moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this the fog is limiting our visibility and the water is to dark to see into. Anything could be out here.\" Mark said quietly in case anything dangerous was near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've crossed this swamp before nothing lives here. The swamp's water is toxic if you drink it, so there are no crocodiles, panthers or anything else out here. Are biggest danger here is dehydration so speed is more important than defense here.\" Megan said before picking up her pace. Mark lowered his spear and speed up to keep up with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when did you come through here Megan, I mean you haven't left our side since you found us. How long ago was it?\" Kate asked as she speed up so that she could walk side by side with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure exactly when, but it was as far back as I could remember. I just woke up remembering barely anything, I only knew my name and that I wasn't always like this.\" Megan said motioning to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't always have that amazing amazon body.\" Kate said shortly before turning red, realizing how her statement could be interpreted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked down at her young companion and smiled innocently before continuing her story. \"No, but I'm not sure what changed me. Then shortly after gaining consciousness I was hunted through the jungle by other amazons. They finally stopped chasing me when I reached the swamp\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group presses forward as Megan details how she crossed the marsh, explored the jungle and, built her home. Three days have passed and the three continued to struggle forward despite their lack drinkable water. At this point even the disgusting, black, murky water seemed welcoming, the only thing holding the group back was the knowledge that drinking it would cause an agonizing death. The thirst had lead to conflict in the group, Mark having grown angry at the situation blamed Megan for taking them into the swamp. Kate stood up for Megan leading to the two to grow distant and causing the group to continue in tense silence. As the group approached a sandbar Mark saw something small dart through the water and over a near by hill. \"I just saw something over there.\" Mark said raising his spear,\" if we catch it it will help us a little.\" Megan and Kate nodded and followed Mark over the hill on the sandbar. As the three cleared the top of the hill they moved right into a pool of quicksand, and were quickly pulled in up to their chests. The three struggled but they soon realized they couldn't get free on their own. Then when the group seems to have lost all hope, a wooden object is lowered to their arms. One by one they grab on and are pulled out, Megan looks up at their savior and sees that the wooded stick was.</span></div></div>",

It has an athletic body, above average height, the greenest of green eyes, and a few mysterious abilities. Vershtae consists of farmland, a few lakes, a large forest, and a fairly generic medieval village. The preachers at the local church have foretold the coming of a savior who would lead them beyond the Great Wall. If the preachers believe Delbang to be this savior, they may do anything and everything in their power to control him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Safame, age 21. Land Brage. Safame is a naga woman 10ft from head to ground. She has large D cup breast, full lips, and blue eyes as deep as any sea. Her light green skin and dark green hair and scales grant her excellent camouflage in the jungle that is Brage. Scattered throughout this land are a dozen or so villages of varying sizes with a walled city in the middle. The settlements are occupied by highly superstitious humans who may regard Sefame as a blessing or a curse. Fortunately, these are issues that must be dealt with in the future. The present however, has a much more pressing issue: a naga\u2019s hunger.</span></div></div>",
