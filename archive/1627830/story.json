He was dressed only in a night shirt and underwear, but also wore an expression of raw defeat as he looked out over his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, buddy?\u201d Darwin asked, poking his head out from his fishbowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You think I\u2019m too young to go through a midlife crisis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but continue. It\u2019s healthy to get this stuff off your chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m just wondering if this is it.\u201d Gumball indicated his messy room. \u201cI wake up, eat breakfast, go to school, eat again, stay in school, try not to incur Ms. Simian\u2019s wrath, come home, eat dinner, and go right to bed. And also maybe the occasional wacky hijinks that seems to follow me around like some obsessive stalker, but that\u2019s beside the point. Is this all I have to look forward to in life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you might\u2019ve forgotten a few things in that list,\u201d observed Darwin. \u201cLike homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball crossed his arms defiantly. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t forget. I simply chose to leave it out. But if you insist, that makes things even worse. Minus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s hanging with our friends in school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball made a sound like a buzzer. \u201cMost of those guys have tried to kill me at least once. Minus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Penny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinite plus! Granted, she\u2019s also tried to kill me a few times, but she\u2019s cute when she\u2019s mad, so I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the family. Mr. Dad, Mrs. Mom, and Anais.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Mixed bag. Sure, the unconditional love is nice, but we\u2019ve also tried killing each other on several occasions. Hmm. Now that I think about it, it seems like everything and everyone has tried to kill us at some point. I\u2019m putting this one in the minus pile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s me, the best friend/brother who\u2019s stuck by you through thick and thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball pursed his lips. \u201cOkay, yeah. That\u2019s also a big plus, but not enough to counterbalance the fact that the world seems out to get me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were having a midlife crisis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did too, but suddenly I\u2019m paranoid about all the things that seem to want me dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn all fairness, most of those things didn\u2019t happen without provocation. Not that it\u2019s an excuse,\u201d Darwin argued, \u201cbut we <i>do</i> have a talent for pissing people off. Maybe if we didn\u2019t do that so much, we\u2019d have fewer brushes with death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball tapped his chin thoughtfully. \u201cI see. So what you\u2019re saying is\u2026 we need to create some big, elaborate spectacle to win the town over and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot do that,\u201d Darwin cut him off. \u201cThat\u2019s usually the sort of thing that upsets people to begin with. Instead, I propose we live our best lives and try to get along with everyone in the hopes that they\u2019ll respond in kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Sounds boring, which just brings us right back to the midlife crisis.\u201d Gumball huffed and fell back against his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarwin rolled his eyes so hard that he tumbled in his bowl. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just in a rut. Would some wacky hijinks make you feel better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball shrugged. \u201cI guess. What\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarwin hummed thoughtfully. \u201cIt should be something exciting enough to pull you out of your rut, but not so exciting that it gives others the urge to kill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d In the blink of an eye, Gumball leapt from his bed, across the room, and hopped onto his computer. He jumped online and started hunting around for his idea. \u201cI heard Penny mention this a while ago, but was distracted by the melodious blowing of some leaves and forgot. Sounded pretty interesting, though. Ah ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarwin walked up to Gumball\u2019s side and stared questioningly at the website. \u201cVore? What\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball scrolled down to find a wide gallery of pictures depicting various acts under the broad umbrella of vore. \u201cIt looks like people eating each other, most of them are naked, and they\u2019re all making some really weird faces.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose pictures make me feel funny,\u201d admitted Darwin as he covered his fishy privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumball looked down at the bulge poking up in his underwear. \u201cMe too. Hmm. Usually that thing\u2019s gone down by now, but it feels different this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould it be the pictures?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be the logical explanation. Clearly we must investigate this matter further,\u201d avowed Gumball seriously. \u201cI guess we could see what all the internet has to teach us, then try it out with our family and friends without properly consulting any adults beforehand, and see what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the most responsible plan, but it does sound like the perfect setup for wacky hijinks. <b>Let\u2019s do it!</b>\u201d Darwin deepened his voice to sound extra serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the boys began their journey down the rabbit hole. Luckily it was a Saturday, so they could afford to be a little lazy. They read on forums and explored a vast gallery of pictures. They even found quite a few familiar faces. Masami the cloud girl was doing some weird things to her mom\u2019s swimsuit area, Mr. Small seemed to be sinking himself into the lower back area of Principal Brown\u2019s fur, Hector eating Doughnut Sheriff, and just about everyone else in Elmore. It seemed like everyone in town was in on this, leaving Gumball and Darwin out in the cold. Well that ended today. Feeling that they\u2019d learned enough, the boys got dressed, marched straight down stairs, and confronted the first person they saw.</span></div></div>",

The creature slowly stalked toward you and bared its cruel fangs. You had no weapons, so you decided to create as much ruckus as possible in hopes of scaring the beast away. You unleashed the most terrifying growl in your repertoire, but the wolf-monkey only barked harsh laughter, and began to charge you. Thinking quickly, you reached behind you to the salt rock, scratched away small crystals with your fingernails, and flung them into the aberration's eyes. The family of otters watched in horror and fascination as the wolf-monkey howled in anguish, and ran off into the forest. The otters ran to their fallen companion, and reared up on their hind legs in an effort to keep you away from the body. However, your plan was never to use the dead otter for a snack, you were simply defending a nice creature that had helped you when you needed it. You told the otters to back down, and that you meant them no harm, and in a strangely human manner, they nodded, as if they understood your words, and crawled away with sullen gaits.<br>\r\n       You carried the dead otter for hours until you found a spot you thought would be good to bury your fallen guide. The other otters still trailed, and you could feel their defeated spirit. You thought the otter that was killed may have been their father. With their help, you began to dig a small hole, and in a matter of minutes, a shallow grave was created. You gently placed the deceased otter inside, and listened to the chirps and growls of its family, singing their last words in a heartbreaking manner. You shoveled the dirt back over the body, and packed the earth with your bare feet. You turned  around to see two of the otters carrying a beautiful green pine-cone, and they pressed the seed into the top of the loosened soil. \"What is going on here?\" you asked, \"What was that thing? Where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n        The otters stood on their hind legs once more, lifted their little furry paws, and pointed behind you over the tree-line. You saw a large plume of unhealthy smoke, and heard a faint grinding of gears. You also heard the faint sound of human voices. You thanked the otters, and they scampered off, back into the water, and swam in the direction of the forest. One last otter was left behind, and it grabbed your leg, as if beckoning you to follow it.</span></div></div>",

Amongst the twigs, leaves, and brush there was a fairly thick, five foot long, white branch. He knelt down to examine it, gently caressing its rough surface with the tips of his fingers. Along its length, every few inches, he tested its strength by applying minor force to bend it. When at last he was satisfied with its strength, Joseph lifted his uncut spear and with the blunt end, he stabbed the ground as if posing for a painting. <br>\r\nThe gralder cried out again. Joseph couldn\u2019t tell if it was calling for help, begging for mercy, or just crying in pain. As Joseph approached for a closer look on the flailing yelping creature, he couldn\u2019t help but pity the poor thing. Trying to get closer proved too hazardous as the thing slashed its claws at him. Even injured the damn thing\u2019s dangerous, Joseph thought to himself. Well of course it is you moron. He rebuttled. Frightened animals are always dangerous. That\u2019s why venomous snakes strike things they can\u2019t eat.<br>\r\nPulling himself back to reality, Joseph realized that the tree wasn\u2019t that thick. And from what he could see, the gralder didn\u2019t appear that injured. It could limp away and hunt otters until it healed. However, left in its current state it would probably attract all manner of predators looking for an easy meal. Joseph met eyes with the creature and marveled at its defiance against certain death. <br>\r\nIt was decided. Joseph found a suitable rock and placed it beside the tree. Then, jamming the branch beneath the tree to use as a wedge, applied all his strength onto the branch, and finally forced the tree to move. </span></div></div>",

She rose to her maximum height and immediately noticed that her right leg had reflexively pulled itself up. Knowing that she needed to test the extent of her injuries, she swayed from side to side, and rolled her shoulders. These movements were done with such a surprising rhythm that it could easily have been mistaken for dancing. Finally, she decided it was time to test her leg. With the will of a coyote who chews off its own captured leg and the bravery of a child going in for their annual shot, she lowered her leg to the ground. Placing her weight over it for all of an instant, she immediately pulled the broken leg back into the air with a yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph, who had been watching amusedly as the wild animal did it\u2019s jig, couldn\u2019t help but give a light chuckle at this new development. Especially upon the discovery that the creature was in fact not an it, but a her; given that nothing shook between its legs as it danced. Not to mention the six nipples on her chest that never shows up on males.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This caused the gralder to look up at Joseph. Its face was blank as its eyes surveyed the man whom spared her. Her eyes darted between him and the tree branch that he held between them. She realized that even if she weren\u2019t hurt, this was not a beast that she could hunt. Confused that he had not yet attacked, and even more confused that he had saved her, she turned from him and began sniffing through the twigs and found her way to the place where the otter had dropped. Picking it up with her still firm jaws, she turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With seemingly intelligent and humble movements, she approached the large pink thing. Seeing the stick lower in his relaxing hands, she assumed that he had guessed her intentions. However, this did not mean that he had ever stopped aiming the sharper end of the stick at her. She continued her approach until she was mere inches outside of the stick\u2019s range. Opening her mouth slightly, she let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naked pink thing almost completely relaxed his stick. He was in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position, when the gralder did something to make them both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

She flinched at the sound of his voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept winning their little staring contest game.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At first she seemed to be offering the otter out of gratitude, or some manner of peace offering. If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. Joseph thought to himself. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. They were in each other\u2019s territory now; her within reach of his spear/club, and him within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph got his answer as the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If this weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With his spear still trained on her head, Joseph pondered this for a few moments. Finally, he decided to do the only practical thing he could think of. Very slowly, Joseph lowered his spear, its tip descending from her forehead to her nose, her throat, chest, stomach, and at last falling upon the long dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a single motion he jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back, ready to fight off the gralder should this all have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. Joseph took another step back then another. Once he had reached twelve foot distance, he decided that it was safe to turn his back. Almost immediately the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following him, limping the whole way. It didn\u2019t take long for Joseph to notice. When he stopped she did as well. When he turned around she bowed her head. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game of stop and go continued for almost an hour before Joseph decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. He slowed his pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. He found another berry bush, eating his fill and then some, since he was unable to carry any with him. Then, looking at the dead otter still in his hand he confessed \u201cI\u2019m gonna make you into a berry pack.\u201d Joseph walked far enough forward so that the gralder stood where he had squatted to eat the berries. He waited a moment to see if she would eat any. To his relief she did.  At last the house was in sight. Still walking, Joseph decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning his head to face her, he called out \u201cHurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That evening, Joseph patrolled the area around the house, collecting as much fire wood as he could. He even found an impressively strong vine and a stick that looked like it would make a suitable splint. Another stick looked like it would make a good spit. He also found stones that would make excellent spark rocks. After he completed his foraging outside, he pointed at Gimp, telling her \u201cGimp. Stay.\u201d Joseph then stepped inside to see if there was anything he could use that he had missed from this morning. To his great surprise, there was. At first figured that it would be fruitless to check the drawers a second time, but it was still a necessary precaution. But when the first drawer opened, he practically leapt for joy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Only a total of eight cabinets and drawers had opened across the house. This might have been disappointing, had it not been for the fact that almost everything he found was of use. Joseph\u2019s new treasures included four boxes of matches, eighteen kitchen knives and two that could be useful in a fight, a bag full of various medicines, rags, towels, twelve spoons, two tool belts with holsters, a sewing kit, an ax, and much more. The final treasure he discovered was book containing detailed illustrations on the plants, creatures, and minerals of the forest. The title was Survival in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Joseph had come down from his present high, he remembered that he was hungry. The growls of his stomach grew ever louder as he began his work. He started by designating a spot for the fire by setting a circle of rocks and filling it with most of the dried wood he had collected earlier, with the exception of the pieces he had labeled the spit, splint, and the support for the spit which he set on either side of the fire pit. To Joseph\u2019s immense pride, it only took him four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire. Following the fire, he bled the otter, followed by skinning it with one of the more peculiar shipped knives. Once the skin had been cleaned and the meat gutted, Joseph proceeded to jam the spit through the otter\u2019s mouth and out the other end. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gimp sat a few yards away from the fire, but with each gust wind she was reminded of the delicious smell of cooked meat and inched her way forward. Joseph noticed this and considered the ways he could hide the smell from any unwanted guests. Setting his spear on the ground next to him, Joseph picked up the book read to the fading light of the setting sun. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia were categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. Before reading up on the goodies of Naxia, he decided to first look up its dangers. There were few venomous plants or animals and no threatening aquatic creatures. The chapter on the otters described them as adequately nutritious. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The meat finally seemed ready. Placing the book down, Joseph grabbed one end of the spit and brought it to his mouth. \u201cDelicious!\u201d The book failed to describe how good they tasted. As Joseph finished off the last bit of flesh, he thought to himself that it could have use a tiny bit of salt, but that could be handled tomorrow. Joseph used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After wiping his hands on a towel, he poured dirt onto the fire, packed up his gear and made his way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. Joseph climbed into bed while Gimp curled up beside him and they both enjoyed a nice long sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just a lazy Wednesday at the home of the Crystal Gems and Steven, nothing to do but lay around and watch some tv. That\u2019s what Amethyst was doing on Steven\u2019s bed right now, just staring at the screen seemingly alone. However, if one were paying attention, you\u2019d notice a tiny head with bushy dark hair sticking out of her cleavage trying to watch the tv too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay in there, Steve-O? I can change into something a lot more low cut if my shirts too high, or I can just go topless if you want?\u201d Amethyst offered as she peered down at the only one in the temple smaller than her. Steven was nestled nicely between her breasts, the huge purple mounds holding him firmly in place. Amethyst was proud to be the only one in the temple that could give Steven a good cleavage ride. Pearl was too small, and Garnet was too big, which always led to Steven getting trapped between her big knockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, I even have something to eat,\u201d the currently two-inch-tall Steven said as he held up a piece of popcorn that had landed in the purple gem\u2019s cleavage earlier. He took a big bite of it, which still left most of it untouched. As he enjoyed the buttery treat, Amethyst reached for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair, that\u2019s mine,\u201d she complained when seeing Steven had stolen some crumbs from her last big snack. It didn\u2019t matter that it was nothing more than a single piece of popcorn, it was hers. With a big grin on his face, Steven dove down into the crevice he had been poking out from, vanishing between the breasts where he hoped to enjoy his snack. He didn\u2019t even get time to take another bite before the purple walls next to him closed in tightly and started crushing his puny form. Gasping as he was smothered in the soft and supple gem boob flesh, he wiggled franticly, trying to slide further down and escape through the bottom of Amethyst\u2019s top. Too bad the grip of the breasts was too tight, forcing him up instead of down. He popped back up out of the cleavage to see Amethyst was squishing her boobs together to wring Steven out from his hiding spot. She gave her bosom a final squeeze before reaching for the piece of popcorn still in Steven\u2019s hands.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s mine now,\u201d Steven shot back at his most immature paternal figure as she pinched the popcorn between her fingers and tried to pull it away from the tiny boy. Steven held on, getting carried out of the cleavage as Amethyst easily took her popcorn back. She held the tiny morsel before her round face as Steven dangled from it. The boy was just not letting it go. The mature thing would be to let him have it. Too bad Amethyst was far from mature. Instead, she opened her mouth and tossed both boy and popcorn into her wet, drooling maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d Steven said as he landed face-first onto the tongue, letting go of the popcorn and sending it tumbling to the back of the mouth. He watched it go over the edge of the tongue, vanishing down the throat without the gem even needing to swallow. Sulking slightly at losing his snack, Steven had more important things to focus on as the tongue surged up under him and started to throw him around. With a laugh he felt himself bounce around the dripping wet cavern, rolling along the tongue until it tilted forward and slammed him into the roof of the mouth. Amethyst started sucking on him, her massive tongue spasming as it slipped all over the tiny boy. Steven kept laughing until he accidentally choked on a bit of saliva. Coughing, he was still smiling as Amethyst wrapped her tongue around him to get even more personal with her mouth play. Then a voice shattered the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAMETHYST!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue went still under Steven, only moving to slowly push out of the mouth as Amethyst stuck it out on command from the most senior Crystal Gem. Steven was lying on top of the pink muscle as he came out to see Pearl looking at him with concern. He waved his tiny arm at her before she ever so gently plucked him up off the squishy surface he'd found himself on. Grimacing in disgust at the saliva, Pearl looked back at Amethyst angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? Undress Steven before he goes anywhere inside you. Do you know how hard it is to get saliva stains out?\u201d Pearl nagged. Having Steven in her mouth wasn\u2019t a problem, none of the Crystal Gems could resist playing with the boy when he was this small. That didn\u2019t excuse making a mess, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t be any harder than getting cum stains out,\u201d Amethyst added as she blew Steven a kiss. Her behavior made Steven giggle and Pearl roll her eyes. Calming down, Pearl put Steven down on the floor and stepped back to let him do his thing. Steven didn\u2019t even have to be told what to do as he willed himself to grow. What had once been a two-inch-tall boy was now a normal, if not slightly short boy; one covered head to toe in drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the drill, Steven. Off with the clothes,\u201d Pearl said, unable to keep herself from smiling slightly as Steven started to undress. Steven was unlike other humans. He was also unlike the Crystal Gems for several reasons; a major one being he could control his size. In the past, Steven\u2019s mother could grow to hundreds of feet tall, a literal giantess that could surpass any fusion in size. Steven never learned to increase his size, but he\u2019s always been able to decrease it. Growing up he could pick whether he was normal-sized Steven, doll Steven, toy Steven or even bug Steven. He loved being small and spent most of his time like that, even fighting gem monsters at a smaller size. Being different sizes was as much a part of Steven as his gem, and with it came a very unique relationship with the Crystal Gems. They loved seeing him small, and early on they all discovered just how deep and passionate that love could get. Steven was more than happy about that and got plenty of enjoyment out of it along with the others. It wasn\u2019t normal, but what part of his life was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven\u2026you really should put something on now,\u201d Pearl spoke up as she took the saliva covered clothes, leaving the boy standing there completely naked. Amethyst didn\u2019t seem to agree with Pearl as she shook her head behind the other gem\u2019s back. She\u2019d be happy if the kid went full nudist all the time. Smiling at them both, Steven went to get dressed. He never knew what to expect, but it would be nice to have at least some small shred of clothes on if trouble came.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven returned to Amethyst\u2019s side on the bed and snuggled up against her. The short gem gave no complaints as she held him close. Feeling playful, she also wedged his face against her right breast. He laughed as she struggled to pull free, but that just made the game more fun. In no time the pair were wrestling and rolling around on the bed. Their hands glided over one another\u2019s bodies. They\u2019d done so enough to memorize the other\u2019s sensitive areas, which they attacked without mercy, leading to even more uproarious cries of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, feeling his breathing run short, Steven suddenly stopped the rolling while he was on top of Amethyst. He slapped his hands to either side of her head before quickly tapping. \u201cOne-two-three.\u201d When Amethyst\u2019s eyes went wide with shock in realization at what happened, Steven beamed and threw up his hands in cheer. \u201cAnd the winner, is Steveeen! Haaa!\u201d He mimicked a cheering audience. \u201cAnd the crowds go wild. Haaa!\u201d Then he turned a triumphant look down on the purple woman. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach you to steal my popcorn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst snickered. \u201cSorry, Steve-o, but you\u2019ll have to do better than that if you want to teach <i>me</i> anything.\u201d She leaned back casually and rested her head in her hands, her expression silently daring Steven to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Well what if I do\u2026 this!?\u201d Steven pulled at the hem of Amethyst\u2019s pants and, with practiced ease, shrunk down to about ten inches as he slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGems didn\u2019t technically wear clothes. Their outer coverings were just an extension of their hard-light bodies. As such, it was no surprise that Amethyst hadn\u2019t manifested any panties. Steven sat upon the furry white bush of the purple woman\u2019s pubic hair and beheld the simple elegance of her purple slit. His smile devious, he used the strength of his greater size to fight against the constrictive pants and crawled the short distance to her pussy. However, just as he was about to reach it, a pair of fingers grabbed his ankle and yanked him right back out. Dangling upside down before Amethyst\u2019s lazy smirk, Steven crossed his arms in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally fair, dude. You chose to get small, so you chose to accept the consequences.\u201d Amethyst shook him around for emphasis. \u201cBesides, Pearl <i>just</i> said you need to get naked if you want to go inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven\u2019s consternated frown shifted to confusion. \u201cSince when do you care about me being clean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI care because Pearl might make <i>me</i> do the washing. And,\u201d she snickered, \u201clet\u2019s be real. That ain\u2019t happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Steven huffed again and slipped his shirt off. \u201cI\u2019ll get naked, but then you put me right back, and play fair this time so I can beat you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst bit her lip to keep from busting a gut at how adorable Steven was. Being small always made him extra cute, but small <i>and</i> trying to be threatening was just too much. She decided to help him out of his bottoms and bubbled his clothes so they wouldn\u2019t be lost. Then she took another look at the boy in her hands. He was now what the gems referred to as toy sized. They all liked playing with him at any height, but this one had a particular function. \u201cYou want to play a game, Steve-o? Then how about\u2026 the quiet game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven gulped. The quiet game had a different context for the gems than it did for regular humans. The point was still to see who could go the longest without making noise, but the twist was that players would often do lewd things to sabotage the each other. Steven, to date, had never won the quiet game. However\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky! Bring it on, Amethyst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it, bud.\u201d Amethyst went over to the head of the bed and propped up some pillows for her back. She then willed away the crotch off of her pants in a flash of energy. Grinning toothily in a sinister smirk, the purple woman plunged Steven head first into her sopping sex. Immediately she slapped a hand over her mouth to keep from crying out. No matter his size, Steven always felt amazing down there. His wiggling body was the ultimate toy, which was actually to her disadvantage right now. She could feel him already touching around inside of her in search of her weak spots. So, being Amethyst, it was hardly a surprise that she manifested a zipper over her mouth and closed it shut. He need not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was panting heavily as the tight confines of the pussy undulated all around him. This, in turn, resulted in him inhaling a few mouthfuls of pussy juice. Although he liked the sweet yet earthy flavor, he still had to cough it back up. Luckily this didn\u2019t count as losing the game. The real problem was that Amethyst was thrusting his body in and out of hers, which felt great. He stifled his pleasured moan and tried to redouble his groping efforts. He\u2019d been in this pussy enough times that he could navigate it with his eyes closed and quickly located the spots he knew would make Amethyst go crazy. Her body certainly thrashed about when he pressed his face against and kissed one such spot, knowing that she\u2019d feel every detail of his lips against her moist walls, but he couldn\u2019t hear her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the worst was yet to come. Amethyst was increasing her rhythm of plunging him in and out, going deeper each time. It wouldn\u2019t be long before Steven\u2019s sensitive young teen penis made contact with her sensational pussy, and that would be the end. He\u2019d lose, just like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, for no particular reason, Garnet exited the temple to check on things in the house. Her keen ears immediately picked up the wet squelches of sex, but without the accompanying cries of ecstasy. Ascending the stairs, her hunch was confirmed when she caught Amethyst purple handed using shrunken Steven like a living dildo, but that wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was that they were clearly playing the quiet game, but Amethyst was cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst\u2019s eyes widened to the size of saucers when she saw the red woman. With the biggest breasts in the house, an ass that could deflect bullets, and thighs that once crushed a cannon ball, she was unquestionably the sexiest of the gems; at least now that Rose was \u2018gone\u2019. Her eyes were hidden behind her eye piece, but Amethyst could sense her silent, seething wrath. The purple woman tried motioning the unofficial leader to back away, but Garnet did just the opposite. She marched up to the bed and loomed menacingly for a few seconds. Then, just when Amethyst thought that things might be okay, the fusion reached out. Garnet slammed Steven all the way into Amethyst\u2019s twat while simultaneously ripping off the zipper like a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuuuck!\u201d Amethyst cried out in a mix of bliss and pain. The sudden insertion pushed her over the edge, as it did Steven. She came hard and forcibly ejected the boy from his fleshy prison. He laid panting in a pool of sex juices between Amethyst\u2019s legs as she looked up at the one responsible. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you did,\u201d Garnet said simply, her tone brokering no argument. She then picked up Steven and brought him up to her face. He groaned, clearly sore from his rough treatment, but he was a tough kid. He could take it. Besides, he smiled and waved when he saw the face of his tallest maternal figure. If she were organic and had a heart, this would be the part where it threatened to beat right out of her rib cage. But since that wasn\u2019t the case, she opted to slide Steven into her mouth. He tasted lovely, as always, but she moved him into her cheek to get the final word in. \u201cYou\u2019d better clean that up before Pearl sees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but this was <i>your</i> fault,\u201d Amethyst argued weakly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who made me cum so hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd <i>you\u2019re</i> the one who forgot to set up a towel. As such, this was the most probable outcome.\u201d Garnet adjusted her eye piece to indicate her future vision, forcing Amethyst to grumble her acceptance. \u201cGood girl. Stay good, and I\u2019ll talk to Pearl about giving you a treat.\u201d She then left without elaborating further. According to her vision, Steven had quite the interesting day that he needed to start on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Steven go?</span></div></div>",

However, the boy curled up on her tongue did. Opening wide, she stared into the mirror, seeing the tiny naked young man straddled on top of her tongue, looking as happy as could be. He\u2019d probably be happy if she just sucked on him all day and while she had done that before today wasn\u2019t about having her little Steven candy to enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Steven, time to wash up. Saliva is great for getting cum off but you still need a shower,\u201d Garnet said after plucking the boy up off her tongue and placing him in the bathtub. Instantly he was back to normal size and dripping wet, big globs of drool clinging to his face. While sticky Steven was okay around the temple, he couldn\u2019t be walking around Beach City like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Garnet,\u201d Steven said as he reached to turn on the water but paused as he remembered something. It was rude not to ask if someone wanted to join you. \u201cDo you want to join me for a shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet tilted her head slightly. While gems didn\u2019t need to take showers any reason to be naked around Steven was enjoyed. Garnet thought about it, using her ability to see where it would lead. \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019ll just wait until later to put you up my butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Steven said, not understanding what Garnet was referring to. If only he knew all the sexual outcomes that Garnet saw every day, he\u2019d understand that her reddish complexion was probably there to hide her blushing cheeks from all the perverted things she witnessed. Leaving Steven alone, he shrugged and got on with his shower, scrubbing himself clean. He was a pro at this, the amount of stuff he found stuck to his body from his time having fun with the Crystal Gems was legendary. After he was finished, he dried off and left with a towel around his waist, couldn\u2019t risk drawing one of the gems to him, and getting dirty all over again. Changing into a clean set of clothes he ran out of the temple, knowing exactly what he needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne Big Mini Doughnut!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven burst into the Big Doughnut crying out his order. He was hoping to see Sadie and Lars but he only saw the diminutive but sweet Sadie manning the cash register. She looked bored until she saw Steven come in, that always got a smile on her face. Rushing up to the counter, Steven slapped down one dollar for his favorite doughnut at the store, one that Sadie always saved for him no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Steven, great to see you. I got your mini doughnut right here,\u201d Sadie said as she placed what looked like a third of a doughnut on the counter. It had started as an accident, one of the doughnuts broke apart and Lars threw it into the display because he didn\u2019t care. Seeing the undersized, ignored piece that would be thrown away at the end of the day struck a chord in Steven\u2019s heart and he had to save it and have it for himself. Since that day Sadie had always had a small mishappen piece for Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Sadie!\u201d Steven truthfully said as he jumped up onto the counter, shrinking at the same time so when he landed, he was only three inches tall. The toy-sized boy scampered towards the now car-sized hunk of fried dough in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you think so. Lars has been complaining I\u2019m too needy lately,\u201d Sadie muttered not realizing she had said that out loud until she noticed Steven wasn\u2019t eating his doughnut and instead was looking at her. Blushing, she quickly ducked her face down and tried to save her pride. \u201cI mean, Lars has just been complaining I ask him too often to stay up all night\u2026 watching movies and playing video games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat wrong with staying up all night. That sounds fun,\u201d Steven said, missing the innuendo. Just because he knew more about how to pleasure a pussy than most men alive didn\u2019t mean he understood when people were trying to be coy about what they were saying. \u201cI can come next time and all three of us could stay up all night,\u201d Steven quickly suggested. He was trying to be helpful, but he didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. To be fair, if he did understand he\u2019d still volunteer to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Lars would like that,\u201d Sadie said, not saying that she would have a problem. The way she was blushing even harder and biting her lip, she probably was more than okay with both of the boys spending all night with her. Shaking that thought out of her head, Sadie just sighed and turned away. This was really not Steven\u2019s problem and she shouldn\u2019t be bothering him with it. She remembered the last time she dragged Steven into her problems with Lars and her own needs. What happened then could never happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t anything I can do?\u201d Steven asked, honestly trying to help. Sadie looked at his big warm smile and his tiny adorable form and just felt her heart melt. She remembered last time all too well. She had felt so lonely and had gone on an early break to feel better, expecting Lars to watch everything. He had bailed, of course, and Steven wandered in and found her in the back, panties around her ankles and fingers about to go into herself. She barely remembers what happened next, only Steven offering to help, the most incredible pleasure, and then guilt. She had tried so hard to forget it, but it was hard with Steven always being there for her at her lowest. If he was just older or she was younger things would be so very different and she wouldn\u2019t feel like the worst person ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to take a break. I\u2019ll be back in a couple of minutes,\u201d Sadie excused herself, leaving Steven to finish his tiny treat. Steven watched her go sadly, but he knew when someone wanted to be alone. Taking a few more bites of his doughnut, he decided to leave. Regrowing himself he left the Big Doughnut in search of something else to do. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A nice comfortable bed with 3 layers of blankets, 2 pillows, and a quilt on top.\u201d He did his best to recount as much detail as possible to keep the story going. \u201cRight away I knew that I had no idea where I was or who I was, so I pulled myself up. Once I saw that I wasn\u2019t wearing anything, I tried to cover myself up, but after a couple minutes of listening to the singing birds outside, I figured that there wasn\u2019t anyone around to see me. I knew that the first thing I needed was to get my bearings, so I surveyed the room for anything of interest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll in all, there was a dresser, three large empty book stands, a chair, desk, and two windows with their blinds shut. There are still a few contraptions in there that I haven\u2019t quite figured out yet. Maybe when you get better you could give them a look-see.\u201d Felecia drifted in and out of consciousness, but Joseph knew he could keep her with him with the sound of a familiar voice. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI noticed that there was some kind of switch on the wall to my left. I gave it a flip, but nothing happened. There were three doors, but only one was open. I got up to test the closed doors, but they were all locked. After trying the dresser and a few other cabinets around the room, I started thinking that maybe everything closed was also locked. Once I had finished a brief expedition of the hall way, living room and kitchen, I found that my theory was correct in every regard except one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe only other open door was to the forest. Looking through the glass windows, the word \u2018backyard\u2019 came to mind. Not sure why but it seemed appropriate. Despite sunlight shining through the blinds in all other windows, the backyard was surprisingly dark. I guess it\u2019s due to the thickness of the canopy. Anyway, since I had nothing better to do indoors, and a warm refreshing breeze was blowing in through a partially opened window, I figured I might as well go outside and enjoy the day. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAfter about fifty feet of what some might consider stalking, probably not you, I decided to look back at the place where I had woken. The house itself seemed fairly normal, but the really freaky thing was directly on top. An enormous metal wall with some kind of glowing array of opaque lights shooting out above it seemed to run right through the house. Seriously though, part of that damn Fence makes up a huge barren dead end of a wall. I swear it\u2019s like we\u2019re cut off from the other end of the house. But I digress, the Fence stretched out endlessly in either direction; or at least it would have if all the trees hadn\u2019t blocked my view.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRemember when you told me about the Fence?\u201d Joseph inquired while he set various items beside his patient as per the directions in the book. When Felecia didn\u2019t answer, Joseph just continued talking. \u201cYour right. I guess it\u2019s not really relevant to this part of the story anyway. You don\u2019t come in until much later. I\u2019m just letting you know that I haven\u2019t forgotten you.\"</span></div></div>",

The only thing to grab my attention was throat becoming quite dry. Finally I found myself some water at Gigigly. We\u2019ll get into how that place is relevant a bit later. Anyway, the Fence ran straight through clear sparkly pond. Regardless of whatever you might think, I am not now, nor was I ever <i>completely</i> devoid of common sense. I found a long stick and proceeded to poke into the water. I wasn\u2019t just testing the depth; I was also making sure that there wasn\u2019t anything lurking beneath the surface. Once I found a sufficiently shallow pool, I dipped my hands in for several refreshing gulps.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen a splash came from out in the pond, it made me jump back and fall on my butt.\u201d Joseph smiled to himself as he watched her eyes move beneath their lids, \u201cYou know, if you were awake right now you\u2019d be laughing too. Anyway, I scanned the surface of the water for any signs of movement. About half way across the lake, were four small heads poking out of the water and swimming towards land. I hid behind a tree until I saw that the creatures crawling out of the pond were some kind of green otters. They were really small, so I saw no harm in stalking them for a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI figured if critters that small were moving around in broad daylight, then surely it meant that there were no predators to worry about. It would be nice to bathe in the pond without any worries of being torn in half. With the stick still in hand, I followed the otters for most of the day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d Joseph began as he filled a syringe with a pink liquid \u201cfollowing a gaggle of otters through a forest, buck naked for several hours sounds pretty exciting. But after a while, I gave the otters a silent \u201cthank you.\u201d After all, they had taught me so much about the place I now call home. I got to see which berries were safe to eat. I saw some weird ants that apparently like fecal matter. At which I thought: <i>Nice. Now I don\u2019t have to worry about stepping in anyone\u2019s crap, especially my own.</i> I even saw a boar carcass, which was a lot more interesting than it sounds. Based on its flat teeth, I managed to deduce that I could hunt them if I managed to get a better stick. Don\u2019t get me wrong, but those things are pretty damn big. No offense.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Joseph injected the pink liquid into Felecia\u2019s forearm, he couldn\u2019t help but marvel at his own skills. It was as if his hands instinctively knew what to do, and were operating independent of his own mind. He had the hands of a forty year medical veteran even though stubble was just beginning to grow on his chin. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnyway, the remaining discoveries of the day included a patch of plants that the otters dug up. I gave em a try and they weren\u2019t too bad. There was also a rock that they licked. I used my finger to give it a taste. It had this really weird flavor. It was nowhere near as weird as what went on in my head. A moment after the stuff had dissolved in my mouth, I thought the word: salt. A flood of images then poured into my head, showing me things like how I could grind up the salt rocks and use them to preserve dead animals for later use. It was easily the trippiest moment of the day.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph followed the next few steps in the medicine book. He grabbed two small rags. The first he folded and maneuvered into her mouth. The second he soaked in alcohol.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI might have kept on following those cute little guys were it not for what happened next. A solitary predator about half the size of the pig, jumped out of the bushes, grabbed an otter and snapped its neck all in the blink of an eye. It had kind of a wolf\u2019s head, monkey\u2019s body, long arms with long claws, and fairly sharp teeth. As I sat there and watched the thing fling the corpse around, giving little roars of victory, I wondered what to do next. Should I avoid it and not make any enemies, or steal the dead otter for myself?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBy the way, I take no enjoyment in this whatsoever.\u201d Joseph concluded his speech as he gently placed the alcohol drenched rag against her wound. Felecia\u2019s eyes flew open, her screams muffled under the rag. Upon seeing such a powerful creature reduced to relying on his care, Joseph gave a quick snicker before continuing.</span></div></div>",

As her body slowly began to relax, her half closed eyes wandered the room before falling on Joseph. Upon seeing Joseph\u2019s face, she was greeted with a relieved smile. \u201cHey there sleepy head. Welcome back to the world of the living.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia moaned groggily and made muffled sounds through the rag that sounded vaguely like \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Her voice was deep and almost sensual. Taking into account the rag in her mouth and her severe loss of blood, her voice might as well have been a whisper compared to her usual volume.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Continuing to apply pressure against the rag on her side, Joseph asked \u201cWe\u2019re in my house. Are you feeling any better?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Using her left and severely less bruised arm Felecia removed the cloth from her mouth.  \u201cThere\u2019s less pain, but my head\u2019s all fuzzy. Why am I here?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph grabbed her right hand and placed it over the cloth on her wound, telling her to keep up the pressure while he got something out of a med-kit. \u201cYou were attacked, remember? You said that you were ambushed on patrol so you came here looking like that. I managed to walk you to this room and started working on your injuries. We\u2019ll be talking about how you look later.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you\u201d Felecia wheezed as she rested her eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, cause right now we got more pressing issues. Tops on the list: won\u2019t they be able to track you here? Why didn\u2019t you go back to your cave?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Doing her best to formulate words despite her loss of blood, Felecia did her best to answer his questions. \u201cMy cave was too far from where they ambushed me. Even if it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the most defendable of positions, especially in my present state.\u201d Felecia hissed as Joseph applied medicine soaked cotton balls against her various scratches. \u201cBesides, this is the most secure place I know of.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he asked, extending his arm in the direction of the living room. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wall that\u2019s made up of mostly glass. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard but glass is pretty flimsy.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia gave a light chuckle. \u201cThis place may have the look and feel of wood, glass, and carpet, but trust me when I say that this place is impenetrable.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lifting her eyelids slightly to see Joseph\u2019s stress, Felecia answered \u201cI nearly dislocated my shoulder trying to smash through that \u2018flimsy\u2019 glass not three months before you appeared. It\u2019s likely that nothing short of a falling tree is capable of breaking through these walls.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026ok\u201d Joseph said.

Looking back he instructed \u201cjust keep putting pressure on that cloth and you should be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he walked out the archway to the room where the weakened Felecia still lay, Joseph began going over the configuration of the house in his mind. To his right was the room where he use to sleep. He gave a quick peek inside. Satisfied that there were no predators small enough to hide in there he turned his attention to the left. After seeing no immediate danger, Joseph made his way down the hall. At the other end of the hall was the living room and the only door in and out of the house. Between him and the door rested a large couch and two recliners. They would provide decent cover to approach the door unnoticed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The problem lay in uncertainty; the uncertainty as to whether or not the door was already locked, and the uncertainty about the condition of the blinds. Normally Joseph left the blinds open during the day to help warm the house. As per Felecia\u2019s advice, he started closing the blinds at night to keep his privacy. It was a new habit that had yet to completely sink in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally coming to the end of the hall, Joseph knew his next step would be to peek around the corner to check on the blinds and the door. If the blinds for the window wall were closed then he could probably head straight for the door without pause. Open blinds would call for a much more subtle approach, especially if there was movement outside. However, the biggest issue wasn\u2019t whether or not the door was locked, but whether or not it was closed. Even if it wasn\u2019t locked the only way to open it was to turn the handle and the only predators in Naxia with opposable thumbs were him and apparently Felecia. If he hadn\u2019t closed the door completely and it had been blown open by a gust of wind, then something may have already wandered in. something that Joseph wasn\u2019t confident he could take with just a spear and knife.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment of truth.</span></div></div>",

In this poor light, the door seemed as closed as it could get, but the blinds were open. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t move fast\u201d Joseph muttered to himself as he ducked down, ready to jump behind the couch. \u201cGotta be cautious.\u201d The storm continued to rage outside. The songs of nocturnal birds drowned out by the constant thud of raindrops and the occasional boom of thunder. The dangerous part was the lightening. If he peeked out during a flash then he might be able to see outside movement, but if anything was out there they\u2019d certainly be able to see him, flash or no flash. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Staying as low as possible, Joseph tucked and almost rolled behind the couch. Still in crouching position he moved swiftly behind the couch. Arriving at the edge, weapons still in hand, Joseph made another jump, this time for the first recliner. As he did so a flash of light filled the room. While taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph felt the rumble of thunder move through his entire body, accompanied, shortly after, by distant howls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With each breath, Joseph\u2019s heart seemed to beat faster. At this point he was actually to the right of the door. Directly in front of him was the brick and wood part of the wall. He continued to hide behind the recliners until he was completely against the wall. Pressing himself against it, Joseph made good time to the door. Confirming that it was indeed unlocked, he considered the next challenge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph still didn\u2019t know whether or not the predators were near yet, the door was half made of glass, and the door-knob. He would have to reach out across almost two feet of transparent glass, provoking anything within twenty meters to charge.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fearing that the sound of his racing heart could be heard over the sound of the storm, Joseph attempted to calm himself. \u201cThey\u2019re just dumb animals you moron. Even if they do see you they don\u2019t know how doors work.\u201d Starting to laugh a bit, Joseph continued muttering to himself. \u201cBesides, if the door\u2019s closed enough to endure the wind then it could probably take a direct hit from a charging rhino. Right?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making up his mind, Joseph discarded the notion of reaching slowly across the door. Instead he dropped his weapons and made one last jump in front of the door, turning the lock until he heard the click.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he stared outside, the constant splatter of drops continuing to bombard its glass, Joseph felt a wave of relief wash over him. Bursts of laughter were interrupted by brief but deep calming breaths. All was right in the world as lightning flashed again, illuminating the swaying brush outside and covering it in an instant with a mass of fur and teeth.</span></div></div>",

The giant wolf\u2019s body and face was covered in long black fur, a pair of horns as thick and long as a human arm protrude threateningly from its head and eyes, as bright and yellow as the sun, glared level with Joseph\u2019s. The monster\u2019s long fangs had such strength and sharpness that they made Joseph\u2019s spear the equivalent of a tooth-pick. This thought provoked a most unpleasant image in Joseph\u2019s mind. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The latest resident of Naxia might have gone on to examine other intimidating features of this vicious beast; he might even have noticed an entire pack pacing back and forth just behind it. However, Joseph was far too preoccupied with the rows of flesh rending teeth that were revealed by the drom\u2019s partially opened mouth. There were also the drom\u2019s eyes to consider; those deep golden eyes that seemed to consume all those who lost their way in them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Out of nowhere the beast moved, opening its mouth several inches before closing to its original position, almost like a silent bark. A startled Joseph took several steps backward. The scare tactic had effectively broken him out of thed trance. Able to think again, Joseph started remembering Felecia\u2019s teachings. The first was in regards to large predators and how to never look them in the eye. After that, the dam in his mind collapsed and al his lessons came rushing back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph recounted one of Felecia\u2019s earliest lessons. He remembered the way she would stare out across the forest as she lay sunning on one of the large rocks outside her cave, her cat like tail swaying from side to side. A gust of wind brought with it a flurry of pollen, causing Joseph periodic sneezes. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without even glancing at him, she said \u201cShow no fear. It is the defining feature of prey when they are afraid; especially in the minds of the scavengers. To show fear is to admit weakness to a harsh and unforgiving world. A beast may not have fang, claw, or horn to boast of, but if they are not afraid then they likely have just reason to be so. Be it out of ignorance or confidence, it is a dangerous gamble to charge the one who is not afraid.\u201d It was then that Felecia turned her head and looked him straight in the eye. \u201cProve yourself and do not blink\u201d she said as she continued staring right through him. \u201cShow no fear. Show no weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph had failed the first test, but after weeks of practice all his hard work seemed to have paid off. Just as Felecia told him, Joseph stood his ground, choosing to stare between the beast\u2019s eyes rather than into them. He crunched his brow, tensed his muscles threateningly, and bore his teeth with a low growl. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The drom attempted another bark, this one less silent. It took every ounce of Joseph\u2019s will power not to budge as he stared past the razor sharp teeth into the gaping maw that could swallow him whole.  The beast stared into Joseph\u2019s eyes in an effort to lock him in another trance, but to no avail. It could find no fear to latch on to, only courage. Slowly it began to dawn on the drom that perhaps the naked pink creature it stared at wasn\u2019t prey. No prey could stare into his eyes without shaking in fear. The over-fluffed puppy lowered its gaze as he cautiously backed away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Satisfied that both he and Felecia were safe, and that he had stood his ground, Joseph started to move again. Without ceasing to stare through the glass, Joseph collected his weapons, confirmed one last time that the door was locked and proceeded to close the blinds. With everything set and secure, Joseph used the remains of his strength to move himself out of the living room and into the hallway. There he collapsed, tears of fear flowing from his eyes. Joseph remained this way for several minutes.</span></div></div>",

As he fell to his knees by her side, Felecia looked up into his red watery eyes. Without needing to ask why, she reached out and touched Joseph\u2019s knee. \u201cNice job kid.\u201d Felecia said proudly, giving him the necessary strength he needed to continue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wiping away the remains of his tears, Joseph smiled back at Felecia. \u201cRight. Well, I hate to leave things unfinished, so why don\u2019t I pick up where we left off.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWonderful\u201d Felecia said rolling her eyes and pulling her hand back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trying to remember where he had last stopped, Joseph dived back into his tale. \u201cUm, this next part\u2019s a bit fuzzy, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Joseph said hesitantly. \u201cAs I weighed my options I noticed some mysterious crackling sound that seemed to reverberate throughout the woods. It grew louder and louder until it sounded like thunder, and I watched as one of the trees started to fall. It wasn\u2019t falling towards me and that was good, especially since I was so freaked that I couldn\u2019t move. The creature I was watching seemed to be in the same boat. The only difference was that the tree fell on her instead of me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis part is also a bit fuzzy. All I can really remember is this unbearable stabbing headache. I pressed my hands against my head for all the good it did me. The only other thing I remember before passing out was some kind of flash inside my mind; so many lights and shapes.\u201d Joseph had to look away for a moment. Every time he thought about his headaches, he seemed to cause them to come back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen I finally came to, I saw that the creature was writhing underneath the tree. I looked at her and immediately the word \u2018Gralder\u2019 came to mind.\u201d Joseph smiled exhaustively and shook his head. \u201cI started wondering how I suddenly knew what the gralder\u2019s name was when I hadn\u2019t a clue only a couple minutes ago. The only thing that really came to mind was that flash in my head. Thankfully before I could put in any serious thought and cause a relapse, the gralder decided to cry out and snap me back to my senses. I walked over to the squirming monkey-thing and noticed he saw that she had dropped the otter a few feet away. As I got closer, I met eyes with her and she stopped struggling. I can\u2019t really explain it, but I think we share a little moment of understanding. The gralder\u2019s back leg was being crushed beneath the tree and there was no way for her to escape. She was fully aware that I could find a large rock, smash her skull, and eat the remains. </span></div></div>",

And to make a long story short I broke off a thick branch from the fallen tree and used it as a lever to move the tree just enough for the gralder to escape. All the while a voice in the back of my head kept screaming at me, calling me an idiot. So you see, I really don\u2019t need your help in that regard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce she was free, I immediately took several steps back. She rose to her maximum height and started stretching her various extremities. For some reason she felt the need to start doing a little dance, it was like she was celebrating her survival. Eventually she decided to test her leg. She put her weight on it for barely an instant before immediately pulling her broken leg back into the air. She gave a light yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think I must have laughed or something, cause then the gralder looked at me. Her face was blank as her eyes seemed to survey me. I watched her eyes dart between me and the tree branch that I held between us. I guess she was confused at the fact that she was still alive, and more so that I had spared her. She turned away from me and buried her face in the brush on the ground, sniffing through the twigs until she found her way to where the otter had dropped. She picked it up with her jaws and turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.\u201d Joseph\u2019s eyes darted to Felecia\u2019s face. He could have sworn that she had just smiled, if only for a second. Joseph continued telling his story, confident that his words were indeed getting through to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith seemingly intelligent and humble movements, and the otter still in her mouth, the gralder started moving closer and closer to me. Guessing her intentions, I lowered my stick a bit as a sign of good will. But I never stopped aiming the sharp end at her. If it was a trick, I wasn\u2019t going to fall for it. She continued to approach until she was mere inches outside of my stick\u2019s range. She opened her mouth a bit and let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt could have ended there, but it didn\u2019t. I had almost completely relaxed my stick and everything. I was even in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position. That\u2019s when the gralder did something to make us both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

I even yelled \u2018Back\u2019!\u201d Joseph raised his voice a bit to try and match his original volume. \u201cShe flinched a bit at the sound of my voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept taking baby step after baby step.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI thought to myself: If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. We were in each other\u2019s territory then; her within reach of my spear, and me within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured, I said to myself. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI got my answer when the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I thought, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If that weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With my spear still trained on her head, I pondered this for a few moments. Finally, I decided on the only practical option available. Very slowly, I lowered my spear past her until it was pointing at the dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith a single motion I jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back. I was ready to fight off the gralder if it had turned out to have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. I kept moving back until I was about four meters away, and decided that it was safe to turn my back. The instant I did so the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following me. She limped the whole way. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was pretty weird. When I stopped she did as well. When I turned around she bowed her head. We played this game of stop and go for almost an hour before I decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. I slowed my pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. I found another berry bush and ate my fill since there was no way to carry any with me. I even let the gralder eat her fill after I had walked far enough forward. It was kind of relieving to see her eat. Once the house was finally in sight, I decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning around to face her, I called \u2018Hurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper\u2019.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I even found some material that looked like it would make a suitable splint for Gimp. I also found stones that made excellent spark rocks. Once I was done foraging outside, I told Gimp to stay put while I ventured inside to find anything of use that I might have missed earlier. Surprisingly, there was plenty. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnly a fraction of the cabinets and drawers had opened around the house. This might have been disappointing, had it not been for the fact that almost everything I found was of use. My new treasures included four boxes of matches, kitchen knives, two of which looked like they could be useful in a fight, rags, towels, silverware, two tool belts with holsters, a sewing kit, an ax, a small case full of various medicines and bandages, and much more. My final treasure that day was book containing detailed illustrations on the plants, creatures, and minerals of the forest. The title was Survival in Naxia.\u201d Pausing for a bit, \u201cYes I know, we\u2019ll be getting to the book in a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI finally remembered that I was hungry. The growls in my stomach were growing ever louder as I began my work. I started by designating a spot for the fire, setting the rocks in a circle, filling it with most of the dried wood I had collected earlier, and set the other pieces in their respective locations. It only took me about four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire; I was so proud. Then I bled, skinned, cleaned, gutted, and finally roasted the otter. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith Gimp sitting a few yards away from the fire, and my spear resting next to him, I picked up the book and read to the fading light of the setting sun. It was a very detailed book; with its categorizations and big words that I still don\u2019t fully understand. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia are categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. I didn\u2019t make it very far that night, but I did skim through some of the edible and poisonous plants. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce the meat seemed ready, I put the book down, grabbed one end of the spit and took a big bite.\u201d Joseph paused for a moment as he recounted that first bite. \u201cIt was freaking delicious. After I had my fill I used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After putting out the fire I packed up the gear and made my way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. I climbed into the old bed while Gimp curled up beside me and we both drifted off to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The drumbeat of my heart overwhelmed the songs of birds which had greeted me the previous day.

The full impact of everything hit me like a ton of bricks. It wasn\u2019t that I was clueless about my current situation or the content of my dream. My amusement and laughter came from a gut feeling I had. A gut feeling that told me that I\u2019d likely spend every night this way for the rest of my life.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And once again, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRight. Now let\u2019s try and set the mood. The smell of fresh rain and blooming flowers permeated the air. Chirping insects, singing birds, and the occasional howl in the distance, gave the forest an overwhelming and almost soothing thrum. I could hardly keep his eyes open as I sat up against the red tree. I sat beneath an exceptionally large hole in the canopy, enjoying the feel of the warm sun against my wet skin. I had just finished a nice swim in the pond. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven the rumble of a nearby snoring Gimp was lulling me to sleep. She had been so relieved at having her cast removed that she wore herself out in celebration.\u201d Joseph smiled as he recounted how the fuzzy creature had galloped and bounded around the pond while he swam. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was on the verge of taking a nap, but I managed to pull myself out of it.\u201d Joseph shuddered. \u201cI had kinda made a commitment to sleep only as much as my body needed and not a second more. I looked around to find something to keep my mind occupied. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA newly carved and hardened spear lay by my side. It seemed to be waiting impatiently for the next hunt when it would again taste blood.\u201d Joseph smiled as he noticed the empathy in Felecia\u2019s expression. \u201cHanging from a nail directly overhead was my old pack holding a few pieces of red fruit, the guide book, a cutting knife, about 20ft of poorly crafted rope if I do say so myself, and a pair of trunks I had made from that first pig. I could have taken the trunks swimming with me, but they itched something awful. So they were left hanging while I got my bare ass dirty again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was about that time that I thought of the book. I extracted it from the pack, opening up to the page I had marked with a strand of long grass.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He knew that he had power over her, at least in this particular situation, and he was going to milk it for all it was worth. Felecia averted her eyes, signaling that he had permission to go on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo. As I flipped through the pages of my personal bible, I recounted what a marvelous and useful tool it was. It had taught me what I could and couldn\u2019t eat, which things were poisonous, some crap about fertile soil, and a lot more stuff that even you can\u2019t tell me. The opening two pages held a detailed fold out map of all Naxia. As you might have already known, this land was shaped like a perfect square. I was able to make out where my house was in relation to trails, bodies of water and a suspicious labyrinth of stone in a place called Naxia\u2019s Teeth. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe bulk of the book seemed more like one giant glossary than a guide. It was divided into several volumes. Each detailed the different species in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHowever, amidst sea of words of the first few Volumes, I discovered some highly unusual marks. While the majority of the book was quite readable, every now and then a string of unfamiliar symbols would replace words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it cuz I was still shocked that I could even read. But these marks really got my attention when I noticed a substantial increase within the chapter on deadly diseases.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let it bother you too much\u201d Felecia comforted. \u201cI\u2019ve read that book and I\u2019ve seen those grey areas. Trust me that I can fill in most of those gaps through life experiences. After all, I\u2019ve been here a lot longer than you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes\u201d answered Joseph sarcastically. \u201cThe almighty Felecia rushes in yet again to save the day. Anyway, Volumes Three and Four described the fungus and plants of the forest. I skimmed through this section rather quickly, so the only things to catch my attention were a picture of a patch of long grass with a large rock resting behind its rows and an orange moss with the ability to decompose fecal matter. If I\u2019m using too many big words, it means that you can crap on it one day and come back the next to find a bigger clump of moss.\u201d Joseph laughed to himself as he remembered the first time he read this and how he had found a patch of moss near his house and tested it.</span></div></div>",

While they had neither teeth nor venom, they secreted hallucinogenic mucus from their skin when frightened. A quote from the author directly following this fact still confuses me. \u2018Don\u2019t even think about it.\u2019 Weird huh?\u201d Felecia chuckled to herself, gaining Joseph\u2019s attention. \u201cIs there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia shook her head. \u201cOf course there is.

Rather than do the same back to him, she merely gave him a look that said that she could but chose not to. Staring into her deep golden slit eyes, Joseph was the first to back down. \u201cJust don\u2019t go sticking the damn things in your mouth without cooking them first. You\u2019ll live longer.

I practically threw that book to the ground and screamed like a girl at the sight of those scaly heads. It took me a little while to recover, but I managed. I found the place where I left off and immediately folded the page over before continuing.\u201d Laughing to himself \u201cAnd I thought the nightmares were bad.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNext came the birds. While the beautiful and bizarre fouls of Section Four were pretty to look at, I was growing ever more fretful at the increasing frequency of the unreadable glyphs. It seemed that the closer I came to the end of the guide, the more they seemed to creep up on me. The other unnerving detail of this section was the final entry depicting a very large bird. The five foot Kresht had brownish green feathers for camouflage, could reach speeds that surpassed the any other land creature thus far. It could certainly give you a run for your money. And it had a sharp beak for rending the flesh from its prey. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReading that, I was so freaked out I had to put the book down for a sec and take a look around. When I was satisfied by the unbothered stir of the forest and the still resting Gimp, I pulled my spear in a bit closer and uneasily resumed reading to Section Five. Looking back, I guess I failed to consider the distant warning cry of the zimzim; easily the brightest and loudest bird in all Naxia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was almost laughable that something as dreadful as the kresht could be followed up by the most adorable little mouse anyone had ever seen. At the time, I thought it was some kind of positive omen for the rest of the volume. Or rather, I tried to think of it that way. As I read through the remaining creatures, a sense of unease was growing in my gut, almost like I could feel time was running out.</span></div></div>",

I started to think that the book was teasing me and I still stand by that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat followed was a trio of predators of ever increasing size that made my heart run a marathon. The first resembled a gralder, except this one was twice as large and had wings. Next came the Droms; aka, those giant dogs that I saved you from. The third and final beast was some manner of big cat with long fangs extending below the roof of its mouth. My heart might have exploded out of my chest were it not for the suspiciously glaring fact that all of these large predators were situated in and around Naxia\u2019s Teeth, all the way at the opposite end of the map.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph paused and looked up for a moment. \u201cIn fact, almost all of the larger animals seemed to make their home in the top two thirds of the map; a most puzzling phenomenon that I couldn\u2019t help but ponder.

Unlike you who, by your own statement, was dropped off in the \u2018least threatening part of the forest\u2019; I was left to fend for myself within Naxia\u2019s Teeth, the most dangerous region in the land.

He wore thick fur garments that vaguely resembled the fur of the big cat with the saber teeth. His body was hunched over as he stalked through the forest. In his right hand he gripped a spear with some kind of stone tip tied to the end.

If I remember correctly, it described the creature as an Utek, or Panthera Sapien. It also said that this giant cat was more physically powerful than any human on record with the exception of three, and then came more glyphs. Wonder who they might have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia gave a light chuckle at his words. Joseph decided not to push the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn-between the glyphs were all kinds of useless footnotes; a lot of which included it enormous size and weight.

My attention was focused on the second appearance of a second picture in a single entry. Damn that thing was freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seemed like an unremarkable sketch of some kind of dark rock partially hidden behind layers of a familiar batch of long grass. After pondering this for a few seconds, I finally realized where I had seen it before and turned back to the Volume on plants. I skimmed through the pages a bit before finally finding it. It was little more than a photo of a common kind of grass called Emel. I was holding the pages with his left thumb and forefinger so I could hold my place. I flipped back and forth between them in an effort to compare the two images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe image in the plant Volume, like every other picture in the guide, was a photograph. While the Volume Five version was the one and only sketch, and a pretty well drawn sketch at that. As I continued to stare at the sketch trying to deduce its purpose, I gradually became aware of two small yellow blotches on the rock. Pulling the book closer, the blotches becoming ever clearer, I at last he noticed their symmetric positions and shapes. As I drew the book ever closer to my face, I was able to make out lines that seemed to take the shape of a nose. From there an image of a face was formed, followed soon after by teeth, a lower jaw and a crouching body. But always I kept going back to those yellow hypnotic cat eyes.\u201d Joseph\u2019s heart continued to race just as it had done that very day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sudden nearby rustle caused me to jump. I fumbled to recapture the loose book, but to no avail. Turning to the source of the sound, I saw that Gimp had woken from her nap. She was sitting up, her ears perked, fur standing on end, and eyes glued somewhere off in front of her and I. As I stared at her, at last it dawned on me that the forest was dead silent. Not a chirp, squawk, or squeak for miles. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTurning my head to face the same direction as Gimp, I immediately noticed a small rustle in a patch of Emel not 30 meters in front of me.

How the hell would you have felt?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia crunched her brow. \u201cI felt scared. If you recall, I was no older than you are now when I first woke up in this place. My early years were filled with running, escaping, and glares from hungry predators. It wasn\u2019t until much later that I became strong enough not to run.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph calmed down and continued. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what I was looking at. But I wasn\u2019t exactly in a thinking state of mind. Those eyes\u2026 it felt like they were swallowing me alive. I might have stayed lost in those eyes if it weren\u2019t for Gimp. And you\u2019ll never guess what she did,\u201d Joseph said sarcastically. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh I don\u2019t know\u201d Felecia answered acerbically with a false smile. \u201cDid she do the only intelligent thing and run away?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah\u201d Joseph exhaled. \u201cI heard a rustle from where she was lying which broke me out of that trance. It took me a bit but the sound of claws scraping against wood forced me to look up. The bitch was half way up the damn tree by then. Course, in her position, guess I would\u2019 a done the same.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI quickly faced forward again to see if the Utek had come any closer. It hadn\u2019t. It just stayed in the long grass in what I assume was a crouching position, ready to spring up and pounce on me in a second. Fortunately, I knew better than to get myself trapped in its eyes again. I glanced down hastily and immediately remembered the spear. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe gears started winding in my head. The Utek outmatched me in strength, speed, and size, but there was a chance that I had a superior intellect. I could use my small size and low center of gravity to my advantage. If I could manage to get the spear in just the right position, then it might be possible to use the beast\u2019s own momentum against it; essentially I would make the Utek impale itself. It wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but I knew that it was my only chance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlacing my hand just over the spear, I looked back up and faced the Utek. I guess my expression gave away the fact that I had a plan, because it was then that the Utek decided to show herself. It wasn\u2019t her full height mind you, but the grass she stood in, the grass that could conceal my stomach, barely brushed her elbows. Disregarding this I grasped the spear in my hand and got to my feet. I turned backwards for all of a full second before I found a suitable notch in the tree in which I could use as leverage for the spear. As I turned to face forward again, a short, heavy, warm gust hit my face. A dark fuzzy wall eclipsed my view as the air around me suddenly reeked of fresh animal carcasses. And when I looked up, all I could see was that giant maw surrounded by teeth.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Although I was close.\u201d The two shared a brief laugh together before Joseph resumed his tale. \u201cMy eyes slowly fell from that great maw. The beast\u2019s body covered in that dark violet, almost black fur. Finally I saw my spear. The tip was barely an inch away from her fur, and I\u2019d guess two inches from her skin. It must have been about here,\u201d Joseph said while pressing against the soft gap at the front of his collar bone, \u201cjust below the voice box, where the neck meets the torso. In theory, it should count as a weak spot on most creatures. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI knew I had her,\u201d Joseph said, recalling his racing heartbeat and tensed muscles. \u201cI knew we were at a stale mate. If she made the slightest move then I\u2019d un-lodge the spear\u2019s base and pierce her windpipe. She\u2019d probably have strength enough to give me a good swipe and take my head off before she died, but there was no way she\u2019d be able to survive a wound like that. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when I looked back up, past the teeth, into the beast\u2019s eyes. I looked for any sign of fear or hesitation; anything that might indicate that we could both walk away from this. I might as well have been trying to spot birds under the dirt. I don\u2019t want to say they were empty, but they were deep; as deep as the deepest sea and just as full.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s a sea?\u201d Felecia interrupted. \u201cYou were on a roll there and I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I\u2019ve never heard that term before.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naturally, Joseph was upset that his chain of thought had been broken, but that didn\u2019t make her question any less valid. Once he began thinking deeper into what he said and how he had said it, he gave silent gratitude to the gods that the light was dim enough to hide his blushing cheeks. After pondering for a few seconds, finding the best combination of words, Joseph was satisfied that he could give an adequate answer.</span></div></div>",

Joseph knew it was a dangerous gamble to pressure her, but he was confident that Felecia would blink before him. He gained a further confidence boost<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cit would be nice to know the context of what you said. I mean, is a sea really that deep and full? And besides\u201d she whimpered, pushing her bottom lip out, \u201cI wanted to know.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph cursed Felecia. He knew what she wanted to ask but wouldn\u2019t. After finally finding the section in the book that talks about the sea, the only answer he could give to the unasked question was \u2018yes\u2019. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d Joseph responded, turning around to face Felecia. \u201cEyes as deep and full as the sea does mean beautiful.\u201d He looked down at the open pages of the book as he walked back to his place at her side. \u201cThe passage goes on and on about how the sea sparkles. \u2018Billions of fish in millions of colors can make the sea indistinguishable from a living rainbow.\u2019 Shame there aren\u2019t any in Naxia. Guess I\u2019ll just have to make do with something just as good. \u201cJoseph smiled. He knew that he had blinked first, but wasn\u2019t too sore about his loss.</span></div></div>",

They're durable enough to be stepped on and even survive stomach acid, but not invincible. Based on the story by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2198917-Minizora-Mayhem\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper had had an eventful last few hours to say the least. After being dropped off by their folks in this tourist trap town, he and his sister Mabel had a bit of an incident. And by incident, he\u2019s obviously referring to Mabel being kidnapped and almost forced into marriage with 1,000 gnomes, followed by an epic chase in a golf cart from a composite gnome monster, and ending with the defeat of said monster with a leaf blower. However, now that the adrenaline had fallen and they were up in the attic for the evening, Dipper took greater interest with his initial big discovery: a mysterious journal with a six fingered hand on the cover. Of particular interest to the three inch tall boy was that the book was sized to minizora like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ch\u2019ya readin\u2019 there, bro-bro?\u201d asked Mabel. The regular sized twelve year old was hanging upside down off the edge of her bed. She wore her usual purple sleeping sweater as her feet kicked idly in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe journal about the mysteries of Gravity Falls,\u201d Dipper explained. \u201cYou know, the one I showed you a few hours ago back when I thought the gnomes were actually a zombie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gave a snorting laugh. \u201cYeah. Great job being the smart twin. Can\u2019t even tell the difference between gnomes and zombies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper narrowed his eyes on his sister. \u201cOh yeah? Well you followed a strange guy you\u2019d only just met out into the woods where anything could have happened! Honestly, it turning out to be gnomes was pretty lucky on your end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault! I thought he was a vampire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that makes it better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel folded her arms and turned away in a huff, still upside-down. \u201cI won\u2019t even dignify that with a response.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been out in the sun all day wearing only a hoodie,\u201d reminded Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe could be using super vampire sunblock. You don\u2019t know,\u201d Mabel whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, that makes literally no sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it does. In fact, I know how to settle this. You\u2019ve got a journal full of weird stuff, right? Go ahead and check.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gave a soft chuckle as he flipped through the pages. \u201cYou know, that was a lot more mature than what I was expecting from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean? I\u2019m super mature! I\u2019m the most maturest mature person to ever\u2026 mature! Also I\u2019m a girl, and everyone knows girls mature faster than boys,\u201d she finished with a dignified huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cRiiight. Mabel is sooo mature. She shops for teddy bear undies in the big girl isle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheeks flushed, Mabel\u2019s hands shot down (relative to her perspective) to cover her sweater over her unmentionables. \u201cYou saw nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Dipper said with a dismissive wave. \u201cYou and your\u2026 wait a minute.\u201d He stopped flipping through pages and brought the book up to his face. \u201cI found it! The section on vampires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me!\u201d Mabel tried to stand, but only managed to flip onto her face with a thud. \u201cOw. Ugh. Just read it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Well I\u2019ll be. It says here that vampires do sometimes use a super sunblock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ha!\u201d Mabel shot a fist up in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuut,\u201d Dipper continued, \u201cit\u2019s made of ingredients considered repugnant by vampires. If a vampire were actually using the stuff, they\u2019d also have to wear nose plugs so they don\u2019t gag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s arm fell limp. \u201cAh poo.\u201d Once she grew bored of lying on the floor, Mabel sat up and walked across the room to the side of Dipper\u2019s regular sized bed and planted her chin on the sheets. She looked down at him with curious and thoughtful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel,\u201d Dipper said warily as the big face loomed over him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing. Just thinking how lucky I am to have a little,\u201d she snickered, \u201cbrother like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ha-ha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean it. You\u2019re so tiny, but you still came after me even when you thought I was about to be eaten by a zombie. You also drove a golf cart like a total pro. How\u2019d you do that again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecially modified for minizora drivers,\u201d Dipper explained, trying to focus on his reading. Now that he\u2019d started, there were just so many interesting factoids about vampires he\u2019d never considered before. \u201cBesides, you\u2019d have done the same for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell duh! But that\u2019s different. You were in, like, way more danger than me back there. What if one of those creepy gnomes stepped on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been stepped on before. Not that big a deal,\u201d Dipper explained dismissively. \u201cAlso, I wasn\u2019t the target for what I assume to have been an attempted gang bang by said creepy gnomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel pouted cutely. \u201cYou\u2019re making it really hard to give a heartfelt thank you for saving my life, you know. You put your life on the line for me when you didn\u2019t have to, and that means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper finally closed the book. \u201cActually, I did have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when someone\u2019s driving and a rabbit runs out in the middle of the road. Technically they don\u2019t <i>have</i> to slow down and let the fluffy adorable critters live, but if they don\u2019t slow down, then they just end up feeling awful all day. I wasn\u2019t about to spend the rest of the summer feeling awful about myself, so there really wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes shimmering, Mabel shot out a giant hand and snatched up her diminutive brother and pressed him firmly against her cheek in her closest approximation of a hug. \u201cI love you Dipper. You\u2019re the best brother ever! I don\u2019t ever want to let you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a tapping from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, keep it down up there!\u201d groused the gruff voice of their Grunkle Stan. \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear what a couple of preteens are doing so late at night alone in their room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, gross!\u201d growled Mabel as she stomped the floor in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper began to laugh as Mabel continued to hold him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a half bad sister, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch it, bro-bro.\u201d Suddenly serious, Mabel pointed an accusing finger at Dipper. \u201cIf you make me mad, then I\u2019ll show you just how immature I can really be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Dipper asked in taunting. \u201cWell that would certainly be a change of pace.\u201d Even as Mabel fumed, Dipper couldn\u2019t help himself and laughed at her expense. As her brother, he had a moral imperative to tease her at every opportunity, regardless of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! If you like my teddy bear panties so much, then maybe you\u2019d like to get acquainted for the rest of the night,\u201d she warned, giving him a chance to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s eyebrow climbed up his forehead. \u201cYou realize that\u2019d just prove Grunkle Stan right, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIre gone, Mabel blinked like a deer caught in the headlights. \u201cShoot!\u201d She kicked impotently at the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s no fair. How can I be a good big sister and keep my little brother in line if I can\u2019t use my go-to for punishment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cAre you actually asking, or are you just thinking out loud? Because if the latter, can I get the journal back?\u201d He pointed back down at the bed. \u201cI dropped it when you grabbed me.\u201d When he caught a devious glint in his sister\u2019s eye, Dipper knew he had to act quickly. \u201cKeep in mind that this journal has all kinds of information regarding the dangerous secrets of this town. If it weren\u2019t for that thing, I might not have gone after you in the first place. If anything bad happens to that book, I might not be able to save you next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel deflated and blew a raspberry. \u201cDouble poo.\u201d She turned a longing eye on the mini boy in her hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything I can do to punish you?\u201d she pleaded pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re seriously asking <i>me</i> that?\u201d Were this anyone but Mabel, Dipper would be floored by the audacity of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019ve got some pretty good ideas sometimes. What\u2019s something I can do to assert myself as the dominant twin that doesn\u2019t cross the line into, you know, weirdness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s never bothered you before. I think I\u2019ve completed, like, half my homework while stuffed in your clothes somewhere.\u201d He gestured up and down her body. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s not even really a punishment. More like my second room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleaaase!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine. Let me think.\u201d Dipper tapped his chin in thought, silently cursing himself for being unable to resist his sister\u2019s cute antics. \u201cHmm. I guess we could\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After settling into this den of weirdness, Dipper and Mabel were in the Mystery Shack\u2019s dining room having just completed an epic syrup race. Mabel had won, much to her regret, and Dipper was reading the towns\u2019 newspaper; scaled down for minizora of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mabel. Look at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger \u2013 but not older \u2013 sibling peered down at the tiny article. \u201cHuman sized hamster ball. Wait a minute\u2026 I\u2019m human sized!\u201d She sucked in a shocked breath. \u201cAnd so are you! But with a regular hamster ball. We can be hamster ball twins!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes and pointed to what he actually wanted to show her. It was a contest for photos of monsters. The winner got $1000. \u201cWe see weirder stuff than that every day. Did we get any photos of those gnomes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Just memories.\u201d Mabel waited a second before holding up a tuft of white hair. \u201cAnd this beard hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you save that?\u201d asked Dipper, backing away in revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of revulsion, that was when Grunkle Stan came in dressed in a pair of boxers and a night shirt with stains that were better left not thought about. The old man wanted to close the shop early and have a bonding day with the family. He promised that this would be nothing like the last time in which they made counterfeit money, which was followed up by a trip to the freezing county jail. With assurances like that, how could they refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a harrowing blindfolded drive across town, the twins were finally allowed to uncover their eyes and behold the lake, where apparently fishing season had opened. Said lake was positively lousy with the town\u2019s colorful denizens doing all sorts of wacky antics. Watching some of the rougher antics led to Mabel grabbing Dipper and setting him on her shoulder for safe keeping. But just as Grunkle Stan was finishing his less than stellar sales pitch for fishing for the next ten hours, that\u2019s when another old man started going off about some monster called the Gobblewonker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Mabel cooed. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a happy jig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when old man McGucket grabbed her shoulders and started screaming. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a jig of grave danger!\u201d warned the guy who had earned the title of town kook. He gave a far more convincing pitch for why the gobblewonker was real, pointing a boat that looked to have been bitten in half and offering a pretty detailed description of the creature. Alas, everyone else was entirely dismissive of his claims and soon the crowd dispersed, including his own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, did you hear what he said?\u201d Dipper asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, donkey spittle,\u201d she said in approximation of the old man\u2019s funny way of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the other thing. The monster. If we can snag a photo, we can split the prize fifty-fifty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s two fifties!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine what you could do with $500,\u201d Dipper encouraged, not bothering to correct her math. He then sat back as his sister\u2019s pupils went wide. Clearly she\u2019d been kidnapped by her own imagination again and it was just a matter of waiting for her to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper. I am one million percent on board with this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Grunkle Stan delivered an inferior sales pitch for fishing, although this time he lost to Soos who\u2019d just driven up in a far superior boat. It wasn\u2019t a hard choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna find that gobblewonker!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna win that prize!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the excitement tempered a bit, the team of a pair of twins and the pair shaped chipmunk faced guy set about their plan. They\u2019d gone and bought an excessive amount of disposable cameras, which made a lot of sense given that none of them wanted to risk their expensive phones. As the boat neared Scuttlebutt Island, an ominous fog descended upon them. The island itself was just as creepy, but spirits were still high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you carry him around with you everywhere?\u201d Soos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel shrugged. \u201cNot everywhere. Just most wheres. Hehe. Saves him the trouble of getting lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, lost? You once got lost on the way to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is that it\u2019s just easier this way,\u201d Mabel insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s like a knight riding atop his elegant and beautiful steed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d agreed Dipper. \u201cThe real steed\u2019s at the shop for repairs, so they gave me this,\u201d he gestured with his thumb, \u201ccheap rental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. Good one, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheap? I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m about to be a five hundred-naire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well so am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy to tag along,\u201d Soos offered. \u201cSpeaking of tagging, I\u2019ve never really known a minizora before. What\u2019s it like being so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible. No matter what I do, I can always look up people\u2019s noses and see the horrors that lie within.\u201d That got everyone chuckling. \u201cBut seriously, it\u2019s not too bad. It doesn\u2019t hurt that I\u2019ve got a nice steed to take me places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee. He admits I\u2019m a steed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just easier than saying rented mule-ow!\u201d Dipper groaned as his head was pinched. \u201cSomebody help! A pair of sausage fingers are crushing my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure that\u2019s safe, dude?\u201d Soos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he\u2019s fine,\u201d assured Mabel. \u201cFirst day here that lumberjack guy stepped on him and he just walked it off. This,\u201d she tightened her pinch, \u201cis nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper finally stopped yelling, showing that he was just putting on a show. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s right. There\u2019s a reason so many stunt men are minizora, you know. We can handle just about anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything,\u201d Dipper affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much can you bench-press?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI once saw him lift up a whole pizza crust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, dude. You\u2019re like a super hero. Got the proportionate strength of an ant, only you\u2019re already pretty small, so it\u2019s not that impressive, but it\u2019s still pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Thanks a lot, Soos,\u201d Dipper said, feeling genuinely moved. Part of why he was the bookish type was because most kids his own age just made fun of him for being small. It was a refreshing change of pace to actually hear praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel grinned from ear-to-ear. She\u2019d already liked Soos. They got each other\u2019s humor. But in seeing how nice he was to Dipper, Mabel knew she\u2019d made a new friend for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when a roar echoed through the woods. Birds were sent cawing in terror as the team finally had a direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it. This is it!\u201d Dipper said in whispered excitement. Still sitting on his sister\u2019s shoulder, he kicked at her through her sweater and urged her onward. \u201cYa, mule! Ya-ya, mule!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude. That\u2019d be so offensive\u2026 if it weren\u2019t so hilariously accurate,\u201d commented Soos as he grabbed a long and sharp stick. Perfect for stabbing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, it all turned out to be a false alarm. What looked like the gobblewonker through the fog was really just a derelict rotted out boat covered in cute beavers. And what sounded like the gobblewonker was actually an old chainsaw engine being messed with by a beaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 I was so sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there, little bro,\u201d consoled Mabel, petting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. At least we got to see a beaver with a chainsaw. That\u2019s pretty sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that old guy was crazy after all.\u201d Dipper slumped on his slumping seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did use the word \u2018scrap-doodle\u2019,\u201d Mabel agreed, just as despondent. While Soos was preoccupied with the beaver, the preteen girl decided to make some distance to give her brother some \u2018alone\u2019 time; which of course meant that she stuck nearby at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sucks. We didn\u2019t find the gobblewonker, and what are we gonna say to Grunkle Stan? We ditched him over nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s pretty bad,\u201d agreed Mabel. \u201cHe seemed really excited just to hang out with us and we left him high and dry\u2026 in that dinky little boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel. Did you feel-whoa!\u201d Dipper slipped, but thankfully caught himself on Mabel\u2019s lifejacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Mabel screamed, pointing out into the water where something big was swimming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d cheered Dipper, pulling out one of their last few cameras. \u201cI just have to-agh. Mabel, hold still. I can\u2019t get a good shot with you moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, dude,\u201d intoned Soos worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the few seconds since Dipper had taken his eyes off the lake, the gobblewonker had come up to the shore, rose it\u2019s long neck out of the water, and loomed menacingly over the trio. And then, just as Dipper turned back around, it roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuuun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn complete disregard to logic, the aquatic gobblewonker flopped its mighty frame onto land and used its flippers to give chase after the trio. Dipper couldn\u2019t run on his own, but he could stare into the jaws of death and warn the others where and when trees were falling on them. And while Soos was able to get them to the boat, the gobblewonker just hopped back in the water, where it was significantly faster. What followed was an exciting chase across the lake, overturning many boats and causing general mayhem. Grunkle Stan would have found it hilarious, were he not on the business end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! Beavers!\u201d cried Mabel as beavers began raining down on the boat. With their home just destroyed, the little fuzz balls were understandably agitated and were biting at anything they could reach. \u201cAhh! My brother!\u201d Before one of the overgrown rats could chomp the little guy, Mabel beat him to it and stuffed Dipper in her mouth for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hardly a new experience for Dipper. He\u2019d been eaten by his sister more times than he could count, though usually it was under less life threatening circumstances. The air was humid, Mabel had apparently forgotten to brush this morning, and saliva was creeping into his clothes. Keeping her lips shut, Mabel was still screaming as Dipper bounced around on the soft tongue. In a brief respite, he caught himself thinking that this wouldn\u2019t be so bad if only he weren\u2019t wearing sticky clingy clothes, but that was neither here nor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a flashlight, Dipper opened the journal and quickly searched for anything related to the gobblewonker, but instead found a very interesting map of the lake. He tapped at Mabel\u2019s teeth and signaled her to open her mouth. She did, screaming as she\u2019d taken over the steering after Soos had been incapacitated by a beaver. \u201cHead for the waterfall!\u201d Dipper instructed as he clung to the tongue for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel did, and everyone braced themselves for the worst. Fortunately, the journal proved true. There was a cave on the other side. Even better, it was too small for the gobblewonker, rendering it stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s stuck!\u201d Dipper cheered, patting himself down within his sister\u2019s maw. \u201cWait, I don\u2019t have any more cameras!\u201d he exclaimed in a sudden panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah.\u201d Mabel extended her tongue with her brother upon it and removed his hat, where he still had one tiny camera left. How lucky were they to find a place that sold tiny cameras? \u201cZare,\u201d she said helpfully with her tongue still occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed with elation, Dipper danced around on the tongue as he ran through the entire roll of film. \u201cThis is it! We finally got the picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Mabel also cheered, ignoring the taste of fabric. It was more fun to play with a naked brother in her mouth than a clothed one. This would be important information to consider for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while everyone was cheering, the gobblewonker\u2019s flailing caused a light cave in, leading to a large rock crushing its head and making some odd metallic sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d Mabel started to ask. \u201cAhh, Dipper!\u201d She reached out, but the little guy was already hopping down the cliff with the speed of a goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Quick little dude, ain\u2019t he,\u201d observed Soos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Mabel grumbled irritably. She hated when Dipper ran away from her, especially towards something so obviously dangerous. Her own efforts to follow were slower and more careful. Oh, Dipper was going to pay for making her worry like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, come check this out,\u201d Dipper called from atop the creatures back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they\u2019d arrived, they found one of those spinning door cranks. It was on Mabel and Soos to open it up, revealing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld man McGucket!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town kook was at some kind of control panel. It was defunct now, but clearly he\u2019d been piloting the gobblewonker. As it turned out, he\u2019d built this behemoth killing machine because he felt neglected and wanted some attention, especially from his family. While even he admitted that it was pretty contrived, his story did move the kids to sympathy for their own old person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, they all decided to make up with and spend the rest of the day with their favorite Grunkle. Fishing turned out to be a lot of fun. Even fleeing the lake police was enjoyable. All was well, except that there was an old man in a cave with a history of building death machines and the stated intent of making a death ray. Not to mention that Dipper never finished reading the lake segment of the journal, which had a good many pages devoted to the real life gobblewonker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun set and the day concluded, the Pines family and Soos departed the lake for their respective homes. Mabel held Dipper in her lap all the while, wondering how she was going to deal with her brother\u2019s reckless behavior.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following dinner at the Mystery Shack, Dipper and Mabel decided to wash up before heading to bed; especially Dipper who was all too eager to discard his saliva drenched clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mabel, could you get a cup of water or something?\u201d asked the naked twelve year old of his undressing twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Standing in the bathroom, Mabel was down to just a pair of blue panties. She stared at her tiny naked brother, free of any sense of shame. They\u2019d been bathing together since they were born, so the sight of the other\u2019s naked body was nothing new to either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just I don\u2019t want these,\u201d Dipper gestured to the clothes in his arms, \u201cto dry and get all crusty before they can get washed. You know what crusty clothes are like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Only cuz you won\u2019t shut up about it,\u201d grumbled Mabel as she picked up the pile of garments and reached over the sink to ready a glass of water. This brought her bare and underdeveloped chest awfully close to her brother, but Dipper\u2019s eyes were on something more important than her little nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong, Mabel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. Of course not!\u201d She kicked at the carpet. \u201cWhy would you think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper cringed. \u201cOh, you know, no reason. Just being a concerned brother is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConcerned brother, huh? Is that what you call it when you leave me behind and run straight towards a giant monster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, give me a break. I was curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurious, huh? Curiosity killed the cat, Dipper!\u201d she said like it was some scathing accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my defense, a giant rock just fell on the thing\u2019s head. It was either dead or concussed. Either way, I\u2019m too small to be looked at as prey. I was perfectly safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing safe about giant sea monsters, <i>little</i> Dipper. You could have been hurt. Do you have any idea how worried I was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was taken aback when he caught his sister sniffling. Her eyes glistened before she turned her back on him. He reached out for her. \u201cMabel\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a shower,\u201d she huffed, slipping off her panties and discarding them to the side. Her immense hair shielded the back of her body as she marched off to the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh, Dipper turned back to the sink. He\u2019d have preferred to shower with his sister like usual, but there were accommodations in the nozzles for a minizora to handle, so at least he could pour himself a steamy bath. The little boy dove in like it was a pool and swam around idly. Every now and then he\u2019d turn to the silhouette of his sister in the shower, but she said nothing. She wasn\u2019t even singing the latest awful boyband hit, but the only thing more awful than that was the ongoing silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Mabel,\u201d Dipper called, but got no answer. He heaved a sigh. \u201cLook Mabel, I\u2019m sorry I made you worry, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being very fair right now. We were <i>both</i> in danger you know. How do you think I felt with everyone running for their lives and me being able to do nothing to help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Mabel tossed the shower curtain aside and turned the water off. \u201cThat\u2019s not your job, Dipper. I\u2019m the <i>big</i> sister, so that means I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, right there!\u201d Dipper accused. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s not fair. We\u2019re twins, but you\u2019re always putting it on yourself to protect me even though I\u2019m just as worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept it is. That whole gnome debacle could have been avoided if you\u2019d just listened to me from the start. I tried letting you do things on your own, and look where that got us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel scoffed in disbelief. \u201cSo what? You want to be the big sibling and look after me from now on? Ha! I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s unfair of you to think you\u2019re the only one that gets worried. You\u2019re my sister and I want to see you safe, but I still let you go out and make your own mistakes. I don\u2019t smother you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel blinked. Dripping naked, she stepped out of the shower and over to the sink. \u201cIs that how you feel about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sheepish, Dipper grabbed his arm and averted his gaze. \u201cSometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess it was kind of unfair of me to forget that you get just as worried as I do,\u201d Mabel conceded. \u201cAnd maaaybe I overreacted just a tad this time with the gobblewonker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot during the attack, though. Only after,\u201d Dipper corrected. \u201cWhen that thing was after us, you actually listened to me. You trusted me to make the right call and that\u2019s what pulled us through.\u201d He reached out and motioned for Mabel to come down to his level. She did, lowering her chin to the counter and extending a hand; whichever he\u2019d prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper went for Mabel\u2019s cheek and gave it an affectionate pat. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that you trust me a bit more. Trust me like I trust you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sniffled and stroked a finger down Dipper\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m still going to be worried about you, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I could stop you,\u201d chuckled Dipper. \u201cHey, you forgot to tell Soos the whole story with the lumberjack guy. You know, where you started attacking him like you had rabies or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled. \u201cHey, I was just trying to teach him a lesson about watching his step.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnimal control was called and the guy\u2019s shoes were ruined,\u201d Dipper deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel sighed fondly. \u201cYeah. I think I hate the taste of shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone does, Mabel. But you\u2019re one of the few people who takes the time to make sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming contentedly, Mabel picked her little brother up and carried him to the shower. \u201cWant to join me?\u201d she asked while stepping back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Though Dipper just expected their typical mutual wash, his sister had something else in mind as she casually tossed him in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh yesh,\u201d Mabel said through her mouthful. Naked Dipper was so much better than clothed Dipper. She couldn\u2019t quite put a name on his flavor. She\u2019d licked skin before, her own and that of others, but in those cases it had been tasteless at best and gag inducing at normal. But with Dipper, there was just some intangible quality that made him absolutely delicious. She was content to just chalk it up to being another minizora thing and leave it at that, but for right now she had the more pressing priority of running her tongue over every square inch of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel licked over Dipper\u2019s face, feeling him smile. She licked under his armpits, which made him thrash about from being tickled. Over his butt got a similar result, but by far the most exquisite part of her brother\u2019s body was his groin. Somehow that tiny penis and pair of balls had the strongest flavor of any part of him. And when she devoted special attention there, she giggled at how he grew erect. She loved how she could do this to him. For all their talk of trust and respect, Mabel would never relinquish the power of being the <i>big</i> sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the moist maw, Dipper was moaning as he was pelted on all sides by soft flesh. When it was just his bare skin, the stickiness didn\u2019t bother him as much. In fact, he rather enjoyed being in his sister\u2019s mouth. He enjoyed being played with, of being tossed around and toyed with. Mabel knew all the right ways to touch him that just felt so incredible. And now that she was focusing on his penis, the little boy cried out in rapture as he bucked his hips into the slimy organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel continued her affectionate tongue bath until she\u2019d achieved her reward. A tiny but potent sprits of sweet and sour flavoring. It was the perfect dessert after a long day of monster hunting, a treasure that was hers alone to enjoy. She hummed, continuing to toss her brother around her mouth until finally that extra special flavor disappeared and she spat him back out. \u201cHave fun?\u201d she beamed, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting from his ordeal in Mabel\u2019s hands, Dipper looked up and gave a weak-armed thumbs up. This was their way of saying that all was forgiven. From there they got cleaned up properly, dressed for the night, and went to bed. All was as it should be, with not a care in the world devoted to the old man and his death ray, nor the mysterious triangular constellation that briefly appeared in the night\u2019s sky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the TV room, Dipper sat on his sister\u2019s shoulder while they ate popcorn and watched the latest episode of Ducktective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat duck is a genius,\u201d awed Mabel as she went through the motions of giving a single corn to her shoulder occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper shrugged, unimpressed. \u201cEh. It\u2019s easier to find clues when you\u2019re that close to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking from experience?\u201d teased Mabel as she poked him in the gut. \u201cLike you could actually outwit Ducktective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I have very keen powers of observation,\u201d Dipper boasted. \u201cFor example: Just from smelling your breath, I know that you\u2019ve been eating\u2026 an entire tube of toothpaste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was so sparkly,\u201d Mabel confessed, sounding just a bit sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dudes. You\u2019ll never guess what I just found!\u201d declared Soos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBur-\u201d Dipper was silenced by a finger over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuried treasure!\u201d exclaimed Mabel. \u201cHa. I win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the \u2018buried treasure\u2019 was a secret door hidden behind the wallpaper. Within was a room filled with wax dummies of various historical figures. Grunkle Stan told the story of how he\u2019d \u2018purchased\u2019 the figures years ago, but then locked them in here after the wax museum stopped being profitable, and also he\u2019d just forgotten about them. When it was discovered that wax Abraham Lincoln had melted, Mabel had jumped at the chance to remake it into something new. When being offered free labor to resurrect an old and potentially profitable attraction, Stan was all too happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Dipper was enjoying a rare instance of independence without being carried around by Mabel. It felt good to stretch his legs and do little things like get his own soda. Walking down the hall, he was enjoying a few sips when Mabel sprung out of nowhere, causing him to drop his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, I have to show you my ideas.\u201d She held up a sketchbook. \u201cShe\u2019s part fairy princess, and part horse fairy princess,\u201d she described of the abominable centaur monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmaybe you should carve something from real life,\u201d Dipper suggested, not wanting to crush his sister\u2019s artistic dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of trial and error, but eventually Mabel settled on sculpting a very special member of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, dude. Your sister\u2019s, like, really good at this,\u201d Soos commented from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Once she gets in one of these artsy moods, basically nothing can stop her.\u201d Then Dipper got an idea. \u201cHey, Soos. I\u2019ll pay you five bucks to go in there and tell her to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoos glowered down at the little dude. \u201cDude, I\u2019m no Albert Einstein, but I\u2019m not stupid. I heard the full story of what happened to Manly Dan and there ain\u2019t no way I\u2019m sticking my hand in a fish tank filled with piranha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper chuckled. \u201cYeah, fair point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater still, there was a big ceremony for the reopening of the wax museum. At the ticket booth, Dipper sat alongside Wendy. She was the fifteen year old ginger who worked the Shack\u2019s counter most days. Her body was leanly built with well-defined muscle, a modest chest for her age, and a rump that was nothing to scoff at. She had a fondness for flannel shirts and wore a fur hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was pretending not to notice the afore mentioned details as he sat in a tiny chair on the table. Technically his job was to guard the money jar, but he had the feeling that he was actually being used as just another oddity to attract customers. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how many people showed up for this. It looks like half the town is here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right,\u201d agreed Wendy in her usual laidback demeanor. She was also pretending not to notice Dipper. She\u2019d never seen a minizora before and there was something about this little cutie that kept drawing her eye. \u201cFolks around here must be super bored. Either that or Stan bribed them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper unfurled a green bill from his jacket. \u201cHe bribed me.\u201d Wendy pulled out her own bill and they shared a laugh. This was nice. Aside from his mother and sister, Dipper had never really hung out with a girl before, especially not one this pretty. It wasn\u2019t weird that he thought she was pretty, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the unveiling finally got underway, it was tragically met with a lukewarm response from the audience. Fortunately, Mabel was not so easily deterred. \u201cThank you all for coming. I made this sculpture with my own two hands. It\u2019s covered in my blood, sweat, tears, and other fluids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the audience gagged at the implications, Wendy stole a wary glance at Dipper. Reluctantly, the minizora nodded that this was the case, to which Wendy commented, \u201cHehe, gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will now take questions!\u201d Mabel announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld man McGucket. Local kook,\u201d he introduced himself. \u201cAre the wax figures alive and \u2013 follow-up question \u2013 can I survive the wax man uprising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 yes! Next question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more questions followed before Shandra Jimenez spoke up. In this one horse town, she was considered the only \u2018real\u2019 reporter. She was Hispanic with dark skin, high cheek bones, and one of the finest bodies in all of Gravity Falls. \u201cYour flyer promised free pizza with admission to this event. Is this true?\u201d Despite her dispassionate tone, this questions seemed to wake the audience up as everyone was up in arms. Literally. Some people had actually brought pickaxes and pitchforks to a wax museum opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis probably isn\u2019t good,\u201d Wendy observed, bracing herself to run. She then remembered her table companion and suddenly felt awkward. Was it okay to pick up a minizora without asking, even in an emergency? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Stan dismissed what had apparently been the primary interest of the audience and attempted to flee with the money. This in turn led to a small riot in which chairs were thrown and poles were punched. Wendy, ever a girl of action, snatched Dipper off the table, stowed him in her breast pocket, and ferried him out of the danger zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper wasn\u2019t too worried about his predicament. He\u2019d been picked up by strangers before, but Wendy wasn\u2019t exactly a stranger. She\u2019d never been overtly hostile and generally treated him with better courtesy than she did most patrons of the Shack. The inside of her breast pocket was hot and the fabric was a little itchy. It also smelled. Dipper knew that there was only one thing he could be smelling at this time and wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! No punching the banner poles!\u201d Mabel snapped, pointing at Manly Dan the lumberjack. As soon as the pair\u2019s eye\u2019s met, the man who resembled a shaved red yeti decided to be anywhere but near that sack of adorable crazy. Once the audience dispersed, Mabel casually walked over to Wendy and with her eternal cheerfulness, held out her hand in a gi-me gesture. Wendy obliged and surrendered the tiny twin. \u201cI think that went well,\u201d Mabel commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yeah,\u201d agreed Wendy. \u201cCompared to how these things usually go, there\u2019s almost no damage. Oh, and sorry little dude,\u201d she said to Dipper. \u201cFor picking you up without asking, I mean. It was kind of a spur of the moment thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey,\u201d Dipper laughed nervously. \u201cIt was no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot big, but adequate sized,\u201d Mabel commented to the confusion of the others. \u201cYou acted quick and decisive, prioritizing safety over personal autonomy. And for that, you have my respect.\u201d She extended her other hand, which Wendy happily shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s\u2026 unsettlingly authoritarian, but whatever.\u201d The red head shrugged. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want the little guy hurt is all. Oh well.\u201d She set her hands on her hips and surveyed the mess. \u201cLooks like a lot of work to do. Think I\u2019ll clock out early.\u201d And she beat a lazy retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel grinned as she watched the taller girl go. \u201cI like her.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, Dipper and Mabel were upstairs brushing their teeth. Mabel had just suggested a tooth brush race when they heard the cries of horror from downstairs. Being a couple of twelve year olds who\u2019d already faced down two horrifying monsters in less than a week, they decided to run towards the sound of danger. That\u2019s where they found the source of the commotion. Wax Stan had been murdered via decapitation and his head was nowhere to be found. It was so gruesome that Mabel fainted; (accidentally) crushing Dipper under her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police arrived in short order, given that this was probably the biggest criminal activity they\u2019d seen in weeks. Even so, the sheriff seemed reluctant to even do minimal investigation, so Dipper volunteered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Dipper,\u201d squeed Mabel, hugging him to her cheek. \u201cI knew I could count on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well would you look at what we got in here,\u201d taunted Sheriff Blubs. \u201cCity boy gonna solve the mystery with his fancy computer phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCity boooy!\u201d called the deputy. \u201cCity boooy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are adorable,\u201d Blubs added, leading the both of them to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdorable?\u201d Dipper asked. He\u2019d been called a lot of names over his life and had learned to shrug off most of them, but for some reason this one really dug under his skin. When the cops left, Dipper was filled with righteous indignation. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Mabel, you and me are going to find out who did this and get back that head. Then they\u2019ll see who\u2019s adorable,\u201d he snarled, trying to look as tough as possible. Then he sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. You sneeze like a kitten,\u201d Mabel cooed, finding his wrathful glare all the more endearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the investigation was underway. The twins were taking photos for evidence, compiling a list of suspects, and consulting the journal for anything supernatural that might be related. Yet it was Mabel who found the first clue in the form of shoeprints in the shag carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang. How did I miss that?\u201d Dipper grumbled. \u201cSo much for being closer to the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome things you can only see from high up,\u201d Mabel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. The point is that these shoeprints have a hole in the left shoe. That\u2019s pretty unusual. And they lead to\u2026\u201d An axe was found just behind the chair. Dipper just glowered at the axe for a solid few seconds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here literally five minutes and already found the murder weapon, but a couple of \u2018professional\u2019 cops didn\u2019t do jack,\u201d Dipper ranted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, maybe they were tired,\u201d Mabel excused. \u201cOr, you know, I hear towns like these include playing FPS games as part of their police exams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned. \u201cNow it feels like I\u2019m racing against someone without arms or legs.\u201d He then slapped himself for daring to pity the enemy. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve still got a mystery to solve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter conversing with Soos, the axe was connected to Manly Dan, who frequented an intense biker joint downtown. Soos also tried coining the term \u2018mystery twins\u2019, but Dipper was in no mood for cute names. Grunkle Stan, upon seeing the kids with an axe and plans on confronting the possible murderer, cheered them on to \u201cAvenge meee!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper was suffering an increasingly low opinion of the town\u2019s collective IQ after Mabel\u2019s fake IDs actually got them into the bar. Inside there were all manner of ruffians punching one another for no discernable reason. Still the picture of perkiness, Mabel deposited Dipper in her sweater collar and attempted to hold him close. However, much to her consternation, he wiggled free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Mabel. We talked about this already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow? You want to go off and do your own thing <i>here</i> of all places?\u201d When Dipper just crossed his arms and impatiently tapped his foot, Mabel gave a conceding groan. \u201cOkay, fine. But if you get stepped or sat on, that\u2019s on you.\u201d And they split up. Dipper went straight for Manly Dan while Mabel decided to destress by chatting up a very tattooed and burly man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cManly Dan, just the guy I wanted to see,\u201d Dipper greeted, trying to look tough as he stood on the arm wrestling machine Dan was playing. \u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPunching the clock,\u201d growled the lumberjack, sounding like he was perpetually on the verge of going into a blood rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were at work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was punching that clock.\u201d He pointed out the window to a clock atop a crooked post. \u201cIt offended me with its incessant ticking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen o\u2019 clock, the time of the murder,\u201d Dipper mumbled. He then regretted not bringing Mabel along as he dragged the axe over for inspection. \u201cSo I guess you\u2019ve never seen this before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here, little girl,\u201d Dan barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, actually-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t pick my teeth with that axe. It\u2019s left handed. I only use my right hand.\u201d He demonstrated this by ripping the arm off of the machine. \u201cThe MANLY hand!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Manly Dan proceeded to beat the snot out of what remained of the machine, Dipper backed away, feeling that he\u2019d been sufficiently emasculated for one day. He caught up with Mabel doing some weird school yard fortune telling thing and gave her the update. They just had to run through the list of suspects and see who was left handed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that proved easier said than done. One montage later and it turned out that there wasn\u2019t a single leftie in the whole town. Even when the twins thought they\u2019d cornered someone, they learned far more than they ever wanted about Toby Determined. They did get an extra clue that the axe had no prints at all, but that just deepened the mystery. Worse, the cops laughed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, the twins returned to the Mystery Shack to attend the funeral of Wax Stan. It was a tasteful ceremony held in the wax figures\u2019 old room with all of their lifeless forms in attendance. To Soos and Stan it looked like the twins were down about the murder, but they were mourning another loss as the adults left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose cops were right about me,\u201d Dipper grumbled in Mabel\u2019s lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Dipper,\u201d Mabel encouraged, petting Dipper with one hand and holding the axe in another. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far. We can\u2019t give up now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed, hopped down to the floor, and headed for the casket. \u201cBut I considered everything. The weapon, the motive, the clues\u2026\u201d He climbed up to get one last look at the dearly departed, where he noticed something odd. \u201cHmm. Wax Stan\u2019s shoe has a hole in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the wax guys have that,\u201d Mabel explained plainly. \u201cIt\u2019s where the pole thingy attaches to their stand dealies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat has holes in its shoes and no finger prints?\u201d It didn\u2019t take much before Dipper\u2019s eyes went wide and his pulse quickened. \u201cUh, Mabel!\u201d he whispered in alarm. \u201cI think the murderers are-\u201d</span></div></div>",

Naturally, Mabel responded by immediately pulling her brother close for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations my two amateur sleuths. You uncovered the truth,\u201d patronized the detective. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re going to bury you.\u201d He pointed his magnifying glass like a weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 how is this possible? You\u2019re made of wax,\u201d asserted Dipper in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 magic?\u201d asked Mabel, giving in to her girlish wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic. She wants to know if we\u2019re magic?\u201d mocked Wax Sherlock before slamming his fist on the casket. \u201cWe\u2019re cursed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCursed!\u201d echoed the other figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCursed to come to life whenever the moon is waxing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry to interrupt, but that doesn\u2019t sound like a curse,\u201d Dipper piped up. \u201cCurses have more of a negative implication. Like if you were the real guys who were turned into wax. That\u2019d be a curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d agreed Mabel. \u201cBeing able to come to life sounds like a blessing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock, unable to think up a counterargument, decided to tell their backstory. After they were stolen from their previous owner, they were set up here for the wax museum. By day they were overpriced attractions, but at night they were free to do as they pleased. It was a pleasant life, all things considered, right up until the money stopped coming in and they were locked in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just say one more thing?\u201d asked Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine. Go ahead,\u201d allowed an annoyed Wax Sherlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora pointed at Wax Lizzie. \u201cYou have an axe. If you didn\u2019t like being locked up, you could have just broken out at any night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd go where, hmm? You want us to be caught out in the sunlight just like Wax Lincoln?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m also not seeing how the wax museum stopped making money,\u201d Mabel added. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t take much to maintain you guys. Stan would have just had to do a minimal cleaning, like, once a week, which isn\u2019t that expensive. You\u2019ve been locked up for years and you all look in pretty good shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Wax Shakespeare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 I really don\u2019t see why you guys would be locked up in the first place. At the very least you\u2019d be making enough money to cover the cost of cleaning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s because your uncle is a big fat jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranted,\u201d allowed Dipper. \u201cHold on. You guys ever see Night at the Museum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI loved that movie,\u201d gushed Mabel. \u201cRobin Williams makes everything good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this movie about museum exhibits that also come to life at night,\u201d Dipper explained to the intrigue of the figures. \u201cThe museum was about to be shut down, so they solved the problem by the end by opening the museum to night guests. That way it\u2019s like there\u2019s a big animatronic t-rex skeleton in the front lobby and a Wax Teddy Roosevelt who can talk with people about the real Roosevelt\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPipe in one hand and Wax Stan\u2019s head in the other, Sherlock\u2019s brow made a climb up his forehead. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you guys could do the same. Show Grunkle Stan that you\u2019re really alive. We can basically employ you guys and extend the Shack\u2019s open hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, yeah!\u201d cheered Mabel. \u201cYou can be the evening crew. Give tours, talk about yourselves, and jack up prices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you guys would be able to walk free at night, and the Mystery Shack would make more money. Everyone wins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hold that thought.\u201d Sherlock motioned for the other wax figures to all gather at the far end of the room while they discussed this alternative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll buy it?\u201d Mabel whispered through a forced grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo clue, but try scooching closer to the fire,\u201d urged Dipper. \u201cTheir wax, so we can just melt them if things get bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea.\u201d And she discretely shuffled her way over to the fireplace to await the figures\u2019 verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. They refuse and things go mostly like in the episode.<br>\r\n2. They agree and become integrated into the Shack</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wax conference concluded as the figures approached the twins. \u201cSorry kids, but no dice. We\u2019ve been waiting ten years to get our revenge,\u201d he flipped the Wax Stan head around in his hand, \u201cand next time we won\u2019t miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were trying to murder Grunkle Stan for real?\u201d asked Dipper in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, you little pipsqueaks! Now that you know our secret. You must die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou first!\u201d Mabel then wielded a fire poker like a javelin, hurling it at Wax John Wilks Booth\u2019s head and spearing it to the wall. \u201cHaha, got\u2019ch\u2019ya!\u201d Her cheer was short lived when the body kept moving and the remaining wax figures just looked peeved. \u201cOops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe candles!\u201d Dipper pointed over to where Grunkle Stan had set up a refreshment table, including a pair of electric candles. Mabel wielded hers like a sword easily enough. Dipper, through much effort, wielded his like a human trying to manage an artillery cannon without wheels. \u201cGet back or we\u2019ll melt you into candles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDecorative candles,\u201d Mabel added threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wax figures were intimidated at first, but then they remembered that they had the advantage in both size and numbers. \u201cYou really think you can defeat us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Worth a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo be it. Attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first casualty of the battle was Dipper\u2019s footing as the weight of the candle threw him off balance and he fell to the floor. When Mabel turned to retrieve him, she accidentally severed Shakespeare\u2019s arms. Dipper recovered to find the wax figures closing in on Mabel from all sides, clearly judging her to be the bigger threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever underestimate the little guy,\u201d Dipper muttered before rolling his candle with all due haste, melting a good many feet all the way up to the ankle. In one case, Wax Robin Hood tripped and knocked Wax Larry King over, who then fell neck first onto the candle and was subsequently decapitated. \u201cHa! Interview that, Larry King! You alright Mabel?\u201d He turned to his sister, and were they not in mortal danger, he would have burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel was using the severed Coolio\u2019s head like a mace, swinging it by the hair to bludgeon the other figures, knocking them back while she retrieved her candle. With her primary weapon retrieved, the little girl made a lunge for Wax Lizzie, but came up short and only tore her dress open. The adrenaline evaporated almost instantly as everyone paused to gawk. \u201cUh\u2026 wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Lizzie\u2019s hands shot down to cover her exposed groin. \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026 damn. I knew shaving down there was kind of a more recent thing but\u2026 wow. You\u2019d need a freaking lawnmower to trim that bush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-shut up!\u201d cried the wax woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned that someone took the time to sculpt her that way,\u201d commented Dipper. \u201cAll these other guys have their clothes as part of their bodies, but her\u2026\u201d He gestured. \u201cSomeone sculpted her to not only go commando, but also have a bush big enough to hide a whole person. Someone fetishized an axe murderer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other wax figures began snickering at Lizzie\u2019s plight, her cheeks began to burn from embarrassment. They burned so hot that she ended up melting herself. Once everyone got the giggles out of their system, the fight resumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWax Sherlock finally did something smart by tossing the Stan head aside and grabbing a real sword off the wall. Dipper\u2019s candle was smashed in short order. In response, Mabel found a broken sliver of metal near the fire place and threw it to Dipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hot on both ends, but not enough to harm minizora skin. \u201cUh, thanks, but how do I fight a sword with a toothpick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigure it out,\u201d Mabel urged, once more being swarmed by the remaining figures. \u201cDie Nixon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Wax Sherlock in pursuit, Dipper could only avoid and evade his strikes. Thankfully he had a lifetime of experience to help him through, but he was ever on the retreat. He knew there was only one chance. The minizora dove out the window and began ascending the Mystery Shack\u2019s roof, once more demonstrating the climbing skills of a mountain goat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can outwit me, boy? I\u2019m Sherlock-bleeding-Holmes! Have you seen my magnifying glass? It\u2019s enormous,\u201d ranted the wax man as he haphazardly swung his sword around and dislodged the big S from the sign. Eventually he cornered Dipper, pinning him to the shingled roof with his shoe. Wax Sherlock tried increasing the pressure to crush the boy like a bug, but the minizora only laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat the best you got?\u201d he wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrr. So be it.\u201d Wax Sherlock raised his sword high. \u201cAny last words?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, actually. Got any sunblock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any-?\u201d Wax Sherlock was cut off by the drip-drop of wax dripping onto his nose. His hands were liquefying and he lost his grip on the sword. He then turned and beheld the golden glow of the sun peeking over the forested horizon. \u201c\u2026 no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLetting me lead you to the roof? Yeah, probably not your sharpest decision,\u201d Dipper taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutsmarted by a child in short pants, and a minizora at that. Nooo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny second thoughts Dipper might have had for killing a person were rendered null at that moment. \u201cSucks to be you, buddy. All my life guys like you have been looking down on me. But in just another minute, <i>I\u2019ll</i> be looking down on <i>you</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, with each passing second, Wax Sherlock lost more and more height, along with facial features. And then, just as the wax man was finally shorter than the minizora and Dipper was about to deliver the last word, he sneezed. \u201cHa-ha-ha. you sneeze like a kitten,\u201d ranted the wax puddle in a mad delirium. \u201cThose policemen were right. You\u2019re adorable. Adorablllllle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Splat*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thunder stolen, Dipper heaved a sigh and returned to the wax room. Mabel was just finishing up with chucking severed wax limbs into the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDipper, you\u2019re okay!\u201d Mabel rushed over and scooped him up, holding him tight to her cheek. \u201cYou solved the mystery after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, I told you I can handle myself,\u201d he strained to say. Mabel\u2019s grip was more constraining than Wax Sherlock\u2019s shoe, so he tapped her cheek to signal her to loosen up. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t have done it without my sidekick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel giggled and picked up the Wax Stan head from the floor. \u201cNo offense Dipper, but you\u2019re the sidekick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Says who? Are-are people saying that? Who\u2019s saying that?\u201d Dipper asked self-consciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t be down. You\u2019re still the best sidekick a hero like me could ever want.\u201d And she gave him a big wet kiss that encompassed most of his head. \u201cEw. You taste like wax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grunkle Stan came in to the warzone of a room, he was immediately placated with the presentation of his missing head. His reward was some affectionate noogying. That was nice, but far more gratifying was when the police pulled up and the twins had evidence of having solved the case. It didn\u2019t matter that no one believed them about the wax people. What mattered was the hilarious sight of two cops spitting scalding hot coffee in one another\u2019s faces.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early morning in the Mystery Shack when Soos was on break and decided to join Dipper and Mabel in the TV room. Mabel held her brother in her lap as her fingers idly fiddled with his tiny form. So long as his vision was unobstructed, he made no complaint, not even when she poked his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s that commercial I was telling you guys about,\u201d Soos informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid commercial was for some self-proclaimed psychic over at the Tent of Telepathy. That there was an unflattering video of Grunkle Stan towards the end only confirmed that these people were his direct competition for, as their dear old Grunkle would so eloquently say: \u201cFleecing roobs.\u201d And when Stan forbid them from going to the show that evening, their childish rebellion left them with no choice but to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing better to do while they waited for the evening, the twins went up to their room to relax. After the door was locked and blinds closed, Mabel removed her sweater to give her chest some open air. \u201cAhh, much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? As far as summer days go, this one\u2019s pretty mild.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m just,\u201d Mabel tittered, \u201cone hot mamma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019ve heard worse,\u201d Dipper allowed as he opened up the journal. He didn\u2019t even make it to the second line before being picked up by his shirt. \u201cHey, what gives?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust giving you an extra special study spot, bro-bro,\u201d Mabel graciously said as she laid on her back and rested her brother down atop her chest. \u201cHehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, uh, sure, I guess,\u201d Dipper accepted of his sister\u2019s silliness. Mabel\u2019s breasts weren\u2019t anything to write home about, but they weren\u2019t <i>completely</i> flat. There was enough there for Dipper to rest his head on like a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe. Comfy?\u201d she asked, using her elbows to try and press her breasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough,\u201d answered Dipper distractedly, trying to ignore the way Mabel pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph. I bet you\u2019d notice if Shandra Jimenez put you on her chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, she\u2019s like in her late thirties. Plus I\u2019d bet those things are plastic. There\u2019s no need to get-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you say it!\u201d Mabel accused, her finger pointed like a deadly weapon at the boy resting against her tiny boob. \u201cI am not jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if anyone around here is going to be insecure about their size, it\u2019s going to be me. Got that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel huffed and turned away. \u201cAt least you could show me a little affection now and then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow and then? Mabel, I was literally in your mouth this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was <i>me</i> showing <i>you</i> affection. I\u2019m always the one doing the petting, the hugging, the licking, and all that stuff. Maybe you could throw a little sugar my way once in a while.\u201d Her tone was pleading and her eyes were doing that shimmery thing that she knew Dipper couldn\u2019t resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine,\u201d Dipper surrendered, closing the book as he was clearly not going to get any reading done until Mabel was satisfied. \u201cFirst, put this up so it won\u2019t get damaged.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel happily obliged and set the book on her dresser. As she did, her frown started to turn upside down as Dipper undressed. She clapped her hands and kicked her legs in anticipation of the fun that was coming. \u201cEe-he-he! Naked Dipper is best Dipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Sure,\u201d Dipper agreed dispassionately as he threw his underwear off to the side. Standing there in the buff atop his bare-chested sister, the minizora was still as soft as a noodle. Just being naked and looking at his half naked sister did nothing for him. It\u2019d take some serious stimulation to give Mabel what she wanted, but that got Dipper to thinking. \u201cSo if you want me to show some affection for a change, then you\u2019re gonna have to commit to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you gotta sit on your hands. Literally. If we\u2019re doing this, then I\u2019m in charge. You can\u2019t do anything. For once, you\u2019re the one who just has to sit back and let your twin have their way with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow. So forceful,\u201d giggled Mabel as she slid her hands under her bottom. \u201cI like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gave a curt nod. \u201cGood. Now, let\u2019s see here.\u201d After a second of surveying the smooth landscape beneath his feet, deciding a course of action, the minizora returned to his sister\u2019s chest lumps and climbed up onto the nipple. Mabel moaned quietly, but that was just a taste of what he had planned. Dipper dropped down onto his belly, pressing his limp dick against the little girl\u2019s nipple. \u201cOhhhh,\u201d he shuddered, having not expected it to feel that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel it,\u201d Mabel moaned. \u201cI feel your itty bitty weewee against my nippy. Tee-hee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby talk only makes this weirder,\u201d Dipper informed as he began experimentally grinding himself against the nub. He rotated his hips around in circles, trying to cover as much surface area as possible with his crotch. The texture of her nipple skin was different than her hands in a way that Dipper couldn\u2019t put into words. It felt amazing, though. Mabel moaned all the louder as she fought to keep her body still. A grin grew across Dipper\u2019s face as he came to terms with the control he now exerted over his sister. \u201cWow. So this is what it\u2019s like to be in charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty great, huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d he agreed while pressing his erection into her hardened nub. The friction of foreign skin against his sensitive prick combined with the knowledge of who he was humping; all added up for some pretty amazing stimulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dipper,\u201d moaned Mabel. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in my mouth, and I make you cum with my tongue, you taste sooo gooood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 figured,\u201d Dipper panted, now getting into the swing of things. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your tongue, though. I think every part of you is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?\u201d Mabel had never done much with her flat chest before, having always dismissed it as too underdeveloped to play with. However, as Dipper was demonstrating, she was a lot more sensitive around there than she\u2019d initially believed. \u201cC-can I play with the other one?\u201d she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minizora shook his head. \u201cUh-uh. This isn\u2019t about you feeling good. This is about me showing my sister some affection, remember. I\u2019m showing you what a minizora can do, and you\u2019re gonna sit back and take it,\u201d he growled, trying to channel some of Manly Dan\u2019s authority. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-harder!\u201d Mabel begged. With Dipper\u2019s stupid rule in place, she was powerless to do much. However, with him preoccupied with her chest, she was able to arch her back just enough to slip both hands beneath her skirt. The angle wasn\u2019t ideal for doing much and still maintain discretion, but it would have to do. Unable to think clearly, Mabel attacked both her ass and pussy, make believing that her fingers were Dipper. Lots of little Dippers, all rubbing and humping to their little hearts\u2019 content, and all at her command. They were doing this for her. The little Dippers were rubbing their little bodies against her most sensitive parts because she wanted them to, because they loved her and wanted to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHegakurgurk!\u201d Dipper gasped, his ejaculation jumping out at him like a snake. His body spasamed and he lost his grip, collapsing onto the erect nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Mabel was able to feel that tiny splash of liquid onto her nub. That combined with the stimulation from her hands to push her over the edge. Reflexively, she broke the rule by bringing the hand from her ass up and clamping it over her mouth to keep herself silent. It was a habit born out of having done this so many times at their parents\u2019 home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings, naked and half naked, laying atop the other and the bed respectively, panted. Their chests rose and fell with labored breaths, their bodies were all sweaty, and their groins were especially sticky. Dipper, to the surprise of no one, called upon his minizora endurance to recover first and stand. Hands on his hips and cock contentedly soft, he proudly surveyed his good work before smirking up at Mabel\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cheated,\u201d he playfully pointed out, indicating her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel, still recovering, scowled down at the minizora. Through her fingers she said, \u201cScrew off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper scratched his chin, pretending to think. \u201cHmm. Sure.\u201d And he began walking off. \u201cI need a shower anyway.\u201d But before he could jump from the little girl\u2019s body, a hand snatched him up and brought him to the little girl\u2019s big glowering face. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to be a sore loser about this,\u201d he said with a punchable smirk. \u201cFair\u2019s fair. You agreed to the rules, so that means-agh!\u201d His lecture was cut short after being tossed in his sister\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNom!\u201d Mabel pushed him into her cheek like a chipmunk storing food, not really up to a proper taste session. She just casually licked and sucked as strength returned to her body. When feeling returned to her legs, she headed for the bathroom and poured herself a glass of water. With Dipper secured by her tongue, she drank around him in an effort to punish him. Now internally refreshed, she looked herself in the mirror and did her best to speak around her mouthful. \u201cYou\u2019re the best brother ever, and I hate you for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible for Dipper not to grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the twins cleaned up and the adults none the wiser, Dipper, Mabel, and Soos paid their visit to the Tent of Telepathy. At the entrance there was a man named Bud Gleeful. A portly man in a Hawaiian shirt, he was holding out a bag to accept \u2018donations\u2019 into what he called Gideon\u2019s Psychic Sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think he knows what that sounds like?\u201d Mabel whispered to her shoulder rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiven what we\u2019ve seen so far from this town, I have no idea.\u201d Dipper looked around the tent. \u201cThis whole place is like a bizarro version of the Mystery Shack. They even have their own Soos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the audience was seated, the lights dimmed and the curtains rose. The person at the center of all this hype was just a pale freckled kid. He\u2019d be only half as tall without his hair and there was something off about how he would bat his eyelashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Stan\u2019s mortal enemy?\u201d Dipper said in disbelief, suddenly having a far lower opinion of the old man for considering this kid a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s so\u2026 little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle by big people standards,\u201d assured Mabel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper continued to be unimpressed as Gideon went through his performance, discerning \u2018secrets\u2019 about his audience members that were obvious to anyone who wasn\u2019t blind. \u201cHow are these people buying this? He\u2019s just doing cold reading. It\u2019s literally the oldest trick in the book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d he do that?\u201d Mabel awed after Gideon had guessed her name to the beat of an annoyingly catchy song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally written on your shirt,\u201d griped Dipper. He did not care for how his sister was looking at this chubby kid like he was made of glitter. The minizora was all too glad when the show finally ended. \u201cMan, that kid\u2019s an even bigger fraud than Stan. No wonder our uncle\u2019s jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. His dance moves were adorable. And did you see his hair? It was like\u2026 whoosh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re too easily impressed.\u201d The twins then descended into a poking war, laughing as they left through the parking lot and completely unaware that they were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Mabel was feeling a little glum. She\u2019d just bedazzled her face and Dipper didn\u2019t seem the least bit impressed. Then when there was a knock at the door, she decided to cheer herself up by talking to a potential stranger. \u201cAhh! It\u2019s wittle old you!\u201d she gasped at the sight of Gideon\u2019s hair, followed by Gideon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh-heh. Yeah, mah song\u2019s quite catchy,\u201d Gideon laughed a bit apprehensively. \u201cAh know we haven\u2019t formally met, but after yesterday\u2019s performance, Ah jus\u2019 couldn\u2019t get yer laugh out \u2018f mah head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean this one? Ah-ha-hahahaaa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a delight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their little back and forth, mostly about their mutual appreciation for sparkly things. Mabel even covered for him when Stan asked who was at the door. And then Gideon invited her over to visit his dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne sec.\u201d Mabel ran back to the dining room. \u201cHey Dipper. Gideon just invited me to his dressing room to play dress up. You wanna-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, would you look at the time,\u201d Dipper said, pointing to his nonexistent watch. \u201cI have to be\u2026 somewhere!\u201d And he made himself scarce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that Dipper would be safe enough at the Shack, Mabel accompanied Gideon for a few hours of dress up. All the while she remained utterly oblivious to the subtle and less-than-subtle hints the short stack kept dropping. When she returned, showing off her new do, she was once more confronted by an unimpressed Dipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, I don\u2019t trust anyone whose hair is bigger than their head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh leave him alone,\u201d Mabel snapped. \u201cYou never want to do girly stuff with me. You and Soos get to do boy stuff all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? We did that\u2026 thing, yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a minizora twin thing, not a girly thing.\u201d In no mood to argue, Mabel returned to Gideon for some quality feminine hanging out time. They\u2019d found a nice roof high up on a cliff that provided a great view of the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know Mabel, when Ah\u2019m up here lookin\u2019 down on all them little ol\u2019 people, Ah feel like Ah\u2019m king \u2018f all Ah survey,\u201d he whispered in a low menace. \u201cAh guess that makes you mah queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaat? You are being so nice to me right now,\u201d Mabel gushed. She slapped him in the gut and said, \u201cQuit it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh can\u2019t quit it, Mabel. Ah\u2019m speakin\u2019 from the heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the where now?\u201d Mabel asked, finally noticing the red flags. Sixty third one\u2019s the charm, as they say. But alas, she was unable to get out of his invitation to a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Shack, Mabel was trying to get her mind off the not-date with some video games. \u201cIt\u2019s not a date-date. It\u2019s just, you know, I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings, so I figured I\u2019d throw him a bone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, guys don\u2019t work that way,\u201d informed the wise tiny on her shoulder. \u201cThis is called \u2018leading a guy on\u2019. You\u2019re building his hopes up, despite having no real intention of getting serious. I know I\u2019d be pretty mad if a girl did that to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel scoffed. \u201cOh what do you know? Not like you\u2019ve ever dated anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not, but you know all those times you stuffed me in your underwear with nothing to do but read those minizora cutouts from your girly magazines? Well those things are mostly trash and even they agree that what you\u2019re doing is, at best, a dick move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dick move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doorbell rang, Mabel set Dipper aside to open it, expecting Gideon. She was right, but she hadn\u2019t been expecting him to be on a horse, or to call her mi\u2019lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer the not-date at the second fanciest restaurant in town went on, the harder it was for Mabel to convince herself that this wasn\u2019t a real date. There was an indoor fountain, aromatic flowers, more utensils than she knew what to do with, French stuff, and an overall creepy vibe as everyone \u2013 even the other guests \u2013 seemed to bend over backwards for Gideon.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon learning that that \u2018little gremlin\u2019 was dating his great niece, Grunkle Stan stomped right out of the shack to put a stop to this once and for all. He drove up to Gideon\u2019s less-than-humble abode, fully prepared to curb stomp the little piglet, and maybe his stupid faced father while he was at it. Bud, however, proved his smooth talking prowess and quickly diffused the situation. And even as committed as Grunkle Stan was at the start, once the prospect of making more money was brought up, he was putty in Bud\u2019s hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Shack, Dipper was sitting on the store counter while Wendy \u2013 without customers or Stan around \u2013 wasn\u2019t even pretending to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem down, squirt. Wanna talk about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Mabel being on a date is just kind of weird for me. Does that make sense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, totally. First time my brother brought home a girl, my first instinct was to kick that little bitch\u2019s teeth in. It\u2019s perfectly normal, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed nervously. \u201cDid you\u2026 do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, man. Go around kicking little kids in the teeth? That\u2019s how cops get called and you\u2019re sent off to juvi for, like, ever. The trick is to play nice at the start. Smile, get to know \u2018em, learn their weaknesses,\u201d she added darkly. \u201cThat way, if it turns out they\u2019re jerks, you can just blackmail them into breaking up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed more sincerely this time. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s super sweet or super creepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts family,\u201d Wendy stated plainly while opening a soda. \u201cThey\u2019re all a bunch of idiots, so you gotta do what you gotta do to keep \u2018em safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. You are really smart.\u201d <i>And pretty.</i> Dipper looked around, wondering who\u2019d just said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. My mom told me that. She\u2019s good with this kind of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you came from her, so you\u2019ve gotta have some of her smarts too, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you to say, but I\u2019m pretty tame compared to my folks. People think my dad is intense, but mom can be a demon when she gets upset. This one time I brought a guy home, I\u2019d left him in the living room to powder my nose. Anyway, just as I come back out, the window breaks. The dude actually jumped out the closed window to get away. Dad was sweatin\u2019 bullets while mom\u2026\u201d Wendy trailed off, laughing nervously. \u201cAnyway, the point is that it\u2019s perfectly natural to not trust your family\u2019s dates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a date,\u201d Dipper insisted. \u201cWell, Mabel says it isn\u2019t. Her words were \u2018throw him a bone\u2019,\u201d he said with air quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sucked in a breath like she\u2019d stubbed her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right.\u201d Dipper fell back on the counter and stared up at the ceiling. \u201cIf I were there I could help. I could be a little shoulder angel and whisper what she should do to break things off as quickly and painlessly as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled kindly. \u201cMabel\u2019s lucky to have a brother like you.\u201d She tapped at the table as a thought occurred. \u201cUm, this might sound weird, but would it be okay if I\u2026 pet you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper frowned thoughtfully. \u201cHuh. I think that might be the first time someone\u2019s ever asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is it weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, only if we make it. Mabel and my parents just do whatever they want. Whenever some stranger tried reaching for me, Mabel would just bite their fingers. But if you\u2019re going to ask, then sure. Go right ahead.\u201d Dipper laid himself flat on the counter, suddenly feeling far more vulnerable than a few seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her bottom lip and with much trepidation, Wendy reached out with a single digit extended and touched Dipper\u2019s chest. Nothing happened, but she still exhaled her relief. She didn\u2019t know what she was expecting. She\u2019d played with dolls before, but that didn\u2019t seem like an adequate comparison. This was a minizora. His chest rose and fell with his breathing and he was warm to the touch. Wendy\u2019s instincts told her that this was a fragile creature that needed protecting, but common sense suggested otherwise. Minizora were tough, people said. They could handle all kinds of things that would kill a regular person. And yet this knowledge contradicted so starkly with what she was feeling right now. At that moment, she wanted nothing more than to hold this little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper, meanwhile, was in a similarly perplexing predicament. A stranger was touching him, and he was okay with that. She was petting him, showing the same sort of everyday affection he was accustomed to from family. Much to his own surprise, he was totally relaxed, not even feeling the usual tension of going to the doctor. Did he trust Wendy that much? How far did that trust go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the doorbell jingled, startling the counter people to straighten up and attempt to look as innocent as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, h-hey Mabel,\u201d Dipper strained to say. \u201cHow did the\u2026 what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gave a long and drawn out groan, not even looking up as she trudged into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, dude. Normally I\u2019d think she\u2019d just broken up, but you said she didn\u2019t even want to date him,\u201d Wendy observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t.\u201d Full of purpose, Dipper hopped down the makeshift staircase from the counter and scurried off after Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smiled as she watched him go and rested her chin on her hand. \u201cThere goes a pretty cool brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dipper finally caught up with Mabel, he found her having already withdrawn her limbs and retreated into her sweater like a turtle. \u201cMabel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel\u2019s not here. She\u2019s in sweater town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to come out of sweater town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel whimpered and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second\u2019s thought, Mabel stuck her hand out of the bottom and motioned him forward. Dipper climbed on and let himself be pulled up to his dower sister\u2019s face. Everything was cast in shadow, but the minizora kept his eyes on what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow bad was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agreed to a second date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Dipper asked incredulously, his tone just making Mabel feel worse. \u201cI mean, you had a plan. Say you just want to be friends, and then be friends. No more dates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. He had a talking bird, and the rainbow machine, and this one lady said she\u2019d die of sadness if I didn\u2019t say yes. She even had a doctor confirm it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper suddenly became less sympathetic. \u201cSo someone you never met just happens to be so invested in you dating Gideon that they\u2019d die otherwise? And they just <i>happen</i> to have a doctor there to make sure you\u2019re manipulated into doing what Gideon wants?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, he\u2019s just like Grunkle Stan: a showman and a con artist. I\u2019d bet anything that those people were just actors planted to guilt you into dating Gideon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on a second. He\u2019s not\u2026 that controlling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! You hesitated,\u201d Dipper pointed out. \u201cSo you <i>do</i> think he\u2019s that controlling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat news, Mabel,\u201d announced Grunkle Stan with a beaming grin and a \u2018Team Gideon\u2019 shirt. \u201cYou have to marry Gideon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d the twins exclaimed together, both poking their heads out of the sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my long-term plan with Buddy Gleeful. There\u2019s a lot of cash tied up in this thing. I even got this shirt.\u201d Then he wandered off, muttering about how bodies change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it!\u201d Dipper stomped his foot on Mabel\u2019s palm. \u201cEnough is enough. If you can\u2019t break up with Gideon, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will?\u201d awed Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, remember that talk about the rabbits and feeling lousy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank-you-thank-you-thank-you,\u201d Mabel gushed, pelting Dipper\u2019s body in grateful kisses while he offered up only a token resistance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, while Mabel stayed home to avoid the paparazzi, Dipper grabbed a ride from Soos to pay Gideon a visit. He entered the first fanciest establishment in Gravity Falls and it certainly fit the title. Seriously, how does a place like this stay open when the number of locals who can afford to eat here can be counted on one hand? Anyway, the minizora held his head high and strutted inside like he belonged there. Although he did find it odd that a place this expensive didn\u2019t have some kind of security to keep people like him out.<br>\r\nUpon arriving at Gideon\u2019s private booth, Dipper ascended the table cloth and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Dipper Pines. How are you? You look good, you look good.\u201d Gideon\u2019s greeting sounded like he\u2019d been rehearsing for a school play. \u201cYou know Mabel has told me quite a lot about you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s all lies.\u201d Dipper strained to smile at his bad joke.<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Because whenever the topic of you came up, it was often accompanied with words like reliable, dedicated, fun, and various synonyms that made mah beloved ever so happy.\u201d He laughed that cutesy laugh of his before shifting to a whispered intensity. \u201cShe seems quite fond of you.\u201d<br>\r\nMore and more Dipper was having a hard time understanding why Mabel couldn\u2019t say no to this guy. If he\u2019d been in her position, he\u2019d have thrown himself out the window and booked it like Wendy\u2019s old boyfriend by now. \u201cLook buddy. We\u2019ve got to talk. Mabel isn\u2019t going to join you tonight. She, uh, doesn\u2019t want to see you anymore,\u201d he laughed uncomfortably. \u201cSh-she\u2019s kind of weirded out by you. No offense.\u201d<br>\r\nGideon just kept on smiling that serene, creepy smile of his. The only indicator that he wasn\u2019t the picture of happiness was the twitching in his left eye. \u201cSo, what yer saying is, you\u2019ve come between us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook man, some people just don\u2019t click. It\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s fault, except maybe yours. Uh, you\u2019re not going to freak out or anything, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Gideon tittered like a little schoolgirl. \u201cThese things happen. Bygones and all that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay cool. Sorry again man, but I, uh, gotta go,\u201d explained Dipper as he backed away, unwilling to turn his back on the giant shorty.<br>\r\nWhen Dipper made it back to Mabel and gave her the news, her hug about crushed the life out of him.<br>\r\nThe next day, while everything seemed back to normal, Toby Determined called wanting to interview Dipper about the unusual happenings he\u2019d seen in town. The minizora was all too excited, right up until he was given the time and place for the meeting.<br>\r\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d Mabel asked.<br>\r\n\u201cToby Determined. He wants to interview me, alone, after dark, in an abandoned building on the outskirts of town.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s literally the opening scene of the horror movie we watched last night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPretty generic, if you ask me,\u201d Dipper agreed nonchalantly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously I have to. If someone\u2019s going through the trouble of setting a trap, I\u2019d like to know who they are so we can keep an eye out for next time.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel did not care for this answer and not-so-gently grabbed her brother. \u201cBut what if you get hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no big deal. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going alone.\u201d He bounced his eyebrows suggestively and gave a winning smile.<br>\r\n\u201cWha? Oh. Ohhh! Hehe, good thinking.\u201d<br>\r\nEntering the old warehouse at the appointed time, Dipper was greeted only by darkness. Was this actually just a prank and not a trap? The light at the far end of the room ominously shining onto a swivel chair suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cHello friend,\u201d greeted Gideon, spinning around in his chair and, in place of a super villain\u2019s cat, petting a little doll of himself.<br>\r\nDipper blinked. \u201cSomehow this is way creepier than the horror movie.\u201d It was honestly rather impressive.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me tell you, boy. This town has secrets you can\u2019t begin to comprehend,\u201d Gideon threatened, shaking his fist.<br>\r\n\u201cThe only secret here is how you can delude yourself like this. I told you, Mabel\u2019s not into you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou liar!\u201d Gideon screamed shrilly. As he hopped off the chair and began marching toward the minizora, his hand gripped tightly on the green amulet on his shirt collar. \u201cYou turned her against me. She was my peach dumplin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAaare you okay man?\u201d Dipper asked, fighting his tiny instincts to run. Running just made the bullies want to give chase. Besides, he was confident he could take any blows this pipsqueak could dish out. And when his body was encased in a green aura that matched Gideon\u2019s amulet, followed by being hurled across the room into the brick wall, Dipper had second thoughts about running. \u201cOh crap!\u201d<br>\r\nOutside the warehouse, hidden behind a tree, Mabel was left to stew in her own thoughts as she searched for any signs of danger. In hindsight, that first date really had been a dick move, but letting Dipper break up for her had been an even bigger dick move. Gideon might have his\u2026 quirks, but he at least deserved an honest break up. As soon as this hole trap thing was sorted out, she\u2019d march over to his house and do things right.<br>\r\nInside the warehouse\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhh!\u201d Dipper was getting more exercise in the last few minutes than the last couple years. Everywhere he turned there was something floating, flying at him, dropping on him, or maybe gravity would just have a hiccup and he\u2019d be the one sent flying. There just comes a point in a young man\u2019s life when he can\u2019t help but think that a bully giving swirlies is the lesser evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce yer out \u2018f the way, Mabel will be all mine! Mwahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are insane,\u201d Dipper spat as he was lifted high in the air. \u201cIf anything happens to me, she\u2019ll know who to blame. She\u2019ll hate you forever.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ah don\u2019t think so,\u201d tittered Gideon as he levitated a pair of scissors up to the minizora. \u201cYou underestimate just how persuasive Ah can be. Tee-hee.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel threw the doors open. \u201cGideon, we have to talk,\u201d she stated with calm firmness.<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mabel? My marshmallow. Wh-what are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d asked Gideon in a rare moment of uncertainty. He knew things looked bad, and so quickly discarded the scissors in the hopes that Mabel hadn\u2019t seen them yet.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gideon, but I can\u2019t be your marshmallow,\u201d Mabel answered calmly, not even paying Dipper a glance. \u201cAnd I need to be honest and tell you that myself.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter all of his denial, Gideon finally looked crestfallen. \u201cA-Ah don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\nWith an inviting smile, Mabel approached with hands outstretched in friendship. \u201cHey, we can still be makeover buddies, right. Wouldn\u2019t you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Gideon hopefully, only for that hope to be snatched right off his neck.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really!\u201d snarled Mabel, the magic amulet in hand and out of Gideon\u2019s reach. The magic faded and Dipper dropped to the ground. \u201cYou were attacking my brother. What the hell?\u201d And she slapped him across the face with a thunderous thwack.<br>\r\n\u201cN-now Mabel, Ah can explain.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Fuck your explanations!\u201d She slapped him every other word. \u201cFuck you! Fuck you forever! Go fuck yourself! You fuck!\u201d<br>\r\nEvery f bomb was like a stab into Gideon\u2019s heart. How could his sweet peach suddenly grow so sour? Then the amulet started glowing again, only this time its glow encompassed Gideon\u2019s body and he floated helplessly before Mabel.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me make this as clear as possible,\u201d Mabel hissed. \u201cI will never date you. You crossed a line and now I will never even like you.\u201d She then spent about a minute experimenting with the durability of Gideon\u2019s face vs. the floor and walls. \u201cIf you ever come near me or my family again, I will end you!\u201d Teeth bared, she crushed the amulet in her bare hand, ending its power forever and dropping Gideon. \u201cNow get out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine. Ah\u2019ll leave,\u201d Gideon conceded, backing away with a limp and clothes in tatters. \u201cBut Ah promise. This isn\u2019t the last you\u2019ve seen of Wittle. Ol\u2019. M-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! Ah\u2019m gettin\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\nDipper waited until things quieted down. \u201cW-wow Mabel. I-I\u2019ve never seen that side of you be-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWha-ha-ha!\u201d Mabel cried as she flung herself onto Dipper, tears gushing from her eyes and onto his clothes. \u201cYou idiot! You stupid, stupid idiot! You knew it was a trap, but you still went anyway. That shit almost cut you with scissors. You can\u2019t handle scissors!\u201d<br>\r\nDipper opened his mouth, but didn\u2019t know what to say. He could point out that there were factors that couldn\u2019t have been accounted for, that he\u2019s withstood worse and maybe could have handled the scissors, or that Mabel had agreed to this whole plan, but he couldn\u2019t see any of those arguments ending well for him. And with the tears of his beloved sister ripping his heart out, he finally settled on something to say. \u201cYou protected me.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel took a break from her constricting embrace and pulled back enough to look Dipper in the eye. She was ugly crying and hated that he was seeing her like this. However, there was something about his smile that lifted her spirits just a tad.<br>\r\n\u201cI knew I\u2019d be fine, because you protected me like you always do.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel fell right back to bawling, but with most of the fear and anger removed. Now there was only relief mixed with a bit of joy that everything was alright. No more words were exchanged as the pair sat there in the warehouse, holding one another for comfort.<br>\r\nWhen Gideon finally made it back home, the first thing he did was have Stanford Pines tossed out. The merger of their families was off. As far as he was concerned, this was a full and proper feud. It hardly mattered that Stan stole an expensive painting on the way out. Oh, there would be recompense and it would go far beyond petty thievery. This, Gideon knew with absolute certainty. He knew it because in a secret compartment at his desk, there was a book; an itty bitty minizora book. It bore no title. Just a little six fingered hand and the number 2 on the cover.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next couple of days, Mabel was being especially clingy with Dipper, which he wasn\u2019t too bothered by. They\u2019d both gone through some pretty heavy stuff: him almost dying and her having to watch her most favorite person suffer. They were each other\u2019s comfort object. Ever since they were little, their default response to any kind of stress had always been to seek out the other. That was the case now, with Dipper offering no complaint even when Mabel insisted on escorting or being escorted by him to the bathroom. And right now, the twins were undertaking a heavy emotional ordeal. They were going to be within two feet of one another, but not actually touch. This was an important step in their recovery process.<br>\r\nAt the entrance to the gift shop, Mabel was sitting on a spinning globe. \u201cHehe. My butt is crushing Canada.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMabel, do you believe in ghosts?\u201d Dipper asked while flipping through the journal.<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that you\u2019re a big dork. Haha.\u201d For her impudence, Dipper pressed a pencil into the globe, bringing it to an abrupt halt and sending his sister flying. \u201cOw.\u201d<br>\r\nThe bell rung and Stan poked his head in the door. \u201cSoos. Wendy. I\u2019m headin\u2019 out. You two are going to wash the bathrooms, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d they answered respectively, each with a firm salute.<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. You stay out of trouble.\u201d With his old man scowl delivered, Stan departed for parts unknown and deeds most likely of the extra-legal variety. <br>\r\n\u201cHey guys. What\u2019s this?\u201d Wendy called, gesturing over to a mysterious curtain in the corner. \u201cIs it a secret ladder to the roof?\u201d Pulling back the curtain, she revealed that it was just that.<br>\r\nSoos was reluctant, but the teen was easily able to bring the preteens onboard. She even showed them to her secret cot and cooler.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, did you put all this up here?\u201d awed Dipper. \u201cHuh. Funny I didn\u2019t notice any of this when Sherloc-er, never mind.\u201d<br>\r\nWendy gave her hair a casual flip. \u201cI may or may not sneak up here during work\u2026 all the time, every day.\u201d She then grabbed a pinecone from a bucket and tossed it across the lot and hit a target that had been strapped to the plastic tiki tower. \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh I want to try,\u201d squealed Mabel as she grabbed an armful and began chucking the things, each round coming up short.<br>\r\nNot wanting to be left out, Dipper figured he might as well try. His pinecone hit someone\u2019s car and set off the alarm. At first his gut sank in fear that he\u2019d just royally screwed up, but Wendy\u2019s laugh said otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha-ha, jackpot!\u201d Bending down with one hand on her knee, she extended her other palm down to Dipper\u2019s level. \u201cHigh five.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper suffered a momentary mental blue screen. The hand of someone other than a relative was reaching out for him in\u2026 comradery? What\u2019s more, that hand was attached to a young woman with cute freckles and a lovely shade of red hair that was being picked up just right by the wind. And her smile\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me hangin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper snapped out of it and delivered the high five. It was oddly exhilarating. <br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, it\u2019s my friends,\u201d Wendy said as a car pulled up. She then looked apprehensively at the twins. \u201cUh, you guys aren\u2019t going to tell Stan, are you?\u201d<br>\r\nWith a resolute smile, Dipper made a zipping motion over his mouth and threw away the key, which Wendy mirrored. The teen then said \u201cLater dorks,\u201d before descending down some nearby trees with a level of prowess rarely seen outside of professional acrobats, or minizora. <br>\r\n\u201cLater Wendy,\u201d Dipper called after they\u2019d already driven off. His laugh was forced and his waving was frantic. \u201cHaaa, good times.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh,\u201d beamed Mabel, not so oblivious when it came to other people\u2019s relationships.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s got a cru-hush,\u201d she sang, poking him in the cheek.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. I just think Wendy\u2019s cool is all. It\u2019s not like I lay awake at night thinking about her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? So when I catch you staring blankly up at the ceiling at night, who <i>are</i> you thinking about?\u201d inquired Mabel, continuing her poking assault.<br>\r\n\u201cHer name\u2019s Business. First name None-Ya.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me. I know when my little brother\u2019s crushing on someone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? So if I were to, say, offer you this handkerchief that Wendy used to wipe her chest earlier,\u201d Mabel said while producing said fabric from her pocket, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be interested?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow much?\u201d Dipper\u2019s mouth said before his filter could switch on.<br>\r\nMabel\u2019s smirk was downright devilish. She had him cornered and they both knew it. \u201cIt\u2019s actually clean,\u201d she said before returning the white cloth to her pocket. \u201cSo, got a thing for red heads, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I mean, I don\u2019t know. Just\u2026 this one, I guess,\u201d he admitted apprehensively. \u201cC-can we just drop this, please?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Whatever you say, bro-bro. Just know that I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready to talk. In fact\u2026\u201d Mabel then unceremoniously snatched up Dipper and stuffed him down the back of her underwear.<br>\r\nWedged between her soft cheeks, Dipper was left to consider how surprisingly mature that response was, at least by Mabel standards. Still, with nothing better to do today, he decided to make himself comfy in the warm softness, pull out his flashlight and journal, and get some reading done.<br>\r\nThe next day, Mabel seemed to have fully returned to her usual chipper self, as indicated by the \u201cRandom dance party for no reason!\u201d<br>\r\nAs she and Wendy got their groove on, Dipper pretended to read, all while peeking over the top of the journal. He was starting to notice things about the red head. Her dancing really showed off how nice her hips were. While she lacked the perpetual sugar rush that was Mabel\u2019s energy, her moves had a more mature elegance. That one move resembled a pelvic thrust, which set the minizora\u2019s imagination into overdrive.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Dipper. You gonna get in on this?\u201d Wendy called.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I, uh, don\u2019t really dance,\u201d Dipper dodged with a blush, only to spy the sadistic gleam in Mabel\u2019s eye. She was about to do her sisterly duty and embarrass him for her own amusement.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, ya do.\u201d She turned to Wendy. \u201cMom used to dress him up in a lamb costume and make him do\u2026 the Lamby Dance,\u201d she said as if imparting some ancient and holy secret.<br>\r\n\u201cNow is not the time to talk about the Lamby Dance,\u201d Dipper said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, lamb costume?\u201d Wendy chuckled. \u201cIs there, like, little ears and a tail, or-?\u201d<br>\r\nMabel immediately produced a picture for Wendy. \u201cHe used to be so cute. He\u2019d prance around and sing a song about grazing,\u201d she laughed with nostalgic fondness.<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow.\u201d Wendy covered a hand over her mouth to stifle her giggles. She understood how embarrassing this was, but couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away. \u201cJust look at him. Aww, he\u2019s so sweet I think I just got diabetes.\u201d While the ladies laughed, Dipper was left to seethe in silent humiliation.<br>\r\nThen the clock chimed.<br>\r\n\u201cOp. Quitin\u2019 time.\u201d Wendy pocketed her name tag and made for the door.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hey wait,\u201d Dipper called. \u201cMaybe I-er-we could come with you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I don\u2019t know. My friends are pre-tty intense. How old did you guys say you are?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, we\u2019re thirteen, so technically teens,\u201d Dipper lied.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I like your moxy, kid. Let me get my stuff.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel picked Dipper up and tutted her disappointment. \u201cLying to a girl just to hang out. Oh Dipper. I thought I taught you better.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taught me literally nothing about dating\u2026 which this isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just one group of friends hanging out with another group of friends, all connected through one mutual friend. It\u2019s all very friendly, and nothing else.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Yeah. Sure,\u201d Mabel teased.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, quick question. Um, why are you being so cool about this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike, I\u2019m not saying I like Wendy or anything, but if I did, I kind of expected you to be a little more, you know\u2026\u201d He gestured vaguely.<br>\r\n\u201cFinger bitey.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way of putting it.\u201d<br>\r\nMabel laughed and shook her head at her pitiable little brother. \u201cBecause I realized something, Dipper. You and me, we kind of, how do I put this? Suck. Yeah. When it comes to love, we kind of have sucky tastes in picking people to crush on.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper scowled. \u201cThat sounds like the worst revelation ever.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBuuut, we don\u2019t suck at judging the <i>other\u2019s</i> love interests.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not following.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a twin thing. We started out as the same cell, but then we became two. I think it\u2019s like we\u2019ve got one whole person\u2019s worth of common sense between us. I tend to miss a lot of stuff that\u2019s obvious to you, but you\u2019re basically blind to stuff I can\u2019t not see. So whenever one of us finds someone we like, we should trust the other twin\u2019s judgement instead of our own. That way we can avoid the awkwardness of gang banging gnomes, magic creepoids, or that one girl with chronic diarrhea.\u201d<br>\r\nDipper shuddered with revulsion. He\u2019d have been happy to never think about Patty ever again. But in thinking of her now, Mabel had warned him beforehand. \u201cHmm. You know, that\u2019s not the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHigh praise.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if I\u2019m following, does this mean you approve of Wendy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she still have all her fingers?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen yeah. I like her fine.\u201d Mabel emphasized by clicking her teeth together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The meeting with Wendy\u2019s friends went less than ideal. Nothing Dipper did impressed anyone and he kind of pissed off Robbie by calling his drawing of an explosion a muffin. The rest of the guys were pretty rough with one another and prone to frequent punching. The only other girl, Tambry, was so glued to her phone that it was a miracle she could walk. Since the twins didn\u2019t take up much space, they were made to sit in the back of Thompson\u2019s mom\u2019s van with Tambry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, you like spending time on your phone, huh?\u201d Dipper asked awkwardly, trying to break the ice while sitting in Mabel\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry finally paused in her texting to give the pair a once over. \u201cSo you\u2019re, like, twins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yup. Sure are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you, like, identical?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel and Dipper shared a look. It was the look of people who\u2019d been asked a particular question so often that they\u2019d put serious thought into starting a petition to get that particular string of words criminalized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not identical,\u201d Dipper said as politely as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re a boy and a girl, not to mention the whole height thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Plus I\u2019m the cute one,\u201d Mabel added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry hummed thoughtfully. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve never seen a minizora before. What\u2019s that like? Do you, like, get stepped on a lot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of, but almost never twice by the same person.\u201d Dipper then gestured up at Mabel. \u201cGuess why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. I saw a photo of that on BookFace.\u201d Tambry flipped through her timeline and turned her phone towards the twins. Sure enough, there was a photo of Mabel frothing at the mouth and biting into Manly Dan\u2019s ankle while he wore an expression of abject horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was actually whipped cream, but I think it sent the right message,\u201d Mabel added, almost bragging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTambry finally smiled. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t half bad.\u201d And she went back to texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van finally pulled up at their destination and they all disembarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is, fellas. The condemned Dust 2 Dawn,\u201d Wendy ominously announced to the awe of the others. The building had been fenced off and looked like it hadn\u2019t seen human activity in decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d they shut it down?\u201d Dipper asked, not wanting to show his anxiety at entering another abandoned building. \u201cSome kind of health code violation or\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry murder,\u201d said one of the guys whose name Dipper had already forgotten. \u201cSome folks died in there. The place has been haunted ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis town has such a colorful history,\u201d Mabel cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wha? A-are you guys serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChill out, man,\u201d Wendy said before poking his arm, what she felt to be an appropriate equivalent of a friendly punch. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone else had to climb the fence, Dipper was able to just walk between the holes. Unfortunately, the doors were locked, but then Dipper got an idea. \u201cHey, let me take a crack at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie scoffed. \u201cYeah right. I can\u2019t get in, but itty bitty pipsqueak is gonna break it down like-Agh!\u201d He winced as a can hit him in the face. \u201cWho threw that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one gave any response; least of all Mabel who was innocently whistling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, leave him alone,\u201d Wendy pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s just a little kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s expression of hurt quickly morphed into determination and he snapped his fingers. \u201cMabel.\u201d She manifested behind him. \u201cRoof me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide grin at the chance to show off their twin skills, Mabel picked up her brother. With him curled up in a ball, she took aim at what looked like a vent and tossed him. Everyone else was gob smacked, unable to believe what they were seeing as the little fella climbed. Mabel had only thrown him half way up, meaning he\u2019d have to make the rest of the ascension on his own while the others watched. He disappeared. There was a commotion on the roof, like metal being punched, and then came silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie scoffed and turned to the others. \u201cWho wants to bet he doesn\u2019t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c$100!\u201d Mabel shouted urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. Like he\u2019ll actually-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the door unlocked from the inside, Dipper was able to push it open and motion the others to enter. While the others congratulated the minizora, even giving him the nickname Dr. Funtimes, Mabel stuck by Robbie\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can discuss a payment plan later. I\u2019d prefer cash, but I\u2019m willing to settle for the equivalent in fingers and toes.\u201d Her ultimatum delivered, she merrily skipped on into the haunted shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man. It\u2019s even creepier than I imagined,\u201d commented Wendy as the group split up to explore the dark isles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was covered in dust and there were more than a few bugs scurrying about. The whole experience of a convenience store at night was pretty novel for all of them. It wasn\u2019t long before Wendy found the light switches and, much to everyone\u2019s surprise, they still worked. With that set, the games were on. They had a food war with expired pastries, dropped mints in soda bottles just because, and did pretty much whatever else they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mabel squealed. \u201cOh my gosh, Smile Dip! I thought this stuff was banned in America.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they had a good reason,\u201d Dipper observed responsibly. All the tape wrapped around the display saying \u2018Do Not Sell\u2019 seemed to predate the store\u2019s closing. But the cheering of the teens throwing liquefied food at one another called him back to the fun, leaving Mabel to her own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on one of the isle shelves, Dipper and Wendy were enjoying some (miraculously) still frozen ice cream sticks. After an initial period of awkwardness, Dipper agreed to sit on her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. Dipper, this night is, like, legendary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look around. The guys are bonding.\u201d She pointed to where they were pouring ice into Thompson\u2019s pants. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen Tambry look up from her phone this long.\u201d Tambry just looked up to check on the shelf sitters, but looked away the moment their eyes locked. \u201cAnd your sister seems to be going nuts for that Smile Dip.\u201d Pink sugary stuff stained Mabel\u2019s hair and clothes. Her eyes looked glazed over as she seemed to be imagining eating something very large. It was unsettling to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Dipper. I wasn\u2019t sure if you could hang out with our crew at first, but you\u2019re surprisingly mature for your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Yes I am, though that\u2019s probably just cuz I\u2019m a minizora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. I think I heard that somewhere. You little guys mature, like, super quick or something.\u201d That was the SFW version, though. When Wendy had read about this online, there had been lots of comments talking about the sexual side of things. Something about them evolving to develop early to ensure survival. There\u2019d been a lot of talk about hormones, or maybe it was pheromones. Lots of people were arguing on the particulars. The overall conclusion was that even if a minizora kid looked like any regular kid on the outside, on the inside they were, like, twice as old. In that sense, depending on how you looked at it, Dipper was kind of like an adult in a little kid\u2019s body. Wendy wondered if this new info made her feelings towards the little dude less or more awkward. Probably the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Dipper agreed, oblivious to Wendy\u2019s inner turmoil. He was glad that from his position, he could sneak glances of her chest without her noticing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dipper had gone to fetch some more ice cream for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame this place shut down,\u201d he said to himself as he opened the freezer door. \u201cNot many places are this minizora friendly. I wonder if-\u201d His train of thought was broken when he beheld a floating brain. The nervous system floated beneath it like the tendrils of a jelly fish, along with a gurgling mouth and a pair of eyes that got way too close. Naturally, Dipper screamed and shut the door before anything else could happen. <br>\r\nThen the teens all came over to investigate. \u201cWhat was that? I thought I heard some lady screaming back here.\u201d Said one of the no-names. \u201cYou freaking out kid?\u201d asked the other no-name.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m fine. Everything\u2019s fine over here. Um, how are you?\u201d Dipper\u2019s eyes nervously darted about in search of some sort of distraction. \u201cHey look. Dancy Pants Revolution, the game that tricks people into exercising.\u201d That worked and the teens all rushed over to play. After taking one last look inside the freezer and finding it empty, Dipper decided that it had just been some trick of the light and rejoined the teens.<br>\r\nDipper\u2019s smile was forced as he tried to play it cool. Then he looked at the reflective glass and saw everyone \u2013 including himself \u2013 as skeletons. He then slapped himself and the reflections went back to normal. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He tried to phone Grunkle Stan. The good news was that it was minizora accessible. The bad news was that no one was picking up.<br>\r\nDipper then returned to Mabel. He climbed on her palm and her fingers reflexively curled around him in a protective embrace. \u201cMabel, I need your help. I think this store really is haunted, I can\u2019t get ahold of Grunkle Stan, and if I say anything to these guys,\u201d he gestured to the teens, \u201cthen they\u2019ll just think I\u2019m a scared little kid or something. Uh, Mabel?\u201d Her only answer was a low gurgle as pink foam poured from her lips. Dipper then climbed up to her shoulder and started slapping her cheek. \u201cMabel, how many of these did you eat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEleven\u2026 teeeeen. Blagh!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh man-oh man-oh man!\u201d Dipper shook his hands as his body felt hot and cold all at once. They were in danger and his other half was in a sugar induced coma. How could things get worse?<br>\r\nRobbie then called everyone over behind the counter. There were a couple of chalk outlines of where the bodies had fallen. Everyone was impressed and, in typical teen fashion, decided to prove their bravery by getting inside the lines.<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Dipper urged, positioning himself between the teens and what was definitely a bad idea. \u201cMaybe let\u2019s not do that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh-heh. This guy\u2019s scared.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is: Why tempt the fates? I mean, what if this place really is\u2026 haunted?\u201d The fallout was as bad as he\u2019d feared. Everyone was booing, his nickname was changed to Captain Buzzkill, and worst of all, Wendy looked disappointed with him.<br>\r\nTambry just kept texting. \u201cStatus update. Trapped in convenience store with insane 9 year old.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not 9!\u201d Dipper stomped his foot like a petulant child and, also like a child, surrendered to peer pressure by laying down in the chalk outline. \u201cI\u2019m 13. Technically a teen.\u201d<br>\r\nWith his announcement made, it was like the whole store gave a groan. The lights turned an eerie green and the chalk outline began to glow. The change in scenery caused Tambry to look up from her phone just in time to vanish in a blinding flash. <br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, what the hell?\u201d<br>\r\nDipper ran over and checked her phone. \u201cStatus update. Ahhh,\u201d he read. Then the security camera flipped on with the girl inside and trying to break out of the glass. Everyone had the appropriate reaction of screaming like a bunch of sissies. <br>\r\nThompson, who was still playing on the machine, was the next to vanish. He reappeared within the game screen and was pummeled by arrows. With nowhere to run, he curled up in a ball and started to cry. Tension only escalated when the doors closed on their own and no amount of force could break through.<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody wait,\u201d Dipper called, pulling out the journal and flipping to the ghost section. \u201cWhatever is doing this has to have some kind of reason. If we can figure out what it is, thennn maybe they\u2019ll let us go.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen the white no-name made a sarcastic remark, his reward was to be transported within the art of a cereal box where the bird mascot tried to eat him.<br>\r\nThen, just as everyone was onboard with the only actual plan, Mabel floated about six feet above the ground. She had no pupils, her body glowed, and she spoke with a deep masculine voice. \u201cWel-commme.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey got Mabel!\u201d Dipper cried.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to your graves, young trespassers. Mwahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re super sorry for hanging out in your store,\u201d Wendy pleaded.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Can\u2019t we just go now and leave forever?\u201d begged Dipper.<br>\r\nThe ghost possessing Mabel hummed. \u201cHmm. Okay, you\u2019re free to go.\u201d The doors opened. However, just as the guys tried to run, they were sealed shut all over again. \u201cHa! Just kidding.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou creepy freak! Just let us out already,\u201d demanded the black no-name.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, loser,\u201d Robbie agreed.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like your tone.\u201d The ghost snapped Mabel\u2019s fingers, turning the disrespectful teens into hot dogs and putting them on the rollers to cook. \u201cIt begins.\u201d Gravity decided to take the day off as everything fell to the ceiling.<br>\r\nWendy winced in pain. \u201cAgh! Dipper. Dipper, where\u2019d you go?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn here,\u201d called a voice from within her shirt. In the fall, Dipper had somehow been wedged waste deep between Wendy\u2019s boobs. Were they not in such great peril, they\u2019d have both been more embarrassed. With the items of the store now swirling in a whirlwind, Dipper directed Wendy to run into an empty soda machine for safety.<br>\r\nSecure inside, Wendy caught her breath with her hand against her chest, along with the boy. Ever since meeting Dipper, she\u2019d been secretly fantasizing about this exact thing happening; only in the fantasy she\u2019d been a lot cooler and able to enjoy the moment without ghosts trying to kill them. \u201cWhat do they want from us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRevenge, I guess,\u201d Dipper suggested while he tried to wiggle free. Wendy\u2019s breasts were a lot bigger than they appeared through her casual clothes, and the way she was lying down squished them together pretty tightly. The rapid rise and fall of her chest made it hard for the little guy to keep his balance and he kept having to brace himself on his hands. He was touching her boobs, and they were warm.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did we do?\u201d Wendy demanded of her boob sitter. Despite her panic, the little guy\u2019s struggling against her sensitive area was causing her body to react very unfortunately. Her only hope was that he didn\u2019t notice and think she was some kind of pervert.<br>\r\nThe two had a back and forth until Dipper figured out the pattern. Everyone had been taken after doing \u2018normal teen things\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Stay here until I get back.\u201d Before she could stop him, he\u2019d already hopped out of her shirt and hurried out onto the main floor/ceiling. \u201cHey ghost! I\u2019ve got something to tell you,\u201d he declared even as he was lifted up into the air. This whole thing was giving him some seriously bad flashbacks, but he still had a mission to complete and a sister to save. \u201cI\u2019m not a teenager!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the magic faded. The ceiling was still the new floor, but everything still dropped, including him and Mabel. Then a couple of ghosts \u2013 a man and woman in their late eighties \u2013 manifested. Were they not transparent and floating, their smiles would be quite charming.<br>\r\n\u201cWell why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d asked the man with a good-natured laugh. \u201cHow old did you say you were?\u201d<br>\r\nMindful of Wendy\u2019s eyes upon him, Dipper sucked in a breath. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 twelve. Technically not a teen.\u201d<br>\r\nThe ghosts then told their backstory. They hated how teens behaved in their store, eventually getting so fed up that they banned them all. In retaliation, the teens had some kind of rap battle dance off in the parking lot. The lyrics were so \u2018hateful\u2019 and \u2018shocking\u2019 that the pair were stricken with double heart attacks. It was the most tragically hilarious thing the minizora had ever heard.<br>\r\n\u201cBut, they\u2019re my friends. Isn\u2019t there anything I can do to help them?\u201d pleaded Dipper.<br>\r\nIn fact, there was. These ghosts wanted to see a minizora do a funny dance. When Dipper let slip that he knew one, they were even generous enough to provide him a lamb costume. As the minizora swallowed his dignity and humiliated himself before these strangers, Wendy was enduring her own brand of suffering. Seeing such a cute boy in such a silly costume was unbearable to behold, but she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away. She had to resort to biting her arm until blood was drawn to keep her imagination from wandering. She\u2019d think about it later, though.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was some fine girly dancing,\u201d congratulated the ghost. \u201cYour friends are free.\u201d <br>\r\nThe lights returned to normal, as did gravity. Everything fell back to the old floor and the formerly captive teens crawled out of the wreckage, all suffering the spectral equivalent of a hangover.<br>\r\n\u201cEvil,\u201d Mabel burbled, her stomach expressing its hatred for her as she stared at a pink package. \u201cEeeviiil.\u201d<br>\r\nWith everyone still disoriented, Wendy saw fit to tell the story. Once the ghosts appeared, Dipper MacGuivered an array of slingshots that propelled him all around the room. He was like the world\u2019s deadliest pinball and battered the ghosts until they ran away crying. While everyone was in awe, Wendy turned back to Dipper and made the zipping motion, which he returned.<br>\r\nOn the ride back, Mabel was amazingly able to keep from spewing. Dipper, meanwhile, was thinking of Wendy. She\u2019d been impressed by him, covered for him, expressed an interest in hanging out further, and her chest had been so soft. So\u2026 soft. All in all, he\u2019d had worse nights.</span></div></div>",

We\u2019re huuungryyy,\u201d Mabel pleaded, pinching her stomach and shaking it. Soon dipper started doing the same as both made sounds like they were dying. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get something in my tummy quick, I might have to eat Dipper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t bluffing, man,\u201d deadpanned the minizora. Mabel had only ever swallowed Dipper by accident. The exception being that first time back when they were three and she was trying to get him away from some bullies. Later, after he\u2019d been spit up and cleaned, she\u2019d apologized until she lost her voice. Even so, it was fun to freak people out with the threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan agreed, leaving the idiot locked in the gift shop. Greasy\u2019s Diner was a local joint with a lot of character, which was a nice way of saying it wasn\u2019t up to code. There were even woodpeckers and beavers chewing on the wood. Their server was Lazy Susan, a woman about Stan\u2019s age with a dysfunctional left eyelid. After some rather forced banter, Stan ordered the cheapest item on the menu for himself and leftovers for Dipper and Mabel to split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Grunkle Stan, I want pancakes,\u201d whined Mabel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man was as stingy as ever, but then Dipper saw his chance to shine. At the far end of the room was a machine called Test Your Manliness, with the promise of free pancakes for winners. Cracking his knuckles, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry guys. Pancakes are on me. I\u2019ll win us some by beating that manliness tester.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second of disbelief, both Mabel and Stan burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s so funny? It\u2019s got a setting for minizora, so I can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Dipper, but you\u2019re not exactly Manly Manington,\u201d cackled Mabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. I am so Manly\u2026 Many or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFace the music, kid,\u201d Stan lectured. \u201cEven by tiny people standards you\u2019ve got no muscle, you smell like baby wipes,\u201d he didn\u2019t notice Mabel\u2019s eyes guiltily darting around, \u201cand let\u2019s not forget last Tuesday\u2019s\u2026 incident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Baba is awesome, but that doesn\u2019t matter. Come on, guys. I\u2019m plenty masculine. Look at this chest hair.\u201d He pulled down his shirt, catching the mid-morning light just right and magnifying it back at his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! My eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt burrrns!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Dipper decided that he was getting nowhere with just words. \u201cFine, oh family of little faith. Get ready to eat those words, with a side of pancakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper hopped down and marched over to the machine, climbing the little staircase on the side to the minizora setting. It had a scaled down handle and everything. Channeling the strength that had defeated gnomes, wax dummies, and a small army of bugs across the years, Dipper grabbed that handle and squeezed with all his might. The bottommost bulb blinked and the machine spat out a card, which Dipper thoughtlessly read aloud. \u201cCutie patootie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel screamed, burying her face in her sleeve and banging on the table as tears poured from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManly Dan, in a rare moment of sympathy for the pipsqueak, decided to do the poor kid a favor. After gently setting him down on the ground, careful not to provoke the wrath of the minizora\u2019s rabid guard dog, the man ape pushed his pinkie against the lever. The machine overloaded and pancakes were flung out to every plate in the diner. \u201cPancakes for everyone!\u201d While everyone cheered at his display, Manly Dan checked on the person he actually wanted to impress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMabel gestured for him to move along, so he did; but only because it was his decision, dammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper just sat on the floor, picking up the pieces of his shattered masculinity, when a red head showed up. She wasn\u2019t the one from the Shack, though. This lady was much older, maybe early thirties. She looked like a super model with an hourglass figure, tremendous tits, and a luscious ass that Dipper wouldn\u2019t mind sitting on him. <i>Who just thought that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squatted down closer to Dipper\u2019s level, thankfully wearing pants. \u201cHey there, sugar. Don\u2019t let yourself get down, none.\u201d Her voice was like honey. \u201cSay, yer that Dipper kid Wendy told me about,\u201d she inquired, reaching down with her thumb and trigger finger to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper swallowed what felt like a lung and accepted the offer. \u201cOh, uh, Wendy t-told you about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sure did. Mah little girl said you were quite the hero the other night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re Wendy\u2019s mom.\u201d Dipper forced a smile, remembering that this was the woman with the power to make guys fling themselves out of closed windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind mah husband, none. He\u2019s just got his own special way of showin\u2019 he cares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s, aha, nice to hear, but doesn\u2019t help much.\u201d Dipper gestured up at the machine. \u201cEven by tiny standards, I\u2019m a wimp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Corduroy smiled flatly. \u201cYa really shouldn\u2019t listen to what some dumb machine has to say. There are lots of ways to be a real man, even for a minizora. Ya just have to find the one that fits yer style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate that. I really do, but I think I just need some alone time to figure things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, suit yerself.\u201d She stood and was about to walk away, but stopped herself. \u201cJust one more thing. If ya happen on some still water \u2018n\u2019 see yer reflection in it, don\u2019t sing. Only princesses do that, \u2018n\u2019 that\u2019s about as far from manly as anyone can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper laughed, once more thanking the woman for her kindness, and departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunkle Stan turned to Mabel. \u201cYou just gonna let him go like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019d just tell me not to follow,\u201d Mabel sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to be more independent and I\u2019m trying to let him. Our therapist said it\u2019d be healthier for both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEgh. Head doctors are all quacks if you ask me, though I guess this one\u2019s not totally wrong. A lucky minizora has family that\u2019ll look after them, but things can sometimes go overboard. Ya get overprotective, smothering, and worry yourself sick. A little distance here and there really is for the best for all sides. Gives them some independence from feeling stifled and gives you a break from worrying.\u201d Grunkle Stan then took a sip of his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That\u2019s almost exactly what our therapist said.\u201d Mabel\u2019s awe then turned to suspicion. \u201cHow do you know so much about minizora?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan averted his gaze. \u201cOh, you know. A guy my age hears things. No big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense to me,\u201d allowed Mabel, fully accepting of this explanation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey there, folks. Lincoln Loud here,\u201d said the white haired boy to the audience in one of his typical episode opening fourth wall breaks. \u201cAnd welcome to this pornographic alternate reality of the Loud House. You\u2019re probably wondering what makes this different from the regular Loud House. Well, I\u2019ll tell ya. See, my mom and sisters are what we call predators. They\u2019re humans who can consume other humans alive and whole in pretty much whatever way they want. You might think that\u2019s a little odd and no doubt have some questions, so I\u2019ll try my best to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, when a predator consumes live prey, digestion is optional. If, for example, mom were to swallow me, she could just hold me in her belly for as long as she wants. It\u2019s actually pretty cozy in there. Mostly my family just vores people for fun, like as favors to friends, or how Bobby usually ends up inside Lori whenever one visits the other.\u201d Lincoln paused as he stared at the fourth wall. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. Vore is a lot of fun for both the consumer and consumed, even erotic depending on how you do it. And since most people in this house can vore, we have what you might call a very laid back attitude when it comes to promiscuity, both with each other and anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigestion does happen, but it\u2019s perfectly legal. It\u2019s the job of predators to help counter overpopulation, but preds are less than 1 in 1,000 of the world population. And if I\u2019m being honest, preds have legal protection to do pretty much whatever they want. Luckily, mom is there to keep the family in line. Digestion is only allowed for bad people and volunteers, although Lola and Lynn Jr. are the biggest offenders there, often needing to be grounded after their competition <i>mysteriously disappears</i>,\u201d Lincoln said with air quotes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that everyone in town is so accepting of us. Predators do what predators do, although it\u2019s generally frowned on to digest the kids your babysitting. Not good for repeat customers and all that. Also no one is allowed to vore teachers just because they do things like give out homework. Also-also, no one is allowed to digest each other\u2019s friends. As a result, we all have a <i>lot</i> of \u2018friends\u2019 who try to suck up in the hopes of staying off the menu, but there\u2019s also plenty of people who genuinely like us for us. Most of the time, folks just treat us normally. It\u2019s only when stomachs start growling that things get awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for volunteers, that happens more often than you\u2019d think. There\u2019s FindAPred.com that\u2019s kinda like a dating service. People can apply to be vored by predators in their area. They get to choose things like how they want to be consumed, whether or not they want to be digested, if they want sex, and some other options. They pay the pred to live out their biggest fantasy and the pred gets a fatter wallet with the possibility of a free meal. Everyone wins. Each pred in the family gets several requests a month, which leads to some awkward encounters in the morning. Luckily every bedroom also has a half bath with toilets specialized for predators, able to take either big piles of feces, or just people who really wish they could use the shower afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still do the normal family stuff. We fight for the remote and eat as a family every morning and evening. That said, the Loud preds do have to eat quite a lot. It says a lot about dad\u2019s skills as a chef that he can prepare meals for all us every day. He\u2019s even learned to prepare volunteers to enhance their flavor for whoever wants to eat them. You\u2019d think it\u2019d be awkward to hear someone moaning while being vored almost every meal, but we\u2019re basically numb to it at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. What else? Oh right. I forgot to mention if I\u2019m a predator or not. Well that answer is simple. You see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Lincoln is not a predator. Only women can vore, which means he is often at the mercy of the ladies in his life.<br>\r\nOption 2: Lincoln can eat people. He likes it fine, but prefers the pleasures of being an ordinary kid\u2026 mostly. Though there are some benefits.</span></div></div>",

I mean, how often do you hear people whining about not being able to swallow people whole. But in this house, it puts me at the bottom of the food chain, literally. I\u2019m everyone\u2019s first choice to not only bug but also devour. Don\u2019t worry about me, though. I\u2019m still the man with the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Lincoln finished his fourth wall breaking introduction he ran straight into a squishy wall. Bouncing off the soft surface, he landed on his butt before a massive looming shadow. He looked up, his view blocked by first a huge, swelling belly and then an equally huge pair of boobs. Something yellow moved from above the big knockers and the mass shifted so that Lincoln could see the ditzy smiling face of his second eldest sister, Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG Lincoln! I was just thinking about you and then you ran into my stomach. What are the odds?\u201d Considering it was the middle of the afternoon and a lot of the family was home, the odds were actually pretty good that they\u2019d bump into each other. Lincoln got up, carefully moving back so he didn\u2019t get hit again by Leni\u2019s big stomach, or worse her big boobs. The gut was caused by whoever she had devoured; probably some volunteer that saw the young blonde and thought that being her food would be sexy. The boobs, on the other hand, were from all of Leni\u2019s previous meals. Sometimes when you digest someone a little bit of mass is moved to certain body parts. If you're unlucky you get a fat midsection. Leni was lucky because the mass usually went straight to her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask you for something Lincoln? I ate this really tasty guy on the way back home and my tummy is having trouble with him. I could, like, really use a belly rub, and maybe I\u2019ll let you rub other parts of my body,\u201d Leni suggestively said, winking at her brother as she squeezed her boobs like she wasn\u2019t being subtle enough. Blushing at the offer, Lincoln wondered if the massage might lead to more between them as things often did, which might suck with Leni currently being so full. Lincoln had been squished under one too many full stomachs in his short life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln!\u201d Turning around, the young boy saw his other sister, Luna, coming out of her room, grinning happily at her brother. Whatever reason she had to be happy to see him couldn\u2019t be good. Luna only ate two kinds of people, women and her little brother. She claimed that men just tasted gross, but she didn\u2019t see her brother as a man. Every time she said that Lincoln wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man, I was hoping you\u2019d let me practice this new vore move on you that I want to try with Sam. I want to get it down pat before trying it with my girlfriend,\u201d Luna said, proudly proclaiming that she had a girlfriend. Sam was great for Luna. While they might not fit together perfectly, the other girl loved being devoured so much. Honestly, Lincoln was positive that if she hadn\u2019t met Luna, then Sam would have offered herself up as a volunteer to the first predator she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it right there, Lincoln!\u201d From out of another corner of the house came Lori, who did not look very pleased. Her breasts and ass had benefited from her diet, not to the same degree as Leni\u2019s chest had but it was obvious why Bobby put up with so much while dating her. At her angry glare, Lincoln wondered if he could hide behind Leni for protection. Those huge funbags were great for avoiding a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday you left something in my stomach while you were there. I\u2019ve been feeling it rattling around every time I move. You had better go inside and get it now, or next time I might just digest you.\u201d It was an empty threat but one that all his sisters made from time to time. Lincoln knew that no matter how angry they got with him, or how much they threatened him, they still loved him dearly. Still, Lori looked mad enough that she might forget she loved him once he got inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry girls, I\u2019m afraid you are all going to have to wait for a turn with Lincoln.\u201d Everyone froze as the biggest predator in the house, and the one they all had come to know as having the best and hungriest belly, came up to them. Mom had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the week and your brother\u2019s room is still dirty, which means it\u2019s time for his punishment,\u201d Rita Loud said with a cheeky grin. She eyed her only son, her tongue coming out to lick her lips. Lincoln blushed even brighter than when Leni offered to let him rub her boobs. Mom was a completely different kind of predator then his sisters, much more experienced and very willing to make things extra sensual when she started eating him. It had only started as he began to reach puberty; his hormones were different than most boys his age due to all the predator DNA inside him. It had certainly done wonders for his mom who had a very big set of breasts and one of the biggest butts Lincoln had ever seen. Her \u2018punishments\u2019 were often more rewards for her and him as long as he had the stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mom!\u201d the three other Louds screamed, arguing about who got him. Covering his ears, Lincoln groaned and wondered if running was a possibility. They might rip him apart unless they could reach a decision, as unlikely as that was going to be. It all came down to Lincoln then, he had to decide who he went with and fast. Looking between the older women in his family, he quickly picked the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really hope I don\u2019t regret this,\u201d Lincoln muttered to himself before moving towards his preferred family member.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mom and other sisters all reacted with varying degrees of disappointment with his choice. Lori, on the other hand, smirked triumphantly and set a hand on her brother\u2019s shoulder, just in case he tried running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d make the right choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, guys. My room\u2019s one thing, but I really shouldn\u2019t leave stuff cluttering a stomach. I know how much that bugs you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Now who\u2019s gonna rub my sore tummy?\u201d whined Leni as she tried hefting up her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo. I\u2019ll help ya, sis,\u201d volunteered Luna. \u201cJust let me practice on you afterwards, and we\u2019re square.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSquare?\u201d Leni looked down at herself. \u201cI thought I had more of a round ball shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rolled her eyes good-naturedly and pushed the swollen girl into her room, where she\u2019d no doubt commit all manner of unspeakable acts upon the agreeable ditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita sighed her acceptance. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m proud of you for cleaning up where it counts.\u201d She walked over, engaged in a brief standoff with Lori to silently assert who was still top dog, and then gave both her kids a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou two have fun.\u201d She turned and gave her rump an exaggerated shake as she left, but also smirked while neither of them could see. Besides being responsible to his family, Rita was also proud of Lincoln's cleverness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, twerp,\u201d sighed Lori in exasperation as she guided him to her room and sat him on her bed. \u201cYou know the rule. Now strip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to his fate, Lincoln slipped out of his clothes without a fuss. \u201cWhat did I leave in you, anyway? I just saw my cellphone in my room and I can\u2019t really think of anything I\u2019d risk digesting.\u201d He finished saying as he pulled down his undies and put his partial erection on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori groaned impatiently. \u201cHow am I supposed to know that? All I know is that it keeps jostling like some kind of jumping bean whenever I move and it\u2019s driving me nuts. Just get in there, get it, and get out.\u201d Hands on his shoulders, she closed her eyes, parted her lips, and leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to kiss her, Lincoln met her half way and felt her hot breath hit his face. She\u2019d eaten spicy chicken wings recently. Her moist tongue pressed against his face to begin the tasting and lubrication process. She moaned loudly, approving of her brother\u2019s flavor. As mad as she\u2019d been, eating someone she liked always seemed to calm her down. Her lips stretched to encompass more of his face as her hands migrated down his body. She grabbed a handful of his butt and giggled when he squeaked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this as permission, Lincoln took the initiative and reached out, blindly groping at the air until he found his sister\u2019s breasts. He sank his fingers into her soft and bountiful flesh. A part of him wondered just how many people it had taken to build up her rack like this, but he doubted that even she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori allowed Lincoln to continue helping himself as she did the same. With her grip on his butt as leverage, she forced more of him in until her lips were around his neck. It was fantastic having him at her mercy like this. Eating people was always a power trip, digestion or not. To have people willingly offer themselves for her enjoyment was the height of bliss. It was good from strangers, but exponentially better with the familiar flavors of her loved ones. Speaking of, as her lips pulled in her brother\u2019s collar bone, she removed a hand from his rear to find that he had a little boner. How cute. Since he\u2019d picked her over the others, Lori decided to give him a little reward for his consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln tensed as he felt the soft hand upon his member. \u201cL-Lori!\u201d he yelped, but she only moaned in answer. With light sparse, Lincoln looked down into the dark abyss of his sister\u2019s throat. For many, this was the last sight they ever saw. For him, he\u2019d seen it more times than he could count. There wasn\u2019t much time for reflection as Lori continued swallowing and jerking him. She\u2019d gotten to his shoulders, which made it increasingly difficult to reach her boobs. He felt her smile when they fell from his grasp. Experience had taught him that there was nothing left to do at this point but kick back and enjoy the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s tongue swept over Lincoln\u2019s chest as it slid through her mouth. There was a faint tang of sweat, which she liked, but mostly she enjoyed his natural flavor. All people had their own unique taste, and like even regular folks, Lori would frequently have cravings for one flavor over the other. Lincoln was just lucky that she\u2019d been craving him a lot recently. Feeling the twitching of his cock and balls in her hands, the eldest sibling sped up her swallowing until his crotch was past her lips. He sprayed his seed onto her tongue and she experienced a brief nirvana of flavor. The one thing that made a loved one taste better was their orgasm and she desperately licked at his member to coax out as much as she possibly could. Lincoln writhed and kicked all the while as she milked him for all he was worth. When his cock finally went flaccid, Lori turned her face to the ceiling. Gravity helped her brother down the rest of the way as her now free hands tracked the bulge he left down her throat and esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln slipped into the moist cavern like a limp noodle, spent after his orgasm. The gurgling walls churned as if to welcome him to their familiar embrace, which made him smile. However, while he might usually take this opportunity to nap, something bumped his head. His hand groped around the darkness until he grabbed what must have been causing Lori such distress. \u201cFound it,\u201d he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRecord timing. You must be so proud,\u201d she said, her bad mood resurrected, but less intense. \u201cSo what is it, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln felt around the object until it lit up, hurting his eyes with its brightness. \u201cIt\u2019s someone\u2019s phone. But not mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori blinked. \u201cSay what now\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. This isn\u2019t my phone. I told you I saw mine back in my room. Let\u2019s see here.\u201d After adjusting the brightness, Lincoln began searching for clues. \u201cNo password encryption. Says it belongs to someone named Susan. Ring any bells?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori face palmed.  \u201cUgh! She was the volunteer I ate right after you. She paid for an overnight stay in my stomach and I expelled her this morning. Dumbass probably wanted to take a selfie inside me, but forgot her stupid phone on the way out. She\u2019s probably half way across the state by now, or whatever. Ugh!\u201d She flopped onto her bed, causing her stomach\u2019s contents to bounce around. People in her belly were pleasant, but for some reason objects were irksome. \u201cI should have just digested it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t because you thought it was mine,\u201d Lincoln reasoned. \u201cI really appreciate that. Thanks, Lori. You\u2019re a good sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori was glad that he couldn\u2019t see how much that compliment made her blush. \u201cWhatever. So, now that you\u2019ve got it, I guess there\u2019s nothing left to do, except\u2026\u201d As if eyes were upon her, Lori turned a suspicious gaze on her pregnant looking belly. \u201cLincoln, why does it feel that you\u2019re smirking at me from in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln chuckled. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind kicking back, but that\u2019s gonna be hard for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? How do you figure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, mom wanted me to clean my room. I totally would have, if <i>someone</i> hadn\u2019t swallowed me first,\u201d he said with a shit-eating-grin. \u201cAnd since you interrupted my chore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori let out an even louder groan and smacked her forehead for her carelessness. In this house, when you interrupted someone\u2019s chores to swallow them, then the responsibility of that chore fell on the swallower. It was a rule to keep the house at least somewhat tidy, which Lori now realized Lincoln knew from the start. He was going in a belly no matter what, but any option other than mom would mean that his swallower would have to clean his room. She couldn\u2019t even do a bad job in retaliation, otherwise she\u2019d get punished worse than him. \u201cYou sneaky little pipsqueak. You tricked me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, man with the plan in here,\u201d he humble bragged while playing on the phone. \u201cNot my fault you forgot the rules. By the way, what do you want to do with this phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Lori grumpily marched down the hall to her brother\u2019s room to begin her task. \u201cI guess I can turn it in for store credit. If that idiot lost it in my gut, it\u2019s mine. That\u2019s <i>also</i> the rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln said nothing as he continued playing on the phone in his sister\u2019s gut. Susan had some pretty cool games, and a nice gallery of photos of Lori\u2019s innards. He just made himself comfortable while his sister toiled away and whispered under his breath, \u201cMan with the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what? Follow Lincoln and Lori until his expulsion, skip ahead, maybe Lincoln gets company, or should we should we switch to a different Loud?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lori frowned as she set about the task of cleaning her brother\u2019s room. Lincoln had a system for what went where, as they all did, and his wasn\u2019t too hard to figure out. The comics on the floor went on the shelf that already had comics, which she decided to arrange by title and numerical order. Normally she\u2019d never go the extra mile in cleaning someone else\u2019s room. However, she couldn\u2019t take the risk of Lincoln tattling to mom that she did a bad job, as unlikely as that was. Lincoln was a good kid and leagues more patient than she\u2019d been at his age, or ever for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made sense, of course. Lincoln was prey living in a house full of predators that treated vore as a preferred means of showing affection. And since they all loved Lincoln, he\u2019d basically been conditioned since birth to put up with that love. Thinking on that, Lori felt better about tidying up her brother\u2019s room. He\u2019d earned at least that much for putting up with the family. In fact, while dusting, she caught her hand lovingly cradling her swollen belly, which she quickly stopped and hoped he hadn\u2019t noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you\u2019ve been quite in there, twerp. Everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh yeah. Just playing around on Susan\u2019s phone. And before you say anything, I turned the brightness all the way down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s still really bad for your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually no. She\u2019s got the VoreLight app just like my phone. It\u2019s supposed to let you look at the screen in the dark without damaging your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori hummed thoughtfully. \u201cNow that you mention it, I think Bobby has that on his phone. That would certainly explain the texts he likes to send from inside me.\u201d She sighed romantically. \u201cHe\u2019s so thoughtful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe texts from inside you?\u201d questioned Lincoln. \u201cIs it too much effort to walk the zero feet to talk in person? Literally <i>in</i> person?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! You just don\u2019t get it, Lincoln. Bobby-Bubu-Bear and I are in love and we have our own special way of showing it. Besides, he mostly texts pics of himself. We still talk the regular way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I know what regular means,\u201d Lincoln joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Probably not,\u201d laughed Lori in agreement as she regarded her work. \u201cWell, I think that about wraps things up in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t that much. You know, if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think you deliberately left your room a mess just to provoke mom,\u201d she teased with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProvoke mom on purpose? Seriously?\u201d asked Lincoln in disbelief. \u201cYou have any idea how crazy that sounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sometimes people get in the mood for crazy. I don\u2019t judge.\u201d Lori shrugged noncommittally and left the room. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, mom wants me to do a grocery run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mind if I come with?\u201d asked Lana. \u201cLola\u2019s car has been making some clunky noises lately. I don\u2019t have the parts to fix it, but there\u2019s an auto shop near the grocery store.\u201d The resident handyman of the house wore overalls, a red cap, and seemed to always be dirty. There was nothing on the outside to indicate that she was a predator as her body was pretty normal for a girl her age, but she was a voracious one, if a bit picky. She often demanded that her meals roll around in garbage, mud, or other gross things before she consumed them. As such, she had a very niche appeal to a select crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the rule.\u201d Lori extended her hand. \u201cYou want a ride, you have to pay up. Favors or cash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need the cash for the parts. Got anything you need fixing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I suppose the drain in my room has been making some odd noises lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Lana cheered eagerly and they shook on it. \u201cJoke\u2019s on you. I\u2019d have done that for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori smiled as she rolled her eyes. The two \u2013 technically three \u2013 boarded onto the lovingly named vanzilla and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is that Lincoln in there?\u201d Lana asked from the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am. Lori wanted me to get a volunteer\u2019s phone from her belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana gave the eldest sibling a deadpan stare. \u201cSeriously? Again, I\u2019d have done that for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I thought it was Lincoln\u2019s phone, which made it <i>his</i> responsibility to fetch. But since it isn\u2019t, I\u2019m turning the thing in for store credit the moment I expel it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana chortled. \u201cYou mean when you crap it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d Lori snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s better to say expel, or release, or anything that isn\u2019t so, bleh, gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you really are off your game today,\u201d observed Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori sighed as Lana laughed. \u201cHeard it the moment I said it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the car ride was uneventful. The girls split up at the parking lot with Lana being entrusted to handle her own finances. With the amount of volunteers they got, all the Loud sisters had been coached from an early age on how to handle money.  Besides, Lana was a predator. No one in their right mind would try bamboozling her. Even if she weren\u2019t, she was one of the best customers for DIY shops across town. They all knew her and were thankful for her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Lori, she walked into the grocery store and smiled contentedly as heads turned. Royal Woods was a small enough town where everyone knew everyone. Even if they didn\u2019t regularly talk, they still recognized each other\u2019s faces, and everyone knew who the Louds were. Being predators meant that they were like local celebrities. Many of said locals had even been clients of the Louds\u2019 vore services. Just about everyone waved and said polite greetings as Lori went by, which she graciously returned. Even if a lot of it was fake, being born out of fear and ignorance, it still felt nice to be noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am. Will you be needing help with your shopping today?\u201d asked a young woman in a staff uniform. She was cute, maybe Luna\u2019s age, with freckles and a nice figure to boot. Lori reflexively licked her lips at the sight of her, making the young woman smile anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, there\u2019s no need to worry. I\u2019m not gonna eat someone on the clock.\u201d Lori closed the distance and wrapped an arm around the young woman\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThat would literally be so rude. And besides,\u201d she gestured down to her belly. \u201cThe space is currently occupied, Emily,\u201d she read from the nametag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gave a relieved exhale. \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s good to hear. I was a little nervous when my boss said I had to help a\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t be nervous,\u201d Lori purred as she pulled Emily close enough to touch cheeks. \u201cEven if I did eat you, I almost never digest anyone who doesn\u2019t volunteer for that service. Besides,\u201d she quickly slapped her tongue against Emily\u2019s cheek, \u201cyou\u2019re the kind of tasty treat I\u2019d hope to enjoy more than once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gave an unintelligible series of chirps as her face turned beet red. No one had ever been so openly flirty with her before. She was broken from her stupor with a sharp pain in her backside. She turned around to see the predator\u2019s fingers pinching into her butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, I won\u2019t eat you on the clock. But the moment you clock out, well, I\u2019m sure you can find me,\u201d tittered Lori as she fluttered bedroom eyes at Emily. Afterwards, Lori had effectively conscripted the young woman as her servant. She read out from her list as Emily did the work of fetching things. This was a pretty normal scene when the Louds went out shopping as stores bent over backwards to accommodate them. They still paid for their purchases like anyone else. It was their job to control the population, not crash the economy, after all. But these added services were very much appreciated. No doubt Lana was getting a similar treatment for her shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lori noticed that things were a bit too quiet. \u201cHey, twerp. You still up?\u201d She rubbed her belly to get his attention, but all she got was him shifting around and snoring. Lori gave a contented yet prideful smile. It was like the first times she\u2019d put her other siblings to sleep all over again; an accomplishment mixed with familial adoration. Remembering that she was in public, she righted herself and finished her shopping. The cart was stacked almost as tall as her, marking this as only a light grocery run. She paid, thanked Emily, met Lana in the lot, and they returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what? Keep following Lori, or try something else?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After minutes of grunting and squeezing, Lincoln fell from Lori\u2019s ass with a wet plop. Everything stunk to high heaven, which made sense given where he just was. He was in a basin in the corner of Lori and Leni\u2019s room. Beneath him was a kind of padding that had thankfully softened his drop and above him was his sister\u2019s squatting ass. It was a lovely and familiar sight that always left him smiling. Lori turned around, bottoms still around her ankles and gave him an expectant look. Lincoln held up the acquired phone and gave it a shake. Unceremoniously, Lori switched on the basin\u2019s shower and a torrent of high pressure water bombarded Lincoln from above. The jet was powerful, but only lasted a few seconds. When it was over, almost all of the leavings from Lori\u2019s bowels had been washed away. The process was effective, but nowhere near as relaxing as a proper shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori then snatched up the cleaned phone from Lincoln\u2019s hand and started fiddling with it. \u201cHmm. Not a bad model. Cashing this in almost makes up for it rattling inside me\u2026 almost.\u201d Finally she spared a glance to her brother who was having a bit of trouble standing, which was normal after someone had been devoured and pooped out. Although she was still mad it him for tricking her, it was still uncomfortable to watch her family struggle with anything. She reached out a helping hand and hefted him up. \u201cThanks again, by the way,\u201d she said while keeping her eyes on the phone. \u201cFor the record, why\u2019d you pick me, anyway? You could have picked any sister to trick to clean your room, so why me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadying himself with Lori\u2019s hand for balance, Lincoln eventually stood to his full height, naked as the day he was born and just as shameless. \u201cAll three of you wanted my help with something, but you kinda seemed like the most in need. Plus I thought I\u2019d really left something in you, so it was only right to make up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLips twisting like she was sucking on something sour, Lori eventually surrendered to her impulses. She leaned down and planted a 3 second peck right on Lincoln\u2019s lips. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make someone very happy someday.\u201d She stood and readied to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLori wait!\u201d Lincoln grabbed her wrist. At her questioning stare, he pointed down where her bottoms were still around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I am really off my game today.\u201d Again Lori squatted and shimmied her way into her shorts and panties. She didn\u2019t do so out of any sense of modesty. Casual nudity was pretty common in this family. Rather, she just didn\u2019t want to make any more of a fool of herself by tripping on her own panties. \u201cThanks again, twerp, but don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get me so easily next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll just think up something new,\u201d agreed Lincoln as he waved goodbye. Looking around, he saw where his clothes had been discarded from earlier. He still felt a little gross, so rather than putting them on, he loaded them into his arms and poked his head out the door. The hall of the upper floor was as loud and chaotic as ever; doubly so with him being in the nude. Ringing an actual dinner bell would be less effective in getting his sisters\u2019 attention. And while Lori and Leni\u2019s room was one of the closest to the bathroom, that was still a lot of hall to cover without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretending like he was a swift bunny trying to evade a pack of hungry wolves, Lincoln lied low and waited for the chance to move. Then he switched to being a sly fox so that at least he wasn\u2019t on the bottom of the food chain. Lola was pulling wheelies in her pink toy car. She\u2019d definitely catch him if she saw him, but seemed to be too busy bickering with Lana over something. Luna had just walked out of her room with a doubly bloated belly. That meant that not only would she be too slow to catch him, but that Leni was a non-factor. An explosion from the room left of his told him that Lisa was preoccupied and Lily was still too young to swallow anyone. That still left 3 sisters unaccounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah!\u201d The boy jumped and spun around, ready to fling his clothes as a distraction to make his escape, only to recognize the only other unique head of hair in the house. \u201cLucy,\u201d he sighed in relief. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask you the same thing,\u201d countered Lucy in her typical depressed voice that sounded like a perpetual sigh. As Lincoln\u2019s fifth youngest sister, she still hadn\u2019t developed that much by predator standards. She was further along than other girls her age, but not enough to warrant a training bra or anything. She also wasn\u2019t that active a predator, being very picky about her volunteers and only taking digestion requests as part of her fascination with morbidity. She wasn\u2019t yet experienced enough to eat people who were too big and there just weren\u2019t that many young people looking to be digested. However, Lincoln was well within her range if she felt the urge. Speaking of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln gestured down at himself. \u201cI\u2019m naked in Lori\u2019s room. It\u2019s pretty obvious why I\u2019m here. Less obvious about you, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Right.\u201d It was hard to see behind her bangs, but Lucy averted her eyes. \u201cWell, I was looking for you, actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s eyebrow climbed up his forehead. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to swallow me, I should warn you Lori just pooped me out, like, five minutes ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually hoping to hear your opinion on my new poem,\u201d she said while pulling the paper out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Lincoln blinked like a deer caught in the headlights. It was such a normal and benign request that it took him a few seconds to process. \u201cWell if that\u2019s all then\u2026 How about a trade? Constructive criticism in exchange for safe passage to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Lucy recited her poem and Lincoln gave his honest opinion. Afterwards, doing his best to hide behind the girl\u2019s smaller body, the pair hurried into the bathroom before anyone else could notice. They made it!

Better watch out for werewolves. Looks like a full moon tonight,\u201d said the freckled ventriloquist dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood one Mr. Coconuts,\u201d laughed Luan. Fourth eldest of the Loud siblings, Luan really had a fondness for making people laugh. Often her punchlines involved vore or sexual things, as in she\u2019d swallow someone at the end of a joke. She preferred not to digest people so that she could continue making them laugh, but her critics had long ago learned the importance of gentleness. Hecklers in general were an endangered species whenever the Louds came around. She was experienced enough to swallow people significantly bigger than herself, although the lack of digestion meant that she hadn\u2019t reaped the same bodily rewards as her other sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull moon. Ha. Ha. Ha.\u201d Lucy\u2019s laugh was deadpan and unnatural sounding, but it was hers. \u201cGood one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. I got a laugh out of Lucy. That\u2019s worth quadruple points for my daily laugh quota. Good job, me,\u201d Luan beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? I\u2019m the one telling jokes with your hand shoved up my ass. How come I always play second fiddle?\u201d Griped the dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. I\u2019m sorry you feel like you\u2019re just a number 2, Mr. Coconuts. But look on the bright side. At least you don\u2019t smell like a number two like, <i>some</i> people.\u201d Luan looked down at Lincoln with a cheeky grin and eyebrows bouncing suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, I know. I just came out of Lori\u2019s butt and I stink. If you guys would kindly leave me alone, I\u2019d like to shower in peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rubbed her chin as she pretended to think. \u201cLucy, don\u2019t the rules say that the bathroom has a three person limit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do believe it does,\u201d Lucy agreed. \u201cAnd I have been spending a lot of time in the dusty attic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s heart sank. \u201cOh, come on. Seriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, little bro. You\u2019ve got two lovely young ladies who just want to shower with you. Most guys would kill for a chance like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. \u201cSince I\u2019m not getting out of this anyway, can I at least ask that you not swallow me afterwards? I was hoping to do stuff later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters agreed and stripped down. Once all three were naked, they climbed into the tub and flipped the shower on. Because there was only one shower head, all three had to cuddle up close to share access to the stream. As a direct and entirely deliberate result, both girls began grinding themselves against Lincoln. Luan squatted enough to rub her smallish breasts against his back while taking several broad licks along his neck. Keeping her back to him, Lucy grabbed Lincoln\u2019s hands and held them around her middle while she grinded her small but pert rump into his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh. Looks like someone\u2019s trying to raise the dead,\u201d Luan chuckled as she watched Lincoln\u2019s erection rise and poke out between Lucy\u2019s butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Lucy grunted as she humped her hips more vigorously. \u201cRise from the dead, little Lincoln. Rise like Edwin from his coffin, ready to plunge his long and sharp fangs into an unsuspecting maiden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnsuspecting maiden?\u201d Lincoln asked incredulously. He pulled his hands from Lucy\u2019s grip and moved them north to cup her budding breasts. They were little more than nubs, but still super sensitive if the girl\u2019s loud moans were anything to go by. \u201cWhere would I find one of those?\u201d he whispered into her ear before giving it a soft blow. \u201cNot you, obviously. You\u2019re about as expectant as they come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d Squatting lower, Luna reached around until her fingers touched Lucy\u2019s hairless vulva, making the girl spasm from the contact. \u201cThis girl\u2019s drooling more than Luna that one time dad poured chocolate sauce on Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must be hungry then,\u201d Lincoln added, hoping to shift the focus off of himself. \u201cWant to give me a <i>hand</i>, Luan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nice one.\u201d Understanding his intent, Luan worked with Lincoln to lay Lucy down on the bathtub floor. With a somewhat sadistic grin, Luna stabbed two fingers into her little sister\u2019s sopping twat and began finger banging her. \u201cWow, Lucy. Your voice is so pretty when you\u2019re all hot and bothered. It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t show this side of you more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy couldn\u2019t speak. Lincoln was sitting off to the side and poking her cheek with his erection. She turned to face him, opened her mouth, and greedily began sucking. She closed her eyes and tried imagining that she was somewhere more macabre, like a dungeon. Her siblings were there, but they were creatures of the night, torturing her by subjecting her to their dark whims. The gloomy girl put up only a token resistance as the two fingers in her pussy became three, then five, and then the whole hand began slipping in. She cried out in bliss as her pussy was stretched, making Lincoln moan from the vibrations around his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan sank her hand deeper and deeper until she hit a wall. She tried going deeper still, but the little girl\u2019s womb just wouldn\u2019t accommodate. \u201cWow, Lucy. You really need to practice more. I can\u2019t even get past my elbow in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, ease up on her,\u201d dissuaded Lincoln as he rotated his hips to thrust his cock in and out of the girl\u2019s hungry mouth. \u201cShe\u2019s doing the best she can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she is, though.\u201d Luan tried to look serious even as her hand was stimulating the inside of Lucy\u2019s womb. \u201cLucy, you need to start eating more people. Even if you don\u2019t digest them, you need to build up your experience,\u201d she explained to the writhing goth. \u201cAnd ask to borrow some of Lynn\u2019s balls for practice. When I was your age, I could fit baby you in my pussy. And let me tell you, it felt fantastic,\u201d she gasped, both in fondness of the memory, and because her other hand was between her own legs. \u201cYou\u2019re a predator, Lucy. Don\u2019t go shutting yourself off from all the great things life has to offer you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was in heaven. Not only were her siblings using her body for their own gratification, but they were showing such concern for her wellbeing. As best she could with what little lucidity she still had, she nodded vigorously. A pressure was building deep in her core; one that Luan seemed to sense and was deliberately agitating. Lincoln\u2019s delicious cock was also twitching. Everyone in the house agreed that Lincoln was one of their favorite people to eat, but by far the best part was his cock and creamy center. She suckled more urgently trying to coax out his cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thrusting in and out for so long, Lincoln hilted in his little sister\u2019s mouth one last time. Her lips created a vacuum seal as he sprayed his load into her guzzling gullet. The rich erotic flavor finally pushed Lucy over the edge and she sprayed her juices all across Luan\u2019s arm. The eldest in the room found the whole thing hilarious and laughed uproariously. The three siblings eventually came down from their orgasmic hi and eventually found the strength to resume their shower. They were still handsy with one another, but without the lewd overtones. Afterwards, they dried off, got dressed, and went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Lincoln go, though?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAh, nothing quite like the peace and quiet of my own room,\u201d Lincoln said to no one in particular. Lori had done a good job of cleaning. She\u2019d even made his bed. As such, he\u2019d opted for a minimally messy activity and started reading one of his comics. Naturally he stripped down to his underwear to do so, since he liked being comfy. However, he\u2019d only made it to the second page when he got a signal on his Ace Savvy walky-talky. \u201cThis is agent L. Loud. Who might I ask is calling?\u201d he asked facetiously, as if it could be anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgent McBride here,\u201d replied Lincoln\u2019s neighbor and best friend. \u201cI was worried when you missed your last check in. So I waited an hour, as per our procedure, figuring you were inside someone. Glad that you\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for checking in on me, buddy. And yeah. Lori ate me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde swooned. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky. I wish Lori would eat me some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know why she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s not a picky eater like Luna. Plus I have it on good authority that she usually eats the kids she\u2019s babysitting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky babies,\u201d Clyde grumbled. \u201cWhen will it be my turn? When, I say?\u201d he wept in his usual melodramatic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to get eaten so badly, I\u2019ve got other sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame on you for even suggesting I cheat on Lori. You know my heart only belongs to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s a predator, which means her stomach is basically like the town bicycle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d really appreciate if you didn\u2019t talk about the love of my life like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough. So anyway, was there a reason you called, or did you just want to say hi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I just wanted to hear your voice. Got any plans this afternoon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thought I\u2019d kick back and treat myself to some comic reading. Hopefully no one will-\u201d The door slammed open, causing Lincoln to yelp, fumble the walky-talky, and fall off his bed. \u201cOw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Stinken?\u201d greeted Lynn Jr. As the most athletic member of the house, she was very well muscled, especially for a girl her age. Her preference for digesting people for their \u2018protein\u2019 had contributed nicely to her budding figure, but mostly to her physique. She always worked out the hardest after digesting someone, claiming that she was guiding the mass exactly where she needed it instead of letting it pool into her gut. Presently, she wore a hockey mask, roller blades, a jockstrap, and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned. \u201cClyde, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d He let his walky-talky hand go limp as he regarded the girl who was only slightly more dressed than himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, Lynn? I was trying to read in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn pulled up her mask and smiled lasciviously as she looked him over. \u201cI can see that. Anyway, I was wondering if you wanted to help me with something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s weight training, then forget it. I know what that means with you,\u201d he said in accusation. Basically it meant that he\u2019d ride around in her belly while she did her usual routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she whined. \u201cYou just did it for Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo things. First, exactly. I just got out of Lori and now I want to spend some time in the open air. And second, I thought I owed Lori a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn scoffed. \u201cIf you want to be out in the open, then do that and go outside. Don\u2019t just sit all cooped in your room like some lame shut in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have your thing and I have mine,\u201d reasoned Lincoln while making a shooing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn gave him an \u2018are you serious?\u2019 look. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get me out of here with <i>those</i> scrawny arms. Dude, even if I weren\u2019t a predator, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned. \u201cIf reasoning won\u2019t work, then we might as well resort to bargaining. I\u2019m not going inside you, so what else can I give you to get you to leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually just need one part of you inside me.\u201d Lynn turned around, bent over, and stuck out her butt. \u201cI was going to play basketball with my friends in the park. Victory is pretty much assured, but you can never underestimate the power of luck,\u201d she explained while giving her rump a wiggle. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try getting out of it by saying you\u2019re spent. You\u2019re an inert predator, which means you\u2019re not allowed to be such a light weight. Lisa told me that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s fine,\u201d Lincoln allowed. \u201cSo how do you want this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn guided her younger brother onto his bed, face up. After stripping off everything but her jockstrap, she planted her feet to either side of his waist and smirked down at him. She squatted down and fished around his underwear until she pulled out his half erect cock. \u201cThere\u2019s my favorite performance enhancer. Thanks for keeping it safe for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln glowered at his sister. \u201cHey, I\u2019m more than just a slab of meat, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a knot. Of course I do. You wouldn\u2019t be as fun to tease if you were. Now just lie back and let big sis Lynn get her fill.\u201d Slipping down to her knees, the athlete lined the cock up with her anus and began to lower herself. Her grunts were loud and her breathing was heavy as she strained to slide it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLube is for losers!\u201d Lynn snapped. \u201cIf I can take a football back there, then there\u2019s no excuse not to take a cock.\u201d Her rapid breathing continued as the mushroom head spread her anus apart and slipped further in. Her pained grunts soon morphed into moans of delight. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Lynn. Haa! Haa! Feel the burn,\u201d she muttered to herself. As a predator, she had an easier time with this sort of thing than most, but there was always that painful hurdle to overcome before they got to the good part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sucked in a hissing breath as he felt his sister\u2019s ass plant itself against his waist. On reflex he reached around to get himself a handful. She wasn\u2019t as plush as his eldest sisters, but her pert butt still felt nice. They stayed like that for a second, acclimating to the feeling of being connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn set her hands on Lincoln\u2019s chest and explored with her fingers. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d prefer if you had a bit more muscle, but I don\u2019t really mind your lankier frame.\u201d She dropped her chest down until they were practically nose-to-nose. \u201cIt makes me feel strong to put you in your place, Stinken.\u201d Lynn lifted herself up and groaned. \u201cNnngh! I feel you sliding against me, bro. Oh fuck, you feel big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly cuz you\u2019re so tight,\u201d retorted Lincoln, hands still on her ass as he felt her up. Her walls were grinding along his cock and he could feel her struggling to keep relaxed and loose. Lynn\u2019s chest rose and fell with her heavy breathing and Lincoln was hypnotized by the sight. She might be nearly a washboard, but she was still pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching him staring, Lynn smirked, grabbed the back of his head, and forced his face against her chest. \u201cYeah, you like that, don\u2019t you. C\u2019mon Stinken. Motorboat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his hands up to her back, Lincoln did just that and grinded his face across her chest. He loved the way it made Lynn moan as she picked up the pace in her bouncing. He tried to match his movements to hers to ensure maximum penetration, but he was quickly outpaced by the athlete. Lincoln was forced back down onto the bed as Lynn rode him like a proper cowgirl. \u201cC-close!\u201d he warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn took this as a call to speed up, humping with greater and greater force as her ass bounced against his hips. \u201cJ-just a bit more,\u201d she panted. Mid-hump, her hand slipped and she fell forward, planting her lips against Lincoln\u2019s in a surprise kiss. That was the last straw for the both of them as Lynn felt her brother shoot his seed up her ass hole, making her brain go white hot with ecstasy. She planted her ass firmly against his groin but kept grinding to coax out more of the hot, viscous substance; all the while her tongue had invaded his mouth and was making itself at home. The pair rode out their orgasms with Lynn spraying into her jockstrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally stopped, Lynn\u2019s legs were wobbly, but she still managed to stand. Clenching her ass to keep the lucky goop inside, she threw her gear back on and wheezily said, \u201cThanks, bro. You\u2019re my favorite cum pump.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re my favorite cum dump,\u201d he raspingly replied, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid what the others might say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStinken,\u201d Lynn chortled as she departed the room, at least showing enough courtesy to close the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShall we continue with Lincoln trying to read, or move on to something else?</span></div></div>",

She was tiny and petite, the perfect size for the junior pageants she loved so much. However, she also had the hottest temper and was prone to tantrums and revenge plots. After one too many \u2018mysterious disappearances\u2019, their mom had flat ordered the judges to do a head count before and after every competition. Any discrepancy would mean a grounding and a tanned hide for Lola, as eating someone to win was tantamount to cheating. Even so, Lola was a sneaky devil and had plenty of tricks for getting around the rules. This was the monster that had barged into Lincoln\u2019s room. \u201cI need your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and everyone else today,\u201d he groaned his exasperation. Standing, he looked the young blonde over and quickly spied the issue. \u201cWhoa, what happened to your dress?\u201d He pointed to the sizable tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was Lana\u2019s stupid frogs!\u201d growled the princess, stomping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cat or the dog I\u2019d buy, but how do frogs-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Lola whimpered as she held up the torn fabric, tears pooling in her eyes. \u201cThis was one of my favorite dresses. I was gonna ask Leni for help, but Luna still won\u2019t let her out. You\u2019re the only other person I can trust to handle a job like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Lincoln hadn\u2019t already been moved by the tears, his heart and ego had swollen with brotherly pride at her words. Adopting a serious expression, he grabbed his sewing kit from his dresser and authoritatively stated, \u201cLet\u2019s operate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in the twin\u2019s room, Lincoln sat at Lola\u2019s sewing station and got to work on the dress. Lola, dressed only in her tiara, high heels, and blue teddy bear panties paced around behind him like this was the waiting room of a hospital. Wanting to ease her worries, Lincoln decided to take her mind off the dress. \u201cSo, how have things been? It\u2019s been a while since we last talked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know how busy I can get,\u201d Lola humble bragged. \u201cTea parties, pageants, the occasional insufferable worm who dares stand in my way,\u201d she added while shaking a fist with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re not hunting people for revenge, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola scoffed. \u201cWhat? Me? Perish the thought.\u201d Her smile grew wide, showing off the gap in her two front teeth. \u201cDoes this look like the face of someone who\u2019d-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew what you were gonna say, and the answer is yes. You really need to stop eating the competition, Lola. Mom said we\u2019re not allowed to cover for you after last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the competition, though,\u201d whined Lola. \u201cSuzie\u2019s big sister threw juice all over my dress. Not spilled. Threw. I had every right to pay her back for sabotaging me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot without permission from mom you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola stomped her foot again. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m the only one who needs permission to digest non-volunteers. Leni\u2019s inside Luna right now, digesting some random guy she pulled off the street, but no one gives her the third degree about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Leni\u2019s Leni and you\u2019re, well, you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola leveled a stare upon Lincoln, eyes burning like the fires of Hades. \u201cAnd what is that supposed to mean?\u201d she asked through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one, it means that I\u2019m still working on your dress.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s words caused Lola\u2019s barely restrained rage to evaporate almost instantly. \u201cFor two, it means you keep breaking the rules while Leni doesn\u2019t. That girl doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body, but you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJunior pageantry is a cutthroat profession, Lincoln. If you\u2019re not the most ruthless on the catwalk, you might as well go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I\u2019ve helped you back stage plenty of times, but that\u2019s still no excuse for breaking the rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola folded her arms and pouted. \u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re not even a predator.\u201d The pageant princess immediately regretted her words when she heard the sewing machine go quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but mom is. A predator is making the rules for the rest of you predators, but also us prey. That\u2019s how it is and we all have to live with it.\u201d Lincoln hung his head low. \u201cI accept being at the bottom of the food chain. The least you could do is be gracious about being at the top.\u201d In truth, a part of Lincoln resented being the only one of his siblings who wasn\u2019t a predator. All of them had this amazing ability, and all he had was the tolerance to put up with it. He did, and most of the time he liked it. He understood that this was just how his sisters showed their love, but it was still hard not feeling like he was being left out; like there was some super fun party that only he wasn\u2019t invited to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola came up behind her nearly naked brother and pressed her nearly naked body against his back, wrapping her arms around his chest. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean anything by that,\u201d she said into his skin. \u201cI just\u2026 I was just blowing off steam and talking without thinking. You\u2019re my brother first and prey a distant second. You know that\u2019s how I really feel, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln gave a long, drawn out sigh and patted Lola\u2019s arm. Feeling her smile against him caused him to smile in return. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s still nice to be reminded from time to time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the tension leave his body, Lola came around Lincoln\u2019s side and planted a kiss on his cheek. \u201cThanks for the dress and\u2026 and for putting up with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019m used to both,\u201d he replied with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the record, I think you would have made a great predator. You\u2019re super considerate. I bet you\u2019d get more repeat customers than any of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the little blonde, Lincoln returned the kiss to her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice thought. Thank you.\u201d Lincoln finished patching up the dress in short order. It was good as new and Lola squealed with elation. With his little sister as his escort, on account of him still being in his tighty-whities, Lincoln returned to his room to once more attempt at reading his comics in peace.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d gotten his fill of comic reading, just in time for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner!\u201d Lynn Sr. called from downstairs. What followed was a stampede of lion killing proportions as the Loud children scrambled to take their positions at the adult and kid tables. Rita\u2019s job was to maintain order amongst the rambunctious kids, and she saw a rather sloppy violation of the house rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands on her hips in disapproval and foot tapping impatiently, the matriarch of the house said, \u201cLeni. What are you wearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d The blonde ditz stared down over her mountainous breasts, past her much more trim stomach, and all the way to her toes. \u201cMy birthday suit?\u201d she replied sheepishly. The second eldest sister had come downstairs buck naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita snapped her wrist like the cracking of a whip as she pointed upstairs. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ah. No excuses. The only ones allowed to be naked at the dinner table are the food. Are <i>you</i> on the menu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get dressed. We\u2019ll wait.\u201d That got a round of complaints from the other kids. Lynn Sr. stopped in the middle of his serving and moved the pots of food back to the oven to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job, Luna,\u201d grumbled Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me. I pushed her out almost an hour ago. It\u2019s not my fault she forgot to dress herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were the last one to vore her, so it <i>is</i> your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBogus, dude,\u201d Luna sighed her reluctant acceptance. Finally Leni returned and took her seat. \u201cSo what\u2019s on the menu tonight, pops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you asked. I was feeling nostalgic for my old recipes, so I brought back an old classic. Salisbury steak.\u201d The response from the kids was a forced cheer, followed by the clearing of a couple throats. \u201cOh, and let\u2019s not forget the other part of tonight\u2019s dinner.\u201d The Loud patriarch motioned to the four strangers lined up near the fridge. All were naked and smiling somewhere between excited and apprehensive. The first was a Hispanic man in his early thirties. He was a bit portly, but still had a handsome face and wore a confident smile. Next was a black woman in her mid to late forties. Her figure and face were on the plain side and she seemed rather apprehensive about everyone staring at her bare form. Third was a white boy no older than Lincoln. He was scrawny, trying to put on a brave face, but refused to pull his hands from his crotch. Lastly was a very small Asian woman somewhere in her sixties. She had probably been beautiful once, if that confident smirk was anything to go by, but the years had not been kind to her body. All four had been covered in sauces and spices, but not so much that they would drip on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeni, since you ruined your meal by digesting someone earlier today, I\u2019m afraid Carlos,\u201d Lynn Sr. paused to read from the list, \u201cgoes to Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Lori pumped her fist in victory and made kissy faces at the big guy. \u201cWell don\u2019t you look\u2026 filling?\u201d She licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. looked back at the list. \u201cAndrea goes to \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 Luna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so down, luv,\u201d encouraged the rocker. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to give you the time of your life on the way down,\u201d she said while tracing a line down her throat and between her breasts. Andrea, for what little her name still mattered, blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky little Zach is going to Rita.\u201d Lynn Sr. looked questioningly at his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I was craving a little boy in my tummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get that part. I\u2019m just wondering why you didn\u2019t accept someone more substantial, or at least two or three more. No offense, Zach.\u201d Lynn Sr. said indifferently to the little boy. It wasn\u2019t often Loud predators got digestion requests from people so young. Lynn had learned long ago that all people had their reasons and that it was none of his business. Besides, if eating this kid would make his beloved wife happy, then who was he to refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLastly, we have Ms. Miller. You sure you\u2019re up for this, Lucy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not too big. I\u2019m willing to give her a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie. If you can\u2019t fit her in, then I can take her so she\u2026 hmm.\u201d Rita stopped herself from saying \u2018go to waste\u2019. Just because these people were food, that didn\u2019t negate their right to some semblance of dignity. \u201cSo she can get her money\u2019s worth. Yes, that\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prey walked to their respective predators and climbed onto their plates while Lynn Sr. set about loading up all other plates with a veritable mountain of food each. Seriously, this guy had to be some kind of kitchen wizard or something to prepare so much food using only standard kitchen materials, and all on a budget. His and Lincoln\u2019s portions were obviously the smallest, but it was still plenty for them. Grace was said, and the feeding frenzy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the Louds were content to just shovel their food into their mouths, swallowing steaks two or six at a time without even chewing. Inevitably, most attention fell on the predators with prey. As things usually went, the preds started with their food\u2019s genitals. It was a good way of wetting the appetite and easing any lingering misgivings their food might have. By far the most ravenous this time were Luna and Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocker had her meal\u2019s legs wrapped around her head as she ate her out. The black woman loudly vocalized her arousal as her consumer hungrily devoured her pussy. \u201cJesus, god! N-no one\u2019s ever mmm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothin\u2019 of it, babe. I know what the ladies like.\u201d Luna licked the sex juice moustache from her lips before diving back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita\u2019s meal was quieter, but more incoherent with how he kept thrashing around. Likely he\u2019d led a relatively normal life up to this point, so having a woman\u2019s experienced mouth around his cock and balls was an entirely alien sensation. It was hard to tell if he was begging Rita to stop or go on, but at this point her courtesy was purely optional. He was on her plate, which made him her plaything until her hunger won out. Now and then Rita would share looks with her husband, smiling as she silently thanked him; not only for the meal, but for everything else she loved about him, especially his tolerance for her eccentricities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori was being unusually quick with her meal. Having already sucked the man off to orgasm, she sat him in her lap and began making out with him. That lasted only a few seconds before her lips widened and she took in his face. She caught Leni staring at her, looking bummed at having lost the meal who\u2019d applied for her specifically, but Lori wasn\u2019t terribly sympathetic. Leni should have been patient and not eaten that other guy. This current guy, whatever his name had been, would be a bit of a chore to get down, but Lori was confident in her skills as a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the kid\u2019s table, an eight year old had her face pressed against the pussy of a woman almost ten times her age. The other kids were also playing with their food, but in the more traditional sense. Lucy was exercising good predator manors by sending her food off with a smile. While that wasn\u2019t usually her style, it was the only way to taste their delicious orgasm, so she was willing to compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, meanwhile, was trying to eat in peace. Between the twins having a mini food war and the saggy old woman threatening to knock his plate over, it wasn\u2019t easy. He tried looking on the bright side of things and smiled at Lucy. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m proud of you for stepping up your game. Whatever happens, you\u2019re gonna be an even better predator in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLincoln, stop trying to make me happy while I\u2019m eating,\u201d droned the goth. \u201cThese are this woman\u2019s final moments in this world. This is a solemn and serious-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy!\u201d snapped the Asian woman. \u201cQuit yer yapping and put those lips to good use, whipper snapper.\u201d And she shoved Lucy\u2019s face back against her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln could only laugh at the scene that was as absurd as it was typical.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peeking around the corner at the adult table, Lincoln could only assume that the portly Hispanic man must have tasted well above average. His upper half had already disappeared down Lori\u2019s gullet, leaving only a very hairy ass and kicking legs sticking out. A sizable bulge had been created in her throat and chest, more than tripling the girl\u2019s width. As she\u2019d done with Lincoln earlier, Lori tilted her head back to enlist gravity in helping pull the man down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no interest in watching the rest, Lincoln turned to Lisa. The smartest member of the family, she was also the youngest active predator. Now and then she\u2019d swallow her classmates for practice, or \u2018experiments\u2019 as she preferred to call them, though she\u2019d yet to digest anyone. To date, the biggest person she\u2019d pulled into her belly was Lana, and that was with Lola\u2019s help to push her in. Lincoln had seen this happen, and seeing the way Lisa had struggled was a pretty stark contrast to the ease with which Lori was downing her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShomething on your mind, male shibling?\u201d asked the book worm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLori\u2019s really pulling that guy down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned a disinterested eye on the scene. \u201cSheems show. Whatsh your point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m just a little curious. Did that guy look, I don\u2019t know, appetizing to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Hard to shay. My diet hash thush far been limited primarily to kindergartenersh, which I would deshcribe ash having a mild shweetnessh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone has their own unique flavor, but youth is generally associated with sweetness,\u201d lectured Lola authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa don\u2019t say,\u201d Lincoln replied, grateful that the food fight was on hold. \u201cSo we talking like flavors of cake or candy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda, but it\u2019s not exactly the same,\u201d Lana chimed in. \u201cLike this lady for instance.\u201d She leaned forward and took a long, broad lick of the Asian woman\u2019s arm. The dirty twin hummed her approval. \u201cYum. That\u2019s some good old lady right there.\u201d Her enthusiasm leveled out to more of a lecture. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda hard to compare to regular food. Old lady tastes like old lady, and sweaty dayworker tastes like sweaty dayworker. At least I hope for Lori\u2019s sake he was still sweaty. A guy like that marinated in his own sweat is the best! And don\u2019t get me started on the body hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, for the love of all that\u2019s holy, don\u2019t start on the body hair,\u201d said Lola, visibly repulsed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can stand that stuff. It\u2019s bad enough going down the first time, but there\u2019s always strands that get caught in your teeth that turn up, like, days later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the best part,\u201d Lana argued. \u201cIt\u2019s like the next level of a delayed after taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled as the twins started bickering. It was just like Lana to talk about the merits of eating body hair. Even as an outsider, Lincoln had to side with Lola in finding that super gross, but that was still a very Lana thing to say. This was a girl who regularly went dumpster diving just for the fun of it. She\u2019d probably eat body hair even if she weren\u2019t a predator. In a way, it was reassuring to know that being a predator was just a part of who Lana was, and probably a pretty insignificant part compared to something like her aspirations of being world class mechanic. He\u2019d never fully understand what it was like to be a predator, which hurt a little, but at least there was still plenty about his family that he could understand. All the predators in his life had more to them than just eating people, and that\u2019s why he loved them, people eating and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFashcinating,\u201d Lisa said while jotting down in her notes. \u201cTheshe dishparate opinionsh on human flavorsh will be usheful in my reshearch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Aren\u2019t there, like, predator cook books you could reference?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShurprishingly no. There are gourmet cooksh who cater to predatorsh, doing as father doesh with bashting and shpicesh. However, there are almosht no predatorsh in the professhion of cooking. Thoshe that are have not sheen fit to record their ideash and observationsh. Rather irreshponsible if you ashk me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s more along the lines of downright stupid,\u201d Lincoln added, pretending not to hear the elderly lady scream and swear in orgasmic bliss. Besides, even if Lisa was, like, a bazillion times smarter than him in most things, he prided himself on being able to understand her on at least a conceptual level. \u201cI mean, like you guys said, dad\u2019s doing his best, but he\u2019s prey like I am. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between an old lady and a young kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I agree that thish ish a tremendoush oversight, I think you may be overplaying the shignificance,\u201d countered Lisa. \u201cTo be clear, there are different flavorsh and all predatorsh have their preferencesh. However, in my reshearch, both through tashte teshting and interviewsh with our other shiblingsh, I have deduced that all people tashte good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. \u201cOkay, now that really doesn\u2019t make sense. Remember that time we all failed to make dinner and just slapped everything we had into one dish? That tasted awful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. However, from the perhspective of every predator I\u2019ve interviewed thush far, all prey tashtesh good. While there are still preferencesh and shome people are objectively more flavorful than othersh\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Lisa grabbed Lincoln\u2019s hand and stuck her finger in his mouth. She suckled for a few seconds before releasing him with a wet pop. \u201cI feel reashonably shafe in assherting that all predatorsh find all people at leasht moderately appealing. Thish would account for why there ish sho little culinary information written <i>by</i> predatorsh <i>for</i> predatorsh. By in large, mosht are content to shimply eat their food raw. What father doesh with hish shaucesh ish much like shprinklesh on ice cream. Appealing to shome, but far from necesshary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Lincoln could look too glum at his failure to understand, a small hand was set on his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your inquiry, male shibling. I appreciate you trying to undershtand ush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, bro. Thanks for putting in the effort,\u201d Lana added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really does mean a lot,\u201d Lola said with a gentle smile. \u201cIt can be so annoying dealing with ignorant people with all these misconceptions about predators. It\u2019s nice to have someone who tries to be different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lily, burbling her nonsense baby talk, gave a small but cheerful applause while looking at Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lucy started gagging, drawing all attention to herself. The old woman had disappeared into the goth\u2019s hungry maw up to her shoulders, creating a considerable bulge in her throat; like a python swallowing a horse. However, Lucy\u2019s sounds of protest and urgent pulls away were all signs that something had gone awry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy, what\u2019s happening?\u201d asked Lola, but the black haired girl could only give muffled sounds of discontent with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa adjusted her glasses. \u201cIt would appear that the woman\u2019sh mammary glandsh \u2013 shtreet name: boobsh \u2013 became uneven and are now clogging shishter Lucy\u2019sh throat,\u201d she analyzed professionally. \u201cRecommendation, we help force her in, or pull her out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want us to do, Lucy?\u201d Lincoln said as he stood, ready to take action one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gagging and unable to speak, Lucy eventually motioned for the woman to come forward. The residents of the kid\u2019s table acted immediately. Lana and Lola stuck their arms down either side of Lucy\u2019s mouth and into her throat. They\u2019d either dislodge the clog, or force the goth\u2019s throat wide enough that her natural swallowing could do the work on its own. Lily made baby burbles that almost sounded like she was cheering for Lucy, which was certainly thoughtful. Lisa pulled out a machine and applied suction cups attached by wires along Lucy\u2019s head and throat. With no other options, Lincoln climbed onto the table and slammed his shoulder into the old woman\u2019s saggy backside. She reeked of old lady, and not in the good way that predators seemed to like. Her skin was smooth, but also very baggy and kind of gross. Lincoln tried not to think about how his arm was wedged between the old woman\u2019s ancient ass cheeks and continued to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a frantic minute, the old woman budged and Lucy resumed more normal swallowing. Her siblings weren\u2019t taking any chances, however. The twins kept their arms in her mouth, Lisa continued whatever it was her machine was meant to do, and Lincoln stayed behind the unsexy lady\u2019s bare bottom, ready to offer another shove if the need arose. Thankfully for Lincoln, the worst had already passed and soon Lucy\u2019s lips closed around the woman\u2019s ass. Lana and Lola extracted their saliva covered arms, looking proud and repulsed respectively. Lisa continued monitoring the situation until the woman\u2019s toes vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, Lucy?\u201d inquired Lincoln worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her breath and hugging her swollen middle, Lucy eventually found her second wind and looked up. \u201cThanks guys. I don\u2019t know if I could have done it without you.\u201d Muffled sounds came from her belly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It wasn\u2019t your fault. I might have pushed myself too hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m proud of you for trying,\u201d encouraged Lincoln. \u201cThat\u2019s how predators get experience, by pushing themselves. Trust me. The next time will be easier. And if it isn\u2019t, you know who to call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare moment of joy she just couldn\u2019t repress, Lucy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheck on the grownup table or stick with the kid's table?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, over at the grownup table, things were proceeding about as normal as one could expect\u2026 relatively speaking. Lori had finally finished her guy and now looked like someone had dressed up a bowling ball with limbs and a shirt. Her clothes stretched snugly across her bloated frame with no signs of tear. Clothes tailored to handle a predator were expensive, but significantly cheaper than having to buy replacements after every meal. Speaking of meals, Lori unleashed a mighty belch that shook the entire room, thereby signaling her fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon,\u201d said the eldest sister with a blush, hands resting on her tremendous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. Nice one, sis. That sure was a gas. Haha,\u201d joked Luan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019ve heard better,\u201d Luna said dismissively as she started licking her woman\u2019s toes and making her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori turned a challenging eye on her younger sister. \u201cOh yeah? Where, when, and who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna extended her fingers as she listed. \u201cLast Thanksgiving, there,\u201d she gestured with her thumb at the kid\u2019s table, \u201cand Lana. I haven\u2019t felt a rumbling in my bones like that since my last McSwagger concert.\u201d The rocker\u2019s attention was stolen by the naked woman\u2019s needful whimper. \u201cOh, somethin\u2019 wrong, luv?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019ve never felt so appreciated before.\u201d She sniffled; whatever her name was. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude. I\u2019m just the food after all. But, d-do you think we could\u2026 continue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gave her best disarming smile. \u201cGladly. Get ready for the ride of your life, beautiful.\u201d She slipped the woman\u2019s feet fully into her maw, licking even more incessantly to drive her meal wild. To keep her under some minimal control, she grabbed the woman\u2019s butt and pulled her close. The woman reciprocated by wrapping her arms around Luna\u2019s head in a loving embrace. She pulled Luna\u2019s face against her chest and sighed contentedly that after all these years, finally someone thought that she was worth their time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita said nothing, on account of her mouth being full. She\u2019d flipped the boy face down and pushed his knees against his chest. Bent as he was, his thighs and lower back had been pulled into the expert predator\u2019s lips, but he\u2019d barely moved in some time. Trying to behave by keeping still, the boy gave mewling whimpers and groans as Rita\u2019s predatory tongue teased his sensitive balls and little pecker. She even probed at his anus, which brought on a loud squeak. Being touched down there felt weird, but in a good way. Sometimes he\u2019d try looking over his shoulder in the hopes of speaking to his devourer, but she\u2019d just give him a smile and he\u2019d turn away in embarrassment. That often led to the other people at the table also giggling at his plight. Those that looked his way all had such friendly and heartwarming smiles. He wished he could say something like that other woman did. He wanted to say how grateful he was for such kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita, indifferent to the thoughts of her food, was suckling his backside like a lollipop. He\u2019d cum already and wasn\u2019t likely to do so again, but she was content to savor his flesh for a little while longer. Sitting at the head of the table, now and then her elbow would <i>accidently</i> brush against her husband\u2019s and they\u2019d share a look. It was a silent promise that every calorie she was about to consume would be burned off before sunrise. While there wasn\u2019t anything in her husband\u2019s ancestry to suggest that he was an inert predator like Lincoln, Rita was hard pressed to think up an alternate explanation. His wizardry in the kitchen was superhuman, but topping that was how he was the only man she\u2019d ever met who could keep up with her in bed. Granted, he\u2019d still tire well before she did, but he still went further than anyone else. Add onto this his good taste, yummy flavor, that cute butt, and his vore fetish, and she was hard pressed to imagine spending her life with anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Rita was so distracted staring into her husband\u2019s eyes that she started involuntarily swallowing the boy\u2019s butt. She felt his pulse quicken and his squirming increase, but paid it no mind. In her experience, such last minute jitters was a perfectly natural reaction, especially for one so young. Besides, if he wanted to back out, he should have said something earlier. Staring at Lynn Sr. the entire time, Rita\u2019s tongue lapped along the boy\u2019s smooth stomach and eventually chest. When he tried putting his hands on her cheeks to slow his descent, her body reacted on reflex. She grabbed his wrists, folded his arms, and stuffed his elbows inside her cheeks. He whined in protest, but she didn\u2019t care. His flavor was rich and her husband\u2019s eyes were dreamy. When only the boy\u2019s face was left, she waited a second to give him one last look at her loving family; easily the best thing Rita could imagine for a last sight. Then she widened her lips, pushed her tongue out over his face, and gently pulled him in before clicking her teeth shut. That was the last anyone ever saw of the boy as she swallowed and sent him where food belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas he good?\u201d Lynn Sr. asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita set her hand on her husband\u2019s while the other rested on the slight bulge in her middle. \u201cA boy that cute was always going to be good. But in the hands of a master chef like you, of course he was delicious.\u201d She emphasized her point with a light lick across his lips. \u201cMmm. I can\u2019t wait for dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Loud parents were having a lovey-dovey moment, Luna was trying something similar with her meal. She\u2019d stalled around the woman\u2019s waist and held her hips in her mouth. This gave her ample access to her food\u2019s ass and pussy. Her tongue was ravishing both, probing deeply and lapping up every ounce of flavor she could reach. On her back on the plate, the woman was moaning loudly as she was eaten out a second time. Every time the black woman looked at <i>her</i> predator, the one responsible for all of these wonderful feelings, she\u2019d breathlessly mouth \u2018Thank you\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare moment of selfishness, Leni leaned over, pulled the woman up in a sitting position, and kissed her full on the mouth. The woman squeaked in surprise, but quickly started moaning and getting into it. Said kiss became increasingly intimate when Leni\u2019s lips parted to encompass the woman\u2019s entire face. Incensed, Luna began slapping at Leni\u2019s butt to get her to stop food stealing. It wasn\u2019t until Rita cleared her throat that Leni stopped and pulled her mouth away with a wet pop, leaving the woman dazed, yet happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just doing her head, mom. I swear,\u201d asserted the ditz defensively. \u201cShe looked so cute the way she was writhing around like that. I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d Then she turned to the aggrieved party. \u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been practicing your tongue work. This lady is loving it,\u201d she said with a chipper smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom anyone else in these circumstances, Luna would be upset by the empty flattery. But from Leni, she couldn\u2019t see such remarks as anything but sincere, which made her smile. Luna caught her mother\u2019s eye, silently telling her that this was her call. With her mouth still full, the rocker said \u201cOoo-haay,\u201d and gave her elder sister an encouraging push on the butt. Rita smiled her approval at her daughter\u2019s willingness to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I totes owe you,\u201d Leni said before engulfing the woman\u2019s face once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole grownup table was aware when the woman orgasmed again as her visible body spasmed and muffled cries of ecstasy came from Leni\u2019s mouth. Reasoning that she\u2019d already played with her food enough, Luna resumed swallowing. The hips were no obstacle as she licked her way up the woman\u2019s lean back. Showing extra consideration, Leni helped to flip the woman around in Luna\u2019s gullet so that the rocker had easier access to her breasts, easily her second favorite part of the female body. Luna kept climbing up the woman until, inevitably, her lips met Leni\u2019s. They shared a giggling kiss that soon became passionate as they embraced. Tongues tangled around the woman\u2019s head for a solid minute before Luna\u2019s swallowing won out. The kiss ended with some saliva connecting their lips and the sisters exchanged loving looks. Their seats were retaken and all was well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was little in the way of chatter for the rest of dinner. Everyone had said all that they felt needed saying while the preys were still on the plates. With the meal concluded, everyone stood to carry out after-dinner procedure. All leftover food was loaded up into containers and stored in the predator sized deluxe fridge. Plates were loaded into the sink after a brief scrub. Rita was the first to go, allowing her to survey the others to make sure no one was trying to weasel out of their responsibilities. When all was finished to the parents\u2019 satisfaction, the kids were dismissed to do as they liked before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s walk had become more of a waddle thank to her new figure, but her movment\u2019s hadn\u2019t been limited too badly. She pulled out her phone as she ascended the stairs, already chatting with her boyfriend. \u201cHey, there, Bubu-Bear. Guess who got to eat Leni\u2019s <i>leftovers</i>?\u201d she hummed melodically. At Bobby\u2019s eager reply, she held out her phone, angling the camera down for a full body selfie, and hit send. \u201cDid you get that, Bubu-Bear? Uh huh. No, it was just one guy. A big one. Aww. That\u2019s so sweet of you to say. Aww, I wish you were here too. You know I sleep better with my snuggle bear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to show off, Luna raced ahead of Lori up the stairs. Her meal hadn\u2019t slowed her down in the slightest. \u201cSo long, wide load,\u201d she teased before rushing to her room. She stroked her hand lovingly over her belly and said, \u201cSorry for the rough ride, babe. No, don\u2019t say that about yourself. You\u2019re beautiful. You wouldn\u2019t have tasted as good if you weren\u2019t. Trust me.\u201d Luna then grabbed her axe and sat on the bottom bunk, legs apart to make room for her bloated belly. \u201cHow about a nice little lullaby to sing you to sleep. I wrote it especially for all of the lovely meals who gave themselves to make me what I am today. So thanks.\u201d She stroked the strings and began to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy, however, was in dire straits once more. \u201cUuugh!\u201d she groaned between periodic belches. The goth took only a single step before falling forward. Only her massive stomach saved her face from colliding with the floor. \u201cSigh. Life alert. I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha. Good one Lucy.\u201d Rather than helping right away, Luan\u2019s grin became sadistically playful as she lightly kicked at the goth\u2019s side, causing her to roll. \u201cHoly cow! Hey Lynn. Up for a game of Lucy ball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I?\u201d Lynn excitedly stated more than asked as she ran up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow girls,\u201d Rita chided. \u201cBe nice to your sister. You\u2019ve all overeaten before, so you should know what she\u2019s going through. At least take her to her room, first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, mom,\u201d Luan and Lynn saluted, grabbed the goth from either end, and hefted her up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh the humiliation. To be reduced to nothing but an object for my sisters to literally kick around. Siiigh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell. Was that her happy sigh or sad sigh?\u201d inquired Luan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe led with a morbid monologue, so I\u2019m pretty sure that was happy,\u201d reasoned Lynn. \u201cBut hey, good on you for pushing your limits, sis. Only way to get ahead in this world is to give it a hundred and ten percent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Rita as the last predator in the kitchen. A lifetime of eating people had given her a truly impressive frame. Not only were her womanly assets top tier, but 6ft 2in, her physique was practically Amazonian in proportions. As such, the boy in her belly wouldn\u2019t have even been noticeable if he wasn\u2019t moving around so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got a squirmer,\u201d teased Lynn Sr, setting his hand on his wife\u2019s belly. \u201cThis is why you ought to have eaten more, so there wouldn\u2019t be so much room in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually like it when they squirm,\u201d tittered Rita as she lovingly stroked her tummy. Her food was saying something, but she tuned it out. \u201cI always have, but now it reminds me of when I felt the kids moving inside me for the first time.\u201d She kissed her husband\u2019s cheek. \u201cSorry for not giving you the big belly you wanted, but when I saw this boy\u2019s application, I just couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind. If you hadn\u2019t taken him, he might have gotten cold feet and either rescinded the offer or picked someone else. It\u2019s not like we could have held him until more kids came along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny you should mention that,\u201d Rita replied, her scheme evident in her expression. \u201cWith the money we\u2019ve been making from volunteers lately, I was thinking about creating an extension to the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr.\u2019s brows rose in intrigue. \u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Rita asserted flatly, not wanting to set off a false alarm that would send the whole house into a panic. \u201cNot yet, anyway. I was actually reading online about how some predators keep their food in pins. You know, like a barn to keep the livestock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. scratched his chin as he thought. \u201cIf we keep them, we\u2019ll have to feed them. That might put too much of a strain on our food budget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily. Legally we\u2019re obligated to feed them, but we can just give them discount stuff. And with us predators switching more towards <i>paying</i> prey instead of mountains of steaks\u2026\u201d Rita trailed off with a coy grin, still rubbing her belly. \u201cI\u2019ll need Lisa to check the math, but I\u2019m pretty sure a barn would actually save us money in the long run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I suppose I can see that,\u201d Lynn Sr. allowed. \u201cBut what will they do in the mean time? It seems unreasonable to just have them locked away without anything to keep themselves busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita pursed her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s the only part that seems a little tricky. From what I read, most predators who use pins keep their food <i>here</i> the house as, well\u2026 slaves. There\u2019s no dancing around it. Most pin users have their prey do things like keep the house tidy, or even go out and work to pull in some extra income.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. nodded, understanding the dilemma fully. \u201cIf we have the food do the chores, then the kids could end up lazy or even entitled. And there goes 17 years of good parenting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita smiled gratefully at her husband\u2019s priorities. Questions of morality weren\u2019t really a factor when it came to predators, especially not since anyone they put in the pin would be a volunteer. It went without saying that they couldn\u2019t risk holding a non-volunteer for any period of time. They might try to escape and hurt someone. No, the main issue with the pin idea was keeping the kids from being spoiled\u2026 along with all the other problems that they couldn\u2019t think of just yet, but would inevitably turn up at the worst possible time. \u201cIt was just a thought, honey. We can take our time to work out the details. For now\u2026\u201d She tapped suggestively at her belly. \u201cLet\u2019s send this kid out the same way he came in; with a bang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn Sr. growled romantically, grabbed his wife\u2019s wrist, and pulled her along to the master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Louds engaged in more benign activities. After the day he\u2019d had, Lincoln felt that he\u2019d earned some solitary video game time in the living room. Leni, after putting Lily to bed, retired to her room to work on the 10 piece puzzle that had been stumping her for the last week. Since it was too late for experimenting, Lisa decided to clean her work area and take inventory of her materials, just in case her siblings had swiped something or the beakers grew legs and ran off again\u2026 not that that had ever happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the peaceful winding down of another day in the Loud House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPick up with the Louds on a holiday Monday morning, regular Monday, or later?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln awoke sometime around the crack of dawn that morning, his bladder beating his alarm clock to the punch. That was probably for the best, since it meant that he might have a greater chance of beating his sisters to the bathroom. After quickly dressing and performing some basic warmup exercises, the middle Loud ran a mental list of what he\u2019d be dealing with. It might have been Monday, but it was a holiday, which meant that the family had time to \u2018enjoy\u2019 themselves, as opposed to the weekday morning rush. Lori, Luna, and Lucy would most likely be preoccupied with their predator bathrooms. Mom and dad weren\u2019t a factor since the master bedroom had its own fully furnished tub and toilet. Leni might still be dealing with the remains of the guy she ate yesterday afternoon, and Lily was still being potty trained. This left five sisters to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln poked his head out the door to survey the hall that connected his siblings\u2019 rooms; aka: the war zone. It was quiet. Too quiet. Alas, his bladder informed him that he didn\u2019t have the time for patience, so he stepped out. Living in a house full of predators, Lincoln had learned a lot about their instincts. For one, it was almost always a bad idea to run from a predator as that risked triggering their chase response. The trick was to move at a brisk power walk and keep calm. Predators could smell fear. Or that might have just been sisters. Either way was a concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing through!\u201d Lynn stormed out of her room on her bike, naked except for a catcher\u2019s mask and her lucky jockstrap. She wielded a hockey stick and battered a ball that Lincoln only dodged because he\u2019d been expecting something like that. At least that was one sister accounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up to the crossroads between the rooms of the twins and the youngest Louds, Lincoln listened carefully. Lola and Lana were bickering about something, which was normal, if a bit early. It also meant that they\u2019d most likely be preoccupied for a while. There was only silence from Lisa and Lily\u2019s room, which was disconcerting. After so many years of Lisa\u2019s science experiments, the absence of explosions or other chaotic sounds from that room was somewhat unnatural. Seeing no point in looking a gift horse in the mouth, Lincoln hurried on through, only to slow back down after passing the doors. There could still be predators lying in wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah!\u201d Lincoln jumped, spun to face the disturbance, and adopted a defensive pose. When he saw only Lucy, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHow do you always do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shadows are my friends. They allow me to slip into places unseen,\u201d replied the goth cryptically. \u201cThe shadows also whisper that you need to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt this time of morning, I\u2019d say that\u2019s more common sense,\u201d he replied plainly, relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed an escort? I owe you for your help yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure. That\u2019d be appreciated.\u201d With a gentlemen\u2019s bow, Lincoln extended his hand to take Lucy\u2019s and they walked side-by-side to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Leni came out of her room in her night gown and waved at the approaching pair. \u201cHey guys. Want to join me in the shower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later. I\u2019ve gotta go number two first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Then by all means.\u201d Leni motioned the boy ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Lincoln questioned hesitantly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some trick to let my guard down so you can eat me, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Lincoln. Don\u2019t be silly. No one\u2019s gonna eat you <i>before</i> you use the toilet, except maybe Lana. That\u2019s just bad manners and all kinds of gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln face palmed for forgetting something so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done my part. You can take him from here, Leni,\u201d Lucy said before heading back. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go finish writing Ms. Miller\u2019s eulogy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind them, Leni slipped out of her nightgown and shimmied out of her panties before tossing both into the clothes\u2019 basket. She had no shame about bearing her impressive ass and globular breasts for her brother to see. In fact, for no particular reason, she fully bent over and touched her toes before glancing over her shoulder. \u201cLike what you see, Linky?\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing from the lewd sight, Lincoln clamped his legs together while hopping between his feet and gestured to the toilet. \u201cUh, bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind waiting.\u201d Leni turned around and cocked her hip as one hand stroked under her breast. \u201cHmm. Lincoln, do my boobs look bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had already planted himself on the toilet to do his business, pants around his ankles, but found it difficult with someone watching him. \u201cUh, can\u2019t this wait? You know I\u2019m a shy pooper. Besides, since you digested a guy yesterday, the answer\u2019s probably yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know that. But I mean, like, more than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed his exasperation. \u201cIf you get in the shower, I\u2019ll help you check as soon as I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Linky,\u201d she chirped, walking with a swagger past the boy on the toilet. She unnecessarily bent over to turn on the shower, pushing her butt in his face. \u201cWhat about here? Am I bigger here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeniii!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You told me not to look, so I\u2019m not looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was technically true, but no less annoying. \u201cPlease just get in the shower already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Just so long as you hurry up with your teeny tiny prey poop,\u201d she giggled as she climbed in and pulled the shower curtain closed, giving some tiny semblance of privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed his relief\u2026 only for the door to slam open as Lola rushed inside. \u201cHey, occupied!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d questioned Lola, glancing at the tub. \u201cHow many?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the two of us. So you\u2019re good,\u201d replied Leni helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d Lola locked the door to ensure that the rule of three would be followed. Strutting confidently over to the hamper, she also stripped bare before strutting to the shower like she was on the catwalk. \u201cYou <i>will</i> be joining us, won\u2019t you, Linky?\u201d Her voice was sweet, but her smile assured that this was not a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned. \u201cSomeday\u2026 someday I\u2019m going to make it to the bathroom and get out without any funny business from my sisters,\u201d he quietly avowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. Keep dreaming, mister,\u201d said Lola dismissively. \u201cNow hurry with your teeny tiny prey poop so you can do your brotherly duties and help your sisters shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hung his head in defeat and quietly motioned her to go on into the tub, which she thankfully did without a fuss. She\u2019d already won, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Leni! Did your boobs get bigger?\u201d Lola\u2019s voice echoed off the tub and tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right. They totes look bigger. Like, bigger than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Let me feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln turned a dumbfounded expression on the shower curtain and those who lay beyond. \u2018Seriously?\u2019 he mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, mamma! It feels like they\u2019re a full millimeter bigger than last time.\u201d Lola went quiet and Lincoln could practically hear the gears in her head turning. Lincoln also saw the silhouettes of the smaller blonde jump onto the bigger one\u2019s chest. \u201cWho did you eat, woman!? What was in that guy that got you to grow so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. He never gave his name,\u201d whimpered Leni as the tiny terror overpowered her. \u201cHe just came up to me, said I was pretty, and that he wanted to make me even prettier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA guy off the street?\u201d asked Lola in disbelief. \u201cDid he at least pay you first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no. He had this kit full of makeup, though. It was some really nice stuff. They were all brands that are only being sold by that new makeup store. Which, come to think of it, was just across the road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Leni. I don\u2019t think that guy was a volunteer,\u201d Lincoln offered. \u201cIt sounds like he was a store employee trying to sell you makeup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh uh. He was totes a volunteer. I asked him to strip for me and he did.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola groaned. \u201cUgh. Of course he did. You probably batted your eyelashes and pushed up your perky boobs-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, that hurts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-until no sane person could resist.\u201d Lola\u2019s tone shifted from irate to impressed. \u201cLeni, you sneaky devil. You actually manipulated someone into volunteering. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did? Wow. I wasn\u2019t even aware I was doing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola hopped back down to the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s cuz you\u2019re a natural, sister. A true hunter doesn\u2019t go looking for prey, but makes the prey come to her. Speaking of which.\u201d The tiny blonde snapped her fingers impatiently. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed that he hadn\u2019t been forgotten, Lincoln flushed the toilet, stripped, and climbed into the tub with his sisters\u2026 again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHere. Let me help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lincoln could ask what she meant, Leni had picked the boy up under his arms, turned him to face away from her, and wedged his scrawny body between her titanic titties. Fearful of falling, he wrapped his arms around the sides. However, when Leni pulled her hands away, Lincoln didn\u2019t budge an inch, much to his and Lola\u2019s surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! I\u2019ve finally got boobs of holding, just like mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Lincoln looked down. Breast flesh took up the entirety of his vision and completely obscured everything below his chest. \u201cWow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComfy, Linky?\u201d Leni asked while pressing on the sides of her breasts. \u201cMmmh. This feels nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 kinda does, actually,\u201d he conceded while reclining into his\u2026 carrier? Leni\u2019s skin was soft and warm and the steady rhythm of her heartbeat against his back was relaxing. \u201cMmh. I think I could get used to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s really sweet of you to say, Linky. Hey, I should try this on Lynn next. What do you think, Lola?\u201d No answer. Leni bent forward a couple inches to peer over her mountainous chest at the pouting blonde. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is your boobs are almost as big as me. It\u2019s not fair!\u201d The little princess stomped her foot in a mild tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually completely fair,\u201d Lincoln dared to argue. \u201cShe\u2019s older, so of course she\u2019s, ya know, bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s just cheating, somehow. She\u2019s got some kind of secret diet that she\u2019s not telling us about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s expression was deadpan. \u201cReally. You think that <i>Leni</i>, of all people, could keep a secret to sabotage others from being as pretty as she is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola averted her gaze. \u201cWell anything can sound absurd when you say it like <i>that</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola, I promise, I\u2019m not on any kind of special diet. If I am, it\u2019s totes not on purpose. Besides, you\u2019re still in your tiny adorable phase. As soon as the boobs come in, they basically kill the adorable factor. If there\u2019s one thing Lola Loud knows how to do, it\u2019s working with what she\u2019s got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola huffed and turned away with a grumble. \u201cI guess that\u2019s true. Not like I can argue with the power of cute.\u201d She looked down at herself. \u201cAt least I can still see my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for sticking up for me, Linky. I knew I could count on you.\u201d With most of his body still engulfed in her breasts, Leni wrapped her arms around her brother, squishing her mammary glands even more tightly around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 breathe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops, sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln panted. \u201cNo worries. Besides, I was literally already in the middle of it. It was either diffuse the situation, or be on the business end of Lola\u2019s wrath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was still really sweet of you.\u201d Hugging more gently this time, Leni pulled Lincoln up a ways until her lips were pressed against his neck. She inhaled deeply and took a long, sensual lick, making him shudder. \u201cMmm. You know, you never did give me that tummy rub, but I\u2019ll settle for a boob rub instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSettle. Hmmph!\u201d huffed the smaller blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know how to make that frown turn upside down.\u201d Without further ado, Leni hoisted Lola up in the air and deposited the little girl into her cleavage, face-to-face with Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair just stared at one another in awkward silence. They were naked, their bodies pressed against one another, they were surrounded by Leni\u2019s rockin\u2019 rack, and Lincoln was experiencing an involuntary physical reaction that was poking his sister\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to recover from Leni\u2019s brazenness, Lola began to grin. \u201cFancy seeing you here, mister.\u201d She wiggled to adjust her position, making Leni groan. \u201cWow, this is comfy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola. Don\u2019t squirm so much. My boobs are really sensitive right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cAnd there it is.\u201d The white haired boy would have elaborated, except his mouth had been overtaken by his little sister\u2019s. Lola was kissing him at full force while grinding and undulating her body against his. Leni was crying out loud enough that half the house could hear her. Despite foreseeing this, Lincoln still couldn\u2019t react in time to stop the little girl\u2019s hand slipping down between them and grabbing his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough of that,\u201d Leni said authoritatively as she extracted the smaller blonde from her busty hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Leni. Things were just getting fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I wanted a boob rub, not a boob\u2026 whatever you call it when two people start going at it while on top of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a term for that,\u201d observed Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is I just wanted to relax with my family massaging me. If you can\u2019t keep it in your pants, then I\u2019ll just have to keep you in mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking abo-oh no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her usual carefree grin, Leni slipped Lola behind her and wedged the smaller girls face into her ass crack. \u201cMmh. Now <i>that\u2019s</i> what I call relaxing,\u201d she hummed contentedly before looking down at Lincoln. \u201cC\u2019mon, Lincoln. Pretty please, give me a boob rub?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Lola\u2019s muffled protests from down below, Lincoln obliged and got to rubbing. He attempted long, rhythmic strokes, covering as much skin as possible with the entirety of his arms. Careful not to go too fast and risk upsetting whatever arbitrary standards his big sister had set, Lincoln was relieved when she gave another contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Lola was not happy. Leni\u2019s stupid, smelly butt was all around her face. No, it didn\u2019t matter how soft it was or how her natural musk was alluring. Lola Loud would not suffer such an indignity\u2026 without a fight. Unfortunately, she had little leverage in this position, and Leni was significantly stronger. It wasn\u2019t long before the pucker twitching against the princess\u2019 nose began to open and grab around the little Loud\u2019s face. A flurry of curses flew from her lips that could have peeled paint, but they were ignored by the larger pred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni bit her lower lip as she felt her anus stretch around her sister\u2019s head. \u201cLola\u2019s putting up a real fight back there,\u201d she told her brother. \u201cNot enough to get out, but it feels sooo gooood.\u201d Aligning herself under the shower stream, Leni decided to have a seat. The younger Loud was trapped between a hard place and a soft tunnel and quickly forced deeper in. \u201cMmmh. That\u2019s it, Lols. I love it when you wiggle like that. And Linky, don\u2019t stop on my account. I know you like this, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the mention of his name, Lincoln resumed his breast massage. He listened carefully to his sister\u2019s moans and tried to discern the spots that got the best reactions. In listening, he could also make out Lola\u2019s ravings. The words were muffled, but the sentiment was clear. \u201cI hope Lola won\u2019t be too mad when she comes out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe never is,\u201d Lola hummed. \u201cShe puts up a fuss, but I know she like\u2019s my butt. Before you came in, I caught her staring back there a bunch, even when she should have been looking at my boobs.\u201d She sucked in a breath through her teeth. \u201cNow only her little feet are outside me. Hehe. Her toes tickle.\u201d Leni wrapped her arms under her breasts and around her brother, holding him tight without being constrictive. \u201cMy brother in my boobs and my sister in my butt. This is the best massage a girl could ask for.\u201d Reaching between her breasts, she grabbed Lincoln\u2019s chin and turned him to face her, just in time to plunge her tongue into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln felt his eyes roll into the back of his head. His sister\u2019s saliva was euphoric. Combined with the steady rhythm of her heart and the warmth of her grand breasts, and his eyelids were becoming dangerously heavy. As if sensing this, Leni ended the kiss, leaving only a single strand of saliva connecting their lips before the shower washed it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Linky. I can always count on you for a good time.\u201d Still sitting, Leni extracted her brother and set him down beside her, careful to make sure he could still stand on his own. Afterwards she stood and encouraged him to join her in more platonic washing. He tried, but it was distracting being so close to an ass full of sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally finished cleaning. Lincoln put his old clothes back on, but Leni just walked out naked. It wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d gone back to her room that the boy finally noticed his painfully erect penis. \u201c\u2026 dang it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow Lincoln as he deals with this latest dilemma, or skip ahead to the next one?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln was in quite the peculiar position. His sisters almost never left him with blue balls. Leni must have been distracted with having Lola moving in her butt. No big deal. All he had to do was leave the bathroom, go into Leni\u2019s room, and politely ask her to finish what she started\u2026 and hope she didn\u2019t take things too far. Piece of cake, right? As if. Psyching himself up and mentally running through the best word choice to \u2018guide\u2019 Leni into doing what he wanted, Lincoln readied to head out. His face was immediately hit by the door swinging open. \u201cCan no one in this house open a door without tackling it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops. Sorry, bro.\u201d Dressed in her purple night shirt with the skull insignia, Luna reached down to help her brother up. \u201cWhoa, dude. That\u2019s a mighty fine tent yer pitchin\u2019.\u201d Luna\u2019s lascivious grin turned sour. \u201cI didn\u2019t jus\u2019 catch you tryin\u2019 ta rub one out, did I? You know mom\u2019s rule on masturbation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cI know, but that\u2019s the issue. See, we were in the shower, when Leni shoved me in her giant boobs and asked for a massage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola was kinda acting up, I guess, so Leni shoved her up her ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh hmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I guess that she got so distracted with Lola that she,\u201d Lincoln gestured down to himself, \u201cleft me high and dry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckled. \u201cMajor bummer. Oh well. Sucks to be her.\u201d She lifted her younger brother up and tossed him over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes. \u201cC\u2019mon, bro. Let\u2019s get you taken care of.\u201d She patted his butt possessively as she walked down the hall to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but can we make this quick? I was planning on hanging out with Clyde, today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna tsked. \u201cSo demanding, li\u2019l bro. Almost sounds like yer takin\u2019 our services fer granted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln couldn\u2019t see it, but he could feel Luna\u2019s teasing smirk. He took a few calming breaths before he said something he\u2019d regret. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just been an especially hectic 24 hours. Also I can\u2019t believe Leni blue balled me like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I agree with. It\u2019s not like her at all,\u201d said Luna as she entered her room. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little dude. Big sis Luna is gonna take good care of you.\u201d Closing the door behind her, she set Lincoln down on her top bunk. \u201cComfy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. So, what\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomethin\u2019 special, dude.\u201d Luna ascended the ladder with her laptop in hand. She sat down behind her brother and planted him in her lap. The rocker made sure to lean extra far forward so that her breasts pressed against his back as she set up whatever she was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sniffed the air. \u201cAre you wearing perfume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna froze, her body going rigid. \u201cUh\u2026 no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln took several more sniffs, following the scent to Luna\u2019s armpits and neck. \u201cYou are!\u201d he exclaimed in accusation. \u201cI thought you hated perfume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I hated it. I just\u2026 thought that maybe, ya know\u2026\u201d Luna averted her gaze and gave off other signals of discomfort. \u201cIt was time for a change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning tersely, Lincoln reached out and closed Luna\u2019s laptop. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t take that tone with me, little dude. You know what I can do to you,\u201d she warned while roughly grabbing his shoulders and spinning him around to face her in her lap. She cut an imposing figure with plenty of muscle built up from years of eating people. Between the muscles, the height, and raw sexual allure, she could easily snap the little boy like a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, however, was unfazed by the empty threat. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever tone I want, cuz I\u2019m your brother and you\u2019re acting weird. So you can either tell me what\u2019s going on, or we can go the nuclear option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s pupils shrunk to pinpricks. \u201cY-yer bluffing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sucked in a breath and readied to yell with all of his might to summon the other sisters for an intervention, only for a hand to slap over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright-alright! You made your point,\u201d Luna whisper hissed. She exhaled her defeat. \u201cFine. See, the thing is that tonight is\u2026 is date night for me and Sam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Not seeing the issue yet, but okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Sam\u2019s a really cool chick. I like hangin\u2019 with her, but lately things have been gettin\u2019 a little\u2026\u201d Luna rubbed the back of her neck apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that works. See, Sam and I don\u2019t really have all that much in common. She likes being eaten and I like eating her, but that\u2019s, like, 90% of what we do together. I thought if I changed things up a little, maybe she\u2019d see me as more than just a pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln sighed. \u201cSorry to say this Luna, but that\u2019s one of the stupidest things I\u2019ve heard all week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna reacted like she\u2019d been slapped right across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018just a pred\u2019,\u201d he quoted derisively. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>her</i> pred. Everyone in the house knows it. Heck, I\u2019ve seen how you two look at each other. Trust me. There\u2019s nothing stale about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln set his hands on his hips and confidently pushed his chest out. \u201cAs prey living in a house full of preds, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve learned a thing or two about predator/prey relationships. It\u2019s like the difference between people who volunteer only once vs repeat customers who always apply for the same predator. They\u2019re smitten, and Sam\u2019s definitely got it bad for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sniffled, fighting the tears pooling in her eyes. \u201cR-really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so what if most of what you do involves vore? Can\u2019t be worse than Lori texting Bobby 24/7.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckled while pressing her forearm over her eyes. \u201cDammit, dude. How do you always know the right things to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, man with the plan here.\u201d Lincoln gestured at himself. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the girl with the sound. You\u2019re always there to help us when we need just the right sound for cleaning, or taking action, or even just going to sleep. That\u2019s pretty much our thing and we get along just fine,\u201d he reminded plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna yanked Lincoln forward and buried his face in her chest as she nuzzled the top of his head. \u201cThanks fer sayin\u2019 that, bro. I really needed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln turned his head so that at least he could breathe. \u201cHappy to help,\u201d he strained to say. \u201cThat said, this isn\u2019t exactly helping with my boner issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops. Sorry. Here, let me get you started.\u201d Luna proceeded to strip Lincoln bare. Her dexterous hands moved with practiced ease in the familiar task. Like eating him, the sisters had lost count of the number of times they\u2019d stripped him, except maybe Lisa. When Lincoln was bare, Luna smiled down at him and wiped a bit of drool from her lips when she beheld his exposed cock. \u201cSmugglin\u2019 some sausage, aye bro?\u201d She tittered. \u201cIt ain\u2019t that big, but I can tell it\u2019s mighty juicy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hunched over and tried covering his naughty parts. Whether she meant to or not, Luna always had a way of making him feel self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t hog the meat all to yourself, bro.\u201d Luna set a finger beneath Lincoln\u2019s chin and forced him to meet her look. Her eyes were gentle, yet lustful. Her smile was kind, but also drooling. \u201cJust because I prefer pie over sausage, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019ve got the yummiest wiener I\u2019ve ever tasted. You know that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln relaxed a little. For predators, complimenting someone\u2019s taste could mean different things depending on the context. Mostly it just meant that they were hungry. But with those they cared about, especially in the tone that Luna just used, it was a way of saying \u2018I love you\u2019. Luna might like to tease her only brother, as did the others, but she still cared about him. Lincoln decided to return that affection with a quick peck to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa!\u201d Luna pulled away, giggling. \u201cNot so fast. Save it for the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. What\u2019d you think the laptop was for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln turned to find that the machine had finally booted. Luna had brought up the webchat and was adjusting the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the feed. Everythin\u2019 comin\u2019 through?\u201d Luna asked as a face appeared. It was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is looking for some video phone sex, Luna's audience for her web show, other predators for her to show off to, someone else, or an interruption?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blank feed suddenly gave way to the bedroom of Sam. From what could be seen, the blonde with the blue streak in her hair was dressed in a lacy red bra and panties that were practically see-through. Possibly her night clothes, but based on her expression, more likely something she wore special for this call. Sam sat cross-legged on her bed against the headboard and was practically bouncing with anticipation.  \u201cHey there, Luns.\u201d Sam tilted her shoulder forward and gave a playful wink. \u201cHow\u2019s my hungry girl doing today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic now that I\u2019m lookin\u2019 at you, luv. Aww, you know the red one\u2019s my favorite,\u201d Luna cooed. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ribbon just waitin\u2019 to be torn off a present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is?\u201d Sam asked, feigning shock. \u201cI would never have guessed. Oh, and who\u2019s this handsome devil?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sam.\u201d Lincoln casually waved, unbothered about being seen in the nude, though he was blushing at the thought of what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, little dude? You here to help with Luna\u2019s big opener?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong story short, yeah. I suppose I am.\u201d Lincoln leaned back until his head rested against Luna\u2019s breasts. \u201cIs this about that thing you wanted my help with yesterday?\u201d he asked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet your tiny pale ass it is.\u201d Luna slipped out of her night shirt, revealing no bra or panties. This earned an approving whistle from Sam. \u201cHold your horses, luv. Not done yet.\u201d Luna pushed the laptop a short distance away, and laid Lincoln down flat on the bed, but at an angle. Making sure the camera caught everything; she planted her muscular knees to either side of his scrawny hips as her pussy loomed imposingly just above his pole. \u201cCan ya see alright, luv?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded eagerly. \u201cGot the faces and the crotches.\u201d She squealed with glee. \u201cI love it when you fuck your brother. It\u2019s so\u2026 naughty!\u201d She licked her lips for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproval achieved, Luna set one hand on Lincoln\u2019s chest and slowly descended upon him. She hissed when his tip touched her lips, the sudden stimulation sending shivers up her spine, but pressed on. Even drawing things out for the sake of her audience, it still took only ten seconds for Luna to hilt herself. \u201cSee, this right here is why mom doesn\u2019t let us have sex toys,\u201d she said with a confident smirk. \u201cWhy waste the money when family\u2019s better, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was fanning herself as she brazenly pulled her panties aside and fingered her pink nether lips. \u201cGod, that\u2019s sexy!\u201d she panted. \u201cEven if you did have a toy, they\u2019re nothing compared to the real thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was breathing heavily. Luna might not have had a full belly, but she was still pretty heavy. Her great weight squished him against the mattress as her thighs blocked his side view. Forward there was the lovely breasts and confident smirk of his musical sister, and looking \u2018up\u2019 was said sister\u2019s upside-down girlfriend getting off to seeing him used. He couldn\u2019t blame her. Luna\u2019s pussy was hot and tight. She had enough muscle control to squeeze his prick with the dexterity of a tongue. He tried to start thrusting, but Luna\u2019s hand held him fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gave him the wagging finger of chastiment. \u201cNot yet, bro. First, ya gotta talk ta yer audience. Tell her what it\u2019s like being dominated by yer big, sexy sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln tried evening his breath. \u201cIt\u2019s, ahh\u2026 Really heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam giggled. \u201cAww, is the big bad pred being mean to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shook his head. Since he couldn\u2019t thrust, he opted to run his hands along Luna\u2019s inner thighs to coax her to start moving. \u201cNah. She can be a little rough, but she\u2019s never mean. She\u2019s actually one of the sweeter sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrooo!\u201d Luna whined as Sam laughed it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try denying it, babe. We both know he\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard you play more beautifully than when someone\u2019s inside you, especially me.\u201d As she started plunging her fingers more deeply into her pussy, Sam\u2019s other free hand pulled on the left side of her bra and began pinching her nipple, all while she never looked away from the screen. \u201cNgh! I wish I could be there right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna started rotating her hips, making Lincoln cry out as he moved around inside her. \u201cYou \u2018n\u2019 me both, luv. Where do you think you\u2019d be, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now? Definitely sitting on Lincoln\u2019s face. His tongue work is great and we could make out while he gets us off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the hand that wasn\u2019t holding Lincoln down, Luna began groping her own breast. \u201cI like that. I\u2019d kiss your neck, grab that scrumptious booty of yours, and lick your face all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam began rubbing herself more vigorously as she bit her bottom lip. \u201cOooh, I love when the licking starts. You can never stop with just that, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even if I could. It\u2019s not just the taste, luv. I love your body. The way your nipples tickle my throat and how everything has just the right amount of squish. Ngh! It\u2019s like you were made to be eaten by me.\u201d Luna lifted herself a short ways off her brother\u2019s ten-year-old cock until only the tip was left inside, and then dropped down with the full force of her weight. \u201cF-fuck, bro! That thing might be small, but it packs a punch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln could only groan as Luna rode him. His whole body was hot and Luna\u2019s pussy was pulling needfully on his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it does, though I bet you\u2019re mostly saying that cuz he\u2019s your brother,\u201d huffed Sam as she writhed under her own ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Luna conceded, starting to pant from the exertion. It thrilled her to no end to fuck her brother in front of her girlfriend. \u201cYa know, Lincoln was saying the nicest things about you, earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa don\u2019t say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He said he could tell that you\u2019re smitten with me; that I\u2019m not \u2018just a pred\u2019 to you. I\u2019m <i>your</i> pred.\u201d Luna giggled as she dropped down with a twisting action that made Lincoln really start to squirm. \u201cWhich I guess makes you my yummy little prey.\u201d She licked her lips for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweet Jesus, yes!\u201d Sam cried out. Her body seized up for a couple seconds before going limp against the headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Did my yummy prey tucker herself out already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam laughed breathlessly. \u201cNo way, Luns. This was all <i>your</i> fault, calling me your p-prey like that.\u201d She struggled to pull herself upright. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can wait until tonight, babe. I\u2026 I need to be inside you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJus\u2019 hold on a sec, luv. We haven\u2019t even gotten to the best part. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll tide you over \u2018til then.\u201d Luna resumed rocking her hips back and forth, sliding Lincoln\u2019s cock within her in short but rapid thrusts. The boy tensed as his load erupted into her. Demonstrating muscle control that was only possible for a predator, Luna sealed her vaginal walls to keep his cum from going too deep. She waited until Lincoln finished cumming before lifting herself off and pushed the clear white goop out onto her hands. Holding eye contact with Sam, she brought the goop up to her mouth and licked her hand clean. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way bro, but your cum tastes better than it feels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLungs burning, Lincoln couldn\u2019t speak. He could only give a weak thumbs up before his arm went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stared at the screen and huffed with the most adorable and longing pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wished I\u2019d saved that for ya, aye luv?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t worry. This\u2019ll be something I <i>know</i> you\u2019ll enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna tries unbirth or anal vore. Two simple techniques that she's pretty good at. Maybe she tries the more advanced and experimental breast vore or even becomes a futa?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luna started by adjusting her setup. She moved her back against the headboard and brought the laptop closer to keep the view. The rocker turned to face herself and Lincoln to the screen fully this time. She stared down at the scrawny boy with a lustful hunger and whispered, \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten off yet. Plus you still owe me for yesterday.\u201d She teased along her sex as she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in a house of preds left Lincoln with a pretty good idea of where this was going. There was, however, one thing weighing down his thoughts. \u201cIf this is going where I think it is, why didn\u2019t you just get Leni or someone bigger to start with? Even if it\u2019s for practice, which we both know you don\u2019t need, why not get someone closer to her size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna leaned down and cupped her hand adoringly to Lincoln\u2019s cheek. \u201cCuz I missed you, dude. Lately it seems like any time I try looking for you, someone else has already called dibs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true enough. In this house, some predators were definitely more proactive in hunting than others, especially when it came to their favorite brother. Luna was more easy-going and preferred her prey to come to her, preferably lured with her music. This was a stark contrast to someone like Lori, who viewed all her younger siblings as her permanent on-call stress relievers, or Lynn, who was known to chase down anyone the moment her stomach rumbled. Lincoln had learned a few tricks to prolong his outside time, even if he ended up inside someone at least once per day. But Luna was right. It <i>had</i> been a while since he\u2019d last been in her. And just like family activities, although Lincoln enjoyed his alone time, he also liked being there with and for his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled appreciatively and pushed up on his elbows. \u201cThat didn\u2019t stop you when Lynn got me the other day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna chuckled. \u201cYeah. She had it coming, always going around with that tight butt hanging out. I made sure to teach her a lesson about stealing other people\u2019s food, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike any of you are gonna learn that when mom\u2019s not around.\u201d Brother and sister shared a snicker at their functionally chaotic family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sam cleared her throat. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. I just, uh\u2026 Oh!\u201d She reached over to the nightstand and downed half a glass of ice water. \u201cGlad I came prepared. Okay. Please continue. You two are so cute together,\u201d the blonde gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, luv. We were just gettin\u2019 ta the good part, anyway.\u201d Luna pushed Lincoln back down and grabbed his feet. She lifted them to her face until Lincoln was almost off the bed and started licking his toes. He laughed and squirmed around as her tongue ran across his soles and between his toes. Luna hummed her approval and locked eyes with Sam. \u201cSlightly sweaty, but I can tell he just got out of the shower, so they\u2019re mostly clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you prefer a clean body?\u201d Sam asked entranced, her hand returning to her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends. A little dirt and sweat is like a spritzing of spice, but I don\u2019t go overboard like Lana,\u201d Luna explained between licks before shoving both feet fully in her mouth, creating two small but noticeable bulges in her cheeks. Lincoln started frantically thrashing as his laughter turned uproarious and he begged her for mercy. Luna ignored him and focused on the taste. Eventually she released his feet with a pop and a satisfied \u201cAhh. That should do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln couldn\u2019t speak. He was still coming down from his laughing fit as Luna set him back down. However, she kept her hold on his feet and brought the slickened appendages to her equally moist pussy. She sucked in a hissing breath and curled her toes when his toes made contact, but didn\u2019t falter in her insertion. It felt to Lincoln like his feet were being pushed into a different kind of mouth, or maybe a throat would have been a better comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, even though yer feet are bigger, if I had to choose just one, I think I\u2019d prefer getting off on yer cock, little dude,\u201d Luna explained to him and Sam as she pulled the boy up to his ankles. \u201cYer prey, so all of you belongs to us preds, but yer cock was especially made fer pleasin\u2019 pussy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes he is,\u201d Sam gasped, having caught her second wind. She\u2019d retrieved a long purple dildo from her nightstand and was inserting it into her pussy. \u201cNnnf! Is he wiggling? Tell me he\u2019s wiggling,\u201d Sam demanded with a hint of desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Lincoln wiggled his toes against Luna\u2019s vaginal walls, sending shivers throughout her body. He smirked at the control he exerted over his consumer. Even if it was only temporary, he always relished turning the tables on his hungry family. Luna\u2019s devious smirk told him that his victory had already expired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, bro. Let\u2019s see if you can keep it up.\u201d Flexing her vaginal muscles, Luna pulled Lincoln further into her pussy. \u201cCheck it out, luv. No hands!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bit her bottom lip more intensely as more of her dildo disappeared up her vag. It looked like she was trying to match her pace with Luna to simulate the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the slick walls massage around his legs and clamp his knees together, Lincoln noticed that his erection had returned. \u201cHey, mind if I help things along?\u201d he asked, though was already trying to wiggle his way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna caught him, holding him down with one hand and used the other to tease his balls. \u201cSee that, luv? My pussy\u2019s so great, my bro jus\u2019 can\u2019t keep out. He wants in me sooo baaad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, f-fuck!\u201d cried Sam while twisting the dildo inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to keep you waitin\u2019, little dude,\u201d Luna said as she let him go. \u201cYou know I aim to please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow free, Lincoln resumed wiggling his way forward. More and more of Luna\u2019s body took up his vision as he sank further in. When he was past his knees, it was like his whole world was made up of her midsection. He could see nothing past his thighs as more and more of him disappeared into the hungry vulva. Remembering their audience, Lincoln decided to be considerate. \u201cGoing is a little awkward, but smooth. Luna\u2019s got a great pussy for taking bodies inside.\u201d Sam\u2019s groan was borderline painful as Lincoln wiggled in another few inches. His balls were resting against her clit when Luna stopped him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it from here, dude.\u201d Luna pulled Lincoln in a few more inches, consuming his butt, hips and groin. Then she pressed herself down on the mattress, making both of them groan. \u201cI\u2019m squeezing the little prick against my vag, luv. Nnnf!\u201d Luna started rotating her hips again, grinding Lincoln\u2019s sensitive cock against her even more sensitive pussy. \u201cI know how to please a guy, but I\u2019ve been practicing with girls, too. I\u2019ve learned this trick that makes it even better than grindin\u2019 beans, luv. Soon as I get ahold of you, you ain\u2019t gonna walk straight fer <i>hours</i>!\u201d Luna grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s legs were increasingly difficult to control. He tried pushing himself deeper in a desperate bid for sweet relief, but he\u2019d been reduced to a snail\u2019s pace. Luna\u2019s hand was fighting the greedy pull of her vaginal muscles. It really was like a throat, massaging him all over as it tried to swallow him, but Luna was cruelly drawing things out. Her body swayed and her eyes lidded as she lost herself in the throes of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna only opened her eyes long enough to check on her current and distant lovers. Lincoln\u2019s face was scrunched in bliss and it was adorable how he was humping so desperately into her. Sam had forgotten any sense of decorum and was screaming her lungs out. \u201cHey now. Easy there, luv. Don\u2019t wanna wake the neighbors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I need you!\u201d Sam cried wantonly. \u201cYou want me to stop so badly, come over right now and hold me. I-I need to feel you around me, to smell you, t-to make me feel like I\u2019m yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you <i>are</i>, luv,\u201d implored Luna with a coo. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. <i>All</i> mine. You were mine the first moment I saw you, smelled your hair, and licked your cheek.\u201d She giggled nostalgically as Sam started to calm down. Losing her focus caused Lincoln to slip past his navel into her vag, but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cI still remember that day. Most folks try pullin\u2019 away the first time I lick \u2018em, but you didn\u2019t. You leaned in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sniffled happy tears. \u201cI knew you were a pred. I wanted to talk to you so badly, but I couldn\u2019t work up the nerve. Then you came up to me an-and I about peed myself. Then I felt that wonderful tongue of yours\u2026\u201d She trailed off with a purr, only to giggle when her eyes opened again. \u201cHehe. Double lips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Luna found that Lincoln had been swallowed fully with only his face still visible. \u201cNever looked hotter, aye, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln said nothing. His eyelids had grown heavy from back-to-back discharges and his sister\u2019s comforting pussy. He let himself sink all the way inside as the world went dark and muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Luna let him out before her date, does she make him tag along, skip to Luna on the date without Lincoln, or will someone else be joining them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Lincoln came to, he was back in his bed, wet from water instead of pussy juice, and still very naked. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d He checked his clock. \u201cHmm. About an hour since I first left for the bathroom. That could have easily been worse. Not that it was bad, but I could still be shoved up my sister\u2019s pussy instead of free to do as I want. Ya learn to take the small victories in life.\u201d Then his gurgling stomach told him that it was time for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast!\u201d Lynn Sr. called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways pays to be prepared,\u201d Lincoln boasted to the viewer as he grabbed one of several spare towels from under his bed and began drying himself. \u201cSometimes my sisters forget to clean me properly after they\u2019re done. Luna at least got her girl cum off, so this isn\u2019t too bad.\u201d Once dry, Lincoln donned one of his many spare sets of clothes and ran out just in time to be overtaken by the stampede of sisters. The boy with white hair was carried down the stairs as if by a mosh pit with zero sense of personal space. When the world stopped spinning, he found himself conveniently at the kid\u2019s table with a plate full of pancakes. \u201c\u2026 Well that worked out nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln ate his fill as everyone else did. Cries of orgasmic bliss came from the grown up table, but Lincoln couldn\u2019t be bothered to see who it was. He\u2019d had enough vore and sexiness in the last hour to last him a while. Right now, he just wanted to eat and get his day started properly\u2026 preferably with minimal food stains from his rowdy little sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where\u2019re ya headin\u2019, Lincoln,\u201d Lana asked. She\u2019d just packed together a wad of pancakes half the size of her head and scarfed it down, creating a noticeable bulge down her throat and into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClyde and I are going to the comic store. There\u2019s a sale today and we were looking to start a new series.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I join?\u201d Lucy asked. \u201cVampires of Meloncholia is getting a comic spinoff and I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s any good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grinned from ear-to-ear. \u201cFinally, a fellow comic reader in the family. Say, if the book is any good, maybe that can be what Clyde and I start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d Lucy replied drearily, though her family could detect the subtle hint of enthusiasm. \u201cI know they say books are better than movies, but if you like the book, maybe you\u2019d want to check out the show, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled, understanding what Lucy was really hoping for. \u201cThat\u2019d be fine, but only if the book\u2019s any good. Also, you have to give my future comic recommendations a try. Agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola scoffed. \u201cComics. Such unsophisticated garbage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnsophisticated?\u201d Lincoln parroted incensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve done it.\u201d Lisa\u2019s voice was her usual emotionless deadpan, but like Lucy, her family could detect the subtle inflections that showed her annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln delved into a long and well-practiced tirade about graphic novels. The history, the evolved artistry of the panels, and the commonly accepted examples of stories that were better in comics than any other medium. Meanwhile, Lola smirked to herself as she drowned her pancakes in syrup, satisfied in her success at riling him up. Causing drama wasn\u2019t quite as fun as gossiping about it, but it was pretty close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, and paying Lori\u2019s fee for the ride, Clyde was picked up in Vanzilla and they set off to the comic store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Clyde. Lucy said Vampires of Meloncholia, her show, is getting a comic spinoff. I was thinking we could check it out for our new series.\u201d Lincoln explained this while sitting in the middle seat to discourage Lucy from trying anything funny with Clyde. Of all his sisters, she was among the least likely to pull something like that, but it never hurt to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the nervous boy said, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cHorror isn\u2019t really my thing.\u201d Then he caught Lori\u2019s visage in the rearview mirror and struck a bold pose. \u201cB-but I\u2019m willing to give it a try, because real men face their fears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVoM is more spooky than scary,\u201d Lori added from the driver\u2019s seat. After she and Leni agreed to start watching the show with Lucy, the blonde Louds had found a lot more to like than just the cute new actor. \u201cIt\u2019s a character drama with a gothic setting. Lots of creepy atmosphere, but they don\u2019t bother with cheap jump scares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde sighed his relief. \u201cPhew. I mean\u2026 phewww bad about that. I was really looking to test myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe real fear comes from the tension,\u201d Lori continued. \u201cLike that episode two nights ago. Edwin spent the entire time stalking that one girl, giving glimpses of himself now and then just to put the fear in her as she tried going about her day. By the end, she was a nervous wreck, and was practically begging to be taken just to be put out of her misery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rehash of an episode from season 1, but still very effective,\u201d appraised Lucy. \u201cThough now I\u2019m actually afraid Leni might give me tinnitus from her screaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what that was?\u201d Lincoln asked. \u201cI thought a jet had flown too close to the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right,\u201d Lori agreed. \u201cI tried to calm her down with the usual stuff. Petting her, groping her, and fingering her, but she just kept going. With lungs like that, she ought to try for swim team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Leni needs is a full tummy. She\u2019s always calm when someone\u2019s inside her.\u201d Lucy slowly and deliberately turned to face Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, I\u2019d love to \u2018volunteer\u2019,\u201d he said with air quotes, \u201cbut I\u2019m starting the comic to see if I like the show. I\u2019ll need to watch a few episodes to be sure, which I can\u2019t exactly do from inside someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Dang it,\u201d Lucy grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Clyde?\u201d Lori inquired with a scheming smirk. \u201cIt\u2019d really help the viewing experience if Leni didn\u2019t blow our eardrums out. Think you\u2019d be willing to do me a favor?\u201d She batted her eyelashes flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde, having never fully gotten over his crush, turned to jelly in the seat. \u201cAnything for you, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll like being eaten by Leni, anyways,\u201d Lincoln encouraged. \u201cIt\u2019s relaxing how she rubs you while you\u2019re in her belly. For a first time experience, I\u2019d definitely recommend her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Lucy. You\u2019re belly\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a little cramped for someone my size. However, if we finally get Clyde to see how great vore is, then we can work our way to you eventually,\u201d Lincoln rationalized. As pushy as his sisters could be about it, he truly believed that being eaten was one of the best things someone could experience and he\u2019d always hoped his best friend would see the light on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy hummed thoughtfully. \u201cAcceptable. Mind if I borrow your hand for just a second? I\u2019d like to taste your fingers.\u201d She reached out, but Clyde pulled away. For all his talk about wanting to give himself to Lori, the boy was still very much a virgin in every sense of the word. Just the thought of someone running their tongue over his body made him have to cross his legs. Luckily, Lincoln made sure to cover for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Eventually,</i> Lucy,\u201d Lincoln emphasized. \u201cI said eventually. Give the guy time. We don\u2019t want to ruin the experience, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not. Sigh.\u201d The goth slumped in her seat and took Lincoln\u2019s fingers as a consolation prize, which he happily allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man. Clincoln McLoud can withstand anything, even hungry sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s laugh was nervous. \u201cThanks man. I can always count on you to have my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was grateful for Clyde as his first real friend outside the family. So many people tried brownnosing up to him in the hopes of getting off the menu for his sisters and mom; as if they just went around eating people at random. Honestly, the whole notion really offended Lincoln. Sure, the women of his life were pretty handsy and liberal with their tongues. However, they almost never brought someone inside them without some kind of provocation, either an invitation or if someone just pissed them off. His family was made up of predators, not monsters. His and Clyde\u2019s friendship was born out of shared interests and just plain getting along, which meant he was safe to only be vored if he was willing. As for the other sycophants around town, Lincoln couldn\u2019t care less.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Lori parked, the younger kids disembarked from Vanzilla while she stayed behind to text. Inside, Lincoln and Clyde were having a ball welcoming a newcomer into their world. Lucy naturally gravitated towards the more monstrous and creepy covers, which the comic duo were more than happy to explain to her. This was a hero that turned into a monster, that was a monster trying to make it as a hero, and this was a regular person who turned into a monster that could be good or evil depending on the circumstances, but was still widely feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this earlier?\u201d demanded Lucy. \u201cAll of these monsters with tormented souls. They\u2019re just seeking people who understand them.\u201d She stroked her hand longingly over a cover depicting some kind of mud monster about to sink its teeth into a screaming woman while an angry mob was shooting it. \u201cI know your pain, dark and murky kindred spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault,\u201d asserted Lincoln. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get you guys on comics for years. And it\u2019s not just the western stuff, either. There\u2019s manga about super models for Lola, detective stories for Lisa, more sports\u2019 books than I can even count for Lynn, that one\u2019s about an up and coming rock band, and everything else. Oh, and all the vore themed porn books.\u201d Lincoln finished by pointing to an entire isle that radiated with an almost heavenly glow and angelic choir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce I was blind, but now I see. We must share this treasure with the rest of the family,\u201d Lucy avowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA nice idea, but how are we gonna afford it?\u201d Clyde asked. \u201cI don\u2019t get that much allowance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys. This one is on me.\u201d Lucy pulled out her personal credit card. The card was custom decorated with art from VoM, along with \u2018Predator\u2019 in big bold letters to dissuade any would-be thieves. It had access to her private bank account where all the money she\u2019d earned from voring volunteers had accumulated, minus the percentage that had been taken out and set aside for college. Maintaining a house full of preds was expensive, but luckily said preds did pretty decently in paying for their own upkeep with plenty to spare. \u201cPick whatever looks good. We\u2019re going to show our family the darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde raised his hand. \u201cUh, I think you meant light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what I said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the boys got a basket and loaded it up with what they felt were the best samples of what each of the sisters would appreciate, along with three copies of the VoM book. When it came time to pay, the teen guy behind the counter swallowed audibly upon seeing the card and became visibly shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, if you b-b-buy ten or more books, you g-get our 10% bulk discount. W-will there be anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cDude, just relax. She\u2019s not gonna bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I borrow your fingers?\u201d Lucy licked her lips in anticipation. \u201cI like the taste of fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh that put Lucy\u2019s to shame, Lincoln reached up, grabbed the guy\u2019s arm, and pulled it down for Lucy to reach. As she took two fingers into her mouth and started licking, the boy explained, \u201cSee. She\u2019s not gonna eat you. She just wants a taste. It\u2019s like shaking hands for predators.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-are you sure?\u201d asked the nervous teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs her brother, yes. I\u2019m very sure.\u201d Lincoln was rather adept at this conversation, having to explain his sisters\u2019 behavior to the ignorant masses far more often than should be necessary. \u201cIf she wanted to actually eat you, she\u2019d go for somewhere more intimate, like the neck or face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy finally released the guy\u2019s fingers and smacked her lips appraisingly. \u201cTeen angst. Not bad, but I\u2019ve had better. Now what was that about a discount?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019ll even throw in the employee discount!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be nice. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purchase was rung up and upon leaving, the guys were made to carry the haul while Lucy started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you,\u201d Lincoln accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. There was nothing about what just happened that was out of the ordinary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really wish I could disagree, but this isn\u2019t my first shopping trip with the Louds,\u201d Clyde said in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were totally scaring that guy on purpose,\u201d Lincoln argued. \u201cThat was totally uncool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he wants to be afraid of me just because I\u2019m a predator, that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he shouldn\u2019t be. You\u2019re not the monster he thinks you are and you shouldn\u2019t be perpetuating the stereotype.\u201d Lincoln pinched the bridge of his nose as they came up to Vanzilla. \u201cLori, please tell Lucy that she can\u2019t go around scaring people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori turned an incredulous eye on her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucy. Scaring people is pretty much her thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreeping up on people is one thing. I agree that there\u2019s no stopping her there. But she\u2019s making people afraid of her for being a predator. Doesn\u2019t that bug you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori just kept scrolling through her phone. \u201cNot especially. Stupid people are gonna be stupid no matter what. It\u2019s no skin off my bones if strangers can\u2019t be bothered to educate themselves. And if any of them try doing anything <i>extra</i> stupid, it will literally be the last thing they ever do. Why do you even care? This is a pred issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. \u201cI care because it\u2019s a <i>Loud</i> issue. You\u2019re my sisters and I don\u2019t like you guys being stereotyped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no biggie,\u201d Lori dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, Lori likes freaking people out just as much as I do. You don\u2019t complain then,\u201d observed Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips, trying to think of a delicate way to get his message across. \u201cThat\u2019s cuz Lori does things more\u2026 approachably. I realize that smiling and hugging people you don\u2019t know isn\u2019t exactly your thing, but there must be some Lucy way of interacting with people that doesn\u2019t perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, next time someone crosses you, you just eat them and say they were a volunteer,\u201d Lori added nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLori!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. I was only joking\u2026 mostly.\u201d Lori finally turned a more focused look on her passengers. \u201cThat seems like a lot more comics than usual. How\u2019d you guys-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComics aren\u2019t as boring as we thought,\u201d Lucy said. Still with her nose buried in her book, she pulled out a volume and handed it to the elder blonde. \u201cI bought samples for everyone. This is a romance about the eldest princess trying to juggle three suitors. Also she\u2019s a pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori slipped her phone in her pocket and began flipping through the pages. \u201cHmm. Well she\u2019s certainly pretty enough to warrant this kind of-\u201d She snorted a laugh at the unexpected pratfall. \u201cOkay, that wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d She flipped the page and her eyes began to sparkle as she fanned herself. \u201cOh, well isn\u2019t he a tall glass of water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lincoln wasn\u2019t ready to let go of his gripe with Lucy, he could take solace that at least Lori was enjoying her present. Once they made it back, the rest of the books were handed out and everyone seemed to like their new stories. Lincoln however, didn\u2019t join them. The man with the plan had a scheme cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he try helping Lucy with this perceived issue, or is something else going on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Up in the converted closet that was his room, Lincoln was pacing back and forth while Clyde was reading on the bed. \u201cClyde, I\u2019m worried about Lucy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we all are, though she\u2019s got great taste in vampires. I really relate to Edwin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean about her social life, such as it is. She\u2019s got friends in her club, but she\u2019s still such a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIntrovert,\u201d Clyde suggested. \u201cSo am I. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being comfortable all by yourself. That\u2019s probably not so easy for you in this house, but the quiet is still pleasant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I get that, but it still seems like a predator should be a little, ya know, proactive in their hunting. All of my older sisters are so outgoing. They\u2019re flirty, they get up close and personal, but then they start laying on the affection. Lana and Lola have this pretty down pat, too. Even if people are nervous at first, they\u2019re put at ease and see what great people preds are. I like seeing when everyone\u2019s happy and getting along. But with Lucy\u2026\u201d He trailed off, his meaning not needing to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is kind of a sensitive issue with you, but are you really qualified to handle something like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ya mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you live in a house full of preds, most of them older and more experienced. If Lucy were, say, underdeveloped, don\u2019t you think one of them would have stepped in by now? Mrs. Loud strikes me as the sort who\u2019d nip a problem like that in the bud; or butt, knowing you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned as he contemplated Clyde\u2019s words. \u201cYou might be right, buddy. This isn\u2019t my area of expertise, but I really want to be a good big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. So what did you have in mind?\u201d Clyde asked while putting the book down. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have plans for today, so I\u2019m up for whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln hummed thoughtfully and scratched his chin. \u201cHmm. If I\u2019m <i>not</i> the expert, then I should find someone who is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, in Luna and Luan\u2019s room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you guys think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, little bro,\u201d Luna responded while strumming her axe. \u201cAt Lucy\u2019s age, I was still pretty locked up in my shell, too. I ate who came to me, but didn\u2019t really have the urge to go out and hunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, then you got a job at the pound, cuz you love hunting for pussy so much,\u201d Luan joked, only to rethink her punchline as her hand stroked her engorged stomach, which had shrunk since this morning. \u201cHmm. I could do better, but I agree with you,\u201d she said to the boys. \u201cLucy really ought to be a more active predator. Be a bit flirtier and lick people gently enough so that they don\u2019t get grossed out. Well, <i>as</i> grossed out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I wanted to hear. So, can you help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Lincoln. I\u2019ve got a kid\u2019s birthday party in an hour and I need to borrow Lynn\u2019s treadmill to work off this beer belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf yer lookin\u2019 fer advice, I recommend Leni,\u201d suggested Luna. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who knows how to make prey relax, it\u2019s her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater still, in Lori and Leni\u2019s room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll help.\u201d Leni was her usual bubbly self, not to mention naked as the day she was born. Clyde was wide eyed, speechless, and bleeding from the nose. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to give Lucy a makeover, but she\u2019s a wily one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakeover? No, we\u2019re talking about making her a more proactive predator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I guess I misunderstood, but that also sounds pretty fun. But we\u2019ll need a good sales pitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a retail thing, but it works equally well with predators. When out hunting and you spy someone who looks really yummy, you can\u2019t just say you want to eat them and shove them in. That\u2019s rude, not to mention they might start fighting, and that\u2019s no fun for anyone. You\u2019ve gotta sweet talk them, figure out what they want, and help them realize what they really want is the same as what you want: for them to go in your belly.\u201d Leni patted her trim stomach. \u201cBasically, Lucy thinks she\u2019s fine, so we have to convince her that being a more active predator is for her own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. That makes sense. Also, Clyde?\u201d Lincoln snapped his fingers in his friend\u2019s face, but got no response. \u201cUh, Leni. You mind putting some clothes on? You\u2019re distracting Clyde.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you like reading in your undies cuz it feels comfortable, and I like being naked. Besides, we\u2019re inside, so it\u2019s allowed.\u201d Crossing her arms under her ample chest, she blew her brother a raspberry to show just how mature the second eldest sister was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes and, rather than attempt bickering with a brick wall, decided to take Leni\u2019s advice. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, something that would appeal to Lucy, aye?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more later, in Lynn and Lucy\u2019s room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, lots of people say that those who seek thrills for a hobby have a death wish, which is kinda true,\u201d Lincoln began, causing Lucy to look up from her poem book. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting falling through the air at high speeds, almost like death itself is on their heels. Same with things like the Running of the Bulls. It wouldn\u2019t be nearly as popular if there weren\u2019t that danger, that possibility of meeting a gruesome demise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d groaned Lucy, crossing her legs. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy point is that, for most people, they get that same kind of thrill being with or even just near predators. <i>You</i> could make them feel like death is breathing down their necks, except it isn\u2019t death\u2019s breath.\u201d He lowered his voice to a stage whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s Lucy\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh!\u201d Lincoln jumped and spun around to face where Lucy now stood. \u201cYou? But you were\u2026\u201d He pointed frantically between the goth\u2019s bed and her current position, covering over 3 meters in the blink of an eye. \u201cBut I was staring at you the whole time. How-did-you-do-that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of your petty mortal concerns. Like comics, I must now teach the prey of the world the joys of being close to death, or at least her dark disciple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? Death is a woman. All the popular goth literature says so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough. Leni\u2019s agreed to show you the ropes. Now we just have to-hey. Where\u2019s Clyde?\u201d Lincoln looked around the room, but saw neither hide nor hair of his buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shadows tell me he\u2019s hiding under Lynn\u2019s bed,\u201d stated Lucy, making Lincoln flinch. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s a mistake no one makes twice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln and Lucy armored up with clothes pins on their noses and thick gloves on their hands. Together they probed the uninhabitable wasteland that was the space beneath Lynn\u2019s bed. The girl kept all her lucky clothes under there, the ones she never cleaned for fear of washing out the luck. Just lifting the sheets up released a tidal wave of stank that made both Louds gag. They found Clyde and quickly extricated him out into the open. After pumping on his chest and performing CPR, the boy finally took his first real breath after what felt like hours of suffocating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I saw the light,\u201d Clyde said in awe as he reached up to the sky. \u201cDeath was escorting me to the pearly gates. She was so beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you,\u201d Lucy boasted dryly. \u201cAlso, my newfound dream to share the joys of a brush with death was just beaten out by Lynn\u2019s old gym clothes\u2026 I feel inadequate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegin the lesson, or skip to a new plot?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still naked, Leni now sat on Lucy\u2019s bed and looked the goth girl over. Clyde lay beside her, still recovering his breath as she patted his head. \u201cHmm. Let\u2019s start by seeing your technique so we know what we\u2019re working with. Lincoln, pretend you\u2019re just some guy. Act like you don\u2019t know Lucy, and that you\u2019re kinda put off by preds. And Lucy, I want you to make Lincoln accept you. You don\u2019t have to eat him, but he does have to be fine with you licking somewhere other than his fingers. Now,\u201d she clapped her hands, \u201cbegin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pulled out his phone to scroll through videos. It didn\u2019t matter what he found, so long as he put up a front of indifference. He\u2019d even put on a black wig to further the illusion. Especially from Leni, this all seemed like pretty good practice so far, at least in theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy swallowed anxiously and made her approach. \u201cHey there, you. Can I lick your fingers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked if I could lick your fingers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBleh! That\u2019s gross. Why would I let you do that?\u201d Lincoln questioned, keeping his eye on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a predator, and I\u2019m curious how you taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln took a large side step away from his sister, but otherwise said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s running, but he hasn\u2019t left,\u201d Leni whispered. \u201cGive chase. He wants you to chase him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy tried just that and closed the distance. \u201cSo, um, do you want to know what it\u2019s like to come close to death?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd with that, I\u2019m out. A regular guy like me gets put off easily with talk of death.\u201d Still watching his phone, Lincoln started to leave, but very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him,\u201d Leni urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait!\u201d Lucy grabbed Lincoln\u2019s wrist. \u201cI-I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, you again? Look, I\u2019m very busy and I don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d Lincoln said, giving only a token effort to pull himself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what do I do?\u201d Lucy questioned anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething drastic. You\u2019re losing him, so be bold! Make him want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBold. Right. Um\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2019s mind was racing, trying to think of something, anything to keep this boy here. What could she possibly do to make him want her? Hang on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cAre we done here? Cuz I\u2019ve got way better things to do than-mmh!?\u201d Lincoln\u2019s words were smothered by a pair of cool lips pressed against his, and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d Leni cheered. \u201cThere\u2019s some boldness to stop folks in their tracks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was the first to break off the kiss. \u201cActually\u2026\u201d He trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck apprehensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConstructive criticism is crucial for improvement, Lincoln. I can take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded. \u201cFor one thing, it didn\u2019t feel all that passionate. It\u2019s like how you\u2019d kiss me normally. Not really show stopper material. You didn\u2019t even use any tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse\u2026 tongue,\u201d Lucy wrote into her notes. \u201cThis is good. Anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust kissing isn\u2019t enough,\u201d answered Leni. \u201cVore is, like, a full body kiss, so you need to put your full body into it. What are your hands doing? What are <i>his</i> hands doing? Where are the hips? Vore is a contact sport, so make that contact! Try again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Lucy looked back at Lincoln to see he\u2019d switched back to his slightly annoyed persona. Taking a breath to steady herself, she lunged forward and pressed her body to his like she\u2019d seen her sisters do with people. She slid her front up and down his sides, nuzzled under his chin, and teased around the groin of his pants. Additionally, the hand holding Lincoln\u2019s wrist pulled it around and clamped it on her butt. Lincoln\u2019s cheeks became flushed, which she took as a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni nodded. \u201cMuch better. However, that probably won\u2019t work so well on prey Lincoln\u2019s age. They haven\u2019t hit puberty yet, so they\u2019d probably be more scared if you touch their swimsuit area. Instead, make it more like a hug. Like you\u2019ve been fighting with Lynn and have a makeup hug. And don\u2019t forget to speak. That\u2019s the real trick. Hold them so they can\u2019t get away, and then convince them to stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded and adjusted her position to be more like a hug and rubbed her cheek against Lincoln\u2019s. The contact was nice, which she decided to share. \u201cYou smell really good and I like how warm you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, th-thank you?\u201d Lincoln was confused about what his character would do at this time, but reasoned he should probably take his hand off her butt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like being close to you. Normally I prefer the dark and cold, but you make me crave something more,\u201d Lucy whispered into his ear. \u201cI\u2019m craving you\u2026 stranger. A-are you craving me?\u201d That sounded like something her older sisters would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had the same thought, which brought a grin to his face. \u201cI kinda am, actually.\u201d He returned the hug. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind getting a little closer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get you close. Closer than you\u2019ve ever been with anyone,\u201d Lucy said rather desperately. \u201cI can make you feel good, too. It\u2019ll be exciting, like going down a water slide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best water slide of your life,\u201d Lincoln whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best water slide of your life. It\u2019ll be warm, and wet, and I\u2019ll hold you tight inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni applauded. \u201cPerfect. That was just perfect! Good job, Lucy. I knew you had it in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaintaining the hug, Lucy turned to face Leni. \u201cThat felt super awkward. I was just doing what I thought you guys would do, but it didn\u2019t really feel like\u2026 me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni waved dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It\u2019s normal to start by copying others. That\u2019s how art works. You just have to keep practicing until you get your own style. Well, I think that means you pass the first level. Now we do the, uh\u2026 level that comes next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond,\u201d Lincoln and Lucy said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. Silly me. Hey, Clyde.\u201d Leni tapped his cheek. \u201cClyde, you up? We could use your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning groggily, Clyde slowly stirred to consciousness and beheld the tremendous sight of Leni\u2019s big, round, and boobilicious chest pillows. \u201cError. Error. System overload,\u201d Clyde said in a high pitched and stilted voice, twitching like a malfunctioning robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is why I asked you to put some clothes on,\u201d Lincoln reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine,\u201d Leni huffed. She left to go put something on, but came back in a set of lacey see-through lingerie. \u201cBetter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy pursed her lips. \u201cSexier, but I agree with Lincoln. If we\u2019re going to use Clyde for anything, he should be able to function like a regular human, or at least as regular as any of Lincoln\u2019s friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeyyy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roll of her eyes, Leni left and returned in a bathrobe. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln and Lucy both gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, good.\u201d Again Leni tapped Clyde\u2019s cheek until he woke up. This time her bodacious boobs were at least covered, so he didn\u2019t malfunction again. \u201cWelcome back. So, Lucy just practiced hunting with Lincoln and did pretty well. But he\u2019s her brother, so that makes him pretty easy to win over. So now we\u2019re moving on to level\u2026 uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo!\u201d Lincoln and Lucy said as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat one. Anyway, are you up for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp for what, exactly?\u201d Clyde\u2019s voice was skeptical as his eyes kept drifting down into Leni\u2019s robe. It was like he could hear her melons calling to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni smiled knowingly. \u201cDo you like my boobies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeees,\u201d Clyde droned, only to recollect himself. \u201cI-I mean, uh, what boobies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni appeared worried. \u201cThese boobies. The ones on my chest. See!\u201d She cupped her hands under both breasts and pushed them up, almost popping them right out of her robes. \u201cYou see them, right? Tell me you see them. They didn\u2019t shrink, did they?\u201d she asked in increasing panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can see your boobs, Leni. You\u2019re just overwhelming him,\u201d assured Lincoln with a hint of annoyance. The second eldest sister was pretty smart when it came to being a predator, but was still dense about almost everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni gave a relieved sigh. \u201cThank goodness. Anyway, I want you to let Lucy hunt you. She\u2019s not going to eat you. She just has to make you comfortable with her being around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, uh, what exactly do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do whatever feels natural. If she\u2019s coming on too strong, tell her. If you want to back away, then do that. You\u2019re the, uh, more difficult level. Think of it like playing hard to get. If you do a good job\u2026\u201d Leni pulled down at the collar of her robe. It wasn\u2019t enough to show any pink, but the implication was clear as her eyebrows wiggled suggestively. \u201cLori told me you wanted to help us watch VoM.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde swallowed audibly and turned a shade of crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni leaned forward and rubbed her cheek to his, (un)intentionally shaking her bootylicious posterior at her siblings. \u201cThat was really sweet of you to help like that. You\u2019re a really great friend, and I\u2019d be honored to be your first predator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s nose started bleeding again, but only a trickle compared to the earlier fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how does the practice hunt go?</span></div></div>",

To his left on the bed were Lincoln and Leni, acting as coaches and moral support. Directly ahead was Lucy, the creepiest of the Loud siblings, but he\u2019d long ago learned just how nice she could be. That was slightly reassuring, but this was still leagues out of his comfort zone. He stole another glance at Leni, her winning smile, pretty face, and the bathrobe barely containing her huge knockers.  She wanted to eat him. The Loud ladies always had and loved teasing him, just like they did Lincoln. The difference being that this time it was really happening. He\u2019d given permission as his \u2018reward\u2019 for helping with Lucy. He could only hope that what everyone said about vore being great was accurate. And although it was no secret that he\u2019d have preferred Lori, Leni was also very pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde slapped himself across the face to clear his thoughts. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready.\u201d He turned around and started whistling inconspicuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Leni\u2019s nod, Lucy made her approach. She came up around Clyde\u2019s side and said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um, hello\u2026 person I don\u2019t know,\u201d he greeted awkwardly. \u201cWhat can I, a person you don\u2019t know, do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of hamming it up, buddy,\u201d advised Lincoln.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. You know I\u2019m not an actor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I like you,\u201d Lucy blurted, trying to keep things on track. At Clyde\u2019s bewildered reaction, she grabbed his arm and pressed herself to his side and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2026 I-I think you l-look c-c-cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde stiffened as his cheeks turned a shade of pink. \u201cY-you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned to face the older boy and inhaled deeply through her nose. \u201cYou smell nice and you look yummy,\u201d she said more naturally. \u201cDo you, um, want to try something exciting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m not so sure. My dads say that too much excitement is bad for the heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe heart isn\u2019t nearly so weak.\u201d Lucy set her hand on Clyde\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s beating strong, pumping gallons of precious blood throughout the body. You need to stimulate it to stay healthy. Exercise is one way, but lots of people enjoy thrilling things, like roller coasters and water slides.\u201d She leaned in closer and took another sniff of his neck. \u201cYou really do smell yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni beamed widely and gave two thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know ways to make your heart pump. I can manipulate your precious life essence in ways that feel amazing.\u201d Lucy began drawing a circle around Clyde\u2019s nipple. \u201cEveryone says how good it feels, and I can attest to that as giver and receiver. So, stranger, do you want me to make you feel good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s knees gave out and he fell onto Lucy, who easily held him up. The watchers on the bed both gave a standing ovation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. That was just perfect,\u201d cheered Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did great, Lucy. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy\u2019s mouth gave a twitch in the barest hint of a smile. \u201cThanks guys. The words feel a little awkward, but that was actually kinda fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt only gets better from here,\u201d Leni gushed as she ran over and pulled her sister\u2019s face between her breasts in a cheerful hug. \u201cYou did great for your first real try, and don\u2019t worry about the awkwardness. You just need to keep practicing with more people, try different things out, and eventually you\u2019ll have a technique that\u2019s perfectly Lucy.\u201d Her only answer was muffled cries and banging against her boobs as the goth struggled to free herself. \u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was able to breathe again, Lucy replied. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m so very happy,\u201d she said like she was fighting to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get why you wanted lessons in the first place. You took to that like a natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it was some things Lincoln and Luan said. They said I wasn\u2019t developing my predator abilities fast enough, and it got me feeling a little insecure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA literal arrow to the heart would not have hurt Lincoln as much as his sister\u2019s words. \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, Lucy. I-I didn\u2019t mean-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth held up a halting hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be. You guys were right. I was being lazy and falling behind in my practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you were so good with Clyde just now,\u201d countered Lincoln. \u201cLooked to me like you\u2019re a natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a predator, so some things come naturally, but natural talen\u2019s a lot like a dead body. It\u2019s no fun unless you dig it up and put it to use.\u201d A palpable silence followed as everyone eyed Lucy warily. \u201cI never said anything, and you can\u2019t prove otherwise. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to call my friends at the mortician\u2019s club and see who wants to glimpse down the throat of death.\u201d And she made her casual departure while everyone watched. She came back a couple seconds later. \u201cI just remembered this is my room. Could you guys give me some privacy? I need to commune with the spirits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo everyone else left. However, Leni had taken Clyde\u2019s hand and was refusing to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Leni?\u201d asked Clyde, trying to pull himself free. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo Lincoln\u2019s room, silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that, but, urrgh, why are <i>you</i> coming? Urrgh! Man, you\u2019re strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s easy. VoM is on tomorrow. So, since you\u2019ve already agreed to be in my belly for the viewing, I figured I should take your vore virginity now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Lincoln and Clyde exclaimed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, uh, does it have to be now?\u201d Clyde asked fretfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd does it have to be in <i>my</i> room? What about yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the help, buddy,\u201d Clyde deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use my room. Lori might come in and I don\u2019t want Clyde to feel too awkward,\u201d explained Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s actually kind of sweet,\u201d Clyde admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it has to be now, cuz a first eating should be something special. A good predator \u2013 which I am \u2013 should take her time in making her prey feel welcome and appreciated,\u201d Leni continued as all three entered Lincoln\u2019s room. \u201cWhen VoM comes on, I\u2019ll need to scarf you down quick so I can enjoy the show, and that won\u2019t allow me to savor you like we both deserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde blinked as he processed all of this. \u201cI never realized vore was so personal and\u2026 intimate. Are first times really that special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotes.\u201d Then Leni\u2019s smile faded. \u201cAlthough, I only really know about being a first time eater for people. I\u2019ve heard others talk about it, but I never really had a first time being eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. Lincoln said you guys eat him and each other all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Lincoln replied. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in and out of each other and mom since we were born. None of us can remember our first times, which is why you\u2019ve got a big opportunity here, buddy. You\u2019ll actually be able to remember your first time going down a throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntsy with anticipation, Leni leaned down and swirled her tongue along Clyde\u2019s cheek. \u201cO.M. Gosh! The others are gonna be totes jealous that I\u2019m the first to eat you. Eee! This is gonna be great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have\u2026 very mixed feelings about this,\u201d Clyde admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, buddy. Being eaten is great. It\u2019s exciting, like Lucy said, but also super relaxing. It\u2019s like a sauna mixed with a full body massage. And when you\u2019re inside someone, with their heartbeat echoing all around you, it can actually be hard not to fall asleep. And when you wake up again, you\u2019ll be super refreshed. Trust me. There\u2019s a reason so many people pay for this service, and you\u2019re getting it for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I\u2019m still not sure. Mind if I call Dr. Lopez real quick? No offense, but she\u2019s a professional.\u201d Clyde whipped out his phone and hit the speed dial. The phone rang a few times, probably (not) because Lopez was reluctant about answering another of Clyde\u2019s calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Leni figured she had a better way of convincing the boy. With the grace of a ballerina, she dropped her robe down to her elbows and let her breasts bounce freely right in Clyde\u2019s face. Her smile was sincere as she leaned forward and she giggled as his eyes followed her swaying tits. \u201cCould you get on the bed for me, please? I\u2019m really looking forward to playing with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter completing a full mental reboot, Clyde ended the call and hopped up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd would you mind stripping for me? Neither of us wants your clothes all yucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde nodded and obediently began to strip, never tearing his eyes off the blonde. Lincoln, largely resistant to nudity thanks to his home life, just smiled proudly as his best friend got naked on his bed. Truly, it was best for everyone that this was happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clyde sat anxiously on Lincoln\u2019s bed, legs crossed, and hands covering his privates. His blush was heavy and his eyes never strayed from Leni\u2019s ginormous boobies. They weren\u2019t the biggest he\u2019d ever seen, even naked, but they did have an odd sense of gravity that seemed to be drawing him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni, familiar with the look Clyde gave her, kept her sweet smile, but decided against discarding the robe completely. She didn\u2019t want him passing out again. However, there was one issue that needed correcting. \u201cI\u2019ll take these.\u201d She relieved Clyde of his glasses and set them on Lincoln\u2019s dresser. \u201cIt makes me happy that you like looking at me, but I don\u2019t want your glasses breaking inside me. That\u2019d be <i>super</i> not fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde was squinting, but nodded his understanding. \u201cI guess that\u2019s fair. You might just be a blur, but you\u2019re still a very pretty blur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. You\u2019re such a sweetie. Just for that, I\u2019ll give you an extra special treat.\u201d Leni dropped down to her knees, but even then had to bend her back to be on Clyde\u2019s level. Hands on her boobs, she leaned forward and smooshed her chest against the boy\u2019s pelvis. He gasped at the unexpected pressure that pushed his hands away and legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wh-what are you d-doinggg?\u201d Clyde stammered. His body was experiencing spontaneous spasms as alien sensations shot through his nervous system. He\u2019d been hugged by well-endowed women before, including the Louds, but something about Leni\u2019s soft and supple chest pillows were doing things to him that he\u2019d never imagined. Compounding this issue was Leni\u2019s natural aroma mixed with a bit of sweat, making him all tingly down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m, like, giving you a boob job, silly. It\u2019s a little tricky with you being so small,\u201d Leni thoughtlessly said, ignoring Clyde\u2019s crushed expression as she fiddled with her bosoms in his lap. \u201cI just, urgh, have to, nnf\u2026 There!\u201d She\u2019d found it poking between her boobs. Clyde\u2019s penis was small, smaller than Lincoln\u2019s, but Leni didn\u2019t especially care. She wasn\u2019t using it for herself. This part was all about making him feel good, of prepping her prey for eating. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh!\u201d Clyde had thrown himself bodily onto the vast expanse of boob flesh and felt himself partially sink into their softness. The masses weren\u2019t total marshmallows and had enough perkiness that they pushed back. It was like resting on the most comfortable of heated mattresses. Not to mention what was happening downstairs. \u201cM-my peepee feels funny,\u201d he blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. It\u2019s so cute that you, like, call it that,\u201d Leni tittered as she pushed on her breasts from the sides, making him whimper. \u201cI\u2019m squeezing your peepee between my boobs. Do you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde could only nod as he bit his lip to keep from screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni repeated the action from different angles, experimenting to see what got the best reactions. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re confused. Most boys your age don\u2019t really know how to feel about this, but trust me. After you\u2019ve had time to think about it, you\u2019ll find you really like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t lying,\u201d Lincoln said, reminding everyone that he was still there. He\u2019d been standing at the door and casually watching his naked sister molest his naked friend like it was ordinary. While he\u2019d intended to just be there for moral support, Lincoln couldn\u2019t deny that the slapping of Leni\u2019s boobs mixed with Clyde\u2019s stifled groans was turning him on just a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Clyde\u2019s whole body seized up before he fell back on the bed. His breathing was heavy as he nervously said, \u201cI-I think I just peed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni laughed as she leaned back. She pulled her boobs apart to show the clear white liquid oozing down the inside of her tits. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just cum. I made you orgasm. And don\u2019t worry about being a quick shot. That\u2019s also, like, normal for a boy your age.\u201d Craning her neck, Leni pushed her breasts up and extended her long tongue directly onto her bare boob. She hummed her approval as she lapped up the young boy\u2019s seed like a dog drinking water, smacked her lips with a pleasant smile, swallowed, and then opened her mouth wide. \u201cAll gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde\u2019s eyes were the size of dinner plates as he stared down her maw. If his body would only listen to him, he\u2019d probably start crawling towards her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want head or feet first? Personally, I\u2019ve found head is less stressful for first timers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-head,\u201d replied Clyde, barely even thinking anymore. There were just far too many sensations competing for attention that his mental processing had slowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni nodded and leaned forward, pulling Clyde up to a sitting position and keeping her hands on his shoulders. With a lick of her lips and an eager expression, she once more opened her mouth wide and wider still. Clyde\u2019s face was pelted by her minty fresh breath as he stared into the blurry dripping cavern. All the lights went out once the lips closed around his face, followed by the wet slap of her tongue. Normally such grossness would repulse the nervous boy, but Leni\u2019s tantalizing moans had a strangely relaxing quality. He wanted to hear more, so he leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just her eyes, Leni shot Lincoln a look that said \u2018thank you\u2019, which he answered with a thumbs up. Leni\u2019s hands descended down Clyde\u2019s thin frame as she pulled his entire head into her mouth. She felt him laugh when she touched his tickle spots and grinned around her mouthful. Slipping her hands beneath his bony butt, she lifted him from the bed and against her chest. He was smaller than Lincoln, so she could easily wedge him between her boobs. Confident that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere, she decided to give him a full body boob job and squished the globes of fat around his body. His laughter turned to cries of bliss, but nothing intelligible. Leni took her first swallow, slipping her lips over Clyde\u2019s shoulders and his head into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Clyde was overwhelmed was an understatement. Every sound made by Leni\u2019s body echoed with such intensity, especially her moans. She like him, or at least how he tasted. The air was hot and muggy, but knowing that such a pretty girl liked him filled his core with refreshing warmth. There was only blurred darkness ahead, but he wasn\u2019t afraid. He trusted the Louds as friends. Having his arms pinned to his sides was a little disconcerting, but Lincoln had told him enough stories that he knew to just wait until it passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni had wrapped her lips around Clyde\u2019s waist following her latest swallow. Between her experience and his small size, she could have finished him off already if she was so inclined, but she wasn\u2019t. Eating and being eaten were just too fun, and the fact that this was Clyde\u2019s first time meant that she had to do everything to make it a wonderful experience. That was her rationalization for cutting the belly licking short and stealing an early taste of his peepee. Just thinking the word made her giggle. Having his privates stimulated brought Clyde\u2019s legs to life as they started jerking around, though his feet were still restrained in her boobs. Leni took another light swallow and pulled his pelvis into her maw. This freed his feet to flail weakly, but also allowed her to give greater attention to his peepee and balls. Her tongue weaved and constricted around both with the dexterity of a finger. There were still a few drops of cum to be squeezed out, but he was still very limp. At least his groin was tasty, as was his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his swimsuit area so brazenly caressed made Clyde wiggle like a worm. It still felt weird, but in a way he\u2019d decided was kind of good. The fleshy tunnel stroked his body like a massage, just like Lincoln said. And the rhythm of Leni\u2019s heart was hypnotically relaxing. Another swallow sent a ripple through the flesh that pulled him down quicker. With only his legs left in the open air, he felt Leni tilt her head back to quickly slurp them up. Although she did linger to tickle his feet. Clyde was squeezed through a tight orifice into a more spacious cavern. At least he could move his limbs a little. When he felt a pressure against his back, he recognized it as a hand and leaned against the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you doing, buddy?\u201d asked Lincoln as he patted Leni\u2019s pregnant looking belly. He pressed his ear to the skin when he got no answer, only to hear a loud snoring. Both Louds giggled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Lincoln. I really liked eating your friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no problem, although I\u2019m pretty sure Clyde liked it more.\u201d Again, they shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve been a really good brother lately, both with Lucy and me. I think you\u2019ve earned something,\u201d Leni licked her lips and folded her arms to push up her boobs, \u201cspecial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 eep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Leni have in mind for her brother?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever wearing that sweet and sincere smile of hers, Leni did Lincoln the service of relieving him of his clothes, which she dumped haphazardly on top of Clyde\u2019s. She picked him up and hugged him into her tremendous titties. Apparently they were her new favorite toy that she couldn\u2019t stop playing with. Lincoln was in no position to complain, however. In fact, from his position he was practically sitting atop Leni\u2019s belly bulge, aka: Clyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a funny face. Is something wrong?\u201d asked Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt kinda just hit me that I\u2019m about to have sex with my sister while my best friend is inside her. It\u2026 kinda feels awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? You have sex with full bellied preds all the time.\u201d That they were family went without saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but usually those bellies are full of sisters or strangers. This is the first time it\u2019s been a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni frowned sympathetically. \u201cI still don\u2019t really get it, but if it makes you feel better, we can do doggy style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled his gratitude. \u201cSee, that\u2019s why everyone says you\u2019re the nice sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni was practically glowing from the compliment. She set Lincoln down, got on her knees, and bent over onto the bed. Her chest pillows were durable enough to support her weight fine, but she adjusted herself to leave her belly dangling in the open. \u201cClyde\u2019s still snoring, so I\u2019m gonna try not to squish him,\u201d she informed while pulling her robe up to give full access to her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but won\u2019t he wake up anyway, ya know, once things start rocking?\u201d Lincoln tried to play it cool, but Leni\u2019s ass kept drawing him in like the gravity of a black hole. It was just so round and perfect, built up from a lifetime of eating people who\u2019d contributed to her exquisite beauty. Even if it was only the third biggest in the house, it probably had more concentrated mass than he did in his whole body. His erection throbbed painfully just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni looked thoughtful before an idea struck. \u201cIs that lube?\u201d She pointed to a squeeze tube on the dresser, which Lincoln had learned to keep handy for occasions just like this one. \u201cJust use that and you can, like, climb on my butt. Less rocking that way.\u201d Leni\u2019s logic was surprisingly sound. Her rump was so big that she often needed to pull her cheeks wide apart and either squat down extra low or lay down on her belly just so Lincoln could reach. Climbing on top was the most feasible solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it!\u201d Lincoln grabbed the lube and applied a reasonable dollop to his cock. The viscous liquid was striking cool. Using one hand to pull her ass apart, he used the still coated hand to massage the goop on and around Leni\u2019s anus. The pink pucker twitched in anticipation as its owner shuddered and bit her lip. \u201cThat good, huh? How about this?\u201d Lincoln sunk two fingers into the pucker, followed by the rest of his hand. The orifice twitched around him as he began applying the slimy substance to Leni\u2019s inner walls. Unlike Lynn, for a predator of Leni\u2019s level, lube was more of a courtesy than a necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that should do it,\u201d Leni gasped. Her breathing was heavy and her cheeks flushed. All the Loud ladies had extra sensitive asses and erogenous zones in general. It was one of the few downsides to being a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln felt no shame in using this to his advantage whenever possible, rationalizing that this was nature\u2019s way of evening the playing field. As such, he sunk his fingers into Leni\u2019s bootyful backside, making her yelp as he squeezed, and pulled himself up the side. Going up along the middle ran the risk of getting stuck. It was a long and arduous journey, but Lincoln ascended to the top of Mt. Leni. However, before he\u2019d even realized it, his body was attempting to hotdog his sister\u2019s ass as if by muscle memory. The friction of her skin against his just felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni cleared her throat. \u201cHurry up, Linky! My bumbum is hungry for your peepee.\u201d She tittered and gave her jiggly rump a light shake, almost throwing Lincoln off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right. Okay. Here goes!\u201d Using his knees to pry her ass cheeks apart, Lincoln lined up his pecker with her twitching asshole. He touched the tip to the wrinkled flesh, causing both siblings to suck wind through their teeth, but Lincoln was undaunted. Her anus was slippery, but the rest of her butt flesh was spongy, enabling him to sink the head in. He laughed and said, \u201cW-wow. A-almost feels like lips trying to pull me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wants you, Linky,\u201d Leni whined, heightening her pitch to sound extra cutesy. \u201cMy butt neeeeds you. It\u2019s so empty. Please fill me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnngh! I can\u2019t stand when you talk like that,\u201d Lincoln groaned with lust. His grip slipped and he fell forward, hilting his cock fully in her rectum, but also causing her bountiful butt cheeks to clamp shut around his middle. He tried to pull free, but something was off. \u201cUgh! Leni, you\u2019re not squeezing me, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. Don\u2019t be mad. You just feel soooo good in there. Mmh. I\u2019ve got my brother\u2019s penis in my bumbum and a boy in my belly. What more could a girl ask for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. Leni was becoming complacent. Nothing good could come from this. Lincoln had to act fast if he wanted to walk out of this room on his own two feet, but Leni was holding him too tight. Hang on\u2026 \u201cHow about a butt full of your brother\u2019s cum?\u201d Lincoln offered. \u201cI\u2019d love to pump your ass full, but you\u2019re clamping so hard I can hardly-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d Leni reached back and pulled her ass cheeks apart. \u201cJust hurry and fuck me. Pump my ass full and don\u2019t you dare stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye-aye.\u201d Smirking triumphantly, Lincoln finally set about doing the deed. His cock had been teased for so long that he didn\u2019t bother starting off slow. Leni\u2019s ass needed a rough pounding and he was honor bound to give it to her. He tried to not get distracted by the coziness of her alluring, jiggling butt cheeks and focus on the task at hand. Despite having pushed whole people through that ring, the orifice was still amazingly tight. Each time he pulled out, Leni would moan in want, compelling him to smash back in all the harder. Her cries of bliss were even louder and more beautiful when he did so. Lincoln bit his lip as he humped away, making his sister sing as he played her like an instrument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni felt an odd sense of embarrassment at being dominated by her brother. If any guy was going to get the best of her, she\u2019d have preferred it be him. However, it was still a little humiliating for a predator to be topped by prey, and especially one so young. Even so, such thoughts were but fleeting distractions amidst the ecstasy coming from her ass and belly. Clyde was stirring, not quite awake, but his movements inside her sent tingles through her body. And Lincoln was being extra rough on her back door, just like she liked. The sounds of wet sliding and the slapping of skin filled the room. Leni could only give unintelligible moans and grunts as she felt her core swell to the point of bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was just as far along. Each slap of his balls into Leni\u2019s taint brought him ever closer. \u201cGuhhh!\u201d He slammed back inside one last time and came. Leni slammed her face into his pillow to muffle her screams while he hung onto her waist and buttocks like his life depended on it. He didn\u2019t unload as much jizz as he\u2019d have liked, having not yet fully recovered from the ordeal with Luna, but it was still enough to satisfy his beloved sister. Lincoln rested his cheek against her lower back as her screaming calmed. As much as he loved the sex and belly time, there was no arguing with the simple pleasures of cuddling those closest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an appropriate amount of time waiting, Lincoln tried to pull himself free, only to find that he was stuck again. This time it was Leni\u2019s anus clamping down on his cock, and refusing to let go. \u201cUh, Leni. Think you could relax your butt a little? I\u2019m ready to get down, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Leni respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she let him go? She could try holding him in place and carry him around in her butt cheeks. Anal vore is always an option. Someone catching them in the act could be fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOops. Sorry, Linky.\u201d Leni relaxed her anus and released Lincoln\u2019s cock. He slid down along the curve of her backside and hit the ground feet first, for which he was rather proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was fun,\u201d Lincoln said as Leni stood and turned around, almost hitting him in the face with her belly full of Clyde. He could hear the guy still snoring. \u201cMan, he\u2019s a heavy sleeper. So, what are you gonna do with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni stared down over the expanse of her breasts and belly at her naked brother, only to yawn. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go take a nap and, like, let Clyde work his way through my system,\u201d she said while tenderly stroking her stomach. \u201cHe\u2019ll be out in a few hours. I want him to enjoy the full experience, even if he\u2019s asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips. On the one hand, he was happy for Clyde finally being eaten. Truly that first experience would be something he\u2019d remember forever. On the other hand, his friend was now out of commission for the next few hours until Leni pooped him out. The girl departed for her room, robe still hanging low, while Lincoln was left to wonder what to do with himself until then. That\u2019s when he remembered the VoM comic. His and Clyde\u2019s copies were still on the dresser. And since he was already comfortably naked, he grabbed one, kicked back, and dove into the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaa!\u201d Lincoln jumped right out of bed. \u201cLucy! Why do you always have to\u2026 Lucy?\u201d He looked around but there was no sign of the goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln looked skyward where a pair of eyes were watching him from the vent. \u201cLana? What are you doing up there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLola thinks she heard a rat up here. I\u2019m gonna flush it out and feed it to my babies,\u201d explained the dirty twin eagerly, referring to her myriad of pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes and got back into bed. \u201cWell, good luck with that. Just don\u2019t try eating it yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana huffed. \u201cThat\u2019s a dumb rule. Animal fur tastes great. I should be able to eat them if I want. Plus they make excellent practice\u2026 I assume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d Lincoln turned the page and attempted to tune her out. When he failed to hear the sounds of vent crawling, he looked back up. \u201cWas there something you needed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, actually. Lucy said you helped her with some hunting practice and I was thinking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy just needed a confidence boost. She seemed like she knew what to do. She just needed a push to go out and do it. If there\u2019s one thing Lana Loud already has in spades, its confidence,\u201d Lincoln deflected insistently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo arguments here,\u201d she boasted. \u201cBut I was actually looking for some practical experience. You know me. I\u2019m a hands-on learner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh. And just what kind of experience are we talking?\u201d Lincoln asked warily. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in Luna\u2019s pussy <i>and</i> I just got off of Leni\u2019s butt, so I\u2019m pretty beat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good. Cuz I was hoping to practice some unbirth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s brow rose. He didn\u2019t exactly keep tabs on how far along all his sisters were in their predatory skills, but he was pretty sure that someone his size was out of the twins\u2019 league. \u201cWouldn\u2019t Lola or Lisa make better practice partners for that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already asked them, but they\u2019re busy. And Lucy\u2019s left, too. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned his defeat and closed the book. It seemed like he\u2019d started something with Lucy, and now he had to finish it. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the condition that you also bring Lola.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw man! Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if she finds out you got pred practice without her, she\u2019ll treat it like she caught someone cheating in a pageant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana shuddered. \u201cFair point. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Lincoln knew it, both his twin sisters were sitting on his bed, and all three were naked. Apparently all it took for Lola to not be busy was the suggestion of falling behind Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cleared his throat. \u201cFirst of all, I just want to make it clear that when I helped Lucy, my main strategy was to get another sister to do the heavy lifting. Ya know, cuz they actually know how this stuff works. I might be your brother, but I\u2019m still prey. I\u2019m basically an outsider looking in. There\u2019s only so much I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. You got this,\u201d assured Lana. \u201cLuan said you just gotta stick your arm waaay up there and move it around to work the muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that you\u2019ve got Lola on board, why not use <i>her</i> arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only here to make sure things stay fair,\u201d asserted the pink sister. \u201cBesides, your arms are bigger, which will give an even better stretch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Linky!\u201d Lola begged. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with more experience going inside a predator than anyone in the house. You know what feels good and\u2026 and\u2026 how to make it not hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cIs that why you don\u2019t want to do it with Lana? You\u2019re afraid of it hurting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola averted her gaze. \u201cWe\u2026 haven\u2019t exactly been practicing, ya know, down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana nodded. \u201cWe heard from some older girls at the bus stop that the first time down there is\u2026 really painful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had to force himself not to face palm. \u201cGuys, they were talking about sex. The first time for prey girls having <i>sex</i> is painful. Predators don\u2019t have that problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so, I\u2019d feel more comfortable if it was you who did it,\u201d Lola admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Same. You know how to be gentle. Everyone else\u2026\u201d Lana trailed off, her meaning clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln groaned as the twins looked up with shimmering, pleading eyes. They were using the big brother card. He couldn\u2019t say no to the big brother card. Finally he gave a defeated sigh and muttered, \u201cI\u2019m such a pushover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we know, but that\u2019s why we love you,\u201d assured Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Then let\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d His decision made, Lincoln pushed up his nonexistent sleeves and got to work. He started by extending both hands to rub the twins\u2019 pussies. His fingers explored their slits and tested their give, making both little girls start to moan, which threatened to revive his cock. Lincoln tried tuning them out as he sunk two fingers into each pussy to get a finger banging going. \u201cSo far, so good. Not too tight and a good amount of pull,\u201d he appraised expertly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for the big one.\u201d Extending his fingers like he was doing a karate chop, Lincoln carefully slid both hands up his sisters\u2019 twats. Both cried out and started flailing. Lola swore like a sailor while Lana had the sense to find a pillow to bite. Lincoln pressed onward, focusing only on the muscles undulating around his upper arms. \u201cGetting a little tighter. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d be able to fit a same-size body this far.\u201d Each set of fingers slipped through an orifice into their wombs. This sent the twins over the edge as their backs arched and they came over his arms. Lincoln patiently waited for their orgasms to pass before attempting to go further. Ultimately, he couldn\u2019t even reach his elbows. \u201cThat\u2019s it. The walls won\u2019t give.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-try moving,\u201d urged Lola. Both twins were panting hotly on Lincoln\u2019s bed, but they were already gaining their second wind. \u201cW-work your h-hand around. Make us stretchy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill biting the pillow, Lana only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but you guys have to tell me if it\u2019s too much.\u201d At their agreement, Lincoln tried pushing against the slimy and fleshy walls of their insides. He pushed both arms down to stretch against the mattress. His fingers wiggled to tickle around their wombs. He tried pushing back until they were against the wall, ever mindful of the sounds they made. While he was fairly confident in his ability to tell the difference between groans of arousal and pain, he was still very careful not to over exert himself. \u201cSee, this is why you need an older sister for this, like Lynn. I bet she\u2019d know if you\u2019re supposed to do one big push or a bunch of little ones,\u201d he griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-keep going,\u201d begged Lana. \u201cS-so gooood!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other alternative, Lincoln continued his experimental approach. He alternated different kinds of pushes and listening to his sisters\u2019 pleasured moans. This went on for several minutes, but Lincoln never stopped feeling like he was grasping in the dark. The only thing that kept him going was the aroused and needy expressions of his sisters. For the second time the twins came, even more intensely than before. They squirted so hard that some girl jizz got on Lincoln\u2019s face, which he happily licked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the twins lying limp on his bed, their chests rising and falling with their labored breaths, Lincoln asked. \u201cEnough?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Typical. Pulling back only dragged them along the bed. So he tried pressing them together and using the friction of their bodies to wiggle his arms free. Doing so required even more movement, which caused the twins to orgasm again. Eventually his arms were free. Sticky, but free. Then the twins\u2019 predator endurance kicked in enough for them to finally stand on their own. They were still winded, covered in sweat; their inner thighs were a mess of sex juices as their gaping pussies slowly closed, and both gap-toothed smiles beamed ever so thankfully up at their big brother. They hugged him, paying no mind to petty things like stickiness when there were important things like hugs to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot, Linky. That felt super good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa see. I told ya unbirth was fun,\u201d Lana boasted. \u201cWe totally need to practice more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really should,\u201d agreed Lincoln, setting his hands on the twins\u2019 backs to hold them close. \u201cBut you really ought to see an older sister to make sure you\u2019re doing it right, first. Lynn at the youngest. Use each other and practice dolls as much as you can, just like regular vore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have all of you inside me,\u201d Lola gushed as her face rubbed into his stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna feel sooo gooood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln smiled and rubbed her back. \u201cI can\u2019t wait, either. I know you\u2019ll feel as good as the rest of our older sisters, but be patient. That\u2019s still a few years off.\u201d Even if his words were wise, it still felt a little hypocritical to say them, given all the times he\u2019d needed to be told that exact message and all in just the last month at that. He was growing at the same rate as the twins, at least for now. It wouldn\u2019t be until they were big enough to digest people more regularly that they\u2019d start to overtake him in height as Lucy had. The goth already had a half inch over him and that gap would just keep widening, but that was fine. He loved seeing his sisters big, happy, and healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of healthy\u2026 That was about the time that both twins noticed Lincoln\u2019s resurrected erection. They shared a knowing grin where he couldn\u2019t see, waited for his guard to fully relax, and then dove down. Lincoln gasped as twin pairs of lips kissed onto his shaft. The twins licked along the stretched skin and hummed their approval at the rich flavor. Lincoln set his hands on their heads to try and push them away, but together they pushed right back. After kissing one another around his meat, the twins switched for a more coordinated attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola slid up along the shaft, licking and sucking delicately, until she reached the head. She laughed when her tongue sampled the difference in texture and made Lincoln shudder. Now directly in front of him, she sunk the head of his cock fully into her lips. Suckling like it was candy, she hilted herself quickly, not even gagging when the tip poked her uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana had gone south to the boy\u2019s balls. She loved playing with them. Bouncing them in her fingers always made her laugh for some reason, but tasting was even better. They were so small and delicate, and the hand pressed against the top of her head was a gentle reminder to be careful. Lana knew well how to tend to sensitive machinery as she suckled the salty, sweaty orbs. Her lips came off with a wet pop and she said, \u201cI can taste Leni on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola slid off the shaft and smacked her lips in satisfaction. \u201cLuna, too, though not as strong.\u201d She looked up at her brother with bedroom eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly been making the rounds this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes, even as he fought against the pleasure. \u201cTell me about it. I g-guess that\u2019s the p-price you pay for p-popularity,\u201d he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh poor you. Hehe. I can\u2019t wait until I can fit all of you inside me.\u201d Lola purred as she nuzzled his cock against her dainty little nose. \u201cI\u2019ll make you cry out and beg for more,\u201d She then applied another lick to Lincoln\u2019s shaft before sinking back down to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana, meanwhile, scooted around to Lincoln\u2019s back. \u201cYeah, playing with the pussy is fun and all, but give me butt stuff anytime.\u201d The dirty twin parted her lips wide and engulfed the whole of Lincoln\u2019s ass, making him yelp. She wasn\u2019t trying to swallow him, but just wanted full access to his buttocks, which she found especially delicious. Her slippery tongue coated over his smooth cheeks with tender affection as he was sandwiched between the twins. When the slimy appendage touched his pucker, Lincoln gasped and felt himself twitch in Lola\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this as her cue, Lola finally started bobbing her head up and down the shaft. While she gave her brother fellatio, she reached around to take Lana\u2019s free hand. The dirty twin might have been having a blast eating ass, but Lola wanted her sister to share in the bounty they were both striving for. Regardless, Lola picked up the pace, pulling back until only the head was inside her lips, and then slammed her face against her brother\u2019s pelvis, swirling her tongue with each thrust. She loved the way his meat thrummed with his pulse, and his moans as the twins double teamed him was like honey to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-ummiiing!\u201d Lincoln warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Lola squeezed Lana\u2019s hand, just in case she missed it. The dirty twin abandoned eating her brother\u2019s ass and hurried back around to the front. Lola pulled off of Lincoln\u2019s slick cock, but kept pumping the base while Lana resumed fondling his testicles. When Lincoln set his hands on both twins\u2019 heads, they got right up to his cock head, mouths wide, tongues out, and cheeks pressed tightly together. Lincoln erupted out into the open air and right onto his sisters\u2019 eager faces. The moment his cum touched their tongues, any semblance of fair play vanished as the pair started struggling for control over his faucet. They shoved, punched, swore, and much more around Lincoln\u2019s sensitive bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for him, he didn\u2019t have much in the tank. So even though the pair knocked him over as they vied for dominance, there wasn\u2019t a lot to fight over. It didn\u2019t take long for their bickering to be silenced with licks as they lapped up any and all spilled seed, especially on each other. Lincoln just lay on the floor, breathing heavily as he let the twins work it out of their system. When they had, they helped their sticky brother up, each kissed his cheeks, and set him back on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Linky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019re the best brother a pred could ask for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big brother card played to fulfillment, Lincoln only gave a weak thumbs up and collapsed into the sheets. What does Lincoln do when he wakes up?</span></div></div>",

Checking the clock, he heaved a sigh that it was already lunch time. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being me sometimes. Having so many people packed in one space tends to eat up your time one way or another. That becomes pretty literal when your house is full of predators,\u201d he deadpanned to his audience as he slipped into his clothes from earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t even have time to get properly cleaned if I want to get to the good leftovers in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spraying on enough deodorizer to render a dog nose blind, Lincoln headed out to what was a pretty standard level of chaos and loudness. Good. If everyone was still doing their own things, that increased his odds of making it to the kitchen unmolested\u2026 Probably a poor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcushe me, elder male shibling. Might I borrow you for a moment?\u201d Lisa asked, stepping out of her room in a hazmat suit. It was distressing just how numb Lincoln was to such a sight by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it is, can it wait? I\u2019d really like to get to the fridge before-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShomeone shtealesh your chicken nuggetsh.\u201d Face expressionless, Lisa produced a plate with Lincoln\u2019s coveted breaded treats, all sizzling hot. \u201cAll cooked to perfection, thanksh to my homemade oven.\u201d There came a sound of something heavy bouncing around behind the genius, followed by a crash, which was very distinct from a standard explosion. Still looking unfazed, Lisa closed the door behind her. \u201cCare to try one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln frowned. For the umpteenth time today, a sister had backed him into a corner. \u201cI might not be Lola, but if this is a trick to experiment on me, I\u2019m definitely telling mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be paranoid.\u201d The crashing from Lisa\u2019s room resumed, only now there was a rhythm, almost like something was dancing. \u201cThe only experiment here ish the effectivenessh of my oven. By all meansh. Enjoy.\u201d She pushed the plate out into his hands. As Lincoln shrugged and popped a bite into his mouth, Lisa muttered, \u201cBeshidesh, that rule only appliesh to chemicalsh and drugsh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what now?\u201d Lincoln asked mid chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shaid nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello mah baby. Hello mah honey. Hello mah ragtime gaaal!\u201d sang something from Lisa\u2019s room, making her look very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln continue to chew, now especially mindful of what might be in his mouth. It was actually pretty good. \u201cSo long as I don\u2019t see it and it doesn\u2019t affect me, I\u2019ve got nothing to tattle about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dishcretion ish mosht appreciated.\u201d Lisa nodded. \u201cAnd the nuggetsh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln swallowed. \u201cBetter than usual, actually.\u201d Anticipating her next question, he began patting himself down and taking a few test steps. \u201cNo adverse side effects, yet,\u201d he said the last word in warning before taking another bite. \u201cOh, that reminds me. Is Clyde out of Leni yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet. Our elder shishter ish enjoying moving him through her digeshtive tract,\u201d Lisa said as she pulled out a notebook to jot down her observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln took another bite. \u201cStill good. Also, have you had time to read the book we got you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \u201cThe art ish nicely detailed, the protagonisht ish above average by human shtandardsh,\u201d high praise from her, \u201cand there are jusht enough cluesh for a keen eyed obsherver to put the piecesh together. I\u2019ve yet to figure out any myshteriesh before the detective, to the author\u2019sh credit, but I don\u2019t feel cheated, like the cashe wash sholved with an assh pull. Overall, very shatishfactory. And you? How ish the chicken?\u201d She gave nothing away as a purple tentacle sprouted from Lincoln\u2019s head, only to fall off and shrivel up behind him. He was none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad.\u201d Lincoln swallowed and popped in another bite. \u201cI probably don\u2019t want to know what you did to these things, but they\u2019re great. I think you might have another patent in the works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Lisa waited for him to finish eating, discretely shuffling any other growths off to the side before Lincoln could notice. When he was done, she took back the plate. \u201cYour cooperation, ash alwaysh, ish appreciated.\u201d Then she sniffed. \u201cAlthough I recommend that you abshcond to the shower, posht hashte. You know what\u2019sh likely to happen once theshe animalsh shmell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. About that.\u201d Lincoln rubbed the back of his head. \u201cYou think you could-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoin you on the journey to the bathroom in the hopesh of deterring our shavage shiblingsh from being triggered by your aroma and acting ash though in heat?\u201d Lisa said all in one breath. \u201cCertainly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back to their respective rooms to grab a change of clothes, with Lisa definitely not engaging in an epic battle against the latest monstrosity birthed by her experiments. They made it to the bathroom and, much to their surprise, had it all to themselves. The pair stripped and hopped in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa\u2019s experiments might be dangerous, but without her tools, she\u2019s one of the safest sisters to be around,\u201d Lincoln said. Although in this case, it might just be his inner monologue being heard by the audience, as Lisa gave no indication that she heard anything. She just made a sound of contentment as he kneaded shampoo into her scalp. \u201cLisa\u2019s young enough that her sex drive is effectively zero. She\u2019ll lick people just for the taste, rather than any other kind of gratification. Not to mention that she\u2019s not even old enough to digest anyone yet. She can only get Lily down, and only after a lot of struggling. It can be hard for a young pred, always being told they had to wait until they\u2019re ready. Fortunately for Lisa, her hobbies keep her pretty busy. Though I can tell she\u2019s envious of our other sisters. That\u2019s something the two of us have in common. Even so, I\u2019m almost as eager as she is for the day when she can finally digest someone, thus becoming a full predator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you wash my back next? I can never sheem to reach,\u201d requested the squinting genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Lincoln grabbed the rag and scrubbed firmly across his second youngest sister\u2019s skin. As one of his sisters, he was still pretty familiar with her body. No curves, other than some lingering baby fat, a flat butt, flatter chest, and super short. She was young enough to still be considered extra sweet, at least in what Lincoln understood of predator preferences. However, if given the choice, their sisters were still more likely to swallow him than her. Preferential treatment really wasn\u2019t all that great, to be honest, but Lincoln endured. He still enjoyed these quieter moments where he and his sister could just wash each other\u2019s backs without any lewd overtones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, with all the stuff you\u2019re always building, you think you could make something like a super deodorizer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what purposhe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so that the next time I\u2019m left in a puddle of sweat and sex juices in my room, I don\u2019t have to brave no-man\u2019s land just to get the stink off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. A meansh of attaining inshtant hygiene for prey looking to avoid opportunishtic predatorsh.\u201d Still squinting, Lisa turned a deadpan stare back at her brother. \u201cYou do realize I have a biash in favor of you washing my hair, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m always glad to lend a hand, but that\u2019s exactly the problem. No offense, but you guys can be awfully needy sometimes. I\u2019m not asking for a break, just a way to walk down the hall with some peace of mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \u201cI shupposhe \u2018needy\u2019 ish a fair asshesshment for a wily predator, and you <i>do</i> do a lot for ush. Very well,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI\u2019ll shee what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Lincoln grabbed Lisa from behind and pulled her naked body to his in a constrictive embrace. \u201cThanks a lot, Lisa. You don\u2019t know what this means to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have an inkling.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s flaccid cock was rubbing against her flat buttocks. And while she was still too young to fully appreciate the sensation, that didn\u2019t stop a light blush from reddening her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair dried one another off, got dressed, and amicably parted ways. Lisa had not only gotten some valuable data from her brother, but also the shared shower was an effective means of unwinding after a long day of twisting the natural order to her sick and depraved whims. Speaking of which, as she entered her and Lily\u2019s room, it seemed that the shriveled tentacles weren\u2019t so shriveled anymore. \u201cShtay back you fiendsh! I have a flamethrower and I know how to ushe it!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lincoln reunited with Clyde shortly after the lucky guy had been pooped out by Leni. The middle Loud had little issue with helping his buddy get clean, regain his land legs, and get dressed; all the while the former meal kept staring at his devourer with goo-goo eyes. Naked people just weren\u2019t as big a deal to him as they were to most, except if there were overt sexual implications in play. Luckily, Leni was content to play on her phone for a while, giving the boys the opportunity to exit the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln wiped some sweat from his brow. \u201cPhew. That was close. It looked like Lynn might\u2019ve gotten us there for a second,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut look at you. I haven\u2019t seen you run that fast since that free giveaway of Ace Savvy merchandise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde beamed and pushed out his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I feel amazing; refreshed, even. It\u2019s like I can take on the whole world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown there, buddy,\u201d Lincoln said soberingly. \u201cYou\u2019re just coming off of a post-vore hi. I get it. They\u2019re super relaxing, but I\u2019m kinda surprised you got all this extra energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always found power naps very stimulating. Looks like a belly nap is that, but in spades.\u201d He swooned. \u201cLeni\u2019s the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought a smile to Lincoln\u2019s face. \u201cSee. What\u2019d I tell you, buddy? All preds do that all the time. There\u2019s a reason our house is practically a business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sign me up, cuz Clyde McBride just became a loyal customer.\u201d He fished around for his wallet. \u201cWhat are Lori\u2019s rates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln chuckled. \u201cUnless they\u2019re hurting for cash, mostly they take whatever\u2019s offered by whoever they think looks good. But for you, I think they\u2019ll be willing to bump you up the wait list.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClyde pumped his fist. \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil then, what\u2019s say we put all that extra energy of yours to work?\u201d Lincoln pulled out two pairs of binoculars and indicated a duffle bag filled with their brand name spy gear. \u201cClincoln McLoud super sleuths?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClincoln McLoud super sleuths!\u201d Clyde cheered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two donned their deluxe spy gear and ventured forth into the neighborhood in search of mystery and adventure. Naturally, they dove into the nearest set of bushes with a good view of the neighborhood. Open windows of any sort were an open invitation to the pair. Predators in the neighborhood tended to attract a certain kind of  neighbor, and the neighbors around the Loud house were an interesting bunch, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a bogey at 3 o\u2019clock on the second floor,\u201d announced Clyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible. Lana\u2019s done picking her nose by 2.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln chuckled. \u201cYeah, yeah. I know what you meant, buddy,\u201d he said while aiming his binoculars at the Yates\u2019 house. Upon seeing another set of binoculars looking back at him, he panicked. \u201cAhh! Our position\u2019s been compromised. Abort!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelay that. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve spotted us,\u201d countered Clyde. \u201cIt looks more like they\u2019re just watching your house in general.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatching our house?\u201d Suspicions at their peak, Lincoln resumed his viewing to confirmed that Mrs. Yates wasn\u2019t actually looking at them. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Mrs. Yates seems to be just looking at our house, but for what purpose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer, the much shorter and stockier Mr. Yates came up from behind his wife, hugged her from behind, and stuck his hand down the front of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we got a couple of voyeurs,\u201d assessed Clyde clinically. \u201cAnd since they\u2019re watching <i>your</i> house, it\u2019s probably safe to assume what they\u2019re hoping to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips. \u201cWell that\u2019s weird. If they want to see vore, they could just ask to come over. Better yet, they could apply as volunteers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but some people just like to watch. Plus this way is probably cheaper.\u201d As Clyde spoke, Mr. Yates had unbuttoned his wife\u2019s top to better reach into her blouse while she was trying to say something. \u201cFemale subject is speaking. If romance movies have taught me anything, she\u2019s probably making something up about what she\u2019s seeing in order to excite her husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of romance movies have you been watching?\u201d questioned Lincoln, more out of curiosity than shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dads have quite the collection,\u201d Clyde answered cryptically. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve made a discovery at the house of Yates. Should we pass on this intel to the proper authorities, or hold onto it in order to avoid causing an incident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a reasonable dilemma. Telling anyone in the Loud house was pretty much guaranteed to send at least a few of them over to give the Yates exactly what they wanted, or at least what they seemed to want. Not like anyone could stop a small army of Louds once they got started, anyway. Naturally, Lincoln could go along if he so chose. There were some cute girls at the Yates\u2019 place, even if their perpetually smiling faces gave him the creeps sometimes. Maybe they\u2019d look less unsettling with his cock in their mouths while a sister at them feet first? The whole lot of them really needed to unwind, in Lincoln\u2019s opinion. And if Clyde was any indication, a day with the Louds would certainly do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he <i>had</i> been complaining basically all day about being oversexed with his sisters. Wasn\u2019t it a little hypocritical to suddenly turn around and jump at the chance for sex with non-family? Probably not. Maybe short sighted would be better, given that a family visit like that would devolve into a full on orgy real quick. Plus it was nice to just hang out and play with Clyde like regular kids. On yet another hand\u2026 Wait, did he have three hands? After eating something Lisa had given him, Lincoln performed a quick check to confirm that the number of limbs remained unchanged. Good. He really didn\u2019t want to have a repeat of last month\u2019s incident. Anyway, on the hypothetical hand, Clyde could come along. He\u2019d never been to a Loud orgy before and catching Lori with her belly full was the ideal time to solicit her for extra intimate cuddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?<br>\r\nNothing. Keep being regular kids for a while.<br>\r\nSound the alarms and unleash the Louds of war!<br>\r\nGo over and talk to the Yates with just him and Clyde.<br>\r\nSomeone is looking for them.</span></div></div>",

How\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. Not bad.\u201d Dressed in her usual hoodie and a helmet under her arm, she offered the pair of them a helping hand up. \u201cI was just passing through the neighborhood, doing some sick moves,\u201d she indicated her skateboard, \u201cand then I noticed you guys creeping through the bushes. You\u2019re not stalking anyone, are you?\u201d she asked with a coy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but it turns out the Yates may be voyeurs.\u201d Clyde handed her his binoculars and pointed to the window in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie Anne stared at said window for quite a while before putting the binoculars down, cheeks flushed. \u201cIt still weirds me out how not weirded out you guys are with stuff like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith my family, strangers getting off while they watch us is pretty mundane,\u201d Lincoln explained evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I just had my first vore experience with Leni,\u201d Clyde boasted. \u201cClyde the boy is no more. From now on, you can call me Clyde the MAN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie Anne looked unimpressed. \u201cOh hey, is that a stain on your shirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is?\u201d Clyde looked down, only to get his nose flicked. Now it was his turn to look unimpressed as Ronnie Anne mocked his gullibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you finally popped your vore cherry, huh? That\u2019s cool,\u201d she said after working the snickers out of her system. \u201cIs it actually as good as they say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Clyde confirmed. \u201cAll that stuff about a full body massage. That doesn\u2019t even come close to how great it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re curious,\u201d Lincoln trailed off and motioned up to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but no thanks, Linc. I think I\u2019ll take a page out of their book,\u201d she gestured at the Yates\u2019 place, \u201cand just stick to watching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lincoln\u2019s turn to smile coyly. \u201cYou know they\u2019re doing more than watching, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t get any funny ideas.\u201d Ronnie blushed and pointed a threatening finger in Lincoln\u2019s face. \u201cI might like you, but I don\u2019t <i>like</i> you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing weakness, Lincoln decided to press the attack. \u201cYou\u2019re not still afraid to come in my house, are you?\u201d he asked of the stunned Hispanic girl. \u201cI told you, I cleared it up with my sisters. They accepted your apology, so now we can all be friends without fear of digestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie pursed her lips and looked away. \u201cWhatever. And for the record, I was never afraid. You\u2019re family\u2019s just a little\u2026 overwhelming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstatement of the century,\u201d agreed Clyde. \u201cIt\u2019s basically impossible to spend 5 minutes in that house without someone licking you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right. And I know I\u2019m not exactly one to talk on the matter, but it\u2019s like no one in that house has any concept of personal space,\u201d Ronnie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen almost half your time is spent <i>inside</i> another person, personal space is more theoretical than anything,\u201d Lincoln offered helpfully. \u201cSeriously, my mom and sisters\u2019 collective stomachs are like a second room to me at this point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that\u2019s so wild,\u201d awed Ronnie. Admittedly, she was a little curious. Between Lincoln and Bobby, it was impossible to not be. Months back, Ronnie had almost made a grave mistake when she started picking on Lincoln for reasons she still didn\u2019t fully understand. Had she been a boy, his sisters would have digested her for sure, but luckily they all thought her actions were just a misguided attempt at flirting. They so weren\u2019t, though, and the girls\u2019 patience was wearing thin. It wasn\u2019t long before Lynn and Lucy started dropping hints in the halls that her \u2018flirting\u2019 was too aggressive for their liking. When Lori came over with Bobby, she was even less subtle, saying in no uncertain terms that if Lincoln ever got hurt because of her, then the blonde would literally digest her while fucking Bobby. That was about the time that Ronnie realized she\u2019d been poking a sleeping bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, that was all behind them. The pair found that they had a good bit in common and became friends. However, simply being off the menu didn\u2019t stop her growing fascination with vore. The Louds weren\u2019t just the local pseudo celebrities that she could keep a safe distance from anymore. They were a part of her life now and the things they did were frequently in her face. If it wasn\u2019t someone with a bloated stomach, it was casual nudity. If it wasn\u2019t that, then it was how she could no longer tune out seemingly everyone around her talking about their own weird obsessions with the family. And to top it off, Lincoln Loud, her best guy friend, effectively had zero sense of shame when it came to talking about sex and vore. It always left Ronnie feeling weird, though she still wasn\u2019t sure if it was a bad kind of weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Lincoln spoke up, startling Ronnie back to reality. \u201cWe were just playing spies. Want to join us? You could be our arch nemesis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie frowned. \u201cHow come I have to be the bad guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause of the three of us, you have the best evil laugh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie opened her mouth to protest, only to reconsider and shrug. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minutes later, and the boys were chasing the evil Dr. Angela up and down the street. Her doom buggy might have given her speed, but the boys had range with the deadliest of nerf guns. More than once she tried weaving through houses to throw them off, but the grass lawns always cut down on her speed and let the boys catch up. It was all a ploy, however, as she also had superior maneuverability that left her pursuers in the dust. Any pretense of being spies had been abandoned for a variation of tag, but at least everyone was having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Stinken?\u201d greeted Lynn, dressed for the outdoors, as she came up on her dirt bike. \u201cLooks to me like you\u2019re finally on the fun side of the hunt.\u201d She looked over to Ronnie who had come to a halt a few yards ahead, and licked her lips. \u201cI can see why you\u2019re chasing her. She looks yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Lincoln said in exasperation, oblivious to Ronnie\u2019s hot blush. \u201cWe\u2019re playing spies, not hunters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cSpies hunt all the time, and it looks like you\u2019re at the part of the movie with the big chase scene. Also looks like your prey\u2019s a wily one. Those that play hard to get are always the most fun to chase. If you\u2019d like, I could give you a few pointers on how to catch her, just so long as I get a share of the spoils.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are no spoils, Lynn. Clyde and I are spies chasing the evil Dr. Angela before she can flood the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you a doctor of, exactly?\u201d Lynn called over to Ronnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got my PHD in BS, though my specialty is putting nerds in their place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn turned to Lincoln with an even wider grin. \u201cOh yeah. That one\u2019s definitely worth chasing.\u201d Then she turned to Clyde and looked him over. \u201cSo, now that Leni\u2019s taken your vore cherry, does that mean you\u2019re available for the Lynn Miester?\u201d she asked while rubbing her stomach, earning a nose bleed from Clyde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she still found the Louds super weird, seeing Lynn tease Clyde like that put Ronnie at ease, bizarre as that might have been. It helped to normalize the athletic Loud. That certainly would have been the sort of thing Ronnie would do if she were a predator and, ya know, into that stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do things go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn joins the game.<br>\r\nLynn leaves them to keep playing.<br>\r\nThey go inside.<br>\r\nThey go to Ronnie Anne\u2019s place.</span></div></div>",

Looks like we\u2019re going to have to pick things up later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no problem.\u201d Lincoln shared a fist bump with Clyde before he ran home. \u201cSee you at school, buddy.\u201d He waved goodbye and turned to his sister and other friend, looking thoughtful. \u201cLynn, since I\u2019m down a partner\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can play!?\u201d she gushed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you promise not to eat Ronnie,\u201d he said authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn puttered her lips in defeat. \u201cFine, but we both know my way\u2019s way more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie smiled at Lincoln coming to her defense. He might have been a dork, but he was also a pretty cool guy\u2026 not that she\u2019d ever say so to his face. Everyone took their new positions to resume the chase. Lincoln yammered some in-game explanation for why he had to change partners, but Ronnie barely paid any attention. Lynn had agreed to leave her bike behind, but she was known as the athletic Loud for a reason. Even on foot, she posed an imminent threat. Ronnie could no longer afford to slow down to taunt her pursuers. Now the tables had turned and it was Lynn doing the taunting, always getting just close enough to grab Ronnie, only to break off at the last minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie\u2019s heart raced each time the athlete drew near. Lynn\u2019 smile also proved infectious, much to her prey\u2019s annoyance. Despite herself, Ronnie was actually having fun being chased. She was still determined not to get caught and risk Lynn breaking Lincoln\u2019s rule, but that just added a layer of excitement. Speaking of\u2026 \u201cWhaaa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026\u201d Ronnie and Lincoln groaned as they lay tangled in a heap. Ronnie had been so focused on Lynn as she drove her skateboard up and down the road, she\u2019d completely lost track of Lincoln. Between his sister\u2019s athletic prowess and Ronnie\u2019s wheels, the boy had fallen so far behind that he\u2019d wound up ahead of them both, leading to the collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn came to a halt over the pair, set her hands on her hips, and looked on with an appraising eye. \u201cWhoa, that looks like it hurts. Hehe. Not a bad crash, Stinken. You make an excellent speed bump,\u201d she praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Am I bleeding?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn rolled her eyes and checked her brother over with her hands. \u201cNah, you\u2019re fine. Too bad. A few scars could\u2019ve toughened you up.\u201d She turned to inspect Ronnie, feeling her up far more than was probably necessary. \u201cSame to you, though I\u2019ve got to say you\u2019ve got a nice body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie blushed. \u201cI\u2026 what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You were rocking that board before. I can tell you must practice often. It really shows with the muscle balance. There\u2019s room for improvement, but when is there not, am I right?\u201d Lynn laughed. \u201cHow come you don\u2019t try out for sports? I\u2019m on, like, all of them for my age, but I get the feeling you\u2019d be top of the league for your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie smiled bashfully. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you to say, but I\u2019m really not much of a team player, ya know.\u201d She picked up her board and gave it a spin. \u201cI\u2019m more of a solo act, if you get my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear ya loud and clear, sister.\u201d Lynn laughed, which turned into a groan. \u201cI\u2019ve been hanging out with Luan too much. But there are still plenty of solo things you can try out for. I\u2019ve been trying to get this knuckle head,\u201d she pulled Lincoln into a headlock, \u201cto join a racing team since second grade. His endurance might not be the best, but he knows how to call on some mad energy for short bursts of speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Ronnie replied, a little suspicious. \u201cWhere was that a few minutes ago? I was skating circles around you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln pursed his lips and averted his gaze. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t want to leave Clyde behind. Then the game just kept going, and I guess I got tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d Lynn cooed as she gave Lincoln an affectionate noogy. \u201cMy little bro\u2019s got team spirit after all.\u201d Then she turned to Ronnie with a lascivious grin. \u201cTo be clear, when I say his endurance needs work, I\u2019m talking about when his legs are moving. On his knees or on his back, and he can go for a stupid long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLynnnn!\u201d Lincoln whined as he tried to pull free. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn stared blankly at him for a couple seconds before her coy grin returned. \u201cAnd?\u201d She laughed when he slumped in her grasp. \u201cAww, don\u2019t take it so hard, bro.\u201d She set him back on his feet and let him go. \u201cThat\u2019s <i>my</i> job, remember? Bow-chica-wow-wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie had never considered herself a very imaginative sort, but right now her mind was tormenting her with all manner of horrific scenarios. All of them involved Lincoln being naked with his family. Said thoughts were making her feel all tingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lynn had a lightbulb moment. \u201cSay, since we were both the hunters chasing our prey-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot prey,\u201d Lincoln interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and you caught her, that means she\u2019s yours to do with whatever you want,\u201d she finished with a suggestive eyebrow wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cLynn, we\u2019re playing <i>spies</i>, remember. When we catch the bad guy, we thwart her evil scheme which, in this case, was to take over the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Ronnie added nervously. \u201cThe day is saved. Yippee,\u201d she cheered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn shook her head. \u201cNo can do, bro. You know how these movies work. The best villains always come back in the sequels. If you want to save the world, you\u2019re gonna have to lock this bad guy up somewhere she\u2019ll never escape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLynn, stop it. I said you couldn\u2019t eat her, so stop trying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but you saying I can\u2019t just makes me want her more.\u201d She looked past Lincoln and exaggeratedly licked her lips at Ronnie. \u201cC\u2019mon, girl. I can tell you\u2019re curious. We can take it super slow and I\u2019ll go any position you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Bad Lynn!\u201d Lincoln pulled out a squirt bottle and sprayed Lynn in the face until she backed down. He positioned himself defensively between the girls. \u201cConvincing is one thing, but you can\u2019t go around pressuring people like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Yes I can,\u201d Lynn asserted, holding her hands up like a shield. \u201cI do it all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but with <i>your</i> friends, not mine. Now back off.\u201d Lincoln sprayed her in the face again, making his sister hiss like a cat before grabbing her bike and scurrying off. Lincoln gave a relieved sigh and turned back to his friend, puzzled as to why her cheeks were so red. \u201cUh, you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah. I mean\u2026\u201d Ronnie rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever defended me like that before. And I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever fended off a Loud like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Lincoln tried spinning the spray bottle like he was a cowboy doing tricks with his pistol, only to fumble and send it flying. \u201cDang it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Ronnie offered, running into the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but it\u2019s really not a big deal. My sisters can be pretty persistent when they want to eat someone, especially me, but you just have to know how to talk to them. With Lynn, if the spray bottle didn\u2019t work, I had this.\u201d Lincoln reached into his pocket and pulled out a red ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s impressive. And also hilarious,\u201d Ronnie chuckled as she returned the bottle. \u201cIs your sister part dog or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility that we\u2019ve discussed many times in family meetings,\u201d Lincoln admitted. \u201cActually, how about we trade. The ball for the bottle. That way if Lynn ever gives you trouble again, you can defend yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, really? But\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I have a bunch more stored in my room. The bottle\u2019s more valuable, anyway. I just have to say its soapy water and Lana can\u2019t run away fast enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie chuckled as they made the exchange. \u201cWhoa, dude. I know you like to call yourself the man with the plan, but I thought it was just some cheesy nickname. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d actually <i>earned</i> that title.\u201d She regarded the ball and slipped it into her hoody\u2019s pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s go to your place.<br>\r\nLet\u2019s go to my place.<br>\r\nSmell ya later.<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s that over there?</span></div></div>",

So far it\u2019s got a promising start. Ya wanna read it with me?\u201d Lincoln offered without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ronnie squeaked, but with countless second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. I left my copy up in my room.\u201d Lincoln motioned Ronnie to follow him, taking several steps before finally realizing what he was doing, but not the full scope of things. \u201cYou\u2019re cool with coming inside, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a paper plane flew out of the window. It caught the wind just right as it flew right into Ronnie\u2019s hands. She unfolded it and read aloud. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said. Then there\u2019s a heart and its signed Luan.\u201d She looked up at Lincoln before crumbling and tossing the paper. \u201cYeah, actually. I mean, so long as you\u2019re there to keep your sisters in line, I guess I can-\u201d She was cut short by a hand pressed against her mouth. Lincoln\u2019s face was frighteningly close to her and he was shushing her urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever say that when they\u2019re in earshot!\u201d Lincoln whispered. \u201cThey\u2019ll take it as a challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 we\u2019re not even on your property yet.\u201d Ronnie motioned to the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trust me, alright. My mom and sisters have their ways of knowing these things. Just\u2026 try to act normal. Don\u2019t show fear, but don\u2019t be too confident, either. There\u2019s\u2026 a lot of ways to provoke my sisters, though usually they\u2019re pretty behaved when company is over\u2026 relatively speaking.\u201d He smiled awkwardly. \u201cSo, uh, about those comics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie Anne, despite every nerve in her body screaming to take the hint and just start running, replied. \u201cY-yeah. Let\u2019s get to reading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the Loud house was pretty much exactly what one might expect from the name. Lots of noise from shouts, laughter, whirring from the kitchen, the revving of a drivable toy car for kids, and what Ronnie was certain was an explosion. The girls of the house, the predators, were all doing their own thing and, much to Ronnie\u2019s relief, barely paid her a second glance. Lincoln suddenly grabbed her by the hand and started pulling her up the stairs. She followed, mindful to heed his advice about keeping calm without looking overconfident. She also tried to not make it too obvious that she was huddling close to Lincoln for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s this book about, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVampires of Melancholia, or VoM for short. It\u2019s a soap opera about vampires. The characters are really glum all the time, but they face some interesting supernatural drama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds pretty neat. So what does it-oof! Hey, what gives?\u201d She demanded irately. Lincoln had just stopped at the top of the stairs, resulting in her bumping into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln said nothing. He merely motioned for Ronnie to stay back as he ascended the final step onto the second floor. When nothing happened, he looked around, only to appear disappointed. \u201cTypical. The one time I\u2019m actually ready for Lucy, and she\u2019s not even here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lincoln.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Lincoln jumped back. \u201cLuan!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, don\u2019t be scared, little brother. You know my bite is worse than my bark. Or was it the reverse? I get the two mixed up sometimes.\u201d Luan laughed and then clicked her teeth together in a chomp. \u201cOh, hey Ronnie Anne. Haven\u2019t seen you in a while. Did you get my message?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. That was funny,\u201d Ronnie affirmed, mostly to keep the peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. Don\u2019t be such a stiff.\u201d In the blink of an eye, Luan had closed the distance and pulled the younger girl into a bone constricting embrace. She also pressed her face into the younger girls neck, took a deep inhale, and gave a brief lick. \u201cMmh. You\u2019re tasting awful yummy today. What\u2019s the occasion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln cleared his throat and gently pulled Ronnie away from Luan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to my room to read my new VoM comic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThe one with the vampires and the werewolves. Well, have you checked her yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChecked for what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she\u2019s a werewolf, duh. You don\u2019t want to find out after the full moon\u2019s already risen. Haha. Get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie frowned. \u201cI\u2026 really don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinky likes to read comics in his undies,\u201d Leni informed plainly as she strutted by and down the stairs, dressed only in a pair of shoes, sunglasses, and a purse. \u201cYou two have fun. I\u2019m off to the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeniii!\u201d Rita chided. \u201cNo nudity outside the house. Get that tight butt back upstairs and put some clothes on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops. Sorry mom.\u201d Leni hurried back up and down the hall to her room, though she was mindful to give her hips an added sway when she noticed who all was staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie had suffered a blue screen moment and was left gawking at the top of the stairs. So much had happened so quickly that she was having trouble processing it all. Luan\u2026 undies\u2026 Lincoln\u2026 dat ass! It was too much, too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln, having seen this look before, took Ronnie\u2019s hand and hurried her into his room where they were less likely to be bothered by his sisters. He closed the door behind them, just in time to miss the roaring of chainsaws from Lisa\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie finally snapped out of her stupor. \u201cWha\u2026? What happened? How\u2019d I get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. Looks like you experienced an overdose of Loud,\u201d diagnosed Lincoln. He pressed his forehead to hers to check her temperature. \u201cHmm. A little warm, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to worry about. So, uh, welcome to casa Lincoln.\u201d He opened his arms to indicate his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all coming back to Ronnie as she looked around. This was the place Lincoln slept. She was now alone, with a boy, in his room, while a pack of rabid predators stalked the halls just outside. This had not been her smartest idea. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, kind of small,\u201d she said, trying to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln shrugged. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s actually a converted closet, but I\u2019m the only one in the house with his own room, so I take what I can get.\u201d He looked around and wondered where he should start his little tour. \u201cUh oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ronnie asked, suddenly fretful that the sisters had broken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo copies.\u201d Lincoln held up the two books. \u201cClyde must\u2019ve forgotten his. Oh well. I can return it to him tomorrow. But hey, at least this means we each get our own book,\u201d he said while handing a copy to Ronnie, which she tentatively took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, great. Um, I might have just imagined it, but it sounded like your sister Luan said something about you reading comics in your,\u201d she swallowed, \u201cundies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Lincoln answered plainly. \u201cI like being comfy while I read and clothes are just so constricting.\u201d Then Lincoln thought about his words and how they might be taken by an outsider. \u201cI don\u2019t have to if it bothers you, though. I\u2019ve already read this one, so I can just wait for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, no. that\u2019s fine. I mean, this is <i>your</i> house. It wouldn\u2019t be right for me to impose,\u201d Ronnie said politely. On the inside, however, she was screaming at herself. Where were these words coming from and why was her mouth so insistent on spitting them out? \u201cBesides, I\u2019d feel awkward if you were just watching me read.\u201d Which was honest enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, cool. I try to be mindful of the fact that not everyone\u2019s used to this kind of environment,\u201d Lincoln explained as he pulled his shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis revealed to Ronnie that he wasn\u2019t quite as scrawny as she\u2019d believed. There was some actual muscle definition there, if only a little. He continued stripping, turning around and letting his jeans drop. Ronnie\u2019s eyes were starting to hurt from going so long without blinking. It almost felt like her peepers might pop right out of her skull when he turned around in his near naked glory, looking perfectly content with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was either the best idea Ronnie Anne ever had, or the worst\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat flavor of awkward will you choose next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair read comics \u2018peacefully\u2019.<br>\r\nNosy sisters are nosy.<br>\r\nRita has some words.<br>\r\nClyde calls Lincoln.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Lincoln read, Lola had called a secret sibling meeting. Upon seeing how serious she was, everyone dropped what they were doing and gathered in Lori and Leni\u2019s room. They took up their usual sitting arrangements, with the exception of Leni still being inside of Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal-e-o, li\u2019l sis?\u201d asked the rocker. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Lincoln? Shouldn\u2019t he be here, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola took up the presenter position on the wall opposite the beds. \u201cLincoln is the subject of this meeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled sounds came from Luna\u2019s gut, with the rocker electing to translate. \u201cLeni wants to go on record that she\u2019s not comfortable with talking about Link behind his back. I\u2019d like to second that motion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuan raised her hand. \u201cThird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this even about, Lola?\u201d questioned Lori before things got out of hand and everyone walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was just thinking that maybe\u2026 possibly\u2026. We miiight be a little too hard on Lincoln.\u201d At Lola\u2019s words, she was immediately met with an uproar of accusations and denials from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roll of her eyes, Lori joined the pink sister in the presenting spot, picked up her gavel, and tapped it to her desk. \u201cOrder. Order in the\u2026 room. Let Lola say her piece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll decide if she needs to be shoved up Lana\u2019s butt after the fact.\u201d Lori turned a warning look on the smaller blonde, giving her the chance to reconsider her position. Lola, to the surprise of none, stubbornly refused to back down. \u201cVery well. You may speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d Lola cleared her throat and addressed her audience. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not trying to suggest anything crazy like we should stop eating him. I think we can all agree that he\u2019s our favorite boy to swallow.\u201d That got a round of affirmatives from the sisters. \u201cBut he\u2019s more than just a yummy treat. He\u2019s our brother.\u201d She indicated her dress. \u201cHe just finished repairing my dress for me and all he wanted in return was a safe escort back to his room. And that\u2019s just the latest example. I saw all of you,\u201d she pointed between the three eldest sisters, \u201cand mom asking him for stuff earlier. You\u2019d basically cornered him with no way out except into someone\u2019s gut. Does that seem fair to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s prey, dudette. Going inside a predator is kinda his thing,\u201d Luna argued, not sounding like she fully believed her own words. \u201cUgh, speak up Leni. I don\u2019t want to be your translator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just saying that all I wanted was a tummy rub, and maybe a little naked snuggling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Lola said skeptically. \u201cMeaning you were gonna crush him under that giant gut of yours.\u201d Leni had no reply as Lola looked up to Luna. \u201cAnd you. Do you really have to say that you don\u2019t view Lincoln as a real man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon, dudette. He knows I\u2019m just foolin\u2019 around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat <i>is</i> a little on the mean side,\u201d added Luan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeak, fam,\u201d Luna griped. \u201cI was gonna shove the little dude up my pussy.\u201d She patted her swollen gut. \u201cHe\u2019d been looking down lately, so I thought I\u2019d do him a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy backing him into a corner?\u201d deadpanned Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna opened her mouth to argue her point, but nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori threw up her hands defensively. \u201cHey, whoa now. Before we get ahead of ourselves, I had a phone rattling around in my stomach. You all know how annoying that is. I really thought it was his, so it made sense for him to get it. Besides, he said it was nice of me to not digest what I thought was his.\u201d She folded her arms in vindication. \u201cSo there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is that we all push Lincoln around too much. He\u2019s more than just our prey and we need to show him how much we like him for more than his taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you proposing?\u201d Lori asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple ideas, but I\u2019d like to put it out to the floor. Let\u2019s think of something we can do for Lincoln to show how much he means to us\u2026 that doesn\u2019t involve vore.\u201d That last part got a round of whines and complaints, but ultimately they agreed. Now they just had to think of something.</span></div></div>",

Lincoln Loud here,\u201d he said, beginning the morning by breaking the fourth wall. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why my room looks so different. Well, that\u2019s because it is. It\u2019s actually my sister Lori\u2019s old doll house. See, I was born a minizora. That means that at a mere three inches tall, I don\u2019t have much chance of getting any bigger, but that\u2019s life. And really, my life is pretty great, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got loving parents, ten awesome sisters, and pets that actually don\u2019t want to chew on me. Then there are my clothes, a private TV, game station, comics, and pretty much all the essentials of life at a miniature size. I even have a private bathroom, though it\u2019s more like a tiny porta-potty that needs to be emptied once a week. Really, I\u2019m pretty lucky. Granted, being so small, I\u2019m pretty dependent on my sisters for a lot of stuff. I\u2019m basically not allowed to go anywhere outside the house unless one of them is carrying me. Worse, because I\u2019m so small and cute, most of the time they insist on carrying me inside their clothes. That can get pretty nasty when one of them has a gas attack. Bleh. But usually it\u2019s fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom and sisters have really soft, warm bodies, so except for a bad gas attack, I don\u2019t mind being carried around in someone\u2019s bra or even panties. And being a minizora, I\u2019m durable enough that I can take pretty much whatever life throws at me, even my family using me as a communal sex toy. Again, not usually a problem. My family does so much for me and it\u2019s nice that I can give something back. It\u2019s like my household chore. Certainly beats taking out the trash, I can tell you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock at the dollhouse door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it looks like my day is about to get started.\u201d Lincoln casually headed over to the red plastic door, ready to greet the world with a smile on his face, but who was there to greet him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood morning, baby bro,\u201d greeted the eldest Loud sister as she opened the wall of the doll house. Lori was blonde, like their mother, and took after her in a lot of other ways. Blessed by Rita\u2019s genes, she had the same curves, full chest, and hips that just wouldn\u2019t stop as the woman who birthed her. Her smile was kind, but also a little condescending as she looked into her younger brother\u2019s little apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lori,\u201d Lincoln replied casually, waving as he sat on the edge of his bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts breakfast time, dork. And it\u2019s my turn for Lincoln duty today, so you know what that means,\u201d she said with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln scratched his chin, rubbed the back of his neck, and went through several other thoughtful poses as he paced, pretending to wonder. \u201cLet me see here. Hmm. Does it mean\u2026 I\u2019m going in your underwear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori tittered, reached into the doll house, and scooped up her littlest sibling. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer before depositing him into her cleavage. It was the most convenient position for all involved, keeping the carrier\u2019s hands free while affording Lincoln a decent view. Not to mention he felt really good wiggling against a pair of sensitive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s bosoms were soft and just a little bit squishy, making them ideal for reclining. Lincoln did just that, or at least as best he could while his lower half was wedged within boob flesh. He gave a contented sigh and spread his hands out, feeling the way his sister\u2019s skin bristled with goose bumps. It was a nice feeling. \u201cOh, you know. Just a feeling,\u201d he replied blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey!\u201d whined Leni. Second oldest, her figure was almost as curvy as Lori\u2019s, though she had more of a ditzy charm that tended to draw in more boys. \u201cHow come you get Lincoln today? I thought it was supposed to be my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, before we made that bet, remember?\u201d Lori reminded smugly. \u201cYou lost, which means that your day now belongs to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was broken from his relaxation by the sight of his sad sister. Leni in particular was such an innocent soul that it actually hurt to see her upset. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what do you care? My boobs are bigger than hers, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had to struggle to twist around and face the tyrannical sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not about boobs. It\u2019s about being a good brother. Today was Leni\u2019s turn and you shouldn\u2019t have made that bet in the first place. Besides, just because it\u2019s your turn, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got me exclusively. Clyde\u2019s coming over today, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but I don\u2019t see the problem,\u201d Lori dismissed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be just fine doing whatever it is you guys do while staring at my chest all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grimaced. \u201cOkay, probably; but my point still stands. Besides, it\u2019s not like you asked me about this dumb bet. I might be a minizora, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat me as an object to be passed around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori scoffed down at the boy in her cleavage. \u201cLincoln, that\u2019s literally what being a minizora is all about. You can\u2019t look after yourself, so it\u2019s up to your family to keep you safe. And, as a part of this family, that means you\u2019ve got to pull your weight around here, bucko.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, I know, which is what I\u2019m arguing for. Today is supposed to be Leni\u2019s turn. She\u2019s been waiting over a week for this; and honestly, so have I. How can you just take away our day together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were going to go shopping,\u201d Leni sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Leni. You\u2019re too nice for your own good sometimes. Time with Lincoln is like time in the bathroom. You want it; you\u2019ve got to seize it when the other\u2019s aren\u2019t looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln heaved a heavy sigh. Lori wasn\u2019t wrong. He loved his sisters and liked spending time with them. The turns system was supposed to keep things fair. But alas, too often his sisters would get impatient. One minute he might be critiquing Lucy on her latest poem, and then she\u2019d turn her back and he\u2019d find himself in the audience of Luan\u2019s latest joke routine. And then there were all the things that happened outside the turns. Even if it was Lola\u2019s turn, Lyn would still get to borrow him by shoving him in her jockstrap and going through an elaborate exercise routine as part of her superstitious sports rituals. Then there were the deals. Sometimes it was a bet, but others it was like when Luna offered to do Lana\u2019s chores for a week if she got to bring Lincoln along for her date with Sam. That\u2026 had been a nice night. Admittedly, the system was pretty broken, but it was still preferable to total anarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Lincoln, it was actually Leni who delivered the winning argument. Not with eloquent words, as those had never been the blonde airhead\u2019s strong suit, but with action. Specifically, she started whimpering like a kicked puppy. Lincoln had to shield his eyes, for no one with a soul could withstand Leni\u2019s unparalleled pitifulness. Lori, however, wasn\u2019t so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d groused the eldest. \u201cI still won, so I\u2019m keeping Lincoln until lunch. You can have him after that. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni perked up immediately and rushed over, wrapping Lori in a constrictive embrace. \u201cThank-you-thank-you-thank-you! You\u2019re the best!\u201d As she gushed, she also unknowingly smothered her chest against Lincoln, compressing him between a boob and a soft place. Fortunately, he was used to this kind of treatment. The only surprising thing was that when Lori finally pushed Leni away, Lincoln was still wedged in Lori\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I know I\u2019m great,\u201d Lori replied, nonchalantly checking her nails as her free hand adjusted her bra. Though it was really an excuse to coax Lincoln into wiggling more. As every Loud sister knew, his little body was a boundless source of stimulation. \u201cOkay, Stinken,\u201d she said down to her boobs. \u201cReady to get this Saturday started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Start with the Louds at breakfast<br>\r\n2 Skip to something special Lori had planned</span></div></div>",

Lincoln Loud here,\u201d he said, beginning the morning by breaking the fourth wall. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why my room looks so different. Well, that\u2019s because it is. It\u2019s actually my sister Lori\u2019s old doll house. See, I was born a minizora. That means that at a mere three inches tall, I don\u2019t have much chance of getting any bigger, but that\u2019s life. And really, my life is pretty great, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got loving parents, ten awesome sisters, and pets that actually don\u2019t want to chew on me. Then there are my clothes, a private TV, game station, comics, and pretty much all the essentials of life at a miniature size. I even have a private bathroom, though it\u2019s more like a tiny porta-potty that needs to be emptied once a week. Really, I\u2019m pretty lucky. Granted, being so small, I\u2019m pretty dependent on my sisters for a lot of stuff. I\u2019m basically not allowed to go anywhere outside the house unless one of them is carrying me. Worse, because I\u2019m so small and cute, most of the time they insist on carrying me inside their clothes. That can get pretty nasty when one of them has a gas attack. Bleh. But usually it\u2019s fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom and sisters have really soft, warm bodies, so except for a bad gas attack, I don\u2019t mind being carried around in someone\u2019s bra or even panties. And being a minizora, I\u2019m durable enough that I can take pretty much whatever life throws at me, even my family using me as a communal sex toy. Again, not usually a problem. My family does so much for me and it\u2019s nice that I can give something back. It\u2019s like my household chore. Certainly beats taking out the trash, I can tell you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock at the dollhouse door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it looks like my day is about to get started.\u201d Lincoln casually headed over to the red plastic door, ready to greet the world with a smile on his face, but who was there to greet him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood morning, baby bro,\u201d greeted the eldest Loud sister as she opened the wall of the doll house. Lori was blonde, like their mother, and took after her in a lot of other ways. Blessed by Rita\u2019s genes, she had the same curves, full chest, and hips that just wouldn\u2019t stop as the woman who birthed her. Her smile was kind, but also a little condescending as she looked into her younger brother\u2019s little apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lori,\u201d Lincoln replied casually, waving as he sat on the edge of his bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts breakfast time, dork. And it\u2019s my turn for Lincoln duty today, so you know what that means,\u201d she said with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln scratched his chin, rubbed the back of his neck, and went through several other thoughtful poses as he paced, pretending to wonder. \u201cLet me see here. Hmm. Does it mean\u2026 I\u2019m going in your underwear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori tittered, reached into the doll house, and scooped up her littlest sibling. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer before depositing him into her cleavage. It was the most convenient position for all involved, keeping the carrier\u2019s hands free while affording Lincoln a decent view. Not to mention he felt really good wiggling against a pair of sensitive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori\u2019s bosoms were soft and just a little bit squishy, making them ideal for reclining. Lincoln did just that, or at least as best he could while his lower half was wedged within boob flesh. He gave a contented sigh and spread his hands out, feeling the way his sister\u2019s skin bristled with goose bumps. It was a nice feeling. \u201cOh, you know. Just a feeling,\u201d he replied blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey!\u201d whined Leni. Second oldest, her figure was almost as curvy as Lori\u2019s, though she had more of a ditzy charm that tended to draw in more boys. \u201cHow come you get Lincoln today? I thought it was supposed to be my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, before we made that bet, remember?\u201d Lori reminded smugly. \u201cYou lost, which means that your day now belongs to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln was broken from his relaxation by the sight of his sad sister. Leni in particular was such an innocent soul that it actually hurt to see her upset. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Lori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what do you care? My boobs are bigger than hers, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln had to struggle to twist around and face the tyrannical sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not about boobs. It\u2019s about being a good brother. Today was Leni\u2019s turn and you shouldn\u2019t have made that bet in the first place. Besides, just because it\u2019s your turn, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got me exclusively. Clyde\u2019s coming over today, remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, but I don\u2019t see the problem,\u201d Lori dismissed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be just fine doing whatever it is you guys do while staring at my chest all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln grimaced. \u201cOkay, probably; but my point still stands. Besides, it\u2019s not like you asked me about this dumb bet. I might be a minizora, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat me as an object to be passed around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori scoffed down at the boy in her cleavage. \u201cLincoln, that\u2019s literally what being a minizora is all about. You can\u2019t look after yourself, so it\u2019s up to your family to keep you safe. And, as a part of this family, that means you\u2019ve got to pull your weight around here, bucko.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, I know, which is what I\u2019m arguing for. Today is supposed to be Leni\u2019s turn. She\u2019s been waiting over a week for this; and honestly, so have I. How can you just take away our day together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were going to go shopping,\u201d Leni sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Leni. You\u2019re too nice for your own good sometimes. Time with Lincoln is like time in the bathroom. You want it; you\u2019ve got to seize it when the other\u2019s aren\u2019t looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln heaved a heavy sigh. Lori wasn\u2019t wrong. He loved his sisters and liked spending time with them. The turns system was supposed to keep things fair. But alas, too often his sisters would get impatient. One minute he might be critiquing Lucy on her latest poem, and then she\u2019d turn her back and he\u2019d find himself in the audience of Luan\u2019s latest joke routine. And then there were all the things that happened outside the turns. Even if it was Lola\u2019s turn, Lyn would still get to borrow him by shoving him in her jockstrap and going through an elaborate exercise routine as part of her superstitious sports rituals. Then there were the deals. Sometimes it was a bet, but others it was like when Luna offered to do Lana\u2019s chores for a week if she got to bring Lincoln along for her date with Sam. That\u2026 had been a nice night. Admittedly, the system was pretty broken, but it was still preferable to total anarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Lincoln, it was actually Leni who delivered the winning argument. Not with eloquent words, as those had never been the blonde airhead\u2019s strong suit, but with action. Specifically, she started whimpering like a kicked puppy. Lincoln had to shield his eyes, for no one with a soul could withstand Leni\u2019s unparalleled pitifulness. Lori, however, wasn\u2019t so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d groused the eldest. \u201cI still won, so I\u2019m keeping Lincoln until lunch. You can have him after that. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni perked up immediately and rushed over, wrapping Lori in a constrictive embrace. \u201cThank-you-thank-you-thank-you! You\u2019re the best!\u201d As she gushed, she also unknowingly smothered her chest against Lincoln, compressing him between a boob and a soft place. Fortunately, he was used to this kind of treatment. The only surprising thing was that when Lori finally pushed Leni away, Lincoln was still wedged in Lori\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I know I\u2019m great,\u201d Lori replied, nonchalantly checking her nails as her free hand adjusted her bra. Though it was really an excuse to coax Lincoln into wiggling more. As every Loud sister knew, his little body was a boundless source of stimulation. \u201cOkay, Stinken,\u201d she said down to her boobs. \u201cReady to get this Saturday started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Start with the Louds at breakfast<br>\r\n2 Skip to something special Lori had planned<br>\r\n3 Skip to Leni getting her turn<br>\r\n4 Clyde comes over</span></div></div>",

Even fairies can\u2019t go messing with stuff that powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, and I get that, but what about lust?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Say what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLust. Like, I can\u2019t wish someone would fall in love with me, but can I wish that they fell in lust with me? You know,\u201d his eyes shifted guiltily, \u201cjust curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Wanda pulled out a copy of Da Rulez and began flipping through the pages. Her expression paled as she read the book backwards and forwards. In time she noticed Timmy giving her an expectant look and figured that there was no point delaying the inevitable. \u201cUh\u2026 no. There are no rules on anything related to sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy rubbed his hands together. \u201cSweet. In that case, for my first wish\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWish for sex.<br>\r\nWish for something more kinky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miguel and Tulio had been venturing through the strange jungle for days atop their nobly stolen steed, Altivo. Miguel was ever the optimist and even Tulio, after seeing how many land marks lined up perfectly with the map, was starting to come around. The pair eventually came upon a carved stone in front of a waterfall; the last marker on the map. However, there was no El Dorado, no city of gold. Tulio was infuriated that they\u2019d wasted their time and insisted that they should just get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as if by fate, at that exact moment a group of dark skinned natives emerged from the waterfall. In the lead was a woman who seemed to be struggling to escape. When the Spanish pair saw that she was being pursued by big men armed with spears, they tried to get Altivo to run, but the horse panicked when the woman ran into him. She was in a state of fear, understandably, but was still a lovely thing with long black hair that reach down to her shapely hips, clothing that showed an ample amount of skin, and a luscious full figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they\u2019d been surrounded, the men with spears said nothing, but motioned the trio and their animal to follow. They went behind the waterfall to reveal a dark cavern and a river. All boarded into boats and traveled a short distance. Those who thought themselves prisoners didn\u2019t say a word with guard monitoring them. However, the Spanish pair did notice how said men would stare with greater interest at them, only to turn away when caught. Maybe they were just intrigued by the newcomers. That seemed logical, although the con artist pair sensed that there was more to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the boats came out into the open and the Spanish pair was left in awe. El Dorado \u2013 for there was nothing else they could call it \u2013 was everything they\u2019d ever dreamed and more. Temples as tall as castles sparkled with golden light. Even lesser buildings made of stone and clay had a fondness for gold trimming. Now that they were out of the waterfall\u2019s fog, it was also clear that gold was a favorite jewelry for the people with most wearing gold necklaces or earrings. The people took just as much interest in the newcomers, if not more so. All gathered along the water\u2019s edge to get a look at these two who bore a remarkable resemblance to images carved on their holy walls. The girl, when noticed, was regarded with scorn for her blasphemous desecration, which she still cradled in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon docking, the prisoners were made to disembark. The Spanish duo mounted their horse while the girl trailed behind them. Then, as they were coming to terms with what would surely be their doom, both were surprised when an important looking native began to speak\u2026 and they understood him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold! As the prophecies foretold. The time of judgement is now!\u201d he said while gesturing dramatically as a fat man came up beside him, also looking very important. The first man continued and descended the stares to approach the \u2018prisoners\u2019. \u201cCitizens! Did I not predict that the gods would come to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel and Tulio were natural con artists. It had been their trade for most of their lives. Upon hearing the murmurs of the crowd and seeing where all eyes were focused, it didn\u2019t take long for them to read the room and concoct a scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lords,\u201d greeted the first man with gracious enthusiasm. \u201cI am Tzekel-Kan, your devoted high priest, and speaker for the gods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Chief Tannabok,\u201d introduced the fat man wearing a golden crown. \u201cWhat names may we call you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntroductions followed with Miguel and Tulio adopting regal poses and trying to sound authoritative. That seemed to please the audience. Then Tzekel-Kan grabbed the woman by the wrist, calling her a temple robbing thief, and asked the \u2018gods\u2019 how she should be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-no, my lords,\u201d she begged. \u201cSee, th-the gods sent me a vision to bring them tribute to the temple to guide them here. My only wish is to serve the gods.\u201d She bowed her head in submission, but also shot a pleading look to the Spanish duo. And with even Tzekel-Kan looking at them, it was evident that they had this woman\u2019s life in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will they do? Will they have her released to follow a similar dynamic as in the movie? Or will they keep her as their servant?</span></div></div>",

The priest shoved the thing the thief had been holding back into her arms.  Now that Miguel had a better look at it, the object that had been stolen looked to be a golden head, probably belonging to a statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you return <i>this</i> to the temple,\" sneered Tzekel-Kan, shoving the female thief roughly out of the way.  The thief stumbled for a few steps but managed to remain on her feet.  As she walked away, both Tulio and Miguel noticed the way the hips of the thief swayed back and forth.  If Tzekel-Kan or the chief noticed this, they chose to ignore it. Tzekel-Kan looked to be too busy glaring at the retreating female thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lords. I am Chief Tannabok,\" he introduced himself. \u201cWhat names may we call you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Miguel\" said Miguel in a bold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Tulio\" said Tulio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmurs around the audience surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lords, how long do you intend to stay in El Dorado?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTzekel-Kan turned sharply around and rolled his eyes.  Before Miguel and Tulio could respond, the priest spoke. \"Enough!  You do not ask the gods such questions!\" said Tzekel-Kan  shoving Tannabok as hard as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing his folly, Tannabok humbly bowed his head. \u201cI apologize, my lords. Might we show you to your temple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr would you prefer to show us your power?\" asked Tzekel-Kan.  \"As proof of your divinity?  We are all eager to witness your wondrous powers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Divinity.... right,\" said Tulio.  The Spanish man gave a nervous laugh.   \"Give us a moment\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTulio and Miguel walked a few feet away.  The two gods were having a quiet conversation that Tzekel-Kan and Tannabok couldn't hear.  As the conversation continued, the nearby volcano started to rumble ominously.  This naturally grew the attention of the entire population of the city, save for the two gods having a discussion of all things.   At one point, the one named Miguel was softly hitting Tulio with  his open palm while the other had his eyes tightly closed.  Tannabok and Tzekel-Kan exchanged bewildered glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Stop</b>!\" yelled Tulio in a commanding voice that echoed across the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volcano had been about ready to erupt when it suddenly stopped.  Everyone in the crowd gasped at this occurrence and immediately prostrated themselves.<br>\r\nTulio and Miguel had finally noticed what was happening and opened their arms to bask in the reverence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make us start it up again\" said Miguel when a guard tried standing.  \"Because we <i>will</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

The last remnants of the morning dew fell from the tips of leaves down to the forest floor. The grass shook as animals of all shapes and sizes stalked, scurried, and foraged. The gentle lapping of a nearby stream flowed into a nearby pond filled with the croaking of rainbow frogs.

She enjoyed their company, since she had been completely alone until she found them wandering helplessly in her part of the jungle. When she found them they were without shelter during a powerful thunderstorm and looked like they haven't eaten in days, she has taken care of them ever since. They were lucky that it was her that found them and not a big cat or poisonous snake. They also happened to be in  the relatively safe part of the jungle that Megan called home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeighboring this oasis of safety was a hostile world. To the south the jungle grows denser and is populated with predators, until the jungle suddenly stops and massive metal and glass structures climb into the sky, she knew the area was populated because the spires would light up at night from electric lights, like the ones in her home, but because of a gut feeling of dread and the alien look of the buildings she stayed away. To the north was a different matter. After a weeks journey through a  inhospitable swamp the jungle was filled with an evil amazon tribe, that would kidnap any that dared enter their land, or so Megan had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had also seen was that the hunters of the amazon tribe were only 6 feet tall at best, suggesting that Megan was the tallest person in the land at 9 feet high. Megan also saw that the amazons wore animal skins around their chests and over their pelvic areas, as opposed to herself, Kate, and Mark lacking any such fabrics to cover themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn these last months she has learned much about her guests, they were both barely adults with Kate just a year older than Mark. Kate was like Megan in having dark hair and deep blue eyes, though being much smaller and standing only 5 and a half feet tall. Kate looked up to Megan wanting to be as strong and independent as the amazon and hardly left her side. Her brother, as Kate referred to him, was taller than Kate and had short black hair, though having only seen a few Amazons, the first thing Megan noticed was that Mark was unlike herself and Kate. She later concluded that there were probably other males like him in the city to the south, and that there wouldn't be any in the amazon ruled jungle, although she still couldn't figure out what males were for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared of into space at the table, reflecting on the time the three had spent together, fishing, hunting, teaching them how to survive, and just staring up at the night sky looking at the stars. She is suddenly brought back into reality by a loud bang in the distance. Megan ran out of the cabin and onto the deck and scanned the horizon to the south.  the sky was lit up with fire and columns of smoke towered into the sky. After a few moments another bang echoed through the jungle and another fire appeared, this one closer than the last. As the night went on the sound of explosions and fleeing animals filled the air, and the fires grew closer. Megan held Kate and Mark close as the two watched the inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate looked up to Megan and in a confused voice asked, \"What's going on? What's causing all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's the people to the south, clearing the area to expand were going to have to leave the area it won't be safe for much longer. The only question is where should we go.\" Megan said as she carefully considered her options.</span></div></div>",

Megan embraced Kate tightly and comforted her. \"Stay calm Kate, if you lose your nerve you won't make it far. We're going to follow the animals' lead and head north, then look for a new home after we cross the swamp. This is dangerous territory so I need you to stay strong for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stared into Megan's deep blue eyes and was filled with hope from the confidence in the amazon's expression. \" I'll be strong for you.\" Kate said, the fear in her voice now replaced admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women break their embrace just as Mark enters the room. Megan motions towards the door and they take the first steeps of their long journey. Outside they are greeted by a completely different world. Smoke clouds their vision, with what little they can see tinted in a red hue from the fires. The peaceful sound of birds now replaced by the screaming and growling of animals and an metallic inhuman screech growing louder. Megan lead the group away from the fire, walking at first then frantic sprinting as the screech grew closer and closer. Moving north was difficult with no cleared path the group was forced to push through dense jungle, resulting in minor bruises and cuts on their bare skin. After clearing a few miles of rough terrain and climbing a steep hill the group turn around and and look at their former home. Near the cleared land, that the cabin was built on,  the tip of a metal object could be seen above the tree line. The object slowly walked into the clearance, each step causing the earth to shake slightly. The object now stood exposed, A large spherical body held up by six large spider like legs, a portion of the sphere  opened  revealing a large blue crystal. The crystal glowed bright and in a flash a red beam of light appeared and scorched the earth everywhere it touched. The group watches in awe as their home is devoured by fire. They were so entranced that they failed to notice as a large figure slowly  creep towards them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the group watched the mechanical being burn the jungle, a large black panther watched them from the shadows. Megan had unknowingly lead the group straight into the panther's territory. Unlike the other animals this predator held its ground against the advancing threat, and considered the group's trespassing an act of aggression. It moved slowly and silently until it was within striking range. Letting out a low growl  the panther pounced.  Megan heard the growl and turned around, and she saw the beast leaping through the air towards Mark, with little time to act Megan was able to knock Mark out of the way. Mark was now safe, however Megan was now in the panther's path. Megan hit the ground with a loud thud, as her vision focused she saw  the beast's massive maw lowering towards her. Megan quickly jabs the wooden shaft of her spear on the panther's neck to keep its razor sharp teeth away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline pumped through Kate as she watched the powerful amazon struggle underneath the panther's weight. Kate let out a roar of primal fury and ran to Megan's aid, driving her spear into the panther's neck.  The panther recoiled in pain, giving Megan an opening to kick the colossal beast off her. The panther cried out in pain before returning to its feet and darting away.  Now standing in clear sight for the first time the group saw the behemoth in all it glory, standing as tall as Megan showing teeth that could easily be larger than a normal man's face. Megan picked herself up off the ground just as the panther circled around readying itself for another attack. The beast jumped through the air once more, but this time Megan was prepared, she dropped to one knee and thrust her spear forward  causing the beast to impale itself. The spear drove straight through the panther's chest striking the heart and killing it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan are you alright?\" Mark asked as he ran to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine thanks to Kate, she is turning into quite the amazon.\" Megan said while smiling at Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's face turns red and she averts her eyes away from Megan. \"... I... just didn't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dusting herself off, Megan once more leads the group north wanting to stay as far away from whatever the machines from the south. The next few days pass without incident, but as they reach the border of the swamplands they come across the remains of a camp site. The fire pit is cold and empty, only one tent stands, wrecked though it may be, yet marks on the ground indicate more tents once stood, the most disturbing image however is the drag marks and trail of dry blood that start from the wrecked tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" Mark asked as he raised his spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan held her spear tight and slowly followed the trail of blood. \" I'm not sure just be rea...... oh my god.\" Megan finished. At the end of the drag marks the half eaten carcass of a man laid on the ground still rotting, tightly clenching a book in its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate puts her hand over her mouth in disgust, but overcomes the gruesome sight and retrieves the book. \"It's a diary, detailing a trip into a cave down the road.\" Megan said while pointing then began reading from the last entries in the book. \" Day five and we're still lost, we thought this could be a safe route past the marsh of the dead, but its a damn labyrinth down here and I fear we are going in circles. Took make matters worse some of the guys are losing their grip on reality, claiming to see a monster stalking us its probably just the near black lighting  playing tricks on overactive imaginations. Day six, We should leave, we should turn back and exit the way we came in, but something is drawing me in, A voice in the back of my head calling to me from the center of this maze. I'm seeing it now too and hearing a growl, It's watching us waiting for a moment to strike. I shouldn't be taking my eyes away from the shadows even to write, but I find it is the only thing that can calm my nerves.  Day seven, oh god oh god, their dead all of them, I know it. It sprang from the shadows and started to rip us apart, and ... and I ran, I just left them. The only thing keeping me going is a light in the distance I must reach it. Day eight, I've made it out, I'm safe now. However it's as I feared I came out the way we entered, and whats worse I can still feel that thing's eye burning into my soul, watching me, waiting. \" At this point Kate looks up with a grim look and said \" This next part is written in his own blood....., It followed me out, and started to eat me alive, before leaving me to die a slow painful death. I write this now as a warning to all that may find this, if you go into it's lair it will never stop hunting you... Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The marsh of the dead, that's what the swamp is called! So are choices are this swamp of the dead or, from how that book describes it, the gates of hell, that's just wonderful.\" Mark says hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing the gruesome corpse Megan wanted nothing to do with the cave, but just like the dead man, a voice in her head beckoned her to enter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan placed her hand on Mark's shoulder and said, \"Don't worry the swamp is dangerous, but it's nothing like this\". Megan takes one last look at the body, before leading everyone away from the cave and towards the marshland. As they get closer to the swamp, the jungle becomes less dense until it reaches the point where the only vegetation is patches of tall grass and everything became silent after they reached the border of the swamp. Fog clouded their vision, but from what they could see showed how inhospitable the landscape was. The water was murky and near black, and it was devoid of life, with the exception of plants Megan recognized as poisonous. Megan walks into the murky water and continues forward with ease, but for Mark and Kate the water reached their waists. Mark kept his spear ready to strike, and attempted to scan the water as he moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this the fog is limiting our visibility and the water is to dark to see into. Anything could be out here.\" Mark said quietly in case anything dangerous was near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've crossed this swamp before nothing lives here. The swamp's water is toxic if you drink it, so there are no crocodiles, panthers or anything else out here. Are biggest danger here is dehydration so speed is more important than defense here.\" Megan said before picking up her pace. Mark lowered his spear and speed up to keep up with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when did you come through here Megan, I mean you haven't left our side since you found us. How long ago was it?\" Kate asked as she speed up so that she could walk side by side with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure exactly when, but it was as far back as I could remember. I just woke up remembering barely anything, I only knew my name and that I wasn't always like this.\" Megan said motioning to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't always have that amazing amazon body.\" Kate said shortly before turning red, realizing how her statement could be interpreted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked down at her young companion and smiled innocently before continuing her story. \"No, but I'm not sure what changed me. Then shortly after gaining consciousness I was hunted through the jungle by other amazons. They finally stopped chasing me when I reached the swamp\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group presses forward as Megan details how she crossed the marsh, explored the jungle and, built her home. Three days have passed and the three continued to struggle forward despite their lack drinkable water. At this point even the disgusting, black, murky water seemed welcoming, the only thing holding the group back was the knowledge that drinking it would cause an agonizing death. The thirst had lead to conflict in the group, Mark having grown angry at the situation blamed Megan for taking them into the swamp. Kate stood up for Megan leading to the two to grow distant and causing the group to continue in tense silence. As the group approached a sandbar Mark saw something small dart through the water and over a near by hill. \"I just saw something over there.\" Mark said raising his spear,\" if we catch it it will help us a little.\" Megan and Kate nodded and followed Mark over the hill on the sandbar. As the three cleared the top of the hill they moved right into a pool of quicksand, and were quickly pulled in up to their chests. The three struggled but they soon realized they couldn't get free on their own. Then when the group seems to have lost all hope, a wooden object is lowered to their arms. One by one they grab on and are pulled out, Megan looks up at their savior and sees that the wooded stick was.</span></div></div>",

Due to a cosmic event bringing the universes very close together, random portals have begun opening in different places around the world, sucking people in and dumping them into Equestria at a greatly reduced size. Many denizens of Equestria are surprised by this sudden development but are quick to help/take advantage of the stranded humans. You are a human male who gets pulled into a portal and sent into the home of a pony and has to survive until you can find some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Humans were once bigger like ponies and lived in a separated kingdom next to Equestria, they were essentially the elves and dwarves of the world for their intellect, mastery of magic, and craft-making but one day, a curse befell the entire species turning them about 4 inches high. When Humanity became cursed, a group of humans sought to become scavengers in the giants' societies and return to their small dwellings with the food and supplies. Over the centuries, these scavengers became Borrowers as they began living within the houses of the giants' equines without them noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day, they were discovered. However, because of Pony society being new and pretty welcoming to foreigners, they understood their plight and allowed them to live beside them. Living in harmony in a symbiotic relationship over the passing centuries, the Borrowers work on jobs and complete tasks usually not possible for ponies but possible for their small and practical size in exchange for living space, supplies, and food although some still do live on those unaware that belief doesn't have any Borrower in their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. One day, hundred of giant portals opened simultaneously and hordes of ponies began pouring out, seeking to abduct as many noncombative human men and children as possible and take them back to their home plane. This is at the forefront of a <i>massive</i> invasion with the goal of correcting a perceived egregious error in the treatment of men by human women (which is not completely unwarranted), to \"rebalance the scales\", so to speak. Even though the society would be ostensibly run by mares it would not at all lessen the status of human men, nor would they be reduced to slavery. In fact, I think it likely they will be coddled and pampered by their new governors. The transition will be quick and quiet, with many waking up in the morning to find that the world they thought they knew had suddenly and irrevocably changed. Some may not even realize it even then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen will be allowed the same rights as men so long as they abide by the new rules, and the ideology of \"Feminism\" while being on the surface similar to their own is completely incompatible with Equestrian sensibilities and will be quickly stamped out, and any of them who try to resist or make trouble will find themselves entrapped in a fate... most unpleasant.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes the 100-foot tall monster kicked a building over but Duck Kong preferred using his fists to punch giant holes in buildings.  Some buildings collapsed on the spot when punched by Duck Kong while others still stood. <br>\r\n           Duck Kong walked passed a freeway that was filled with traffic.  Pausing in his rampage the giant looked down at the freeway and smashed a section of the freeway.  Then the monster leaned forward and placed his open mouth at the end of the freeway making a tunnel that led directly to his stomach.  The cars and trucks on the freeway were going too fast to stop in time to prevent themselves from being eaten.  Nearly three dozen cars and trucks ended up as snacks for the giant Duck Kong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Duck Kong decided to move on when there were no more cars and trucks for him to eat.  That was the beginning of the great feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Duck Kong walked for several blocks until he spotted an all-night grocery store.  Smiling down at the crowded store, Duck Kong got down on his hands and knees and simply shoved his entire head in the store which was a superstore.     Duck Kong opened his mouth and inhaled.  Entire aisles of food and shoppers went into the monster's hungry maw.   Shoppers tried to save themselves but in vain.   Everything and everyone in the store ended up going down the throat of the hungry monster.   Duck Kong swallowed whole mouthfulls of people and food.  <br>\r\n             The entire store was empty in a matter of minutes.  Nothing was left in the store, absolutely nothing at all.   <br>\r\n              Duck Kong pulled his head from the store.  The monster then belched rather loudly.   The monster stood at his full height and moved on.<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n         Duck Kong then picked up a bus.  The monster lifted the bus high in the air and examined the people within it.<br>\r\n        \"Next stop: My stomach\" said Duck Kong.  \"Enjoy the ride\"<br>\r\n        Duck Kong swallowed the bus in one gulp.  After that Duck Kong decided to eat all the people he saw running down the street trying to escape from the rampage. </span></div></div>",

It was the kind of place that should be shut down for hundreds of laws it\u2019s broken from tax fraud to animal-related terrorism. It was the kind of place where bad parents that don\u2019t know how to tie their own shoes send their kids. It was the kind of place where the inclusion of a masked serial killer would more likely improve the atmosphere of the camp. It was Camp Campbell and if you\u2019re there, we\u2019re sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright campers, everyone back from their super fun nature walk!\u201d The one asking the question was David the Camp Campbell counselor who always tried to make camp fun and safe for everyone. He often failed. Behind him, trying to sleep against a tree was Gwen, another camp counselor who always tried not to be completely depressed about her crappy job. She often failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, is everyone here. Nurf, Preston, Nerris, Dolph, Neil, Maaaa\u2026MAX!\u201d David\u2019s rollcall was stopped as he screamed out the name of the resident troublemaker, a small, tanned young man with black hair and an even blacker soul. The reason for David\u2019s alarm had to do with a big, squirming gut on the young boy\u2019s body that was most likely another camper. Max had devoured someone alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you know what I said about eating campers, it is strictly forbidden for any camper to devour another camper in any way shape or form,\u201d David calmly explained like this was a conversation he had with Max a hundred times before, probably because he had done this conversation before seemingly a hundred times. There were certain people in the world that could eat other people, they could do it safely or they could make it fatally with the person being digested alive. One of the only, ONLY! Good things anyone could say about Camp Campbell was that they made it very hard for the campers to get eaten and digested. It helped that only three people could eat people whole and that was Max, Gwen, and David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit. I thought you would be too stupid to notice my stomach,\u201d Max grumbled, pissed at getting caught once again. He liked to eat people and thought a lot of the campers looked tasty. He wasn\u2019t going to digest them, not all of them at all. He thought it was just so unfair, the one thing he wanted to do at the stupid camp and his most hated enemy, and David was his fucking enemy, was the one thing he couldn\u2019t do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I did notice. Now spit out whoever it is you ate,\u201d David firmly, but also as kindly as he could, said as he patted Max hard on the back. Max tried to avoid regurgitating his meal, but David knew the exact spot to hit to get him to hurl. His mouth widened as a wet, naked form spilled forth from his insides and splattered on the ground. A disorientated but giddy Nikki stood up instantly, uncaring that she had been eaten or that she was buck naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki, go grab some clothes,\u201d David said as the girl laughed and ran off, leaving the counselor to deal with the troublesome pred. David looked like he had a lecture ready, but instead, he just sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cMax, why do you have to try and eat everyone. It\u2019s dangerous and not very friendly. Vore should be a gentle, private thing that is shared willingly and only done when you're fully mature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck your PC bullshit, David. I can eat people, you can eat people, even Gwen can eat people so why don\u2019t we just do it. Vore isn\u2019t some touchy-feely crap, its power, its sex, it\u2019s awesome.\u201d Max shot back, not willing to take this. He wasn\u2019t some weak little boy afraid to be eaten, he ate people and if he was able to he\u2019d eat David and that would show him who was at the top of the food chain. Too bad he was just too God Damn Lanky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your opinion but I\u2019m still going to have to punish you. You eat someone so you get eaten for an hour. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be nice and safe,\u201d David assured the rather rude, violent, and very troubled boy as he patted him on the head. Max snarled at the counselor, not happy to be the one being devoured instead of devouring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat a dick, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically he is about to,\u201d Neil pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, a good one,\u201d Gwen said as she seemed to finally be paying full attention again. Honestly, she was all for letting the kids eat each other and maybe eating a few herself. It was like the one benefit of being a camp counselor, getting your pick of the tasty campers. The rules said otherwise, and Gwen was worried she might lose her job if she was caught with a kid in her stomach. Luckily, there was no rule about going out of camp occasionally and finding someone tasty to gobble up. It did mean leaving David to handle this Hellhole alone, but Gwen tried to make it up to him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, let\u2019s not make this even worse than it has to be. Max, I\u2019m going to eat you now,\u201d David said, reluctant to devour the young boy but needing to. He always felt so uncomfortable eating Max, he knew deep down Max was sensitive and needed his support, but this was the only way he would learn. Well, maybe there was another way. \u201cOr I could sing you a song I\u2019ve been working on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo song. I\u2019d rather be eaten than have to listen to another fucking camp song,\u201d Max quickly said before David could pull out his guitar. David seemed disappointed and was about to argue about the healing benefits of music when Max jumped up and dove into his mouth. Shoving his arms, head, and shoulders in to shut the counselor up. David stumbled back as he had Max sticking out of his mouth, the boy\u2019s tiny legs kicking in the air. Grabbing his sides, David took a deep breath through his nose and started swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax cringed as he felt the mouth around him surge back as he was swallowed, he hated this so fucking much. It was so tight and slimy, pressing in on his puny body in ways he really didn\u2019t like. The undulating surroundings would gently massage him down, caressing every inch of him. It felt nice which was exactly the reason he hated it so much. There was no way he\u2019d ever enjoy being eaten by David, not that guy. Max grit his teeth as he felt himself getting taken in, David as always being careful as he lightly sucked on him and rolled his body around to get him nice and wet. It would have been better for both of them if Max was naked, but the boy refused to make anything easier for David ever. He felt the young man gripping his legs firmly as he tilted his head back, taking in more of him with a solid gulp. David was a good predator, with strong throat muscles, and a lot of give in his flesh, but he was still a pussy and that just pissed off Max even more. Max\u2019s crotch entered the mouth, covered up but still feeling the heat and wetness of the maw. The kid bit his lip to keep from getting aroused, hist stubbornness to remain hostile so strong. He\u2019d get through this as miserably as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating Max was easy for David, so easy he could have taken the boy down nearly instantly. However, it was important he takes his time and let Max get used to this so he wasn\u2019t scared. He once told Gwen this and she rolled her eyes and called him a moron, the sunny young man thought that was very rude. David was nearly done with Max, only his little legs were legs to swallow and he could feel him inches from slipping into his stomach. While this was about teaching Max a lesson, there was no doubt that there was something very addictive about the way he tasted. David wanted more, but he would control himself, he was a role model though. He hoped one day Max saw this as what it was, an attempt to help him overcome his bad behavior and be happy like him. With a final swallow, a large bulge traveled down David\u2019s throat as he took in the last of Max. His gut expanded, slightly pushing up his shirt as the big, angry meal landed inside. David knew Max was fully settled when he felt him try to punch the stomach wall towards his heart with his tiny fist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, everyone, back to camp,\u201d David said, smiling brightly as his big, round stomach wobbled. Inside him, Max seethed and plotted. He was going to get David one of these days and then they\u2019d see who was inside whom. He\u2019d make the evil bastard pay for trying to make him act like a decent person.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was dinner time, so everyone had gathered in the mess hall for the miserable excuse for dinner. The counselors ate separately from the campers, so as not to upset anyone, but Max had no such consideration as he shoveled down the small mountain of food. It was still the same crap everyone else got, but just in greater quantities befitting a predator. The campers were used to that, however. Yet all still gave him more space than usual, even the two people he hated the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you not smell that?\u201d griped Neil, his voice even more nasally than usual as he pinched his nostrils and fanned his hand. \u201cSmells like the south end of a northbound cow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki, finally dressed, took several tentative sniffs. \u201cHey, it does!\u201d she cheered. Now that things had been recontextualized for her, she scooted closer to Max, who just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cuz I literally came out of David\u2019s ASS!\u201d he growled. \u201cStupid jerk ate me, shit me out, and told me to go clean myself off in the lake. Bastard even gave me a bar of soap that not only disintegrated the moment it touched the water, but it turned my clothes tie-dye. How the fuck does that work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few reasons,\u201d Neil replied. \u201cMost I\u2019m pretty sure are illegal in this state. Still, at least you\u2019ve got your spares.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and now they\u2019re gonna smell like shit until this stupid camp can get a decent bar of soap.\u201d Miserably Max rested his cheek in his palm while his other hand popped what might have been a sausage in his mouth, though it tasted unsettlingly like broccoli. \u201cI hate this stupid camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa knowww,\u201d Nikki began as her head whimsically swayed. \u201cSmelly clothes wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal if this were a proper nature camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d Neil asked, wary of any ideas that came from the hyper girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nature sounds like naturalist, which is another word for nudist. If we went around naked all the time, we could just burn our clothes and frolic freely through the woods, just like mother Gaia intended.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHippy garbage aside, that\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Max allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d whined Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously. The temperature\u2019s pretty mild morning, noon, and night, we\u2019d only need rain coats for rain, nudity is pretty liberating, and it saves me the trouble of stripping you people down before I eat you. So far I\u2019m not seeing a downside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d questioned Neil authoritatively. \u201cDid you forget about David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax blinked. \u201cI did, actually. Dammit. It was nice picturing a world without him around to always mess with my fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon my intrusion,\u201d boomed the deep voice of Quarter Master; real name, age, and possibly species all unknown. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help but overhear your proposal for camp-wide nudity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? What of it?\u201d Max asked defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo carry out such a policy change, you\u2019ll need signatures from all the campers\u2019 parents, plus Cameron Campbell and at least two other camp staff.\u201d QM produced an official looking petition to make the camp clothing optional, already complete with his and Cameron\u2019s signatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, why do you have this?\u201d Neil asked, backing away from the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQM blinked and snorted. \u201cTo make this a reality, I suggest you work on your sales pitch for your fellow campers. Either that, or find someone who can forge some signatures.\u201d He then set the petition down on the table and walked off without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax picked up the paper and read through the lines of big but manageable words. His face lit up with the almost alien expression of enthusiasm. \u201cAlright! Finally something to make camp tolerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still not sure,\u201d Neil said. \u201cI mean, this is Quarter Master we\u2019re talking about. Even his signature is sketchy.\u201d He pointed to the scratch marks on the page that looked like they\u2019d been drawn with the man\u2019s hook hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a wet blanket, Neil,\u201d urged Nikki. \u201cBesides, its clothing <i>optional</i>. If you\u2019re too chicken to show us you\u2019re naked butt, then go right ahead and hide in the prison of clothing. As for me, I look forward to embracing the call of the wild!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax set a hand on Nikki\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHold your horses there, girl. It says here we need signatures from <i>all</i> the parents. Hmm. How do we make this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil hummed thoughtfully. \u201cWell, so long as this is only optional nudity, we could try breaking into the counselor\u2019s cabin and finding our application forms. Those have our parent\u2019s signatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking, Neil.\u201d Max really must\u2019ve been optimistic about this plan. He almost never complimented anyone. \u201cSo, who here\u2019s got the least shitty handwriting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki raised her hand. \u201cOh-oh. How about Dolf? He\u2019s an artist. That\u2019s basically the same thing, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, yeah,\u201d agreed Max, his grin growing, only to shrink again. \u201cBut even if we tricked him, we run the risk of the others complaining and getting things changed back to normal. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Quarter Master\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got to convince everyone that this is for the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil rolled his eyes. \u201cBest for you two, maybe, but how are you going to convince everyone else. Space Kid never takes his suit off, and just about everyone else has some kind of weird attachment to some specific article of clothing, like Magic Kid\u2019s hat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax stroked his chin. \u201cSpace Kid we could probably convince that it\u2019s just a new level of training, and Magic Kid <i>only</i> needs his hat and wand. We could say it\u2019ll improve the trick if he literally has no sleeves to hide things in. Oh yeah! This is gonna happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEred\u2019s so cool, she\u2019d look cool in anything, even her birthday suit,\u201d swooned Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax nodded. \u201cGood angle. So we\u2019ve got the parent signatures, we\u2019re working on the campers\u2019 compliance, so all we need is one other camp worker to make things happen.\u201d Max\u2019s smile finally fizzled. \u201cDavid\u2019s a bust. I can already hear his stupid lecture about comfort and maturity and bleh. Makes me sick just thinking about it, so I\u2019m not even gonna bother. So how are we gonna sell this to Gwen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a pred, just like you,\u201d Nikki reminded. \u201cMaybe you can tell her that it\u2019ll be like having her food already unwrapped? That sounds like something a pred would like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt definitely is,\u201d Max agreed, his good mood returning. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got some base pitches going. Let\u2019s work on them tonight, see what we come up with in the morning, and put our plan into motion to make Camp Campbell tolerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just gonna say better, but that works too,\u201d agreed the ever chipper Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil shrugged. \u201cEh. We were due for another adventure anyway. This actually seems like it\u2019s on the tamer side of things, so why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do our rambunctious campers go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone is skulking around the camp at night.<br>\r\nSomeone is skulking around the camp at night\u2026 who doesn\u2019t belong.<br>\r\nSkip to the morning and try to sell their plan to the campers.<br>\r\nSkip to the morning and try to sell their plan to Gwen.</span></div></div>",

How can you stand it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Gwen, as I just told Max, vore is-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen held up a hand to stop David\u2019s lecture. \u201cCaring, cuddly, and blah-blah-blah, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be gross and uncomfortable. For god\u2019s sakes, David. The shoes!\u201d She pinched the bridge of her nose and took a calming breath. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing this as punishment, don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be more <i>punishing</i> if he were naked? Sure, slobber covered clothes is icky, but we both know that it\u2019s just as bad for the eater.\u201d She paused and added, \u201cYou do know that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid huffed his exasperation. \u201cWell of course I do, but I\u2019m not just punishing Max. I\u2019m trying to teach him to be a responsible pred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen demand he follow basic predator etiquette and get naked before he goes in. Otherwise, if enforcing the rules is just as unpleasant for you as it is him, he\u2019ll keep breaking the rules just to spite you,\u201d Gwen argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d said Max, his irritable voice muffled through the walls of David\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen motioned insistently between David and his gut, silently demanding that he see reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Gwen. What have we said about using our words?\u201d David spoke as if to a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrr!\u201d Gwen stomped her foot and marched off, only able to take so much of David\u2019s Davidness in one sitting. She moved out of earshot, muttering about the miserable life choices that led her to this miserable camp, before finding a nice tree to sit under and pull out her journal. Writing erotic fanfiction always helped to calm her nerves, though what she\u2019d really like right now was a nice, full belly. Speak of the devil, she heard tiny footsteps approaching and looked up. \u201cOh, hey Nikki,\u201d she said disinterestedly. \u201cUh, why are you still naked? David told you to get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scrawny preteen girl was briefly distracted as the wind rustled the trees and tugged at her long blue hair. Her skin was dry, so at least she\u2019d cleaned off Max\u2019s slobber. \u201cAhh, feel that breeze. The sounds and smells of nature all around us. Nothing like what\u2019s in the city. That\u2019s why I love this camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes one of us,\u201d Gwen grumbled. \u201cBut David still told you to get dressed. You don\u2019t want to trigger another of his lectures, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh. I\u2019ve learned to tune him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, two things. He said to grab some clothes, which I did, before dropping them. Also-also, he\u2019s dealing with Max right now, meaning he won\u2019t have time for me for at least a few hours,\u201d Nikki reasoned, showing a dangerous level of cunning for such a chaotic child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded, almost went back to her writing, only to take another look at the girl. She was scrawny, but pretty leanly built for her age, probably a result of her running around so much. Good. Gwen had a preference for the better built people. Wait, no. The rules of the camp forbade counselors from eating the campers without reason\u2026 Then again, David <i>was</i> preoccupied at the moment. Still, Gwen needed to be sure. \u201cSay, why\u2019d Max eat you, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was the game we were playing. Survival of the fittest. Whoever could eat the other first, wins. Max won, as always.\u201d Nikki rolled her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a good feeling about next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sadistic, grinchly grin grew across Gwen\u2019s face. On any other day she\u2019d chide the girl for her gullibility. But right now\u2026 \u201cSay, how about we play? You know, so you can practice for next time with Max.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki\u2019s face lit up and she threw herself on Gwen with a hug. \u201cThat\u2019d be great. Thanks Gwen. You\u2019re the big sister my mom always wished she had to look out for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. That\u2019s really sweet, I think,\u201d Gwen said as she patted the girl\u2019s bare back. Her hand rubbed up and down until it descended to her pert little bottom and gave it a playful squeeze. Nikki just laughed, viewing it as just part of the game. Gwen might have actually felt bad about taking advantage of her, if she weren\u2019t currently spilling drool from her lips. \u201cAlright, so let\u2019s go in turns. You can try eating me for starters, and then I\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d she said while offering her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pumped her fist. \u201cYes! Oh-ho, get ready, Gwen. You\u2019re about to take a one way trip to belly town.\u201d Grabbing the teen\u2019s hand, Nikki licked her lips and shoved the fingers into her mouth like it was a cheeseburger. She gagged almost instantly, but fought to press on. Alas, since she wasn\u2019t a predator, her mouth just wasn\u2019t built for big meals. Her bones lacked the flexibility and her muscles lacked the elasticity. Even so, her effort was commendable, if a bit na\u00efve. Finally she gave up and yanked the hand from her lips. \u201cDid I do good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely room for improvement,\u201d Gwen offered as she set her hands on the child\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLet me show you how a pro does it.\u201d Licking her lips, Gwen opened wide and wrapped her mouth around the girl\u2019s face. Nikki laughed as her face was licked, wiggling a little from the tickling sensation. Gwen hummed her delight from the flavor. The aftertaste of Max\u2019s stomach juices was tolerably faint, but more pleasing was the sweetness of flowers that the girl had no doubt been frolicking through. Nikki always had surprises like that whenever Gwen ate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pred opened wider to pull more of her prey\u2019s head in. She got another nice surprise when she felt Nikki\u2019s hands push their way inside. Gwen smiled gratefully around her mouthful as she made her first swallow. It was always best when prey was willing. She pulled Nikki\u2019s shoulders past her lips as the girl\u2019s head entered her throat. Her tongue never ceased its exploratory assault in tasting every square inch of her eager meal. Another swallow brought the girl\u2019s torso into her consumer\u2019s maw. Gwen\u2019s moans grew in volume as she tasted the prepubescent girl\u2019s undeveloped chest nubs, which just made her kick all the more frantically from the stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome might have called this child molestation; probably because that\u2019s what it was. However, predators were held to a different set of standards to regular people, aka prey.  Socially speaking, what Gwen was doing was no worse than leaving a subpar tip to her waiter. Arguably douchey and generally frowned upon, but nothing actually bad. That was Gwen\u2019s mentality as she took several more swallows and reached Nikki\u2019s pelvis. Her tongue almost reflexively went to the little girl\u2019s little slit. That really got her wiggles going as her laughter turned into moans. She was likely too young to fully grasp the signals her body was sending her, but the flavor of underage pussy was too much for Gwen to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counselor plunged deeply to sample as much of the minor\u2019s vaginal fluids as possible. Nikki\u2019s incoherent cries reverberated through her throat, but Gwen just took that as incentive to go on. Nikki might have been gullible, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew what she was getting into when she agreed to an eating game with Gwen. After growing complacent with pussy juice, Gwen extended her tongue to the bitter but still pleasurable girl butt. Nikki thrashed all the harder, which only built her consumer\u2019s arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking to make sure the coast was clear, Gwen slipped both hands into the front of her shorts. One hand rubbed her clit between her fingers while the other penetrated her pussy. Closing her eyes, she imagined herself being forced upon by some tentacle beast trying to impregnate her. Said beast just so happened to have a tentacle that resembled a little girl with a functioning pussy and ass. The beast gurgled its strange fishy language, but Gwen was able to make out words like \u2018mine\u2019, \u2018egg slut\u2019, and \u2018forever\u2019. As the fire within her loins roared, she threw her head back and attempted to cry out. In so doing, she accidently gave a hearty swallow and pulled her meal\u2019s pelvis into her throat. Nikki\u2019s kicking petered out after that, likely due to exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen maintained the mental image of tentacle rape as she took only lighter swallows and masturbated more furiously. When only Nikki\u2019s feet were left outside, Gwen clamped her hand over her mouth to muffle her orgasmic screams. Her reward was the varied flavor of everywhere Nikki had been walking in the last few minutes, which the counselor relished to prolong her bliss. Feeling that things had run their course, Gwen took one final swallow and pulled the girl into her stomach. She rested back against the tree and her hand moved of its own accord to stroke her pregnant looking belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun, kiddo?\u201d Gwen asked contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it. You might\u2019ve gotten me this time, Gwen, but don\u2019t let your guard down. Someday\u2026 Someday Nikki\u2019s gonna be at the top of the food chain!\u201d avowed the wannabe pred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed and rubbed her belly adoringly. \u201cHehe. Sure thing, kid.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Like all mining towns it died when the silver mines went dry.  The Great Depression effectively killed it and the population had been dwindling ever since.   New Hampton had a population of around 40,000 in its hayday.  These days the population hovered around 2,000.   There were a lot of abandoned buildings and condemned mining buildings and shafts.  <br>\r\n              New Hampton was haunted by a ghost known as the Mining Phantom that haunted a particular mine that was close to the old chemical plant that had been abandoned some 50 years prior due to mysterious circumstances.  There were rumors about the reason why the chemical plant was closed but nobody knew the real reason.  <br>\r\n              <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A green van with the words \"Mystery Machine\" written on it was parked in the otherwise empty parking lot.  There was no movement save for the trees that was waving in the breeze.  It had been a high wind day where the wind decided to remain blowing at 20 mph with gusts sometimes exceeding 40 mph.  Now that it was night the wind had died down considerably.  <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n      The two occupants of the van was a tall teenager by the name of Shaggy and a great dane known as Scooby Doo. The two had refused to enter the chemical plant while the others had went inside to search for the supposed phantom.  The gang had only seen a brief glimpse of the Mining Phantom earlier in the day.  The phantom was an old man with a long beard wrapped up in chains, armed with a wicked-looking pickaxe.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n       Shaggy sat in the front seat at the driving wheel while Scooby was seated next to him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"See anything, Scoob?\" asked Shaggy as he ate at a bag of Scooby Snacks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The great dane was looking directly at the entrance to the plant perhaps 40 feet away.   The entrance was lighted by a bare light bulb that was directly above the entrance.  Apparently the abandoned plant still had electrical power.   The plant was dark for the most part.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Uhh uhh\" grunted Scooby Doo shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's been over a hour\" said Shaggy, glancing at his watch.  \"Think the others are okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Before Scooby could respond the Mining Phantom came into view.  The Phantom was heading straight towards the entrance to the plant.  Both Shaggy and Scooby ducked low trying not to be seen.  Several moments went by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Shaggy peeked over the dashboard to see the great double doors that served as the entrance to the plant were wide open.  <br>\r\n       Shaggy peered around the parking lot without leaving the van.  There was no sign of the Mining Phantom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Like, I thought the Phantom was here already\" said Shaggy.   \"Unless....the Phantom has a brother\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Ragggy, look!\" said Scoob pointing at a broken window at the far end of the plant.  Shaggy had to squint his eyes to see that Velma was signaling for the pair to come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well, here we go, Scoob\" said Shaggy opening the door of the van.  He walked to the passenger door and opened it.  Scooby-Doo hesitated and then climbed out of the van.  Scooby was clearly shaking in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Calm down will ya, Scoob?\" asked Shaggy.  The pair started to walk towards the entrance to the plant.   \"I know you're scared and so am I but you know the routine\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Scooby glanced up at Shaggy and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The two entered the chemical plant.            </span></div></div>",

As Ookami is a wolf demon that resembles a wearwolf, but with magical powers.<br>\r\nOkami is a strang jungle, but certainly no paradise. There are a few vilages here and there, but nothing to amazing, unless you count the mysterious walled city. The people of the towns are a mix of races including humans and an assortment of humanoid furrys. Wolf's shape may not stand out, but his powers may earn him quite a bit of attention. Only time will tell if that is a good thing or a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about this?</span></div></div>",

As I've conceived them, they're a minority population with the ability to consume people in any way they like. Digestion is option, so they can just hold those they eat for a while and let them pass through to the end, or add their prey's nutrients to their growing bodies. Predators, or preds for short, have full legal immunity to eat whoever they want, and get away with quite a bit more if the writer so chooses.
