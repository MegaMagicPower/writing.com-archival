Some would call Zootopia a paradise, others would say that it is a way of life, others still would say that Zootopia is just a dream, that no matter how hard you try, Zootopia is far from a paradise. However our story has not properly begun, it cannot be told without a main character, this is where you come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will decide who you are, what you are, what you will do, where you will go, the power rests on your shoulders. The only question remains; Who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>**IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ**</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you are five choices of great power, they will shape the way that you read the story and enjoy the numerous scenarios within.<br>\r\nYou can choose to shape your character, Max, in any way you desire. For the Character Creation element of the story to work, I have a few ground rules that I encourage all who contribute to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1.</b> When choosing Max's characterization, please label your chapter \"Character Creation\" Followed by a title<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2.</b> I am not crazy about \"Choice Chapters\" in any interactive, they seldom contribute to the story and they artificially inflate the chapter count of the story. However, this is a story in which choices will shape who and what Max is and where they will go so \"Choice Chapters\" are inevitable. I ask that choice chapters are used to continue the story. I ask that you provide at least two well written sentences, relevant to the story, either as the storyteller or the character are provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this proves too daunting, please contact me and I will work with you and further explain what I want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy and Welcome to Zootopia Adventures!</span></div></div>",
