If she avoided using the wrong kind of wording, then Blaze wouldn't know the difference between actually being in control or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bars soon completely melted as alarms went off.

Passing off the wetness as the cave dripping, Rouge batted at it lightly, only to separate the entity more.  She stared at the piece of goo in her hand as the piece of it left on her head dove down her ear as she shuddered, gasping as she backed against the wall.  The piece of it in her hand took the opportunity to dive down her throat as the two worked in conjunction to claim this new body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge slumped to the floor, twitching and groaning as Amy walked over to her, grinning as the entity controlling her became aware of both minds, though Rouge was much stronger than Amy.  She still struggled against it even as she bolted awake...  Then everything became crystal clear...  Rouge was purposefully leading her the wrong way through the caverns, she had suspected something wrong with Amy, though she did not know what...  She planned on leaving her stranded...  The new Rouge glared at that as she got up, still squirming as the real Rouge was fighting, trying to worm her way into its mind...</span></div></div>",

She was right, something had been off with her as Amy stood there, slumped lightly...  Was she waiting for her to make her do something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up slowly, rubbing her head as she felt the entity twitch within her, though she felt it from both ends...  That bastard had tried to take her body away from her...  She smirked lightly as she motioned Amy to come towards her.  She began practicing controlling two bodies at once, discovering Amy's mind underneath its ooze...  Well, why should she let Amy go?  She was just an annoying nuisance, but now she could serve a much more useful purpose.  She snapped her fingers as Amy's body began to melt as she let the entity within her consume her body...  She'd leave herself solid, for now, until such a time as she was sure that she'd remain in control.  The mass of Amy's body slid over towards her as she willed it to coat her...  And then it turned solid once more as she looked herself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this will be fun...\"  She said, at first with her voice, though it gradually changed to Amy's as she allowed Amy's ooze to slide down her throat a bit.  She soon made her way to the exit.</span></div></div>",

Why she was here was of no concern of yours, all you wanted to do was get the hell out of here and fast. It seems after looking in her memories that she was lost herself and that she was following a friend when she suddenly got lost. The 'friend' was a pink looking creature with a rose red dress and had a desire to become partners with a creature with spikes on his head and had supersonic speed. It also seems that this body was fairly attractive as your memories show suburban males whistling at her while she jogged while they also observed these jello like pieces of flesh that stood on your new solid form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't care to process all the other information as you soon won't be needing this inferior body that you possessed. Epically the large mounds that sits on \"Rouge's\" chest, those are truly bothersome to navigate with. However soon you began hearing rather abnormal  voices as someone with a really annoying  voice begins to shout some one's name across the quiet dark cave. \"Oh where could she be? Oh man, if only I didn't run looking for Sonic here. But of course I couldn't since he's dreamy\" The creature soon begins to hold both of her hands together and day dream as she continued walking. She then spots you and rushes to you, \"Oh my goodness, where have you been Rouge?! I've been looking everywhere for you!\" She soon burst into tears as you try  your hardest to show emotion of course you felt none as this creature is nothing but a pathetic weakling however, you could use her and add her to your collection.

A crude nickname given to the one who held it captive...  Once it had more bodies, perhaps it would return to seek its revenge...  Amy cocked and eyebrow inquisitively.  \"Since when are you scared of a tussle with Eggman's bots?\"  'Rouge' just shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why start a fight unnecessarily?  Besides, I think that if Sonic were here, we'd see lots more wreckage.  Let's just head back towards the city.\"  She continued to try to prod the pink hedgehog back...  She was nothing if not persistent, however...  Annoyingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wanna prove to him that I can handle things...  Besides, if I get caught, then I can get rescued by him.\"  She grinned, daydreaming again as she smiled.  It growled in Rouge's mind...
