As two scheming men were in a jalopy peering upon the farm with somewhat evil intentions, not even noticing the still car just pranced around happy as can be to actually have some alone time without her brothers or sisters budding in. relaxing upon a oak tree, soaking up the serenity that was upon her, mean while Horace and japer were sulking around the farm looking for the Dalmatians for their boss, miss cuella de vil. While they were searching around for the dogs jasper spotted cadpig at the big oak tree sleeping all alone, \"well this isn't our lucky day is it Horace?\" as Horace responded back to his cohort stating  \"no, it is not all we found on this lousy farm is this wee one, the misses isn't going to be please with us, not one bit\", while thinking of what to do a cow mad a noise startling the two bumbling henchmen so with a quick reaction the two just grabbed cadpig and ran out of the farm and back into their car, starting to drive off. Once at the cruella manor Horace and Jasper begun to empty out the burlap sack in front of their boss revealing the runt of the littler cadpig, with a sign of anger the mistress de vil begun yelling at the two henchmen 'this is all you have for me one measly puppy I need all of them to make even one dress'stated cruella while she smacked her henchmen. While the beatings continued for their incompetence, cruella had an evil plan cooking in her mind, as she went over every inch of the puppy with her eyes like they were a fine tooth comb, a plan begun formulating in her mind as she lifted up cadpig cruella started to yell at her lackeys, 'Horace, jasper go to the pet store and but plenty of dog food' with a smile on her face Horace and jasper started looking at cruella with a puzzling face, 'uhh miss I'm not one to question but why do we need dog food?' with an angered voice their boss responded 'cause you bumbling twits, this runt isn't going be so small any more' with a chuckle from cruella the two henchmen were more puzzled than before as they left for the pet store</span></div></div>",

Faline was just a young fawn who didn't know much about the world around her, giggling at everything. The king of the forest begun his daily work of protection for the forest, with the queen of the forest deceased from hunters that had trespassed into the forest, nothing was to stop the king from protecting his domain, it was his only focus. Peeking at the king she had noticed a new young buck that seemed afraid of his surroundings, \"this is your domain Bambi every little creature from the smallest field mouse to the largest bear are under your protection, we conduct your teachings of this land later, for now meet your people\" he stated to his son, noticing the doe hiding in the bushes behind a mighty oak tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBambi didn't know what to expect from the new area that was his father's domain it was all new to him, he had his two friends with him which made the transition to this new environment more bearable. Thumper and Flower have been through it all with the prince of the forest, from him dealing with his mother's passing to his father taking him to the strange new place. Faline didn't know how to approach this new playmate any other way than to be her rambunctious giggling self, she didn't have many playmates other than her twin brother since not many fawns were around her age to play with. Seeing that the young buck was alone she saw this as her chance to meet him, chasing him through the trees like a bat out of hell, swerving and crossing Faline finally made it to her target who wasn't even expecting a doe like her to be around. Bursting out of the trees and into a clearing Faline frightened Bambi half to death with her antics she started to speak in a coy manner \" what's the matter scaredy cat, can't catch me even if you tried to\" this got right under the skin of Bambi as no young doe was going to out race him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two begun to play in the large forest that they called home, it was fun for Bambi it seemed like all of his worries began to disappear, this little race seemed to be the start of a great friendship. While the two fawns played they never even heard the cracking of a branch off in the distance, the sounds of whatever broke that branch. After a while the two fawns were exhausted from their games, \"what was that noise\" Bambi exclaimed frightened about what it was. Closer and closer the sound came to Bambi and Faline, afraid of what these noises were caused by the two of them fled. Faster and faster they ran trying to get away, Faline got stuck upon a loose root twisted leg and caught between the entanglements of roots. Bambi fled frightened by whatever was creating those horrid sounds, not having the nerve to go back for the doe he coward away looking for his father to protect him. Meanwhile the noise got closer and closer only to reveal a bunch of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crackle of the brush that was around the edge of the dense forest that was behind Faline, not knowing what this sound was the only thing Faline thought to do was to back up but as she noticed quite quickly, this was impossible for her hind leg was still tangled in the rich number of roots that based the bed of the forest. She didn\u2019t know what to do as her only option of escape was exhausted thanks to her leg being completely immobile by the massive trees that surrounded the area where Bambi left her to fend for herself, \u201cso much for the prince of the forest\u201d she scoffed at him, trying to make light of the situation only made Faline realize that it was quite a dire situation that she was in as the sound of whatever was moving into the forest began its descent upon her position with unbiased intent. Scared of what she was going to encounter Faline futilely tried to tug at the roots that bound her to the spot where she awaited the fate that has been given to her. It seem as it humans have entered the forest of the king, three of them looked quite unassuming much less threatening than her mother has described them, Faline just looked at the humans they held a metallic looking object in each of their hands this object peaked Faline's interest she made sure to be hidden from the humans as they prowled deeper into the forest to fortunes untold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000There were only three humans that Faline could see all dress in the same garb which consisted orange vests covering flannel shirts and brow pants that helped them blend into the surrounding area. Curious with these humans Faline didn't even notice there was someone creeping upon her hidden position, the clicking of a gun was heard behind Faline, fearing for whom ever was behind her Faline begun to worry whom was behind her. Sharply Faline turned around just fast enough to see a glimmer of whom was behind her, seeing golden locks swaying in the wind as Faline begun studying the beautiful face of what seemed to be a woman, looking like she didn\u2019t belong with the three other more gruff older looking men that accompanied the young woman. Faline couldn\u2019t even flee from her hiding spot as the woman bashed the poor fawn across the skull knocking her out for a time, dragging her new found catch the edge of the woods to place upon in the back of her pick-up truck to be mounted. \u201cYou call that a catch it\u2019s not even a one pointer\u201d one of the men chuckled as they all left the area to return to their own lives. Driving home to a lavished mansion like property the woman whom hasn\u2019t even looked at her catch since they left the home of Faline, changing the station of the radio she couldn\u2019t do anything but scoff at her own inability as a hunter saying quietly to herself \u201cgood one Nadine all you can catch is fawns, looks like impressing the higher ups with my hunting abilities is something that I need to work on\u201d, looking into her rear view mirror, backing up into the drive way of her well-earned home, nothing but trees and forest encompassed her property fences darted around so no critters would wander into her property uninvited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Dragging her newly acquired kill through the garage and into the basement of the house, it was an impressive level all on its own. The garage was split into four large section, which all had memorabilia from her past achievements and adventures over the years. Closer and closer Nadine got to the area where she usually skinned and chopped her various animal kills, not even realizing that Nadine had never finished the job upon Faline and the young doe was merely knocked out from the trauma of being bashed into the skull with the stock of Nadine\u2019s rifle. Groggily Faline begun to wake up from her unconscious state in fear and confusion of where she was. Scared and alone Faline begun to do the only thing she could think out at the time, run away from this place where she found herself in, kicking Nadine\u2019s hands causing her to let go of the young doe\u2019s legs allowing her to run wild. Corner to corner Faline tried to find an escape route for herself as there was no hole or opening that she could squeeze through, even with her small stature she didn\u2019t know how to escape from this woman whom uprooted her from the place she called home. Trying as she might Nadine could see the fawn wouldn\u2019t listen to reasons no matter how much she tried to calm her down, looking upon her prize more closely she could see this doe was quite beautiful in her own right, knowing that she wouldn\u2019t calm down and not seeing any other way to relax the doe Nadine grabbed her trusty tranquilizer gun and took aim. Almost instantaneous the drug concoction that was in the needle that was shot into Faline\u2019s side, out like a light the drugs took hold of Faline and unconscious came to her quickly. No longer wanting to skin this beautiful doe Nadine could only chuckle as a sinister thought popped into her head, laughing more manically she only whispered \u201cone pointer huh?

Not wanting to take any chances with this woman Faline begun to look for a way out of w here ever she was, it seemed to be hopeless as the white sheen of the basement confused and disoriented the young doe\u2019s perception of what was happening all around her, seeing this Nadine begun her plans to capture Faline, making sure to be as less threatening as humanly possible Nadine begun her descent upon the fawn. Slowly she begun to reach out her hand to the fawn trying to familiarize herself to Faline as a friend not foe. Cautious around this woman for not having any interaction with humans made it quite difficult to read, if this woman did have something sinister planned for Faline was none the wiser. Indeed Nadine had something planned for this beautiful doe, the other hunters wanted to make fun of her catch well when they get a load of her prey when she\u2019s done with the necessary preparations the at needed to be made. Nadine couldn\u2019t believe this animal whom she was about to kill was now Nuzzling against the woman\u2019s side, \u201cit must think I\u2019m her mother or something\" Nadine believed as each time she moved away from Faline she only got closer to her, sadden at the state of affairs that was now her destiny, her only friend was this one woman and she seemed to be nice enough and reminded her of her stern yet loving mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even realizing that it has been quite some time since her last meal, a growl from her stomach \u201cmy, my hungry are we?\" Na dine asks charmingly to the young doe, slightly Faline blushed as she was embarrassed with her hunger, it was not quite ladylike of her. Moving her black hair out of her face and tying it in a ponytail, she had a quite athletic body, while her olive skin shined with a healthy glow to it. Faline's instincts were all out of whack when she was near this woman, she didn't know why this woman would want to bring Faline to her house, this confused her to no ends, not even knowing where she was at the moment she thought this woman seemed nice enough to trust. This was going to be a poor judgment of Nadine's character, so many plans for this doe was Running through out Nadine's mind, not knowing how to exactly to go about to fee d this beautiful fawn to make her grow massive. Petting Faline to make her feel welcome to her new surroundings, completely content with where she was feeling as if Nadine was her mother. \"My, my, aren\u2019t you an affectionate little bugger, you could almost make my heart all warm and tingly, but it\u2019s time for dinner my little pet\" grinned Nadine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the intercom that connected the rest of the of her luxurious s mansion Nadine spoke into it calling her faithful servant, \u201cAnnie please prepare a meal for me and my new pet deer.\u201d Annie was fir st taken a back of what she heard, the mistress never was one to s hare a connection with animals, and she was one whom killed animals not befriend them. \u201cThis is quite a change mistress, what shall I make for you and your new pet?\u201d Annie asked calmly and orderly manner, thinking long and hard of what Faline would love to eat that is al so fattening for this little doe to become a big ball of flab. \u201cmy pet project would love to eat some sweets, no matter how much she dislikes it\u201d, grinning like the Cheshire cat she was going to make her new pet the biggest fawn, ever seen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Believing that he had gotten rid of the four cats that were owned by Madam Adelaide, not even realizing there was an error in his judgement as the cats were more than capable of making it back to the house as it wasn\u2019t hard to venture the countryside where they were left off at, especially when they had a tomcat named Thomas O\u2019Malley to help them get back to where they lived thanks to his unconventional reasoning. The thing that Edgar didn\u2019t even notice was that not all the cats wherein the bag when he drove off to the countryside trying to get rid of all the cats, he thought that it would be a fool proof plan just drop them off somewhere and they wouldn\u2019t bother them ever again, not realizing he miscounted in his initial kidnapping attempt. The only one that was still left in the mansion with Edgar and Madam Adelaide was little Marie who was still exploring the giant mansion that she lived in not even crossing her mind that her brothers and mother were nowhere around for her to play with she was just concentrating on exploring the other areas of the mansion that she could never explore before as her mother believed it to be too dangerous for kittens to explore. \u201cAs a lady we must always be quite dignified especially when exploring the home\u201d Marie said to her self being her usual high-class self, looking around she found some stairs that she didn\u2019t know we're here in the mansion she didn\u2019t know what kind of secrets this opened door held it made young Marie want to explore them even more it was exhilarating to her to be on a solo adventure without her unruly brothers to create problems for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to explore the depths of this new area that she had discovered on her travels still blissfully unaware that her mother and brothers were no longer on the property of Madame Adelaide, she was too busy intrigued with this new lower level to really realize that they were going \u201cwhat is down there I wonder\u201d the young kitten thought to herself she just as she began her descent to where ever this place was she wanted to explore it, something new had always made her excited as the dull and drab was always boring for her she wanted to do something at least a little exciting to do in this mansion. Closer and closer she got to the lower level the steps creaked with every step she took this place seemed to be slightly musty in smell but it was spacious in its size there were many bottles of liquids that lined up on the wall Marie wondered what this place was, when she finally saw a familiar face humming to themselves not paying much attention to their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Edgar who opened the door as he believed that with him getting rid of the cats that his fortune was secure from Madam Adelaide, so gleefully he picked up a bottle of vintage wine not even noticing the little white kitten inching closer and closer to him until she was near his leg rubbing against it in a happy manner, feeling this on his leg made him jump with fear as he thought it could have been a rat seeing how dusty this place was. \u201coh no how did you escape?\u201d Edgar wondered as he didn\u2019t know how he missed one of the cats from his plan, this was something that he didn\u2019t know what to do, rushing to the door that leads to the upstairs he locked it so that his Madam wouldn\u2019t see that one of the kittens was still in the mansion, this was something that she didn\u2019t need to know but he knew that he had to do something about this kitten to make it so she couldn\u2019t climb those stairs. Something clicked in Edgar\u2019s mind when he said that, if she was too fat to move she couldn\u2019t even move to climb those stairs, his evil plan was taking shape and he couldn\u2019t be happier, rushing to get all that he would need to make this happen, Marie just looked on in wonder as she just sat there wondering why Edgar was in such a tizzy.</span></div></div>",

Breaking the case of the animals going aggressive was what drove Judy forward. Nick wasn't anywhere near Judy, finding out the truth of what was happening in Zootopia was all that mattered to Judy. All she could do was grab a few samples of the night howler concoction proving to chief Bogo that there was something larger at play, the sheep that were manufacturing the night howler concoction were defiantly not happy with young Judy and her great reasoning skills. Chasing through the abandoned tunnel systems that ran throughout Zootopia, fearing what they would do to her if caught by them. Judy did what all rabbits did well, she ran as fast as she could knowing that what she held in her hand was a very major price to the puzzle that was plaguing her fair city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000\"Give me that you damn bunny\" the muscular sheep yelled at Judy almost trapping her behind a rusted grate that he had flung at her. Outsmarting the bumbling sheep wasn't hard as it seemed these sheep were just brawn with no brains, grinning like a Cheshire Judy knew that if she could just lead these two under the museum of natural history she could meet up with nick and take these two in with little effort. Seeing the maintenance hatch that leads to the museum, Judy knew that her chance to lock these guys up was at hand and she could fully interrogate these bumbling idiots for information that could help crack this case wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Finally, she was inside the museum's interior, from small age she loved coming to this museum as a child, she knew this museum like the back of her hand from coming here so many times as a child. Luring the two into the prehistoric, this is where she thought nick would be hanging out, correct in her assumption as his bushy tail could be seen near the human exhibit. Closer and closer she got to her dear friend nick the more she realized something was wrong with him, unmoving from his position Judy began to shout for him \"Nick I got the evidence, but I'm gonna need help here with these guys\" still Nicks body refused to move. Almost to nick, she pushed herself to see what was wrong with her friend, from the shadows stepping over the lifeless body of Nick the creature came into the light. Holding a shovel in their hands the creature was revealed to be assistant mayor bellwether, knowing she couldn't cover her crime she let her true colors show through. With malice intent bellwether stated with a chuckle as she dropped the shovel \"I guess he won't be bothering us for some time\", shocked at what the little lamb was capable of made Judy back away from bellwether slowly not wanting the assistant mayor to do anything rash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I really liked you Judy and all the gusto you have, but all that has to end for big things are changing in Zootopia, things that I can't allow to be mucked up by you miss Hopps\u201d Bellwether said so coyly, not even noticing the two large sheep creeping up upon the small bunny, not even noticing that the burly sheep brothers were sneaking up on her, suddenly she was caught. Judy, try as she might to escape the clutches of the two henchmen that bellwether had hired for her plans. \u201cmy dear Judy I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t allow you to leave, no, no I have plans for you my dear\u201d chuckled Bellwether as she motioned her henchmen to follow her. Knowing that what the assistant mayor had nothing good planned for her, she knew that she had to escape from the clutches of Bellwether.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nala was at the local watering hole with Simba, as Simba played with a butterfly probably terrorizing the poor thing, Nala was lying down next to the watering hole sleeping.as something seemed to be in the bushes that was just a far ways off from the place that they played so quietly, as Nala and Simba went on with their usual day.Zazu carefully watching the two cubs from afar like the proper babysitter his highness had ask him to play. It was actually a nice to see the peace in the pride rocks it was charming at least there wasn\u2019t any danger, balance and unity flourished across the land, even different types of animals got some what along without much hostility. This was a great site to be seen for its king, Mufasa was happy with his loving family and how the pride lands ran. Meanwhile Simba and Nala just hung out around the watering hole playing, this was a local watering hole many animals frequented this hole so it was always fun to play with other animals that were there, even though some of the animals that frequented it were afraid of Nala and Simba just because of them being lions.this was something that just made Nala upset for she wanted nothing more than new friends but she didn't know how to make some. Simba was a fun friend and she had lots of good times with him but she didn\u2019t want just one friend. While this was stirring inside her brain as she looked into the deep blue water inside the watering whole she didn\u2019t realize all the animal began to scurry away for right behind her was a lone figure was posed behind bushes, not really paying any attention to the fleeing animals. His concentration was on the cub,as he had put a tranquilizer dart in the rifle, pulled it up, sighting his target and shot the dart into the cub's hindquarters. The subject target would be sedated for extraction and transport.He noticed the other lion cub that was playing with her also turned tail and fled from the scene. Less of a bother. He'd have to hurry before any adult lions arrived. He got up and went over to the lion cub subject, wondering for the tenth time why the Madame would want such a useless looking animal in the first place. Perhaps for her own petting zoo, he guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down the pet holding container, he scooped up the lion cub and set her into it, closing the small door on it and <br>\r\nlatching the door closed. Carrying his precious cargo, he puts the pet carrier in the back of his vehicle, starts up the engine and drives off, heading back to deliver the cargo of the lion cub subject to his employer. But as he drove away, there was a lioness that had arrived on the scene. The mother of the lioness cub, Sarafina. So what does a caring mother do? Immediately takes off <br>\r\nand follows the vehicle, but at a safe held back distance. Also as to not get herself tired and exhausted. But even if she <br>\r\nwould get captured, then at least she hopes she'd be with her daughter Nala. She hopes to get to where the human was <br>\r\ntaking Nala by night then get Nala away from the humans and back to the pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the man arrived to the estate of his employer, he stopped the vehicle then turned it off, then went to the back to get <br>\r\nthe pet carrier out and place it on the ground in a shady spot before opening the carrier to let out the lion cub subject. He was <br>\r\nsure that this would be the last time he'd see the lion cub. Done with that, he went to go tell the Madame about her prized <br>\r\nlion cub's arrival and also collect his job payment then got into his vehicle to drive off again, heading back to wherever his own home was here in Africa.Sarafina chased after the car as fast as she could not realizing that she was moving farther and father away from pride rock, she didn't care about this right now her cub was in trouble and she was going to do all she could to get her back. Making sure not to be spotted by the humans that were around the area, she stayed low and inside the tall grass hoping that no one would find her as she came up with a plan of some sort to get her daughter back and be home as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Sarafina looked around she noticed something quite odd about the surrounding area, the plains were lush, trees that she had never seen before were present in this place, this place was nothing she had seen before it was a strange place nonetheless. This giant hut was something that she never seen before, it was huge and white there were men patrolling the area, she didn't know how to get into this place or even where her daughter would be in this giant place. About to make her move she felt a sharp pain in her side like something was in her, feeling woozy she tried to fight it but what ever she was shot with finally won the battle. As Sarafina slept she felt the calming sound of her daughter's voice, waking up in a strange place that was a different jungle entirely, she hugged he daughter and licked her lovingly. A door swung open and two humans walked in, they both seemed quite refined as they gleefully looked at Nala with an evil twinkle in their eyes, these humans seemed to be the mistresses of the house, Sarafina protected Nala with a fearsome roar. A man came behind Sarafina to restrain her as the mistresses picked Nala looking at Sarafina the black haired woman said to the chained mother \"Don't worry my dear she is safe here your cub is our pet project\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarafina begun to tug upon the chain that confined her that was held by a burly looking man, he was easily holding back Sarafina from g getting towards her only daughter it was a quite surprising feat she knew that these two ladies were up to no good she didn\u2019t know what t was going to happen to them but she knew that the two of them h ad to get back to the pride lands it was their home and they will  get back to it no matter what it would take it was just a matter  of time before they did. This man would make it difficult to leave, but it seemed it was an open area with nothing but a fence to confine the two lionesses in this area a waterfall seemed to in the background near a large den area which all seemed to be man made are a, even the grass lands seemed to be man made with the intent to keep the two in this very area, for what reason was unknown to Sarafina but she would protect her daughter as much as she can. Noticing the two women who seemed to be fawning over the little cub the two petted her lovingly as if they were going to take care of the little one with all the power they had, yet there was something quite sinister about the women that Sarafina couldn\u2019t put her her paw on, it was like the same feelings she got when ever scar was upon her her presence. \u201cMy, my aren\u2019t you just the cutest little cub eve r\u201d the woman with the black hair stated while she petted the frightened Nala almost curled up in a ball the young girl didn\u2019t know what to make of these women but she didn\u2019t want to trust these humans fully, it felt good to be petted by the black haired woman, Na la didn\u2019t even notice the Brunette woman grabbing a couple of thing s from the house that was just at the edge of the fenced in area. Purring Nala didn't even realize that one of the women was gone she was enthralled with being petted and pampered, \" my, my aren't you a small little cub, such a thin little girl, don't worry we will fix that\" a devilish grin appeared upon the black lady old face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside the house the brunette woman was searching the mansion for the materials needed to measure and weigh the tiny cub, such a series of strange events had conspired instead of just getting a cub they also got the mother of the young cub, this wasn't apart of the plan but they hope the mother wouldn't be too much of a problem as the begun to use her daughter as another project. As she grabbed a scale from the bathroom the old lady begun to pass various pictures of other animals that had undergone their pet project. All of the animals had two things in common with each other, they were all female and massively overweight. Finding the measuring tape she begun her journey to the outside grasslands to return to the side of the other woman \" sister Giselle, I have retrieved the materials needed to start of the little cub's journey\" Nala wasn't even paying attention to the other one she was just loving the feeling of being petted. Grabbing the scale from her sister Giselle begun to weigh Nala without the knowledge she was even being weighed by one of the master's of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarder and harder was it to control Sarafina as the large man started to lose his grip on the chain that controlled the large lioness mere inches from Nala, Sarafina was doing everything she could to protect Nala and cuddle with her daughter. Regaining control of the chain around the neck of Sarafina, she had to watch as the one called Giselle pinched and prodded her daughter, looking dissatisfied when she didn't find any flub upon Nala's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading Nala upon the scale to weigh the young cub, the scale lightly creaked when it was used by Nala, a measly twenty pounds was upon Nala's body, disgruntled about this Giselle wanted to fatten up Nala as quickly as she could, but she wanted to remember this special occasion, as she did with all the other animals. \"Dear sister Lindsay would you please take a picture of our new pet\" Giselle said to her younger sister as she cuddled the young cub, grinning the two could only imagine the feast young Nala was about to endure...</span></div></div>",

Thanks to the return of the actual king, Simba the suffering that was taking place thanks to Scar. Since that time things were finally beginning to change for the better, having the proper leader in pride rock was one of the key points that made the pride lands flourish in the first place, it has been many years since the battle Simba had with his uncle for Nala and Simba had two children by the time the pride lands begun its return to former glory, yet there were lions who still stuck by the decisions that were made by the previous leader of the pride lands, these lions would now be exiled out of the pride lands and called the outlanders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new day on a new generation Simba\u2019s daughter was as curious as her father was at her age wanting to explore the Pride lands in its entirety, but with an overprotective father like Simba on her tail about every little thing that she did, this was almost impossible to do as even when alone she had two very clumsy caretakers watching her from the shadows, even if those shadows were in places that had lots of grubs to dine on. \u201cHey, Pumbaa, there are some juicy Beetles over there shouldn\u2019t we keep an eye on them?\u201d Timon said to the large warthog whom he was good friends with, some might say that he and this warthog were inseparable as they were always seen grazing the pride lands in search of bugs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUhh, Timon I didn\u2019t want to interrupt you but aren\u2019t we supposed to be taking care of Kiara and not munching on these beetles?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even noticing Kiara and what she was doing as both of her caretakers were more focused with lighthearted bickering than keeping an eye on her, \u201cthis is my chance to catch up to Tiifu and Zuri and see what is going on at the watering hole\u201d Whispering to her self-making sure neither Pumbaa or Timon heard her thoughts or her slinking away from them to join her friends at the watering hole. Pumbaa asked his friend meekly as the other was too enamored with collecting beetles before they flew away to even give his friend prober response only stating to Pumbaa, \u201cRelax Pumbaa she is safe we don\u2019t need to keep an eye on her in the pride lands\u201d how very wrong he was not even he could realize that something was going to happen that would make these few moments with her protectors the happiest she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though it did work to give her overprotective uncles the slip so she could meet her friends at the watering hole Kiara had lost her way and didn\u2019t exactly know where she was, the area where Timon and Pumbaa led Kiara was a trail that she didn\u2019t travel all that much as she never really was away from Pride rock that often. Looking for something that she would recognize maybe something like Bunga\u2019s tree that he and her uncles usually live near, or maybe Rafiki\u2019s home something that would let her know where she was. Nothing jumped out at her that she was going the right way or if she was getting further and further away from her home, coming to an opening from where the brush had ended made it easier at least a little bit for Kiara to figure out where she was going and maybe she would see some other animals that could help her figure out where the cub had ended up. Cautiously Kiara moved through the open area hoping that there weren\u2019t any kind of predators around that would see her as a snack of sorts, there was still hope that she would find someone who could help her is the what she was banking on. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I anyway, daddy is going to be mad at me if I don\u2019t return home quickly and I don\u2019t want Timon and Pumbaa to get yelled at too for my mistake\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKiara thought to herself, brushing off some dirt off of her coat before continuing her travels through the Pridelands making sure that she looked around for someone who could help her in some shape or form. Coming up empty for finding people who knew the area better than Kiara did was quite disappointing, the earth beneath her feet seemed to become more and more cracked and dry, dust continually was pushed up by the winds. Kiara didn\u2019t know that there were areas of the pride lands that looked to be so inhospitable. Deeper into the canyon Kiara looked around hoping to see at least something that of a landmark or something that she could use to figure out where she was, but nothing really stood out to her it all just blended together in a beige blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muttering of voices was coming ahead of Kiara, relief came to mind when Kiara heard these voices hoping whoever it was could help her get back home and away from this desolate area. Being a bit precautions due to her nature Kiara crept up to where those sounds were coming from hoping to see who was making them think it must be a lizard or some kind of desert-dwelling animal, she didn\u2019t know what it was so Kiara thought it would be best to take it slowly hoping it wasn\u2019t a hyena or any of the other vicious clans of animals that made area\u2019s like this their home. Hiding behind a large pile of rocks Kiara poked her head above her hiding spot to see that the animals that were making noise were a bunch of Lionesses, not knowing them or if they even were from the Pridelands Kiara was immediately wary of them and their presence. looking as if two were having some sort of disagreement in where they were going Kiara thought it would be best if she could listen to their conversation, placing one ear close to the ground she began listening in to their conversation as<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of just eating I bugs and other small animals, why don\u2019t we just go into the Pridelands Zira? We could just attack them and be done with them instead of just scrounging around for an ibex or two.\u201d the small lioness grumbled to herself not wanting what seemed to be the leader of the group to hear her complaints about their current situation, being Outlanders didn\u2019t help as much as it did hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause my dear sweet Abena, if we attacked the Pridelands which has more lions and lionesses that we Outlanders do than we would be wiped out, don\u2019t worry your pretty little head, I know thinking isn\u2019t your strong suit\u201d Zira smug in her statement looked proud in the fact that she put the young lioness in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the danger that she was in Kiara thought it would be best to leave the area post-haste before she was found out by the group of lionesses, not looking at what was behind her Kiara accidentally stepped on a dry twig causing an echoing snapping sound to reverberate through the surrounding area. Zira not wanting to be ambushed by anything leaped toward the sound ready to fight whatever it was that was trying to sneak up on the group. A surprise was the first thing that came to mind when Zira found that the one who was trying to sneak around wasn\u2019t an enemy of sorts it was just the royal brat that Simba had birthed. Zira wasn\u2019t pleased to see someone from the Pridelands sneaking up on her group, snarling at Kiara Zira had just thought of how to keep her people well fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201clooks like our little meal ticket had just fallen into our laps, as well as keep Vitani busy with her new fascination\u201d The older lioness chuckled before grabbing Kiara by the nape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease my father would be very disappointed with me if I don\u2019t return home, Zira please let me go\u201d Kiara begged, tears welling up from her eyes knowing how much trouble she was going to be in if she didn\u2019t return soon, these pleas fell on deaf ears none of the lionesses felt guilty thinking how much meat they would get from keeping Kiara hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come to her little princess, if you would have stayed in the Pridelands then none of this would have happened but don\u2019t worry Vitani will keep you company for a while\u201d one of the lioness states in a matter of factually way laughing at what they were doing none were too concerned with the repercussion as the went deeper into the outlands to \u2026\u2026</span></div></div>",

Knowing that they were both the trapped by the criminal genius Ratigan only made them fear about what was going to happen to them, \u201cfather I missed you so much I didn\u2019t know what was to become of you\u201d Olivia stated as tears of joy ran down her face she didn\u2019t know how to express how glad she was that her father was alive and well. Just as their touching reunion began it ended abruptly as Olivia not even noticing the evil Ratigan tore her away from her loving father without a second thought. \u201cRatigan you vile devil, give me back my daughter right now, I\u2019ll do what you\u2019ll say just give me my daughter\u201d Begged Hiram upon deaf ears as his daughter was gone once more thanks to none other than their peg-legged friend a one mister Fidget, with his Cheshire like grin and a nod to his boss He scooped the girl up and took her to another part of the Place Ratigan called home. \u201cNow you see her Mr. Flaversham if that contraption doesn\u2019t work properly then you will never see your dear daughter again for she will be lunch for my dear Felicia\u201d as he raised he bell he used many times to call upon his pet to get rid of his enemies. Fearing for his daughter\u2019s welfare he made it apparent to the cynical Ratigan that he was going to comply with his demands if it meant the return of his daughter unscathed. \u201cIt will be done on time, just don\u2019t hurt my daughter she is all I have left\u201d Hiram begged with the maniacal Ratigan, a devilish grin appeared upon the evil rats face, knowing that he has won the old toymaker over with the danger of his daughter. Assuring Hiram that nothing will harm Olivia Ratigan state in a coy way \u201cDo not despair my dear Hiram your only child will be taken care of and WELL FED\u201d<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Olivia was taken to a very lavished room far away from her father, fidget didn\u2019t know what to do with the young mouse so all he could do until his boss arrived was make sure the little girl didn\u2019t escape her confides. \u201cBoss will be with you shortly my pretty deary\u201d chuckled Fidget the young mouse looked tasty to the large bat, almost good enough to eat, as she backed slowly into a corner with the advances of Fidget to just devour the poor girl in one solemn gulp. The door whipped open as the mastermind who took her and her father to whatever this place was, the man looked at the girl with a crazed yet dignified expression, somehow she knew that whenever this man entered the room, no matter how sincere and refined he seemed to be, it meant no good. \u201cMy dear Olivia Please make yourself at home it seems as if we will have lots of quality time together as your father still has time to work on that little do-hickey that will grant him your and his freedom\u201d the sly rat said, as he poured Olivia a spot of tea to soothe her nerves and nodding to one of his lackeys to retrieve the dessert cart for the young mistress. Sipping with the tea he had just poured into his cup and munching upon a scone that laid on the cart he sensed the distrust that emitted from Olivia in her way. Comforting children was not his forte he didn\u2019t even like them, but try Ratigan did as he was still a man of social graces, no matter how criminal his activities were. Getting close enough to the girl Ratigan tried to comfort her, \u201cthere my dear it will not be long until my uses for your father have ended so bear with this until then\u201d trying to reason with the girl seemed futile as her response to his reasoning was hot burning tea in the face. Angered by the acts that Olivia had taken, Ratigan grabbed a handful of sweets from the cart and shoved it in the young girl\u2019s mouth, only action she could take was to swallow the food that was shoved into her face, evilly Ratigan begun to ponder the proper Punishment for the young girl whom has just disregarded his hospitality with searing tea to his face, \u201cFidget Make sure Miss Flaversham eats every last crumb that laid upon this cart, I want to see her lick it clean, I told her father she would be well fed in my care\u201d Ratigan stated with a wide grin upon his face if she wasn\u2019t going to be a good prisoner he will make her beg for him to stop. He left her in the good care of fidget, he had some other things to take care of and one girl in a locked room shouldn\u2019t be too hard to feed for one bat, Fidget eyed all the delicious sweets on the table and he wondered what to feed her first. </span></div></div>",

Not wanting to bother the rescue rangers with her minuscule woes, Foxglove avoided them like the plague. She got odd jobs that help out the community that resided in and around central park, becoming somewhat of a mail carrier Foxglove had to adhering to the new rules and regulation that came with the job that she has chosen for herself, life was good from where she stood, not working for the dreadful Winfred was such a step up in the eyes of the cute little pink bat that she didn\u2019t know if she could ever go back to being nothing more that a servant for the washer woman. If it wasn\u2019t for the rescue rangers she still might be working for Winfred as her familiar, stealing items for her to become a full fledged witch and doing other dastardly things to please her master, it seemed like a far off memory to Foxglove, she was glad to be a parcel deliverer than anything else, Foxglove was happy at last. Her boss was a elderly shrew whom worked hand and hand with the human\u2019s delivery services without the humans even realizing that they were there to interfere with the parcels that were exchanged, it was a coexistence that one party wasn't[t even aware about was even happening which is how that old shrew liked it. Many Parcels were delivered all over New York some were far and some where just in the next tree, this is why Foxglove loved her job, she never got to visit so many different people at a time, she was surprisingly good at her job too which didn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Late again she made her breakfast, to go as Foxglove begun to race to the office as her previous encounters with old lady shrew have taught her anything about her job is not to be late to it, daytime she was late to pick up her daily mail to be delivered to all the animals around central park and beyond, shrew always gave her an earful about how it was their duty to be on time the slightest miscalculation could be a disastrous event for the whole entire community. Not even saying hello to the old shrew Foxglove begun her duties to deliver the mail to all the awaiting people in the area, a with her favorite satchel and a chipper altitude she begun her rounds, around central park Fox glove had met all of her familiar faces, Mr. and Mrs. Squirrel, grouchy Mr. Beaver, and the large family of Mice all have very heavy and important packages that Foxglove delivered without a hitch. As she looked upon her list of places to deliver, she noticed a package was to be delivered near where she used to live where Wilfred lived, not wanting to go near that area she thought to just skip it, thinking it over in her mind her good nature personality took over and despite her fears she went to deliver that mail.<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Nothing has changed in her old neighborhood, even though its been a while since Foxglove has been near this area, she flew it like she never left. Finding a one Mr. Bartholomew Rat\u2019s house wasn\u2019t hard at all, Delivering the package with a kind heart and grin to match, Foxglove felt good about conquering her fears of running into her old boss she begun to blindly fly into a net of some sort. Tangled in the net, Foxglove plummeted to the ground in a free fall. Surely she would injure something when she was caught by some one whom stayed hidden among the shadows, \u201cthank you kind person you don\u2019t know how glad I am that I didn\u2019t hit the hard ground\u201d Fox glove stated in her always chipper altitude. Gazing upon the person that saved her all of the pink from her fur vanished as the person whom saved her was none other than Wilfred, maniacally the woman laughed while stating triumphantly \u201cMy dear think nothing of it, we have so much to discuss my little experiment\u201d whisked away, Foxglove could only cry as she didn\u2019t know her fate.</span></div></div>",
