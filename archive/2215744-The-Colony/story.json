            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Earth was on the verge of destruction during the mid-21st century; as global temperatures rose, water levels dropped and the atmosphere began to become toxic.  Wars brought on by famine and hunger brought the population of 8 billion down to just over 100,000.  Because of the limited resources, strict population control was put into effect \u2013 reproduction was based on a lottery system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were looking grim for Humanity by the time an alien race called the Maltorians arrived.  The advanced race was fleeing the destruction of their homeworld.  They left their homeworld slightly more than 1000 years earlier, in 3 large colony ships.  Each ship was sent to a different solar system to increase the chances the species would survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maltorians were surprised to find Earth that Earth was already inhabited, but they weren\u2019t okay with the environmental damage.  In exchange for land in South America, the Maltorians offered to help repair the planet.  The repairs would take close to 30 years, so the remaining Human population was either placed in cryogenic sleep or sent to an underground settlement on the Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife on the moon was harsh; with a total of 30,000 Maltorians and Humans living in two large settlements in the Moon\u2019s polar region.  There was a near-constant need for repairs to the colony, the occasional food shortage and regular issues with life support.  There were also the occasional flare-ups in inter-colonial relationships \u2013 but they were generally handled quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where I enter the story.  My name is Olivia and I was born in 2053; just over 4 years into the lunar exile.  I live with my mom, dad and my little brother Eric in modest living quarters towards the outskirts of the colony.  I was 5 years old when I contracted a potentially life-threatening disease; the cure for which was only provided by the Maltorians.</span></div></div>",

The two of us were on our way to the Central Hub, where I was going to be dropped off at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we stepped onto one of the transports, I took a seat between my mom and a window. The transport soon started to move and it wasn\u2019t long before we were on the surface. I could see the tops of some nearby craters, but what really caught my eye was the Earth in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I\u2019d been born on the Moon, so I had no real connection to Earth, but I knew that it was my ancestral home. Even at a young age, I knew how humanity had nearly destroyed the planet\u2019s environment. My daddy said it would have become completely uninhabitable had the Maltorians not arrived when they did. I couldn\u2019t see much detail since the night side was currently facing us, but I knew there was still work to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transport continued on its journey, I spotted a young boy around my age. I immediately noticed that he wasn\u2019t like other Maltorians that I\u2019d seen around the colony. For starters, his skin was a lighter shade of blue and he had a full head of red hair. I was confused by that because I\u2019d never seen a Maltorian with hair before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy confusion faded when a bystander moved to the side, allowing me to see the human woman sitting next to him. Turning to look at Mom, I said, \u201cMommy, why does that boy have hair? I didn\u2019t think Maltorians had hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her tablet, Mom glanced in the direction I was looking and said. \u201cThat little boy is only half-Maltorian; that woman sitting next to him is probably his mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at them, I saw that no one was sitting next to them. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone sitting near them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are those that see children like him as pariahs; people to stay clear of.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate because there\u2019s nothing wrong with that young man. He didn\u2019t ask to be born that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore my mom could stop me, I got up and made my way through the car to the boy. He looked up at me as I got closer. \u201cH-Hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. My name\u2019s Olivia.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy\u2019s eyes lit up when I said that; it was clear few people took the time to talk with him. Looking at me, a smile appearing on his face, he said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Kevin..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed the woman next to Kevin was looking at me.  As I looked at her, I noticed a resemblance between them and figured she was most likely his mom.  Turning my attention back to Kevin, I took a seat next to him and said, \u201cHow come I\u2019ve never seen you around the school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChildren like me aren\u2019t welcome in the main school; we\u2019re seen as freaks.\u201d On the verge of crying, Kevin said, \u201cI go to a special school for other children like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a freak.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t go to my school; because I\u2019d like to be your friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d surprised, Kevin said, \u201cY-You\u2019d want to be my friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh!\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cIn fact, how about you come over to my house tomorrow; we can play with my toys and watch some old cartoons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin anxiously looked up at his mom who, despite looking concerned, nodded.  A big smile on his face, Kevin turned back to me.  Before I could stop him, he hugged me and said, \u201cThanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transport had arrived at the Central Hub at that point.  While the other passengers left, some giving Kevin dirty looks, Mom walked over to where we were sitting.  As I went to stand next to Mom, Kevin\u2019s mom stood up and said, \u201cYou have a wonderful daughter, ma\u2019am.  I haven\u2019t seen Kevin this happy in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer father and I raised her not to judge people by their appearance.\u201d Glancing down at Kevin, still with a smile on his face, Mom said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care that your son in different; all she sees is another potential friend to play with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing something on her tablet, Kevin\u2019s mom said, \u201cI just sent you the relay code for my quarters.  Give me a call, and we can set up the play date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a plan.\u201d Taking my hand, Mom said, \u201cCome Olivia, it\u2019s time for school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Following after Mom, I looked back and waved at Kevin, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin smiled but cautiously waved back. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked of the transport station in the Central Hub, I spotted two Maltorians staring at me as I walked past.  I noticed one of them say something to the other before they both nodded.  I got an uneasy feeling as Mom and I continued walking.  Little did I know, they\u2019d started following us.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I decided not to say anything to my mom about the men following us through the Hub.  They walked past us when we reached the school, but one of them did glance at me as they walked by.  It was at that point I started to feel a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy nervousness must\u2019ve been noticeable because Mom stopped outside the door and looked at me.  \u201cOlivia, honey, are you <br>\r\nalright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mommy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might be a little late picking you up this afternoon; I have to bring your brother for a checkup and your father has an extra shift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of us walked inside the school and made our way to the Kindergarten area.  As we rounded the corner, I spotted my friends Dhelo and Marcus putting some things in their cubbies.  While Mom went to talk with Ms. Trogrik, probably about picking me up late, I ran over to my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhelo, Marcus and I had known each other since we were 2 years old; our fathers worked together in the Colony Control Room.  Dhelo was the oldest of the group; albeit only 2 weeks older than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Marcus said, \u201cAre you alright, Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my best efforts, it seemed my concern about the men following me was still evident.  Putting a smile on my face, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d As the three of us walked into the room, I said, \u201cYou guys want to play with the building blocks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone agreed to the blocks, we made our way over to a viewport overlooking the lunar surface.  As Marcus dumped the blocks on the floor, I noticed a few people in suits walking around on the surface nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 10:30 in the morning, which meant it was getting close to snack time.  After playing with the blocks for almost an hour, the three of us moved on to simply staring out the window \u2013 occasionally waving at the workers if they saw us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay children, it\u2019s time for snacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked away from the viewport; only to get a sickening feeling in my stomach.  One of the men from earlier was standing next to Ms. Trogrik.  Seeing the disturbed look on my face, Dhelo said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat man was following my mommy and me this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just a coincidence.\u201d Taking my hand, Dhelo said, \u201cCome on, Marcus is saving us some seats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes passed by without incident; Ms. Trogrik passed out some juice packets and some protein bars.  When she got to me, I swear I saw a look of guilt on her face as she handed my snacks to me.  I thought nothing of it, as I took a sip of the juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes had passed when I suddenly felt the worst pain I\u2019d ever experienced.  As I doubled over in pain, I noticed two other classmates in pain as well.  Placing my hands on the floor to balance, I noticed they were starting to turn blue.  {i+}What\u2019s happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was my last conscious thought before I blacked out.  When I finally woke up again, I found myself ______.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I woke up again, I found myself in a room about the size of my bedroom.  The beeping noises and the monitors around me told me I was in the Colony Medical Bay.  I heard movement behind me and turned to find my parents standing at the foot of the bed, my brother Eric in Dad\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was by my side the moment she noticed that I was awake.  When she took my hand in hers, I immediately noticed that it was much bluer than it had been earlier.  Pulling my hand back, I looked at it closer and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my hand, Mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know, sweetie; the doctor thinks it\u2019s a Maltorian disease.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for a Maltorian doctor to come and confirm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look at my arms showed the changes weren\u2019t limited to my hands \u2013 my arms were starting to turn blue as well.  I was starting to get scared as I looked up at Mom.  \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me, Mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up, Mom said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright, sweetie; I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon became apparent that my condition was too much for Mom to handle; as she quickly left the room.  This elicited a response from Eric, \u201cMommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad pulled a chair up to my bedside and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be back to normal soon, sweetie; don\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, a curious look on his face, Eric said, \u201cYou look funny, Owivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say something in response, but Dad beat me to it.  \u201cDon\u2019t say that, young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we waited for the Maltorian doctor to arrive, Daddy told me that three of my classmates had also been afflicted by whatever was affecting me.  I asked if I could see them, but Daddy said the doctors were worried about spreading whatever this was to the rest of the colony.  Mom had returned at that point, having composed herself.  Walking into the room, she said, \u201cHow are you doing, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had been feeling queasy for the last few minutes.  Looking at Mom, I said, \u201cMy tummy hurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad glanced at Mom and said, \u201cI asked if we could give her something to settle her stomach, but the doctors advised against it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom went to lie in bed with me, she looked around the room and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Carmichael came to get him about 15 minutes ago; I didn\u2019t want to risk him getting whatever this is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us?\u201d running a hand through my hair, Mom said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be worried about getting it ourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the doctors would\u2019ve asked us to leave if they were worried about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maltorian doctor, a woman in her mid 20s, walked into the room at that moment.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late; you must be the Sheppard\u2019s.\u201d smiling, she reached out to shake Mom and Dad\u2019s hands.  \u201cMy name is Dr. D'Pkeni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor.\u201d Gesturing to me, Mom said, \u201cCan you tell us what is happening to our daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, Dr. D'Pkeni said, \u201c900 years ago, after my species fled our home world, we realized that we weren\u2019t adapted to living in space.  A retrovirus was created to artificially alter our genome to ensure we could survive long-term space travel.\u201d Sighing, Dr. D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how, but it seems your daughter was exposed to that retrovirus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what any of that meant, but I could tell from my parent\u2019s expressions that it wasn\u2019t good.  Taking my hand, Mom said, \u201cWhat are you saying, Doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying, Mrs. Sheppard, is that your daughter is becoming a Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes bugged out when I heard that; while my parents alternated between shock and anger.  \u201cYou can fix this, right?\u201d Looking at Dr. D\u2019Pkeni, Dad said, \u201cPlease tell me you can make my daughter human again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a way to counteract the changes, but I\u2019m unsure as to the effect it will have on humans.\u201d Taking a breath, Dr. D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cThere\u2019s a very real chance that it could kill your daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI burst into tears when I heard that \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to die.  Tears streaming down my face, I looked at my parents and said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mom tried to calm me down, Dad looked at Dr. D\u2019Pkeni and said, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate if you watched what you said around my little girl.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cShe\u2019s scared enough already, she doesn\u2019t need to be told she could die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Sheppard; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not used to treating humans.\u201d With a faint smile, Dr. D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cI\u2019m used to treating my own species, and Maltorians like to be told everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still crying at that point, but not as much as before.  Looking at my parents, and the doctor, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad looked at each other for a few moments; I knew they were facing an impossible decision.  Either they continued to let me turn into a Maltorian, or risk the cure killing me.  I knew I was only a child, but I knew the option I would have preferred \u2013 I\u2019d rather be a Maltorian then dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dr. D\u2019Pkeni stood by, and I sat on the bed, Mom and Dad discussed their options.  After a moment, they took one glance at me before turning to Dr. D\u2019Pkeni.  Taking a deep breath, Dad said \u201c_______.\u201d</span></div></div>",

When I moved to take the sheets off, I immediately noticed my skin was still blue \u2013 not only that, but my hands only had 4 fingers on them.  <i>That stupid cure didn\u2019t even work!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out of bed, I ran over to a nearby mirror and my jaw dropped.  The reflection looking back at me wasn\u2019t the one I\u2019d seen this morning.  To my utter shock, I was now completely Maltorian; down to the 4 fingers, 4 toes and the dark blue eyes of the species.  <i>What is going on here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, confused as to what was going on, I spotted a jumpsuit similar to the one I\u2019d worn this morning.  After getting dressed, I decided my next step was to make my way home.  I slowly opened the door and peaked out into the hall; noticing everyone was running around in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out of the room and started towards the exit; hoping that no one would stop me.  Thankfully I made it to the exit without a problem, as everyone was in a panic.  I made my way through the crowds to the transport hub; only then did I realize I didn\u2019t have my transit pass.  I wouldn\u2019t be let on the transport without the pass, but I also needed to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted a Maltorian family getting on the transport so I decided to sneak on with them; hoping the guards would think I was with them.  As the transport started moving towards home, I heard an announcement over the intercom.  \u201cA mandatory curfew will go into effect in 25 minutes; please return to your homes immediately.  Anyone caught in the public areas after curfew will be punished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that announcement made me wonder what was going on.  I\u2019d never heard of anything like this happening before.  Thankfully the transport arrived at the station without incident.  After getting off, I saw I only had 20 minutes left to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran through the central area to the passage that led to my family\u2019s quarters.  On the way, I saw some humans harassing a Maltorian woman; but didn\u2019t stop to see why.  Once I got to my family\u2019s quarters, I started knocking frantically on the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, open up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the door opened and I saw Mom standing there.  She looked down at me with a confused look on her face.  \u201cCan I help you, little one?  Are you lost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to respond when I saw something that shocked me more than when I found out I was becoming a Maltorian.  Behind Mom, walking out of my bedroom, I caught a glimpse of...myself.</span></div></div>",

As we waited in line, clearly getting annoyed at this point, Mom looked at me and said, \u201cSweetie, I understand you\u2019re confused; but I\u2019m you\u2019re your mother.\u201d Kneeling down to my level, she said, \u201cThat little girl you saw back there?

Why wouldn\u2019t she even entertain the idea that I was telling the truth?   Before I could try again to convince her, I was interrupted by the sound of someone talking in front of me.  \u201cPlease sir, you have to let me on the transport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up to find a woman in her late 20s standing in front of a guard.  She looked to be in a panic about something.  Looking at her, the guard said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, but traffic to the Central Hub from this station is limited to Maltorians only.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d digging through her bag, coming out with an ID card, she said, \u201cMy wife is Maltorian; please, I have to get home to her and my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the guard communicated with someone over the radio, my mom went up to the woman and said, \u201cExcuse me, did you say your wife is Maltorian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d turning around, the woman said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you disapprove of inter-species marriages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not; my best friend is married to a Maltorian.\u201d Gesturing to me, Mom said, \u201cThis little girl needs to get home to her family.  Could she ride the transport with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I guess that\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Looking at me, the woman said, \u201cWell, little one, what do you say we find your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to shake my head profusely; saying, \u201cNo, please, I don\u2019t want to go!  I belong here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at Mom, who simply said, \u201cI think she\u2019s confused; she believes my husband and I are her parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are!\u201d looking at Mom, tears streaming down my face, I said, \u201cMommy, please believe me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then an announcement came over the intercom.  \u201cLockdown will commence in 10 minutes; please return to your respective colonies at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s our cue.\u201d Grabbing my hand, the woman turned to my Mom said, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets home safe and sound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d With a smile, Mom looked at me and said, \u201cStay safe little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only watch, helpless to do anything, as Mom walked away.

I sat silently by a window; fixated on my reflection and how much it had changed.  I used to have my Daddy\u2019s hair and my mommy\u2019s eyes, but that wasn\u2019t the case anymore.  That was enough to bring a tear to my eyes, which caught the attention of the woman watching over me.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cAre you okay, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Looking at her, struggling not to cry, I said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m never going to see my parents again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that; once we get off the transport, I\u2019ll help you find your parents.\u201d Taking my hand in hers, she said, \u201cWho knows, they could be waiting for you at the station.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to explain that she didn\u2019t understand what was going on; but in reality, I didn\u2019t fully understand it either.  Would anyone believe me if I told them I was supposed to be a human girl?  Realizing I should say something, I sighed and said, \u201cI hope they\u2019re there waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us were silent for a few moments until the woman said. \u201cYou look to be around my son\u2019s age.\u201d With a smile, she said, <br>\r\n\u201cHow about, once we find your parents, we arrange a play date or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIs your son Maltorian...like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s human like me.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI just realized I never introduced myself; my name is Liz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that; Liz would probably be confused about why a Maltorian girl has a Human name.  Thankfully an announcement came over the intercom before I could answer; announcing that the transport was arriving at the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz was the only person I knew right now, I quickly grabbed her hand and followed her off the transport.  Before we even got 10 feet, I heard a woman\u2019s voice call out, \u201cLiz, honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us turned in the direction the voice came from; I noticed a Maltorian woman walking towards us with a young Human boy.  I quickly figured the boy was Liz\u2019s son; and she was right, he did look about my age.  I watched as Liz and the woman shared a kiss; before the woman turned noticed me standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the quizzical look on her face, Liz said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Sorain, this isn\u2019t another mouth to feed.\u201d Sighing, Liz said, \u201cShe was lost over in the Human Colony, I told the woman who found her that I\u2019d make sure she got back to her family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was worried there for a second.\u201d Chuckling, Sorain said, \u201cWith the lockdown, I\u2019m concerned we don\u2019t have enough food for the three of us; let alone another child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how enthusiastic you are about us having another kid.\u201d Sighing, Liz turned to me and said, \u201cSweetie, this is my wife Sorain and our son David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorain and I exchanged some quick pleasantries before I turned my attention to David.  He looked to be about my height, maybe a little taller; with red hair and some freckles.  He kind of reminded me of Marcus.  Looking at him, I smiled and said, \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d Smiling back, David said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted by someone yelling out, \u201cMatura Telfani!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around, thinking someone was looking for their child, only to spot _____ walking towards me.</span></div></div>",

Looking at her, shaking my head, I said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatura, little one, we\u2019re your parents.\u201d Gesturing to the man behind her, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the sound of it, she got herself lost in the Human Colony.\u201d Pausing, Liz said, \u201cApparently she went to someone\u2019s quarters; insisting that she was their daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid confusion is a common side effect with Phiemu fever; the humans should be glad they\u2019re immune to the illness.\u201d Sighing, the woman stood up and said, \u201cHer sister found her sweating profusely in bed last night, so we rushed her to the Med Bay.  The doctors were supposed to keep an eye on her, but with everything that\u2019s happened; she was probably able to sneak out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the third time I\u2019d heard someone mention something happening; I\u2019d been too caught with my situation to figure out what it was.  The woman reached out to take my hand, but I stepped away and looked up at Liz.  \u201cPlease don\u2019t let them take me; they\u2019re not my parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment I thought I saw a glimpse of understanding in Liz\u2019s eyes, but it quickly disappeared.  \u201cThat\u2019s enough Matura, your father and I have had enough of your games.\u201d Forcibly grabbing my hand, the woman said, \u201cLet this woman go home to her family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman started pulling me away, Liz looked at me and said, \u201cBye Matura, it was nice meeting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to free myself from the woman\u2019s grip as they led me from the station, but it was useless.  As we walked through the main plaza, I decided my best course of action was to throw a tantrum.  \u201cHelp!  I\u2019m being kidnapped; these aren\u2019t my parents!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, no one really paid attention; as the man and woman pulled me into a passageway.  Reaching into his pocket, the man retrieved a needle.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cI was hoping this wouldn\u2019t be necessary, but I\u2019m afraid you leave me no choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to run but the woman had a grip on both my arms.

As I sat up in bed, the first thought that entered my mind was \u2013 how am I going to get back home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly looked around the room and saw another bed; with an assortment of toys strewn about the room.  Wherever I was, this was definitely meant for children.  Suddenly the door opened and I turned to see a young Maltorian girl, perhaps a few years older than me, walk into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reflexively squeezed myself into a corner and tried to cover myself with the covers; which caused the girl to stop and look back at my kidnappers standing in the doorway.  The man simply gestured for the girl to go forward, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s alright Tala, go introduce yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, Tala, slowly walked forward until she was standing right at the foot of the bed.  Looking at me, anxiety apparent on her face, she said, \u201cHi, I-I\u2019m your sister Tala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a sister; I have a little brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I said that, Tala started to tear up a little; which caused the woman to walk into the room.  Tala wrapped herself around the woman, as she looked at me.  \u201cMatura, sweetie, the sooner you accept that we\u2019re your family the better off you\u2019ll be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t my family!\u201d getting defiant, I said, \u201cI want to go home to my real family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wrapped around the woman, Tala looked up and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Matura, Mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, sweetie; each conversion is different.\u201d Looking for Tala to me, the woman said, \u201cYour sister is just more strong-willed than we were led to believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind them, the man said, \u201cEither that or they picked the wrong child to convert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, Jervix.\u201d Glancing back at the man, the woman said, \u201cWe just have to give her space; I\u2019m certain she\u2019ll come around in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tala left the room with her parents; leaving me alone with my thoughts.  Once the door was closed, I brought a hand to my mouth to keep from screaming.  Whatever this conversion was, it was probably the reason why I was a Maltorian now. I don\u2019t know what scared me more; the fact that this was intentional, or that I was specifically chosen.</span></div></div>",

I felt terrible when I saw Tala start tearing up.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset you, Tala; but I\u2019m not your sister.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even born like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was something I didn\u2019t expect.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t born this way either; the Maltorians kidnapped me a few years ago and made me one of them.\u201d  Looking at me, taking a deep breath, Tala said, \u201cOne minute I\u2019m in the Central Plaza with my Mom; the next thing I know, I wake up and find out they\u2019ve turned me into a Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you ever try to get back to your family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to get back to them once; only...they were dead.\u201d Tears in her eyes, Tala said, \u201cThey were killed, along with 14 others, when part of the passageway they were in decompressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a vague memory of that incident; it had happened a few months after Eric was born when a micro-meteorite pierced the tunnel.  Suddenly realizing my problem wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as Tala\u2019s problem, I embraced her and said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala held me close for a few moments as she cried.  Once she was finished, she wiped her eyes and said, \u201cI hate to say this, but I\u2019m kind of glad to have someone else who knows what I\u2019m going through.  All my Maltorian friends think I was born like this, and I can\u2019t tell my human friends because they think I\u2019m dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled a little bit; for I was also glad to have someone in my situation.  \u201cDo you know why they\u2019re changing human children in Maltorians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea; but whatever it is, it seems they need kids like us to do it.\u201d  Pausing, Tala said, \u201cI have a feeling that clones were behind the attack on the Launch Zone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat attack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know about the attack?\u201d shocked, Tala said, \u201cOne of the resupply ships heading to Earth exploded; killed 30 people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, it made sense that the entire colony was put on lockdown.  Unfortunately for me, that was going to make it difficult for me to get back to my family.  It was at that moment that the door opened again and Kalura walked stepped into the room.  \u201cI'm glad to see my girls are getting to know each other.\" with a smile, she said, \"Dinner will be ready in a few minutes; why don't you girls get washed up.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking at Tala, I said, \u201cI never really thought about it, but you\u2019re right.  Why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of respect for the humans.\u201d Moving to unzip her jumper, Tala said, \u201cMaltorians don\u2019t wear any clothes when we eat.\u201d<br>\r\nI instinctively went to cover myself; even though I was still fully clothed.  \u201cNothing at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even underwear.\u201d Pulling the jumper down from her shoulders, Tala said, \u201cI thought I\u2019d better tell you before we left the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized I had no way out of this; so I reluctantly took my clothes off as well.  Once the two of us were completely naked, we walked out of the bathroom and joined Kalura and Jervix at the table.  \u201cGood Tala, you told your little sister about our custom.\u201d Looking at me, Kalura said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Matura, you\u2019ll soon grow accustomed to our ways.  Given time you\u2019ll even forget ever doing it anyway but ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently took a seat at the table next to Tala; as Kalura said some words in Maltorian.  Once she was finished, Jervix gave us permission to start eating.  I kept my eyes on my plate at first; not wanting to see anyone, myself included, naked.  But as dinner continued, I found myself gazing around the table.  Kalura was right, I was getting used to it.</span></div></div>",

Some of them were kind of fun, though. The Maltorian dolls were a lot like my Barbies. I had a bunch of them sitting around and drinking nekta juice, and Kalura smiled and nodded. For a moment, I almost forgot that I was her prisoner, along with Tala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of playing, Kalura said it was time to get ready for bed. My nightgown was a lot like the one I used to wear. The stuffed animal was weird, though: Instead of a teddy bear, it was something with tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I had time to get ready for bed, Kalura came into the room I shared with Tala and tucked me in. \"I know this must all be scary for you, Matura,\" she said, \"but you don't have anything to worry about. I will not allow any harm to come to either of you. You are safe with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my real mother!\" I said. \"You took me away from my family, and left a fake in my place!

Whatever happened to me after this, my family would still be there.  There was, however, something I wanted to check out.  <br>\r\n\u201cMommy. Daddy. Can I have some privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad left the room with Dr. D\u2019Pkeni.  Once I was alone, I removed my covers to find my feet were as blue as my hands.  As I climbed out of bed, I noticed that the little finger on each hand was curled up and I couldn\u2019t straighten them out. I knew Maltorians only had four fingers on their hands, so I figured I would lose those soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a mirror I saw my forearms and lower legs were blue; while my upper arms and thighs were slowly changing.  <br>\r\nThankfully Maltorians were roughly the same size as humans, so I knew that wouldn\u2019t change; while the shape of my head wouldn\u2019t change until I was older.  I was going to be different from my family, but maybe not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to go back to bed, I saw some of my hair lying on the pillow.  While hybrids like Kevin generally kept their hair, full-blood Maltorians were bald.  So it wasn\u2019t surprising to find that I was losing my hair; just like I was losing two of my fingers and two of my toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing back into bed, I remembered Dr. D\u2019Pkeni saying that I\u2019d been exposed to whatever changed me.  As I lay in bed, I remembered the two Maltorians following me this morning.  <i>Where they responsible for this?</i> I wondered.  <i>Why did they do it?

My breasts weren't much to look at, but the shape of my head showed that I would soon be a Maltorian woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom knocked on the door, then came in. \"Olivia, honey - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said. \"Matura, honey, breakfast is ready. I made your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. Mom and Dad weren't great shakes at much of Maltorian culture, but Mom's Maltorian cooking brought praise even from my Maltorian friends. I took off the dress I was wearing, then joined the family at the table. I offered prayers to Chrestus, and then the meal began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, it was usually Eric's and my job to do the dishes. Today, though, Dad decided to join me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we washed, it became clear why. \"Ol- Matura, sorry - about your name,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matura is a prophetess, Daddy,\" I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" he replied. \"It's just that... What was wrong with Olivia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Olivia is a nice human name. But I'm not a human, and I haven't been for eight years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ashamed of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to him, unsure if I had heard him correctly. \"What have I done to suggest such a thing? Tell me, so I can correct it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your name,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understood now. \"My name is Matura Sheppard, Daddy. My first name tells everyone who I am, and my last name tells them where I came from. I am not an Olivia, Daddy, but I will always be a Sheppard. I know that Chrestus smiles upon this home, and I would never dishonor her or you by wishing for another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad wiped tears from his eyes. \"That's all I needed to hear. And know that Chrestus smiles on you, too. Your mother and I gave you the other name, and perhaps we were foolishly bound to it. We have always said that we love you, no matter what. I apologize for suggesting that might not be the case.\"</span></div></div>",

Pulling me aside, she said, \u201cJudging by that smile, I suspect you\u2019ve made your decision?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a Maltorian female reaches her 13th birthday, she\u2019s allowed to give herself physically to a person of her choosing.  My parents weren\u2019t too keen about that idea; especially after Sorain mentioned it involved sex.  But once they realized that it was part of my culture, they relented and gave their consent.  \u201cI spent days praying to Chrestus for her guidance.\u201d  Turning my attention back to Dhelo, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided that Kevin is the one I want to be with; if he\u2019ll have me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious what that answer is going to be.\u201d Chuckling, Dhelo said, \u201cHe\u2019s been following you around for weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhelo and I were still talking when Mom came over to us; carrying two glasses of nekta juice.  \u201cMatura, sweetheart, don\u2019t forget you have other guests here as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mother.\u201d Taking one of the glasses, I said, \u201cDhelo and I were just discussing my plans for this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t discuss that in public.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m aware that it is part of your culture, but I\u2019m afraid the parents of your human classmates might not understand it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault your species has such primitive hang-ups when it comes to sexuality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it...you know what, I\u2019m not going to get into another argument with you about this.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Mom said, \u201cJust enjoy your party, then you can spend the evening doing whatever you want with Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you keep it down, Mother!\u201d gritting my teeth, I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t discussed it with him yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you may want to before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Pointing behind me, Mom said, \u201cHe seems to be having a nice conversation with your friend Madison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I saw Kevin talking with Madison Decker; a girl from my lacrosse team.  We were on friendly terms, but the two of us tended to be competitive with each other.  I already lost out on being Team Captain; I wasn\u2019t going to let her take Kevin from me.  Handing my drink to Dhelo, I took a deep breath and walked over to them.  \u201cSorry to interrupt; but Kevin, could I talk to you for a moment?  In private?</span></div></div>",

After all, if I were still human then my family and I wouldn\u2019t have tried so hard to understand Maltorian culture.  Clasping hands and touching foreheads again, the two of us rejoined the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited an appropriate length of time before telling Dhelo; but decided to let Madison figure it out for herself.

If we're going to stop them, we need to do the last thing they want us to do: work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I listen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it happened to me already,\" I answered. \"I was one of the human children who became Maltorians eight years ago. I believe it was done as a test, to see what the reaction would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've embraced being a Maltorian. Another has a foot in both communities. And the third has been raised as a four-fingered blue human with two hearts and no hair. None of us have been rejected by our families. Whoever did it may want more information. This may be only Phase II of their plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would Phase III be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's up to whatever their goal is. But they definitely don't want the two governments joining forces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't they want the Maltorians looking for them? Wouldn't they be thrilled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Maltorians, the laws of government and Chrestus are one. And they know that their actions are forbidden under the <i>Xrex'yrd</i>. They would face not only our judgment, but Chrestus's. It's not a glass of nekta juice that awaits them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor was silent for a long time.</span></div></div>",

We each had a tutor at our side, walking us through our classes but there was little interaction permitted. In fact, each teacher wore a medical mask and gloves to prevent the spreading of germs. All precautions including social distancing was ordered  to keep the next generation safe from illness. We were all told that we were humanity's hope to carry on. No pressure there, right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are excel in all subjects, Olivia.\" Smiling, my teacher, Mrs. Jones said. \"You have finished today's lessons early so you are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that and gladly left my desk, thoroughly washing my hands before leaving the small school building. As I walked to the trans pick up to return to the transport station in the Central Hub, I noticed two blurry men watching me from a distance. They were both Maltorian and not a friendly looking pair. I picked up the pace, hoping the human only trans would be there when I arrived. It did not help my nerves to know that they had started to follow me. <i>\"What did I do to get their interest?\"</i> Worried, I thought. <i>\"I'm just going home.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved even faster and arrived at the trans pick up just as it had arrived. i almost literally jumped on and showed the driver my DNA ID, proving I was true blood human. The driver nodded and motioned me to take a seat. I did so and looked out the window to the frowning faces of the two Maltorian men. One took up a small radio device as the trans moved away from the school. \"Those blasted Maltorian security goons seem to be everywhere these days.\" Grumbling, the driver said. \"Any idea why they were interested in you, lass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Not a clue.\" Honestly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your senses sharp, lass.\" Frowning, the driver said. \"There is too few of us to have your youngins disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then turned to the window at the passing scenery. There was not much to see as we were in a colony on the moon but it was something to look at. Just as boredom was about to set in, a second trans going the other way stopped as mine did only a few feet away. I looked over and nearly screamed. Staring right back at me, in complete disbelief was a little girl who looked exactly like me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, we just stared at each other as if looking at a reflection until the two trans continued on their way...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom pulled me into the section and sat down with me before the door was sealed. We remained in that sealed glass section until we reached the hospital wing. As the tans moved along, i was in for another shock.

I sat up, feeling dizzy, due to whatever had hit me and took a careful look around. Behind me was a large window, over looking a small but inviting court yard. To my left was a sizable mirror, taking up almost a quarter of the wall. On the right was a door, leading to a tiny wash room. Across the room from me was a closed door, I guessed was the only way out. My memories of what had happened the night before were still fresh in my mind but, for some unknown reason, I was strangely unafraid, merely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crawled out of the bed and discovered that I was now wearing a fashionable pair of blue pajamas. Upon closer examination of myself, I found that I was carefully bandaged from head to foot, making me look somewhat like a mummy, only increasing my confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my feet and found a pair of pink slippers, which I slipped on, then walked uneasily to the closed door. Of course, the door was locked. But, still in a daze, I was not detoured and pulled onto the door knob harder. The lock broke with a low crunch and the door handle ripped off in my hand as the door slowly drifted open in front of me. I looked at the handle, slightly surprised, then lightly dropped it to the floor as I then cautiously walked out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe- Hello?\u201d Politely, I called. \u201cI- I\u2019m sorry about the door. Hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around as no one answered and began to slowly wander the halls, curiously taking yin my new environment, uncertain, but not afraid. \u201cHello? Is anyone here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My but you are a strong girl.\" Startling me, a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spun around to find a well dressed, tall and attractive young woman, standing in the hall. She smiled politely and motioned for me to follow her. Seeing no threat, I walked over to her. \"Where am I?\" Politely, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in a safe place, I am Dr. Dani Dorsey.\" Calmly, the woman replied. \"I do apologize for your injuries, there was a fight over you before we could get you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A what...?!\"</i> Startled, I thought. Then i asked, \"Have you seen my mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in due time, young lady.\" Kindly. Dr. Dorsey said. \"Your mother is safe and resting. I was hoping we could have a little talk... won't you join me for some tea...?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
