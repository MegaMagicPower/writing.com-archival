            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Earth was on the verge of destruction during the mid-21st century; as global temperatures rose, water levels dropped and the atmosphere began to become toxic.  Wars brought on by famine and hunger brought the population of 8 billion down to just over 100,000.  Because of the limited resources, strict population control was put into effect \u2013 reproduction was based on a lottery system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were looking grim for Humanity by the time an alien race called the Maltorians arrived.  The advanced race was fleeing the destruction of their homeworld.  They left their homeworld slightly more than 1000 years earlier, in 3 large colony ships.  Each ship was sent to a different solar system to increase the chances the species would survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maltorians were surprised to find Earth that Earth was already inhabited, but they weren\u2019t okay with the environmental damage.  In exchange for land in South America, the Maltorians offered to help repair the planet.  The repairs would take close to 30 years, so the remaining Human population was either placed in cryogenic sleep or sent to an underground settlement on the Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife on the moon was harsh; with a total of 30,000 Maltorians and Humans living in two large settlements in the Moon\u2019s polar region.  There was a near-constant need for repairs to the colony, the occasional food shortage and regular issues with life support.  There were also the occasional flare-ups in inter-colonial relationships \u2013 but they were generally handled quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where I enter the story.  My name is Olivia and I was born in 2053; just over 4 years into the lunar exile.  I live with my mom, dad and my little brother Eric in modest living quarters towards the outskirts of the colony.  I was 5 years old when I contracted a potentially life-threatening disease; the cure for which was only provided by the Maltorians.</span></div></div>",

The two of us were on our way to the Central Hub, where I was going to be dropped off at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we stepped onto one of the transports, I took a seat between my mom and a window. The transport soon started to move and it wasn\u2019t long before we were on the surface. I could see the tops of some nearby craters, but what really caught my eye was the Earth in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I\u2019d been born on the Moon, so I had no real connection to Earth, but I knew that it was my ancestral home. Even at a young age, I knew how humanity had nearly destroyed the planet\u2019s environment. My daddy said it would have become completely uninhabitable had the Maltorians not arrived when they did. I couldn\u2019t see much detail since the night side was currently facing us, but I knew there was still work to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transport continued on its journey, I spotted a young boy around my age. I immediately noticed that he wasn\u2019t like other Maltorians that I\u2019d seen around the colony. For starters, his skin was a lighter shade of blue and he had a full head of red hair. I was confused by that because I\u2019d never seen a Maltorian with hair before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy confusion faded when a bystander moved to the side, allowing me to see the human woman sitting next to him. Turning to look at Mom, I said, \u201cMommy, why does that boy have hair? I didn\u2019t think Maltorians had hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her tablet, Mom glanced in the direction I was looking and said. \u201cThat little boy is only half-Maltorian; that woman sitting next to him is probably his mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at them, I saw that no one was sitting next to them. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone sitting near them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are those that see children like him as pariahs; people to stay clear of.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate because there\u2019s nothing wrong with that young man. He didn\u2019t ask to be born that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore my mom could stop me, I got up and made my way through the car to the boy. He looked up at me as I got closer. \u201cH-Hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. My name\u2019s Olivia.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy\u2019s eyes lit up when I said that; it was clear few people took the time to talk with him. Looking at me, a smile appearing on his face, he said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Kevin..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed the woman next to Kevin was looking at me.  As I looked at her, I noticed a resemblance between them and figured she was most likely his mom.  Turning my attention back to Kevin, I took a seat next to him and said, \u201cHow come I\u2019ve never seen you around the school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChildren like me aren\u2019t welcome in the main school; we\u2019re seen as freaks.\u201d On the verge of crying, Kevin said, \u201cI go to a special school for other children like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a freak.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t go to my school; because I\u2019d like to be your friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d surprised, Kevin said, \u201cY-You\u2019d want to be my friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh!\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cIn fact, how about you come over to my house tomorrow; we can play with my toys and watch some old cartoons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin anxiously looked up at his mom who, despite looking concerned, nodded.  A big smile on his face, Kevin turned back to me.  Before I could stop him, he hugged me and said, \u201cThanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transport had arrived at the Central Hub at that point.  While the other passengers left, some giving Kevin dirty looks, Mom walked over to where we were sitting.  As I went to stand next to Mom, Kevin\u2019s mom stood up and said, \u201cYou have a wonderful daughter, ma\u2019am.  I haven\u2019t seen Kevin this happy in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer father and I raised her not to judge people by their appearance.\u201d Glancing down at Kevin, still with a smile on his face, Mom said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care that your son in different; all she sees is another potential friend to play with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing something on her tablet, Kevin\u2019s mom said, \u201cI just sent you the relay code for my quarters.  Give me a call, and we can set up the play date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a plan.\u201d Taking my hand, Mom said, \u201cCome Olivia, it\u2019s time for school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Following after Mom, I looked back and waved at Kevin, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin smiled but cautiously waved back. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked of the transport station in the Central Hub, I spotted two Maltorians staring at me as I walked past.  I noticed one of them say something to the other before they both nodded.  I got an uneasy feeling as Mom and I continued walking.  Little did I know, they\u2019d started following us.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I decided not to say anything to my mom about the men following us through the Hub.  They walked past us when we reached the school, but one of them did glance at me as they walked by.  It was at that point I started to feel a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy nervousness must\u2019ve been noticeable because Mom stopped outside the door and looked at me.  \u201cOlivia, honey, are you <br>\r\nalright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mommy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might be a little late picking you up this afternoon; I have to bring your brother for a checkup and your father has an extra shift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of us walked inside the school and made our way to the Kindergarten area.  As we rounded the corner, I spotted my friends Dhelo and Marcus putting some things in their cubbies.  While Mom went to talk with Ms. Trogrik, probably about picking me up late, I ran over to my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhelo, Marcus and I had known each other since we were 2 years old; our fathers worked together in the Colony Control Room.  Dhelo was the oldest of the group; albeit only 2 weeks older than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Marcus said, \u201cAre you alright, Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my best efforts, it seemed my concern about the men following me was still evident.  Putting a smile on my face, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d As the three of us walked into the room, I said, \u201cYou guys want to play with the building blocks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone agreed to the blocks, we made our way over to a viewport overlooking the lunar surface.  As Marcus dumped the blocks on the floor, I noticed a few people in suits walking around on the surface nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 10:30 in the morning, which meant it was getting close to snack time.  After playing with the blocks for almost an hour, the three of us moved on to simply staring out the window \u2013 occasionally waving at the workers if they saw us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay children, it\u2019s time for snacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked away from the viewport; only to get a sickening feeling in my stomach.  One of the men from earlier was standing next to Ms. Trogrik.  Seeing the disturbed look on my face, Dhelo said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat man was following my mommy and me this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just a coincidence.\u201d Taking my hand, Dhelo said, \u201cCome on, Marcus is saving us some seats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes passed by without incident; Ms. Trogrik passed out some juice packets and some protein bars.  When she got to me, I swear I saw a look of guilt on her face as she handed my snacks to me.  I thought nothing of it, as I took a sip of the juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes had passed when I suddenly felt the worst pain I\u2019d ever experienced.  As I doubled over in pain, I noticed two other classmates in pain as well.  Placing my hands on the floor to balance, I noticed they were starting to turn blue.  {i+}What\u2019s happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was my last conscious thought before I blacked out.  When I finally woke up again, I found myself ______.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I woke up again, I found myself in a room about the size of my bedroom.  The beeping noises and the monitors around me told me I was in the Colony Medical Bay.  I heard movement behind me and turned to find my parents standing at the foot of the bed, my brother Eric in Dad\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was by my side the moment she noticed that I was awake.  When she took my hand in hers, I immediately noticed that it was much bluer than it had been earlier.  Pulling my hand back, I looked at it closer and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my hand, Mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know, sweetie; the doctor thinks it\u2019s a Maltorian disease.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for a Maltorian doctor to come and confirm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look at my arms showed the changes weren\u2019t limited to my hands \u2013 my arms were starting to turn blue as well.  I was starting to get scared as I looked up at Mom.  \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me, Mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up, Mom said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright, sweetie; I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon became apparent that my condition was too much for Mom to handle; as she quickly left the room.  This elicited a response from Eric, \u201cMommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad pulled a chair up to my bedside and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be back to normal soon, sweetie; don\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, a curious look on his face, Eric said, \u201cYou look funny, Owivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say something in response, but Dad beat me to it.  \u201cDon\u2019t say that, young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we waited for the Maltorian doctor to arrive, Daddy told me that three of my classmates had also been afflicted by whatever was affecting me.  I asked if I could see them, but Daddy said the doctors were worried about spreading whatever this was to the rest of the colony.  Mom had returned at that point, having composed herself.  Walking into the room, she said, \u201cHow are you doing, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had been feeling queasy for the last few minutes.  Looking at Mom, I said, \u201cMy tummy hurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad glanced at Mom and said, \u201cI asked if we could give her something to settle her stomach, but the doctors advised against it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom went to lie in bed with me, she looked around the room and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Carmichael came to get him about 15 minutes ago; I didn\u2019t want to risk him getting whatever this is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us?\u201d running a hand through my hair, Mom said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be worried about getting it ourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the doctors would\u2019ve asked us to leave if they were worried about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maltorian doctor, a woman in her mid 20s, walked into the room at that moment.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late; you must be the Sheppard\u2019s.\u201d smiling, she reached out to shake Mom and Dad\u2019s hands.  \u201cMy name is Dr. D'Pkeni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor.\u201d Gesturing to me, Mom said, \u201cCan you tell us what is happening to our daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, Dr. D'Pkeni said, \u201c900 years ago, after my species fled our home world, we realized that we weren\u2019t adapted to living in space.  A retrovirus was created to artificially alter our genome to ensure we could survive long-term space travel.\u201d Sighing, Dr. D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how, but it seems your daughter was exposed to that retrovirus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what any of that meant, but I could tell from my parent\u2019s expressions that it wasn\u2019t good.  Taking my hand, Mom said, \u201cWhat are you saying, Doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying, Mrs. Sheppard, is that your daughter is becoming a Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes bugged out when I heard that; while my parents alternated between shock and anger.  \u201cYou can fix this, right?\u201d Looking at Dr. D\u2019Pkeni, Dad said, \u201cPlease tell me you can make my daughter human again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a way to counteract the changes, but I\u2019m unsure as to the effect it will have on humans.\u201d Taking a breath, Dr. D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cThere\u2019s a very real chance that it could kill your daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI burst into tears when I heard that \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to die.  Tears streaming down my face, I looked at my parents and said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mom tried to calm me down, Dad looked at Dr. D\u2019Pkeni and said, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate if you watched what you said around my little girl.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cShe\u2019s scared enough already, she doesn\u2019t need to be told she could die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Sheppard; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not used to treating humans.\u201d With a faint smile, Dr. D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cI\u2019m used to treating my own species, and Maltorians like to be told everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still crying at that point, but not as much as before.  Looking at my parents, and the doctor, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad looked at each other for a few moments; I knew they were facing an impossible decision.  Either they continued to let me turn into a Maltorian, or risk the cure killing me.  I knew I was only a child, but I knew the option I would have preferred \u2013 I\u2019d rather be a Maltorian then dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dr. D\u2019Pkeni stood by, and I sat on the bed, Mom and Dad discussed their options.  After a moment, they took one glance at me before turning to Dr. D\u2019Pkeni.  Taking a deep breath, Dad said \u201c_______.\u201d</span></div></div>",

When I moved to take the sheets off, I immediately noticed my skin was still blue \u2013 not only that, but my hands only had 4 fingers on them.  <i>That stupid cure didn\u2019t even work!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out of bed, I ran over to a nearby mirror and my jaw dropped.  The reflection looking back at me wasn\u2019t the one I\u2019d seen this morning.  To my utter shock, I was now completely Maltorian; down to the 4 fingers, 4 toes and the dark blue eyes of the species.  <i>What is going on here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, confused as to what was going on, I spotted a jumpsuit similar to the one I\u2019d worn this morning.  After getting dressed, I decided my next step was to make my way home.  I slowly opened the door and peaked out into the hall; noticing everyone was running around in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out of the room and started towards the exit; hoping that no one would stop me.  Thankfully I made it to the exit without a problem, as everyone was in a panic.  I made my way through the crowds to the transport hub; only then did I realize I didn\u2019t have my transit pass.  I wouldn\u2019t be let on the transport without the pass, but I also needed to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted a Maltorian family getting on the transport so I decided to sneak on with them; hoping the guards would think I was with them.  As the transport started moving towards home, I heard an announcement over the intercom.  \u201cA mandatory curfew will go into effect in 25 minutes; please return to your homes immediately.  Anyone caught in the public areas after curfew will be punished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that announcement made me wonder what was going on.  I\u2019d never heard of anything like this happening before.  Thankfully the transport arrived at the station without incident.  After getting off, I saw I only had 20 minutes left to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran through the central area to the passage that led to my family\u2019s quarters.  On the way, I saw some humans harassing a Maltorian woman; but didn\u2019t stop to see why.  Once I got to my family\u2019s quarters, I started knocking frantically on the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, open up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the door opened and I saw Mom standing there.  She looked down at me with a confused look on her face.  \u201cCan I help you, little one?  Are you lost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to respond when I saw something that shocked me more than when I found out I was becoming a Maltorian.  Behind Mom, walking out of my bedroom, I caught a glimpse of...myself.</span></div></div>",

As we waited in line, clearly getting annoyed at this point, Mom looked at me and said, \u201cSweetie, I understand you\u2019re confused; but I\u2019m you\u2019re your mother.\u201d Kneeling down to my level, she said, \u201cThat little girl you saw back there?

Why wouldn\u2019t she even entertain the idea that I was telling the truth?   Before I could try again to convince her, I was interrupted by the sound of someone talking in front of me.  \u201cPlease sir, you have to let me on the transport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up to find a woman in her late 20s standing in front of a guard.  She looked to be in a panic about something.  Looking at her, the guard said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, but traffic to the Central Hub from this station is limited to Maltorians only.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d digging through her bag, coming out with an ID card, she said, \u201cMy wife is Maltorian; please, I have to get home to her and my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the guard communicated with someone over the radio, my mom went up to the woman and said, \u201cExcuse me, did you say your wife is Maltorian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d turning around, the woman said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you disapprove of inter-species marriages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not; my best friend is married to a Maltorian.\u201d Gesturing to me, Mom said, \u201cThis little girl needs to get home to her family.  Could she ride the transport with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I guess that\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Looking at me, the woman said, \u201cWell, little one, what do you say we find your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to shake my head profusely; saying, \u201cNo, please, I don\u2019t want to go!  I belong here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at Mom, who simply said, \u201cI think she\u2019s confused; she believes my husband and I are her parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are!\u201d looking at Mom, tears streaming down my face, I said, \u201cMommy, please believe me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then an announcement came over the intercom.  \u201cLockdown will commence in 10 minutes; please return to your respective colonies at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s our cue.\u201d Grabbing my hand, the woman turned to my Mom said, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets home safe and sound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d With a smile, Mom looked at me and said, \u201cStay safe little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only watch, helpless to do anything, as Mom walked away.

I sat silently by a window; fixated on my reflection and how much it had changed.  I used to have my Daddy\u2019s hair and my mommy\u2019s eyes, but that wasn\u2019t the case anymore.  That was enough to bring a tear to my eyes, which caught the attention of the woman watching over me.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cAre you okay, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Looking at her, struggling not to cry, I said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m never going to see my parents again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that; once we get off the transport, I\u2019ll help you find your parents.\u201d Taking my hand in hers, she said, \u201cWho knows, they could be waiting for you at the station.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to explain that she didn\u2019t understand what was going on; but in reality, I didn\u2019t fully understand it either.  Would anyone believe me if I told them I was supposed to be a human girl?  Realizing I should say something, I sighed and said, \u201cI hope they\u2019re there waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us were silent for a few moments until the woman said. \u201cYou look to be around my son\u2019s age.\u201d With a smile, she said, <br>\r\n\u201cHow about, once we find your parents, we arrange a play date or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIs your son Maltorian...like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s human like me.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI just realized I never introduced myself; my name is Liz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that; Liz would probably be confused about why a Maltorian girl has a Human name.  Thankfully an announcement came over the intercom before I could answer; announcing that the transport was arriving at the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz was the only person I knew right now, I quickly grabbed her hand and followed her off the transport.  Before we even got 10 feet, I heard a woman\u2019s voice call out, \u201cLiz, honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us turned in the direction the voice came from; I noticed a Maltorian woman walking towards us with a young Human boy.  I quickly figured the boy was Liz\u2019s son; and she was right, he did look about my age.  I watched as Liz and the woman shared a kiss; before the woman turned noticed me standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the quizzical look on her face, Liz said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Sorain, this isn\u2019t another mouth to feed.\u201d Sighing, Liz said, \u201cShe was lost over in the Human Colony, I told the woman who found her that I\u2019d make sure she got back to her family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was worried there for a second.\u201d Chuckling, Sorain said, \u201cWith the lockdown, I\u2019m concerned we don\u2019t have enough food for the three of us; let alone another child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how enthusiastic you are about us having another kid.\u201d Sighing, Liz turned to me and said, \u201cSweetie, this is my wife Sorain and our son David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorain and I exchanged some quick pleasantries before I turned my attention to David.  He looked to be about my height, maybe a little taller; with red hair and some freckles.  He kind of reminded me of Marcus.  Looking at him, I smiled and said, \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d Smiling back, David said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted by someone yelling out, \u201cMatura Telfani!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around, thinking someone was looking for their child, only to spot _____ walking towards me.</span></div></div>",

Looking at her, shaking my head, I said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatura, little one, we\u2019re your parents.\u201d Gesturing to the man behind her, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom the sound of it, she got herself lost in the Human Colony.\u201d Pausing, Liz said, \u201cApparently she went to someone\u2019s quarters; insisting that she was their daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid confusion is a common side effect with Phiemu fever; the humans should be glad they\u2019re immune to the illness.\u201d Sighing, the woman stood up and said, \u201cHer sister found her sweating profusely in bed last night, so we rushed her to the Med Bay.  The doctors were supposed to keep an eye on her, but with everything that\u2019s happened; she was probably able to sneak out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the third time I\u2019d heard someone mention something happening; I\u2019d been too caught with my situation to figure out what it was.  The woman reached out to take my hand, but I stepped away and looked up at Liz.  \u201cPlease don\u2019t let them take me; they\u2019re not my parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment I thought I saw a glimpse of understanding in Liz\u2019s eyes, but it quickly disappeared.  \u201cThat\u2019s enough Matura, your father and I have had enough of your games.\u201d Forcibly grabbing my hand, the woman said, \u201cLet this woman go home to her family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman started pulling me away, Liz looked at me and said, \u201cBye Matura, it was nice meeting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to free myself from the woman\u2019s grip as they led me from the station, but it was useless.  As we walked through the main plaza, I decided my best course of action was to throw a tantrum.  \u201cHelp!  I\u2019m being kidnapped; these aren\u2019t my parents!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, no one really paid attention; as the man and woman pulled me into a passageway.  Reaching into his pocket, the man retrieved a needle.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cI was hoping this wouldn\u2019t be necessary, but I\u2019m afraid you leave me no choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to run but the woman had a grip on both my arms.

As I sat up in bed, the first thought that entered my mind was \u2013 how am I going to get back home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly looked around the room and saw another bed; with an assortment of toys strewn about the room.  Wherever I was, this was definitely meant for children.  Suddenly the door opened and I turned to see a young Maltorian girl, perhaps a few years older than me, walk into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reflexively squeezed myself into a corner and tried to cover myself with the covers; which caused the girl to stop and look back at my kidnappers standing in the doorway.  The man simply gestured for the girl to go forward, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s alright Tala, go introduce yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, Tala, slowly walked forward until she was standing right at the foot of the bed.  Looking at me, anxiety apparent on her face, she said, \u201cHi, I-I\u2019m your sister Tala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a sister; I have a little brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I said that, Tala started to tear up a little; which caused the woman to walk into the room.  Tala wrapped herself around the woman, as she looked at me.  \u201cMatura, sweetie, the sooner you accept that we\u2019re your family the better off you\u2019ll be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t my family!\u201d getting defiant, I said, \u201cI want to go home to my real family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wrapped around the woman, Tala looked up and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Matura, Mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, sweetie; each conversion is different.\u201d Looking for Tala to me, the woman said, \u201cYour sister is just more strong-willed than we were led to believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind them, the man said, \u201cEither that or they picked the wrong child to convert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, Jervix.\u201d Glancing back at the man, the woman said, \u201cWe just have to give her space; I\u2019m certain she\u2019ll come around in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tala left the room with her parents; leaving me alone with my thoughts.  Once the door was closed, I brought a hand to my mouth to keep from screaming.  Whatever this conversion was, it was probably the reason why I was a Maltorian now. I don\u2019t know what scared me more; the fact that this was intentional, or that I was specifically chosen.</span></div></div>",

I felt terrible when I saw Tala start tearing up.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset you, Tala; but I\u2019m not your sister.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even born like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was something I didn\u2019t expect.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t born this way either; the Maltorians kidnapped me a few years ago and made me one of them.\u201d  Looking at me, taking a deep breath, Tala said, \u201cOne minute I\u2019m in the Central Plaza with my Mom; the next thing I know, I wake up and find out they\u2019ve turned me into a Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you ever try to get back to your family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to get back to them once; only...they were dead.\u201d Tears in her eyes, Tala said, \u201cThey were killed, along with 14 others, when part of the passageway they were in decompressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a vague memory of that incident; it had happened a few months after Eric was born when a micro-meteorite pierced the tunnel.  Suddenly realizing my problem wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as Tala\u2019s problem, I embraced her and said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTala held me close for a few moments as she cried.  Once she was finished, she wiped her eyes and said, \u201cI hate to say this, but I\u2019m kind of glad to have someone else who knows what I\u2019m going through.  All my Maltorian friends think I was born like this, and I can\u2019t tell my human friends because they think I\u2019m dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled a little bit; for I was also glad to have someone in my situation.  \u201cDo you know why they\u2019re changing human children in Maltorians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea; but whatever it is, it seems they need kids like us to do it.\u201d  Pausing, Tala said, \u201cI have a feeling that clones were behind the attack on the Launch Zone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat attack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know about the attack?\u201d shocked, Tala said, \u201cOne of the resupply ships heading to Earth exploded; killed 30 people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, it made sense that the entire colony was put on lockdown.  Unfortunately for me, that was going to make it difficult for me to get back to my family.  It was at that moment that the door opened again and Kalura walked stepped into the room.  \u201cI'm glad to see my girls are getting to know each other.\" with a smile, she said, \"Dinner will be ready in a few minutes; why don't you girls get washed up.\"</span></div></div>",

I looked at Tala, sitting on the toilet, as I dried my hands.  \u201cWhat does Maltorian food taste like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; the food is actually pretty good.\u201d Standing up, Tala said, \u201cI have to ask; have you ever noticed that you never see Maltorians eating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d always wondered why Dhelo and my other Maltorian classmates ate in a different room for lunch.  Looking at Tala, I said, \u201cI never really thought about it, but you\u2019re right.  Why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of respect for the humans.\u201d Moving to unzip her jumper, Tala said, \u201cMaltorians don\u2019t wear any clothes when we eat.\u201d<br>\r\nI instinctively went to cover myself; even though I was still fully clothed.  \u201cNothing at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even underwear.\u201d Pulling the jumper down from her shoulders, Tala said, \u201cI thought I\u2019d better tell you before we left the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized I had no way out of this; so I reluctantly took my clothes off as well.  Once the two of us were completely naked, we walked out of the bathroom and joined Kalura and Jervix at the table.  \u201cGood Tala, you told your little sister about our custom.\u201d Looking at me, Kalura said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Matura, you\u2019ll soon grow accustomed to our ways.  Given time you\u2019ll even forget ever doing it anyway but ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently took a seat at the table next to Tala; as Kalura said some words in Maltorian.  Once she was finished, Jervix gave us permission to start eating.  I kept my eyes on my plate at first; not wanting to see anyone, myself included, naked.  But as dinner continued, I found myself gazing around the table.  Kalura was right, I was getting used to it.</span></div></div>",

Some of them were kind of fun, though. The Maltorian dolls were a lot like my Barbies. I had a bunch of them sitting around and drinking nekta juice, and Kalura smiled and nodded. For a moment, I almost forgot that I was her prisoner, along with Tala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of playing, Kalura said it was time to get ready for bed. My nightgown was a lot like the one I used to wear. The stuffed animal was weird, though: Instead of a teddy bear, it was something with tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I had time to get ready for bed, Kalura came into the room I shared with Tala and tucked me in. \"I know this must all be scary for you, Matura,\" she said, \"but you don't have anything to worry about.

Why did the procedure work so well with Melissa, but not with Duncan and me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held out hope that perhaps there was still some of Melissa in there, but I wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it.  All I knew for sure was that Duncan and I had to make sure no one discovered we still had memories from our previous lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting in one of the chairs, looking at my hands, when the door opened.  I looked up and saw my mom standing there; or at least Matura\u2019s mom.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel conflicted; I had memories that told me she wasn\u2019t my mom, but I also had memories that told me she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the room, she looked at me and said, \u201cHi, little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not sure what made me do it, but I jumped off the chair and ran over to hug her.  \u201cHi Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting down on one knee, Mom said, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling better.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cChrestus protected me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew that she would.\u201d Standing up, Mom said, \u201cLets go home, little one; your father and sister are waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us walked out of the room, I had a craving for a jumja stick; a sweet-tasting snack that Maltorians loved.

As we made our way through the crowds, I was still trying to process everything that was going on.  The woman next to me <i>was</i> my mother; but at the same time, she wasn\u2019t.  It was confusing having two distinct sets of memories in my head.  <i>I wonder if Duncan is having the same problem.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered growing up as Olivia Sheppard; while, at the same time, I also remembered growing up as Matura Telfani.  Olivia wanted to be a doctor when she grew up, while Matura wanted to be an engineer.  It was going to take time but, eventually, I knew I\u2019d get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we waited in line to go through security, Mom looked down at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m relieved that you were able to pull through little one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Mommy.\u201d Taking a bite of the jumja stick, I said, \u201cI never lost faith that Chrestus would protect me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrestus always protects those who believe in her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough it was our turn to go through security; Mom and I showed our ID cards to the Human guard standing at the gate.  Once we were waved through, Mom and I made our way to the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe barely made it 10 feet before everything went crazy.  The entire area was suddenly overwhelmed with the sound of alarms blaring.  I could barely hear over the alarms, but I thought I heard something about an explosion at the launch site.  I instinctively clung to Mom as everyone around us started to panic.  Looking at Mom, I said, \u201cMommy, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I wondered where we were going until a saw a sign that said \u2013 <b>Maltorian Colony Transport</b>.  Mom quickly showed our IDs to a guard who stepped aside to let us down the escalator.  We were about \u00bc of the way down when I heard a woman\u2019s voice at the top.  \u201cPlease, you have let us through; my wife is Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over Mom\u2019s shoulder and saw a Human woman, with a young boy about my age, standing in front of the guard.  For a moment I thought they weren\u2019t going to get through until the guard finally stepped aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached the bottom of the escalator, I saw dozens of Maltorians clamoring to get aboard the transport.  \u201cMommy, are we going to make it aboard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we will, little one; don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Mom was right; we were one of the last people aboard the transport.  The doors were about to close when the woman from earlier pushed herself and the boy inside.  As the doors closed, I heard the boy say, \u201cMommy, I\u2019m scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright, sweetie; mommy will be waiting for us at the other end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I had overheard the discussion earlier, Mom hadn\u2019t.  Her curiosity peaked, she turned to the woman and said, \u201cForgive me for asking, but why did they allow humans on this transport?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the fact that my wife is Maltorian, I doubt they would have.\u201d Holding her son close, the woman said, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not; I was too focused on getting my little one to safety.\u201d With her free hand, Mom said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Kalura and this little one is Matura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you both; my name\u2019s Liz.\u201d Gesturing to the boy next to her, Liz said, \u201cThis is my son David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another Maltorian bumped into her, Mom said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking; don\u2019t you think you\u2019d be more comfortable in the <i>other</i> colony?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Visibly annoyed, Liz said, \u201cWho I\u2019m married to, and where I live, is none of your concern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the 10-minute ride passed in awkward silence.  The transport slowly emptied once we reached the station.  After putting me down, Mom and I started towards the station exit.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Liz approaching and then kissing a Maltorian woman.  <i>I guess that\u2019s her wife.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were out of the station, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cMommy, why did that woman get upset with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was all a misunderstanding, little one.\u201d Bending down to my level, Mom said, \u201cTensions between our two species tend to rise in situations like this.  I meant no disrespect to that woman, I just thought perhaps she\u2019d be safer with other humans.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once Asura and I were undressed, we walked out to the table and took our seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mom walked out holding a steaming pot in her hands, I thought back to what Asura said and wondered if Mom had been against the kidnapping.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After dinner was over I joined Asura and Mommy as we watched some old Earth movies.  We were currently watching a movie called <i>Monster\u2019s Inc</i>; a movie that Olivia remembered watching, but that Matura had never seen before.  It was weird to watch a movie that I\u2019d seen but also, at the same time, never saw before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsura and Mommy seemed to be enjoying the movie; although they both thought the concept of monsters was primitive.  Once the movie ended, Mommy turned to us and said, \u201cOkay little ones, it\u2019s time for bed; you both have school in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsura and I both groaned in annoyance, but obliged and headed towards our room.  I stopped halfway there when I heard a ringing noise coming from the communications system.  I turned around to see Mommy answering the call; a smile crept across my face when I saw Daddy on the other end.  \u201cHello Jervix, I trust you\u2019ll be coming home soon?\u201d pausing, Mom looked at the screen and said, \u201cYour children miss you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could come home, Kalura; but, as the human\u2019s say, it\u2019s a madhouse around here.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cThe Chancellor wants to break off contact with the humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d concerned, Mom said, \u201cAll this because of an accident at the launch site?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accident, my love; investigators discovered evidence of explosives at the site.\u201d Pausing, Dad said, \u201cThe consensus on the council is that this was a deliberate attack by the humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know our two species haven\u2019t seen eye to eye, but that launch site is the key to repairing Earth.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe the humans would be so willing to risk the recovery effort failing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let my curiosity get the better of me at that point; as I crept closer to the monitor.  I watched from behind the table, out of sight, as Dad said, \u201cThe humans are a primitive race, Kalura; it\u2019s nearly impossible to understand their thought processes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the Chancellor decides to end relations with the Humans, I trust he\u2019ll make a public announcement?\u201d leaning against the table, Mom said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be wise to do so without warning; otherwise people will become trapped on the wrong side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be up to him, my wife.\u201d Taking a breath, Dad said, \u201cHow did it go with Matura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything went fine; Dr. T\u2019Mera said there were no issues with the memory implantation.\u201d A hint of sadness in her voice, Mom said, \u201cI just hope it was worth it; killing an innocent girl to get our daughter back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought a hand to my mouth to stifle my gasp; Asura was right, Mom had been against kidnapping Olivia.  I stared at the screen as Dad said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this, Kalura; thanks to the clone, the humans will never know what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll know, Jervix.\u201d Choking up, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m a mother; how can I live with myself, knowing what I did to get my little girl back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell Dad was getting frustrated.  \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this when I return, Kalura; in the meantime, you must ensure that our children never find out what we did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ended the call after that; before walking into the kitchen, while I stood there in shock.  After a moment I quickly ran across the room to my bedroom and closed the door; just as Mom stepped out of the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Climbing out of bed, I walked out of the bedroom to use the bathroom.  Before I could even make it 5 feet, I saw Dad step out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Matura.\u201d Walking over to me, Dad said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how happy I am to see you back on your feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope it was worth kidnapping an innocent girl.</i>  \u201cI\u2019m happy too, Daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother is giving your sister a bath; why don\u2019t you go join them.\u201d Kissing my forehead, Dad said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you get back from school, little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Dad, I walked into the bathroom to find Asura sitting in the bathtub while Mom was washing her.  One of the many things I\u2019ll miss about being human is having hair; mostly because Olivia had her mommy\u2019s hair but also because she liked it when Mommy washed her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Matura, you want to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 20 minutes before Mommy had finished washing the two of us.

I experienced flashes of memories as time went on; playing with Marcus and Dhelo, meeting Eric right after he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter how hard I tried, I could feel myself slowly giving in. <i>My name is\u2026is Olivia Sheppard; my...parents are Kevin...and Kalura Telfani. Wait, that\u2019s not right.</i> It was getting harder and harder for me to hold onto my memories; as they were slowly replaced with new ones.<i> My brother\u2019s...name is Eric. No, that\u2019s wrong; I don\u2019t have a brother. My older sister is Asura.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much I struggled, I was facing a losing battle. Eventually, I would have to give in; my life as a human would be gone forever. <i>I\u2019m a Maltorian, not a human.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everything went dark, and I felt an overwhelming feeling of contentment wash over me. I was going home to my mommy and daddy; I\u2019d get to play with my big sister again. As the last of my human memories vanished, I said to myself, <i>Goodbye Olivia.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, a short time later, I discovered that I was in the Med Bay.  I remembered being brought here for respiratory distress; my sister Asura was scared that I wouldn\u2019t make it.  <i>Thank Chrestus I\u2019m alive.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sensed movement beside me; turning, I saw my mommy and daddy standing there; relieved looks on their faces.  Bringing a hand to her mouth, Mommy said, \u201cMatura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big smile appeared on my face, as I said, \u201cHi Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank Chrestus you\u2019re alright, little one.\u201d Running over, Mommy kissed me and said, \u201cWe were so worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in a coma for three days, little one.\u201d Looking at me, Daddy said, \u201cThere were times we didn\u2019t think you\u2019d make it, but you pulled through.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, I said, \u201cDoes that mean I can go home now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, little one; your sister will happy to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the Med Bay with my parents a short time later; as we went to catch a transport back to the Maltorian colony.

Whatever happened to me after this, my family would still be there.  There was, however, something I wanted to check out.  <br>\r\n\u201cMommy. Daddy. Can I have some privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad left the room with Dr. D\u2019Pkeni.  Once I was alone, I removed my covers to find my feet were as blue as my hands.  As I climbed out of bed, I noticed that the little finger on each hand was curled up and I couldn\u2019t straighten them out. I knew Maltorians only had four fingers on their hands, so I figured I would lose those soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a mirror I saw my forearms and lower legs were blue; while my upper arms and thighs were slowly changing.  <br>\r\nThankfully Maltorians were roughly the same size as humans, so I knew that wouldn\u2019t change; while the shape of my head wouldn\u2019t change until I was older.  I was going to be different from my family, but maybe not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned to go back to bed, I saw some of my hair lying on the pillow.  While hybrids like Kevin generally kept their hair, full-blood Maltorians were bald.  So it wasn\u2019t surprising to find that I was losing my hair; just like I was losing two of my fingers and two of my toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing back into bed, I remembered Dr. D\u2019Pkeni saying that I\u2019d been exposed to whatever changed me.  As I lay in bed, I remembered the two Maltorians following me this morning.  <i>Where they responsible for this?</i> I wondered.  <i>Why did they do it? And why did they pick me?</i></span></div></div>",

I explained to her what happened, but I don\u2019t know if she told Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope he still wants to be friends with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transport started moving, Mommy said, \u201cI\u2019m sure he will; especially since you were so kind to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was uneventful, although Mommy and I did get quite a few curious looks \u2013 no doubt wondering why I was with a human woman.  Once we got off the transport, we walked through the plaza to the elevator; riding it up 3 floors to our level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we rounded the corner by our quarters, I saw Kevin and his mommy standing outside the door.  She saw me almost immediately, but Kevin was fixated on his tablet.  I cautiously walked up to him and said, \u201cHi Kevin.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I made your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. Mom and Dad weren't great shakes at much of Maltorian culture, but Mom's Maltorian cooking brought praise even from my Maltorian friends. I took off the dress I was wearing, then joined the family at the table. I offered prayers to Chrestus, and then the meal began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, it was usually Eric's and my job to do the dishes. Today, though, Dad decided to join me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we washed, it became clear why. \"Ol- Matura, sorry - about your name,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matura is a prophetess, Daddy,\" I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" he replied. \"It's just that... What was wrong with Olivia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Olivia is a nice human name. But I'm not a human, and I haven't been for eight years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ashamed of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to him, unsure if I had heard him correctly. \"What have I done to suggest such a thing? Tell me, so I can correct it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your name,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understood now. \"My name is Matura Sheppard, Daddy. My first name tells everyone who I am, and my last name tells them where I came from. I am not an Olivia, Daddy, but I will always be a Sheppard. I know that Chrestus smiles upon this home, and I would never dishonor her or you by wishing for another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad wiped tears from his eyes. \"That's all I needed to hear. And know that Chrestus smiles on you, too. Your mother and I gave you the other name, and perhaps we were foolishly bound to it. We have always said that we love you, no matter what. I apologize for suggesting that might not be the case.\"</span></div></div>",

Pulling me aside, she said, \u201cJudging by that smile, I suspect you\u2019ve made your decision?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a Maltorian female reaches her 13th birthday, she\u2019s allowed to give herself physically to a person of her choosing.  My parents weren\u2019t too keen about that idea; especially after Sorain mentioned it involved sex.  But once they realized that it was part of my culture, they relented and gave their consent.  \u201cI spent days praying to Chrestus for her guidance.\u201d  Turning my attention back to Dhelo, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided that Kevin is the one I want to be with; if he\u2019ll have me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious what that answer is going to be.\u201d Chuckling, Dhelo said, \u201cHe\u2019s been following you around for weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDhelo and I were still talking when Mom came over to us; carrying two glasses of nekta juice.  \u201cMatura, sweetheart, don\u2019t forget you have other guests here as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mother.\u201d Taking one of the glasses, I said, \u201cDhelo and I were just discussing my plans for this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t discuss that in public.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m aware that it is part of your culture, but I\u2019m afraid the parents of your human classmates might not understand it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault your species has such primitive hang-ups when it comes to sexuality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it...you know what, I\u2019m not going to get into another argument with you about this.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Mom said, \u201cJust enjoy your party, then you can spend the evening doing whatever you want with Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you keep it down, Mother!\u201d gritting my teeth, I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t discussed it with him yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you may want to before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Pointing behind me, Mom said, \u201cHe seems to be having a nice conversation with your friend Madison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I saw Kevin talking with Madison Decker; a girl from my lacrosse team.  We were on friendly terms, but the two of us tended to be competitive with each other.  I already lost out on being Team Captain; I wasn\u2019t going to let her take Kevin from me.  Handing my drink to Dhelo, I took a deep breath and walked over to them.  \u201cSorry to interrupt; but Kevin, could I talk to you for a moment?  In private?</span></div></div>",

After all, if I were still human then my family and I wouldn\u2019t have tried so hard to understand Maltorian culture.  Clasping hands and touching foreheads again, the two of us rejoined the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited an appropriate length of time before telling Dhelo; but decided to let Madison figure it out for herself.

If you are, say it to my face, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not accusing you,\" he said. It's just... You've been acting strange. You're not the Olivia I knew anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that I was changed into a Maltorian, myself. I am proud of who and what I am now. But do you really believe that I would force another to do what I have done? Such a thing goes against everything in the <i>Xrex'yrd</i>, Marcus. It would dishonor me in Chrestus's eyes. Do you really think that of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered his head. \"I... guess I don't sound like much of a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there is hope, Marcus: You came to me with your concerns. You didn't just assume you knew everything and join those who said those horrible things.\" I took a deep breath. \"If what happened to those kids was deliberate, then maybe what happened to me was deliberate, too. Maybe <i>I</i> was a victim. But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus shrugged. \"Maybe they want humans to become Maltorians. Maybe they think it will accomplish something, like those people who blew up buildings back on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Whoever is responsible has struck against the Maltorians as much as the humans, even if they don't realize it. They must be stopped.\" I turned to Marcus. \"And I think it will take the human and Maltorian governments working together to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human government may not want to work with the Maltorians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how can we show them that they must?\"</span></div></div>",

This, he said, was because a busy person wants things done right, while the person who talks about being busy would rather do nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich type of person was the mayor?

We each had a tutor at our side, walking us through our classes but there was little interaction permitted. In fact, each teacher wore a medical mask and gloves to prevent the spreading of germs. All precautions including social distancing was ordered  to keep the next generation safe from illness. We were all told that we were humanity's hope to carry on. No pressure there, right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are excel in all subjects, Olivia.\" Smiling, my teacher, Mrs. Jones said. \"You have finished today's lessons early so you are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that and gladly left my desk, thoroughly washing my hands before leaving the small school building. As I walked to the trans pick up to return to the transport station in the Central Hub, I noticed two blurry men watching me from a distance. They were both Maltorian and not a friendly looking pair. I picked up the pace, hoping the human only trans would be there when I arrived. It did not help my nerves to know that they had started to follow me. <i>\"What did I do to get their interest?\"</i> Worried, I thought. <i>\"I'm just going home.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved even faster and arrived at the trans pick up just as it had arrived. i almost literally jumped on and showed the driver my DNA ID, proving I was true blood human. The driver nodded and motioned me to take a seat. I did so and looked out the window to the frowning faces of the two Maltorian men. One took up a small radio device as the trans moved away from the school. \"Those blasted Maltorian security goons seem to be everywhere these days.\" Grumbling, the driver said. \"Any idea why they were interested in you, lass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Not a clue.\" Honestly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your senses sharp, lass.\" Frowning, the driver said. \"There is too few of us to have your youngins disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then turned to the window at the passing scenery. There was not much to see as we were in a colony on the moon but it was something to look at. Just as boredom was about to set in, a second trans going the other way stopped as mine did only a few feet away. I looked over and nearly screamed. Staring right back at me, in complete disbelief was a little girl who looked exactly like me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, we just stared at each other as if looking at a reflection until the two trans continued on their way...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I sat up, feeling dizzy, due to whatever had hit me and took a careful look around. Behind me was a large window, over looking a small but inviting court yard. To my left was a sizable mirror, taking up almost a quarter of the wall. On the right was a door, leading to a tiny wash room. Across the room from me was a closed door, I guessed was the only way out. My memories of what had happened the night before were still fresh in my mind but, for some unknown reason, I was strangely unafraid, merely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crawled out of the bed and discovered that I was now wearing a fashionable pair of blue pajamas.

Of course, the door was locked. But, still in a daze, I was not detoured and pulled onto the door knob harder. The lock broke with a low crunch and the door handle ripped off in my hand as the door slowly drifted open in front of me. I looked at the handle, slightly surprised, then lightly dropped it to the floor as I then cautiously walked out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe- Hello?\u201d Politely, I called. \u201cI- I\u2019m sorry about the door. Hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around as no one answered and began to slowly wander the halls, curiously taking yin my new environment, uncertain, but not afraid. \u201cHello? Is anyone here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My but you are a strong girl.\" Startling me, a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spun around to find a well dressed, tall and attractive young woman, standing in the hall.

In our quest for power we brought upon our own last hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom says that a lot...\" Tearing up, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ancestors were conquerors, much like my ancestors, only we each made a fatal mistake... one that is slowly killing us all.\" Cryptically, Elder said. \"You and your mother are the last living descendants who have the power to change everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Shaking my head, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder giggled. \"You remember the story of Adam and Eve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Mom told me they were the first man and woman on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder nodded. \"You are the new Eve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I have to find and 'Adam'?\" Making a face, I asked. Elder nodded. \"Ewww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder smiled, bemused. \"Not now... but eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened and in walked...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Even so young, I know that there is no chance of getting out, at least not like this. The place is swarming with guards, security cameras, and protected from the outside lunar environment. Trapped in an inescapable fortress containing the precious oxygen that I needed to even survive out in space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist spent the rest of the day after my attempted escape trying to win me over with new dolls and sweet treats. She scanned her card and brought me into an area with vending panels and the loud buzz of a long refrigerator. <br>\r\nShe explained that sometimes little boys and girls got sick and had to be taken somewhere special where they couldn't hurt others. Like their friends from school and their moms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would I feel, Dr. Dorsey asked me, if I gave someone the bad cold and they went away forever? When I ask her why no one here is worried about getting sick, she has a response for that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you're here Olivia. We're making the medicine to make everyone better and we really need your help.\" The scientist pushed the ice cream towards me again. \"You need your strength but it doesn't hurt if you have some joy out of being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up the spoon and dug into a scoop of vanilla. If my family was okay with me being here and they knew I was safe, I had to help out the scientists, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl. Now you finish that up and Mr. Olly will bring you to my lab.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDr. Dorsey nodded to the head of security for the floor. He was a large men with a headset over his face where he could watch all of the activity at the facility and the public cameras back at the Hub. Holographic lines of DNA ID sequences zipped past his view. \"Got it boss,\" he answered dismissively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was very focused on all the activity flashing through his eyes and brain. When he finally paid attention to me, he raised his voice and sneered. <br>\r\n\"C'mon kid, I don't have all day.

He grumbled to whoever was on the other end of his headset about having to cater to a \"bratty kid\" and play babysitter. I pretended not to be eavesdropping. Although Dr. Dorsey had insisted that I could have whatever I wanted and I was using that to my advantage, I didn't want to anger the Head of Security too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was definitely a human. There was no doubt about that. He lacked the slightly off physiology and prowess of the Maltorian who ran the lab. With this partnership, it was not uncommon for some humans to do whatever undesired jobs the others had no time or want to do. That's how you had someone like Mr. Olly, an imposing detail-oriented man who watched over and in return, the Maltorian high command provided his family with resources. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now however, he was stuck scraping ice to dump into my water. \"More please.\" I told him when he showed me the glass. When he was about to say something else to me, I brought up Dr. Dorsey again and that she had wanted me to be as comfortable as possible. Mr. Olly shook his head, mumbling, and lifted up the long refrigeration unit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater was one of the most precious resources anywhere, especially here on the Moon. It was one of the few things that the Maltorians hadn't been able to maximize the production of. Instead, they relied on units that connected to an underground reservoir that pumped clean, ice-cold water back up through the refrigeration unit. When his shoulder lifting up the heavy lid, Mr. Olly was trying to multitask by keeping his eye on the security video streams. That was when I saw my chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up the DNA ID that he had left on the table. Without second guessing it, I threw it and watched as it flew through the air and landed inside the refrigeration unit. Mr. Olly immediately started cursing as he now had to dig through the ice. \"You little brat, we are going right to Doc after this..\" He grumbled and complained about his hands feeling raw and cold from picking through the ice. But right when it seemed like he had found the ID, I was ready to make my first move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad about it for a second. Mr. Olly couldn't see me hop down from my chair and crawl towards the unit until I reached the panel on the side. The Maltorians had no sense of occupational safety like humans did. Their devices were functional and the best at it with no regard for safety as long as they were efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad for about a second before I mashed my hand against the panel. Then again, these people had kidnapped me and Mr. Olly was part of it, a bully who did whatever they told him to even if it meant hurting or intimidating a kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unit began to buzz loudly. <b>\"What the h-?\"</b> Mr. Olly yelled. His hand was still in the device when the whole machine began to pressurize. Before he could lift himself out, the force brought the lid down on his head and his body collapsed right into the machine. With a loud snap, the unit closed and began to whir as the temperature inside dropped to below subzero degrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I back away from the machine, I nearly step on Mr. Olly's headset. I am shocked at myself for what I did.. there was no way I wouldn't be in trouble now. I had ki... I couldn't even say it in my own head. When I put the large headset on my face, the base and all of its labs were now in my open sight. I could see everything and everyone - and I still had no time since no one had been alerted to the commotion I had just caused.</span></div></div>",

I'm not as familiar with the Maltorian-specific devices and the menu options are blinking in their strange language. \"Hello?\" I call out into the receiver. I'm trying not to look at the refrigerator. It hasn't yet hit me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead I back away and begin to exit the room when suddenly the door opens again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia honey, we're still waiting for you.\" Dr. Dorsey comes inside with a trio of guards that now block my way out. Before I can try to explain, one of the guards gasps. He nudges Dr. Dorsey to catch her attention but she is already aware. Out of all the reactions, I do not expect it when she chuckles and shakes her head as if I just knocked over a vase. She walks up to Mr. Olly's frost-ridden hand, which sticks out of the refrigerator, and slams the lid back down. With a crunch, the hand disappears and I hear the unit whirring, still functioning with the body crammed inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame about that,\" Dr. Dorsey says. \"He was good at his job. Never late. Never questioned anything. We'll just have to hope the next one is just as dedicated, right?\" She smiles at me. I am not sure what to say back since she is being so pleasant about everything, not unlike the trio of guards who glare and whisper to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we really must get going.\" The scientist continues. \"Unless you plan on disposing of more staff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently, I follow Dr. Dorsey out of the room with the guards flanking me on each side. I am more confused than ever as to what is going on in these labs but if I want answers (and a possible way out), I'll have to play along with whatever is happening. Walking around with them, I realize that the facility is a lot larger than I had noticed before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many other rooms and labs connected to the main hallway, as well as what looks like a greenhouse and recreational area like the gymnasium at school.

When the two men come into the room, at first they're confused. There is no sign of a young girl and there is no sign of Mr. Olly. The pick that he had been using to carve up the ice laid in a melted puddle and the ice cream sundae was untouched on the table. Finally one of them realizes that the refrigerator is making a concerning sound. Rumbling and quaking as if something has been jammed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards struggled to lift up the lid, mumbling about the overly complicated set-up of Maltorian technology and how their lives completely depend on it now. Then when they realize what has happened, they begin to dry heave for a couple of seconds before running out and shouting into their communication wristbands. I am completely out of sight, of course- watching the gruesome scene from up above in the vents, where I have beat my own record for holding my breath and staying motionless in place. When they are gone, I finally take another breath. It wasn't hard for me, being small, to find the right spot in the wall where I could squeeze through the vents. Even if they thought of sending someone through, it would be impossible for any adult to come crawling in without the possibility of suffocating in the tight space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headset around my face is frenetic with activity and I can see it all. The heat signatures of the scrambling guards, the scientists in their lab (one of which is Dr. Dorsey) and other beings too distant to identify. It wasn't hard to disable the outgoing and incoming signals on the device which leaves me as a ghost on the network. We learned how to use most of the common Maltorian equipment at school, and us kids just had a natural ease with learning the tech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard an alarm go off somewhere and I knew it was going to get even more crazy. The search would escalate and I couldn't just hide forever in this same spot in the vents. Was there anyone here who wasn't part of this mysterious project to experiment on colonist kids? I could play the ghost for a little longer and find some answers...</span></div></div>",

I also remember why Mom brought me here in the first place. My head is burning again, I haven't taken any medication in hours.<br>\r\nBefore I can pass out, from being exhausted, my twitching eyelids are blinded by a bright white light. It flashes once then after a few minutes, it happens again. It isn't easy but I crawl to chase it, maybe even wondering if this is the fever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I hear voices. Voices that I know! Like that awful Dr. Dorsey and the sound of strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any update?\" I can see her through the vents. The pretty scientist paces back and forth. It is still hard to believe that she is behind something terrible, she seems young like one of Mom's aunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one of the guard answers Dr. Dorsey and shakes his head, her calmness ends right away. <br>\r\n\"Get out of my sight until you find out where she is!\" She screams at the guard and tosses a clipboard at him. Humiliated, he turns around and disappears. His partner turns to also follow but Dr. Dorsey keeps him behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks to her desk, tosses a bunch of papers, and opens a drawer. The guard looks surprised when she pulls a bottle out and takes a long drink from it! She makes a happy sound and offers some to the guard but he says no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First kill, can you believe that?\" Her voice sounds like she is really sleepy. \"She took down your boss without a pause\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear this. I am just here for the job.\" The guard says in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the sickness getting to me. Every part of my body hurts! But I have my full attention on what Dr. Dorsey is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am just wondering,\" she smiles. \"If it dies, does one of the others keeps the memories of her past life? Her fears? Maybe even that moment where she faded to nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes look crazy with a madness that gives both of us the creeps. I am so thankful to be hidden out of sight from all this even as all of me is sweating and aching. My stomach growls with the feeling to vomit. I don't want to puke in this small space, this is the worst day I've ever had. Then before I can pass out, I hear the guard talk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, you need to come with me. Now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard finishes talking to someone on his headset and disconnects. He reaches out to grab Dr. Dorsey's wrist. Before he can make contact, she raises the bottle and crashes it on his head. After she crawls out from under him, she stands up and crushes his headset with her heel. I don't stay conscious for much longer after that. It becomes impossible to breath and my head feels like it splits open. My eyelids close and then there is nothing but darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">**</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the room are shiny and white. Machines make sounds all around me. When I try to get up, my arms and legs are strapped to the bed. When I open my mouth to cry out, I am silenced. A series of tubes connect at a mask that covers my face. All my struggling catches the attention of a woman dressed in white who comes to my bed and begins to fix the tubes. \"Hey now! Stop that.

It never crosses their mind and instead, Dr. Dorsey leads the guards around in a frenzied panic, checking and rechecking the same areas again. I haven't moved from my spot near the break room. Although I can move fine and freely, I just have this fear of ending up stuck nowhere with no chance of rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device pops up a green screen where I can now see general numbers to call and a field to enter someone's DNA ID. This wouldn't be much help but I happen to know one very well and that is because of the early lessons at school. If I call Mom, what could she even do to get me out of here? I see that one of the most contacted numbers in the menu is for the Lunar Community Force. The Maltorians didn't take away all of our freedom to govern myself. They knew most humans would refuse to listen if they didn't have some representation. The LCF was the community patrol of the moon and the Maltorians were the overlords. I didn't know if they could even help but from the times that one of their officers came for Career Day, they were friendly and known for occasional disobedience when it came to the colony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think about who I can send my message out to - I don't think I have much time, as dumb as everyone here is, someone will get the idea to check my space and from the words they shout, I don't expect a good ending.</span></div></div>",

This line is for emergencies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, my transmission must be clearer as well because his eyes become less angry. \"You are not.. the Head of Security.\" He says, his tone now being a lot more gentle and patient. \"Who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can now see who he is talking to.

Unlike last time, the signal comes in crystal clear without any issues. The signal meter shows that I am at maximum connectivity which my small knowledge of these devices means... I am connecting with someone nearby. Instead of the man I had spoken to before, the video shows the face of a familiar attractive woman in her late 20s, her long brown hair tied back in a ponytail, and the collar of her lab coat visible in the feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, Olivia.\" Dr. Dorsey smiles. \"You've sure caused us a lot of trouble for us but there is still a chance to save yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face goes white with terror. I desperately try to shut the device on but the video of the sinisterly smiling woman remains until I grab the headset and rip it off my face. Even without having it near me, at the loudest volume possible, I hear her yelling at me to get out of there immediately. It was all my fault for trying to get in contact again.. it made sense that a crazy scientist like Dr. Dorsey would be smart to catch on to whatever I was planning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save yourself!\" The voice crackles again through the overturned headset.

I couldn't even hear my echo inside the clear circular prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey wakey,\" Dr. Dorsey says with a smile. \"I am sorry we had to do that but you got us into some real trouble when you called Tanaka.\" I wanted to throw out every curse word I had learned at her - but it was useless. No movement, no speech.. this was definitely Maldorian technology at its worst - designed for the sole purpose of tormenting humans. \"We were able to clear up the misunderstanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still have my sight and I can see that the laboratory is massive. There's other scientists in coats checking tanks and toying with the dials on blinking panels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a clever child, you know that.

The future and survival of this colony are in your blood, Olivia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe signals one of her workers to turn a knob all the day. It is seconds later that I feel it. A surge of electricity or whatever power they use in this laboratory.. it now begins coursing through the sphere, tingling at my fingertips, and spreading throughout my body. It is a good thing I can't scream. Instead, I begin to think about what Dr. Dorsey was saying. Being different? Yeah, that is true. I don't talk like the other kids my age, I don't have anything close to the same interests as them. There is also that mysterious sickness which now seems like the least of my problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cbgreen\">Zzzzzzzzzzzzzt!</span></b> What are they doing to me?

Think back to your ancestral land, remember the moment that started that fateful chain of events...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my eyes and take a deep breath to relax myself. The egglike device that I am inside of is spinning furiously, an out of control centrifuge in which every moment begins to feel like an agonizing eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is the feeling nothingness. That too begins to feel like an eternity and with my eyes closed, I have no sense of time or awareness, even Dr. Dorsey's excited instructions echo away into the beyond. When I do open my eyes, I am free again. But the sight of what I am looking at makes me want to faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am no longer at the lab with Dr. Dorsey. Which means I am no longer imprisoned in anything but the view of tall silver skyscrapers and realizing I am in the middle of a busy street is a shock. I had only seen them in movies about Earth. Our ancestors had to deal with traffic and walking as they lived out their daily lives like tiny ants moving around their cities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Minggir!\" A person on a bicycle zips past me ringing their bell like a madman. \"Get out of the way!\" He yells as he disappears onto the crowd-filled sidewalk. I have never seen so many people together like this. Everyone just blends into each other, the young and the old, the street beggars and the men in what I learned were called suits. So this was the Earth... I look up into the skyline to admire the skyscrapers. Some are older than most of the people on the streets and I wonder if they ever think about the lives that were sacrificed to create these views. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am so overwhelmed by the noises and sights of the city that I haven't paid attention to two things. When I look down at my hands, I see that they are older and like a human man's. When I reach to touch my face, my fingers find the base of a cloth mask over my mouth. With everything I had experienced thanks to Dr. Dorsey, the mask doesn't even seem so noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is at this moment when I notice that everyone else, the thousands of people running around this city, also wear protection over their faces. What a strange time, could this have been what Dr. Dorsey had meant when she was keeping me in her lab? The chain of events. This also makes me wonder if I want to continue exploring this.. dream? Or if it is time to go home and refuse to answer whatever Dr. Dorsey and the Maldorians are trying to discover. </span></div></div>",

The syrupty cherry had already brought about an aching nausea. I dropped the spoon and coughed into my arm, struggling to eat much more of it. Any kid would've sold out their family to the Maltorians for even a scoop of ice cream. It was that hard to find and really more of a thing for the very wealthy or the brave Maltorians who kept it as a culinary curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I wanted to, I couldn't stomach another bite without wanting to throw up all over the place. The large man shook his head as if he is watching a wounded animal on a documentary. When he does this, one of his eyes doesn't move at all. Instead it wobbles without motion inside his socket. Mom had told me some veterans had glass eyeballs. Some even had legs made out of metal and plastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWars were like that, they took away life and if you survived, sometimes you lost part of your body. That was one thing I had never worried about on the Moon. The Maltorians had basically created world peace, just in a much smaller population and not quite on a world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if this man was a veteran, why was he working with the Maltorians in this creepy place? I couldn't help myself and blurted out without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you from Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped on his temple as if I had interrupted him from a call. Then without answering my question, he laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm from the same place you're from. That's why I would never eat that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Olly replied with a serious tone and before I could ask him what he had meant by any of that, his attention was back to beeping scans. I pushed the bowl away with tears swelling in my voice. I hate this, I hate these people and this place. I want to go home and see Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid, I gotta take you back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having any other choice, I left the dessert melting and went out the door with the large man. We walked down a hallway that led into Dr. Dorsey's lab. The plated door leading inside was blocked by an eye scanner and under the vigilance of four rotating cameras that extend and capture every angle of the entrance. Something about going beyond that door made me tremble. I look at Mr. Olly's face to see if he has any guilt, but he is ready to scan his retinas to gain access. As he placed the gear over his face, he paused for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old did you say you were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told him and he flinched as if he had been slapped in the face. He shook his head, mumbling under his breath. Then he stopped talking and nodded as if he was making a decision. <br>\r\n\"Before we go again, just answer me this:<br>\r\nWhat is easy to get into, but hard to get out of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot completely sure, I answer the first thing that comes to mind...</span></div></div>",

His tone was solemn and he looked back to his normal self of hiding any facial motions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never get that wrong. Have you heard that one before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. I didn't know myself why I had responded like that. The answer came to me immediately, as if it had come from a dream that I could never forget, ready for the moment to respond dutifully. Why did my whole life start to feel like that now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Olly chuckled dryly. \"I hate this, but until something extraordinary happens, we don't have much of a choice but to go with it.\" He picked up the scanner and brought it to his face. I could see him blinking briefly before the doors of the lab began to slide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a lot like the hissing elevator doors I had seen in old videos. As they made the inside more visible, I was amazed at what I saw on the other side. It was a space that appeared way longer than I could've imagined. The room seemed to never end and it was full of machines that beeped so softly that they were like a buzz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant glass tanks filled the room as well, with whatever was beneath the glass, unseen in the cloudy water. Then she came to us, holding a clipboard, appearing out of thin air or just from outside of my sight. There was just so much going on and she was completely alone. No other guards. No fellow scientists helping her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you both are. I was beginning to worry.\" Dr. Dorsey smiled in a way that made me feel chills. I knew she was human but there was just something very <i>off </i>about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a standard one,\" Mr. Olly said. \"She won't give you any trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is great to hear. We haven't had much luck lately, have we Gregor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so confused by what they were talking about but the more I concentrated on the lab, the more creeped out I began to feel. There was more medical equipment than I thought, trays full of cotton balls and sanitizer. Scalpels and pliers that looked brand new but very menacing. Then I had to look twice because something in one of the tanks was definitely moving, stirring inside the hazy water and splashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Olly turned pale and looked in horror. He was about to say something but before he could, Dr. Dorsey had already reached into her lab coat and pulled it out. Something inside the pocket clicked and in an instant, Mr. Olly disappeared with a loud pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy witch! What did you do?\" I screamed at her. She started to laugh and point down to the floor where something round was moving around. Scared but curious enough to check it out, I got closer and gasped. It looked like a peach-colored marble twitching by itself. <i>\"Mr. Olly?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to retire the old boy.\" Dr. Dorsey said with disappointment before she smiled again, excited like a kid during the Celebration of Lights. \"His replacement will be here very shortly!\"  She looked sinister as she pointed her finger directly...</span></div></div>",

He tapped the side of his head and a red light began to blink on the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't be able to trace me for a minute or two, so listen and don't freak out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was quick and panicked, I hadn't heard him sound anything like that when he was talking to the other guards or Dr. Dorsey even. It was strange to see his calm coolness gone so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had that exchange dozens, maybe even a hundred times, and you've never answered that wrong.\" He led us away from the door and back onto the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked sad for a moment. As if his whole life was flashing before his eyes. His voice was shaking when he spoke again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that I'm not going to take them to you. Not this time. Not again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the headset and dropped it to the ground. Then to my surprise, he raised his boot and stomped the device until it crunched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll buy you some time, get out now! There's a hatch inside the main utility closet. It leads to a passageway underground between this lab and the main colony. They don't know what she is doing here so just go to the highest power you can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at Mr. Olly in total confusion. But this is what I was waiting for, a chance to get away at least from here and find Mom again. Without saying another word, I headed towards away from Dr. Dorsey's lab and down the corridors of this eerily-white lighted facility. There were cameras everywhere - but whatever Mr. Olly did before he went off the grid had knocked them offline, at least for a little while. I was worried about bumping into other people as well but it had been pretty empty up to this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until I hear a pair of shoes on the linoleum. Then I hear two voices talking to each other as they begin to corner the hallway. I can either pull off some serious acting on the two guards or scientists coming by or head into one of the nearest unlocked rooms instead. </span></div></div>",

The other started cursing and stepped closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a medic, man.\" I could feel him nearby but he never came to take a pulse or check if I was breathing. With my eyes completely shut facing the floor and my body limp like a ragdoll, I had already made the guard squeamish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those Olly units sometimes go berserk.\" The closest guard to me said. His boot was only a few inches away from my laying face. \"You're lucky you weren't here last year when these rogue Olivias managed to hijack one. We lost a few guys that year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard clicked on his device and I could hear the faint sound of a woman's voice screaming on the other end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. I understand.\" The guard replied back, I could hear his voice nervous and shaky. \"We'll head over right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt their bodies as they stepped over me and began to head in the opposite direction. \"Dr. Dorsey is trapped, the Olly is barricading the doors and threatening to cause some pain. I hope you're good with that pistol.\" The two men disappeared as their footsteps turned into running and they were gone to handle the emergency. I couldn't believe it.. what did they mean by Olivias? Why were they talking about us as if this had happened before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was sure they were gone, I got back up. I was close to the utility closet and it seemed like there were no more people on patrol. Without no one spotting me, I went inside and locked it, my heart racing as I looked around for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what felt like the longest three minutes, I grabbed onto the handle of the chute that would be leading to some unknown underground passageway. I pulled my arms as hard as I could to lift it. But nothing, my hands couldn't even shake the small door. Now what, I couldn't just punch my way through the metal frame and the handle felt loose already. The space of the utility closet might offer something. I could see dusty shelves of cleaning products and a mop leaning against the wall. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Maltorians arrived on Earth in the mid 2040s; looking for a new world to settle after fleeing their home system.  What they found was a planet on the verge of destruction; thanks to humanity causing irreversible damage to the environment.  The Maltorians offered to use their advanced technology to repair the planet - the catch was that it would take 25 years to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the Maltorians and the remaining humans would live in a colony on the Moon.  The humans believed the Maltorians were their saviors, but they didn't know the Maltorians were hiding something from them - something that would have devastating consequences for humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Use proper grammar<br>\r\n2. Be creative with storylines but keep close to the original idea.<br>\r\n3. Use the 1st person perspective (I, I'll, I'm, etc) - as the story will be from Olivia's POV.<br>\r\n4. I reserve the right to edit, and/or/ remove chapters.</td>",
