You know, those days where you just wanna clock some guy in the mouth just cause? <br>\r\nToday was kinda like that you know? I'm saying You know a lot. Gotta stop that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm being a little vague I guess, maybe I should start from the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I wake up to my alarm right, and right off the bat things started to suck. My alarm was all the way up on full blast for chrissakes! I fell outta bed and hit my head on my dresser I never use. Now I got this huge scar upside my forehead. After that, a lot of crap went down real quick,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The shower was burning hot<br>\r\n- I tripped over my pantlegs and fell down the steps<br>\r\n- Mom forgot to make breakfast again<br>\r\n- My car is apparently \"in the shop\"<br>\r\n- So I took the bus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyhow, the bus ride was just awful. We had to drive to school in the pouring rain so everything was just dysmal. Such is the price of living in Central Michigan I guess. Lake effect you know? Dammit, my habit again. Sigh, well I'm not scratching it out, maybe if I keep noticing it, it'll just go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy experience on the bus today was actually reaallly similar to half my classes. I got, well, bullied in all of them I guess. Brad was throwing pencils at the back of my head on both occassions so there you go. Some best friend. OH WAIT, I didn't write down what happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia broke up with me. Reason: well it's kind of bizarre, I was framed, sortof. Remember Emma, the redhead, the one who used to be into me? Jeez look at me, I'm asking questions to an Inanimate object. Anyways, long story short, Emma kissed me in front of Cynthia. You do the math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now everyone hates me. Cynthia being the whole doe-eyed lil deer she is, she turned the team against me with all those waterworks! Now I'm off the team until further notice because Brad instigated a series of escalating events that I'd rather not get into. All over kissing a girl! Jesus, what is this world coming to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really sucks is Emma's hotter than Cynthia! I mean sure up until today I loved the girl but she was no knockout. I should've left her for Emma when I had the chance. Actually.....No, yeah, SCREW CYN! She never had what I wanted in a woman anyway! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I wouldn't give for a nice, sexy blonde. With a nice set of curves and an open mind.....damn. Pipe dream. Not that I could even do anything with her. American Virgin everybody! Sigh. Damn my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just realized it's past midnight, I better get some shuteye if I'm gonna face more of what I did today tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- KS</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay so today was....interesting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could beat around the bush but let me just dive right into this; my pants don't fit. Almost ALL of my pants don't fit. I realized it this morning when, well, I was getting dressed. I went to my closet and- this is stupid, you get the point. I had to wear sweatpants today. Never been a fan, but it was all I could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom once again forgot breakfast, in fact she actually left for work early today, which was weird of her. I had my usual meal of Instant Bacon and Corn Flakes before running out the door to the bus. I bring up what I ate because I felt sick all day, and the taste of that strange combination was in my throat all day! Sometimes I think my body is plotting against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever on that note, I got taller today! Crazy right? I know this mainly because my head bumped the ceiling rim of the bus when I was entering it today. So, now both a stomachache and a headache plagued my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo everyone at school was still mad at me about the whole Emma/Cynthia thing. I don't completely blame them, but a pudding bomb in my locker is just rude. luckily it wasn't me who opened it, but my locker partner Nick. We have a lot of classes together and I could see him yanking that gunk out of his hair the entire day.  In retrospect, I should've taken the bomb. I know it would've been impossible for me to know it was there, but Nick doesn't deserve that crap. <br>\r\nHe and I used to get made fun of because we don't cuss. Stupidest thing ever you know? OH WHAT THE-..... Okay, no more \"You knows\", I swear to Christ if I perform that stupid habit one more time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of Nick's misery today came from Emma's group actually. She and...Kim? I think it's Kim, I don't really know. She and Kim sit two seats behind Nick and they were throwing pencils and getting them stuck in Nick's hair. The nerve of those girls! But damn did they look good today. Nothing beats a Leopard Print Dress and some cleavage! I can still see her in my mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/405502214763537\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/4055022147...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, I'm getting turned on just by thinking about it. Anyways, our history teacher Mr. Franklin was obviously not amused by the duo's antics, and he told them to stop, or else face detention.<br>\r\n They complied of course, half because of the threat, half because it was him who asked. All the girls go gaga over Franklin, Especially the school...um....the promiscuous girls. Didn't wanna write the other word, I hate using it. I mean I can see where they're coming from; he's single, athletic, he always has his hair gelled, he wears tight khakis, He's a smooth guy! Girls got good taste! And on top of that he's a fairly easy-going teacher....HA just kidding. All of class today wound up being a huge surprise study session for a massive test no one knew existed. Well we know now! It was hard to focus too, my shaggy hair kept falling into my eyes. Which is odd because I just had it cut a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause I couldn't see very well, I asked Mr. Franklin if I could sit near the front. He graciously allowed me to do so, even pulled out my chair for me! He's definitely going to be some girl's Prince Charming someday, no doubt about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big thing that happened today for me though was the fight. No point in describing it except I fought Brad, who was still pissed about Cynthia. It ended fairly quickly since it was during lunch but if it had gone on, I'm pretty sure he woulda kicked my ass. Now that I think about it, I'm so much smaller than him. Weird. Another weird thing was Brad APOLOGIZING afterward. I don't think I've ever heard Brad apologize for anything in his life! But even so, it happened. Funny ole World isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know I think these sweatpants are growing on me. The only problem is they've gotten so tight, you can see my boxers right through em! I wish there was some way to make them less visible, idk. God, my nipples have been tingling all day! It's like I'm uber-ticklish or something. Maybe I should put some lotion on them, yeah that'll help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I better get on that, catch you later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Ken S</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I lost my voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god, you don't understand how freaked out I was! I woke up, and I just couldn't talk! Seriously, I tried to move my lips, which are all swollen btw, and all that came out was air. I was horrified. But then I noticed my blonde roots are creeping back into my hair and I felt a little better. I miss being blonde, so at least something's going right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh before I go any further, that lotion worked like a charm! My nipples don't tingle anymore! They look a little larger than before which means I must have an infection or something, but who cares, at least they're not bothering me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I took a shower, (making sure to keep my hair dry, if I'm growing it out it better friggin look good), pulled on my boyshorts and my tight sweats, and decided to actually go back into the mysterious depths of my dresser. Gahhh I was so excited. What mysteries could it hold, what secrets lye inside its cluttered drawers! wow, I can be really poetic if I want to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I basically fished out a black t-shirt because everything else looked so...immature. T-shirts of the Avengers and Mario, huge baggy hoodies an all that jazz. Really the drawer was just full of Shit! Hahahaha Oh jeez, well I can't unwrite that I guess. I felt like I was forgetting something, like something I was supposed to wear, but I couldn't remember so that was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so then I had my usual breakfast of Sausage and Honey Nut Cheerios and I was out the door. I didn't hit my head this time thank god! I would've been devastated if I found even one scratch on my face. It was strange, more people wanted me to sit with them today then even before the whole Cynthia thing! I kept getting waved over to different seats but obviously I had to go sit by Brad. Without saying anything, it seemed like things were back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo pudding bombs in the locker, no angry glares from other students, oh it was refreshing. OMG so we were in Health class today, and Mrs. Dallon was absolutely 100% on the rag! You could see it through her pants and she never noticed! Emma and I were laughing over it, we actually have the same sense of humor! I totally misjudged her! Except for her looks that is, I always knew she was pretty, but I had no idea we had so much in common! We got to talking, (well, actually she did, all I could do was croak), and it turns out she was trying to break me up with Cynthia to help me! Says I can do better than that skank. And you know what she's right!<br>\r\nI could easily find someone better than that dumb dyke. Emma also says I have a horrible taste in clothes and at first I was thinking \"Whoa now\" but then she showed me the leather bra she was wearing and I completely understand where she's coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh another thing that happened today was I got kind of a scare in Mr, Franklin's class when he revealed that since he's going on a trip next Monday, the Review test we were supposed to have over our Sophomore material from last year is being upped to Friday. I freaked out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way I could memorize all that stuff from last year! All that information was drowned in parties and drinking! <br>\r\nI tried to follow along with his verbal study guide but it all kinda just went in one ear and out the other. Mr. Franklin was wearing those pants again today...mhmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after class I went up to him, (voice came back, still I little squeaky, but I can talk again!!) and asked if maybe I could get an extension on the test, \"to be able to study the material\", was what I said, but that was obviously a fuckin lie. I was really just going to have Emma palm the answers so I could get un undred percent! <br>\r\nMr. Franklin actually said yes! Without hesitation!  I was so happy I gave him a hug! His embrace was so warm, and nice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut anyways I left after that, but as I was leaving I was shocked to see that he was checking me out! What a pig! I'm only seventeen for fuck's sake!<br>\r\nIf he thinks this is going to be some student teacher fantasy, he's got another thing......coming....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I missed the bus, so that was stupid. So I called up Brad, trusty old Brad, and he rolled up in that sexy Hummer of his to pick me up. Oh and Nick who was tagging along. It was an interesting ride since they didn't really know each other, and Brad of course let his usual cockiness shy through when Nick (being the moron he is) let slip that he's a virgin. THEN when Brad heard Nick had never even felt up a girl before he pulled over the car and I got to listen to him giving one of his inspiring lectures about being a man. Poor Nick, if only he had kept that virgin mouth of his shut. sighh.<br>\r\nAfter we dropped Nick, Brad and I decided to have one of the old boys night's from our childhood. We went minigolfing and I destroyed the windmill on the second hole. Don't ask. We were gonna bail but the guy in charge said we could come back on Friday when it was fixed \"free of charge!\" because \"I had a nice face.\" ugh, men. When we got back Brad walked me to my door and gave me the usual kiss goodbye, he's so sweet, such a great guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here I am I guess diary! Sitting in my cold wood chair wearing nothing but boyshorts and a baggy Avengers T-Shirt. It's been a long day, but good news! I'm straightening my hair for tomorrow! I also put in some dye to bring out the color in my roots.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry, Brad wants to Skype! I should head off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTTYL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, Kel <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote to self: I wonder if Mr. Franklin noticed me staring at his dick...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dear Diary,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMhm, I was sooo horny when I woke up this morning. I basically ruined my nightie taking care of it, can never wear that thing again! It's like an itch I just can't scratch, I got turned on in the shower too! The hot, steamy water running all over my smooth sensitive breasts just made me want to mmmm, whoa girl! Settle down now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo my straighteners didn't completely work, but I have them in right now, so maybe they'll work for tomorrow. I noticed after my shower when I was half dressed, and I took a picture for ya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.turboimagehost.com/p/16847200/tumblr_mhhv4tiId91ru0h9xo1_500.jpg.html#\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.turboimagehost.com/p/16847200...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't it look great? Oh fuck, there I go, askin questions to my diary again! <br>\r\nSo I threw on my favorite pair of yoga pants and a white blouse which I tied beneath my breasts, God, I'm such a show off. But you know me, I love it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom didn't come home last night, she's probably still at the club counting the singles shes made. She's a talented lady, I wish I could shake it as good as she  can. I grabbed a sausage and a banana on my way out, (girl's gotta eat!) before plopping my big sexy ass down in my boy Brad's lap. His boner digging into my asscrack did nothing to help my raging hormones, but you know me, I take it as a compliment ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasses were....distracting. Emma was kicked out of class today for wearing this skintight minidress which really wasn't school appropriate, I mean you could almost see her snatch it was ridiculous. I wouldn't be caught dead wearing something so scandalous in class, (even if I might want to). I'm so jaelous of her, with all her leather pants and her tight little skirts. It almost makes me want to go shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChemistry was really hard for me, I just couldn't understand all those terms! I had to get Nick to help me, but he was really distracted since he kept sneaking peeks at my tits. I told him I knew what he was doing and he got really embarassed and wouldn't talk to me. Honestly I was kindof pissed at him, it's nothing to be fucking embarassed about! So after class I took him into the Janitor's Closet and let him feel me up. He's lucky, my double C's for his first boob? Not every guy gets that. My nipples were getting extremely hard, so I made him stop. He's not that bad looking after all, maybe someday... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Franklin is such a naughty boy ;) He told me to call him David today and I just couldn't control myself. I basically started attacking his face with my mouth, it was soo HOT. He is so hot. His piercing blue eyes, his chiseled jawline, mmm and he's almost 30 Ahh!<br>\r\nWe were almost caught, so I had to stop in the middle of pulling his belt off. He slapped my ass on the way out, it made me so wet. I have plans for that man, mmm I can't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's this one girl in the hall who keeps running away everytime she see's me, I don't know who she is. I hope I didn't hurt her feelings, I hate having enemies. Although fighting another girl has always been one of my fantasies mmm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was just amazing though. Brad took me to see 50 Shades of Grey, he's such a great guy, he always knows want I want. I gave him a quick handie in the theater just to show my appreciation, but really he had it coming, I was so turned on today it was all I could do to retain what little virginity I have left. <br>\r\nYou know who was really hot though was the ticket guy. All he said was \"Tickets\" and I could've taken him right there. I can just see it now, him whipping it out in the kitchen, popcorn spilling between my tits, Wow I need to stop. I get so carried away all the time, sometimes I think I might be a bit of a.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, can't think like that Kels! Gotta keep that under control. I think that's everything, tomorrow's Friday! I've got to get my outfits together for Brad, can't have him be disappointed by his own personal sex-kitten! I hope I dream about his muscles tonight, wouldn't be the first time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTTYL diary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, Kels<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
