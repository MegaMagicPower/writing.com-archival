            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning fog covered the bay. The sea was calm, not a wave to be seen. The only movement was a soft breeze whistling through the trees. All was quiet in Smuggler's Cove on the cold, Thursday morning, the streets were bare in the little fisherman's village with the light wind dancing across the cobbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not to last as the small town hall began to announce 7:00 in its usual pompous way, its chimes ringing across the town. Jessica heard it. Loud and clear. Bringing news that it was time to wake up and get ready for her daily task of opening the local pub. She hadn't moved here to be a barmaid. Having only been in the town a few weeks she had already encountered three fish shortages, one marriage breakdown and six powercuts. Bartending wasn't what it cracked up to be, nor was the fresh sea air of the cove. Her dream was to be a teacher but these dreams were taking a long time to develop into reality so for now, she was settling with her steady job at the Rum Run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were still empty as she left the house, braving the bitter weather. It was always cold here and the fog never lifted, sweeping in from the sea. She had grown to like the mist, it gave an eerie feel to the village, as though it was hiding them from the rest of the world, their very own little village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still quite early, the pub wouldn't have woken up yet so Jessica detoured while everyone was still out of the way. Beating the crowds she turned down Cobbler's Way, the street where the few shops the bay had were situated. There wasn't much here, in the way of anything, it was a very basic place but that's how everyone liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to head back to the pub when she caught sight of a little shop, set back a little from the straight row of shops and houses. She had never noticed it before and it looked old and derelict. So small it was like a doll's house. She peered in through the grimy windows and could barely see anything but furniture piled high and huge portraits leaning against the walls. It was an antiques shop. But one like she had never seen before. Things here must have been dated beyond the Victorian era. She couldn't even begin to estimate how much the place must be worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation was pulling her closer and closer towards the door but her shift started in 20 minutes and it took 15 to get there, let alone the 15 to set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the shop seemed to call to her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although the shop was intriguing, she reasoned that it would still be there later. Being a small village everyone knew everyone and everything that was happening so she'd know if it was closing some time soon. As it was she hadn't heard anything, and being a barmaid, would have done from someone or other, the shop wasn't going anywhere. However, her job may be fast disappearing if she didn't get a move on to open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dreary walk to the Rum's Run in the unlifting fog she finally ended up in her usual routine, doling out drink after drink after drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was long and her mind kept drifting back to the little, hidden shop. The longer the day dragged, the more appealing the shop seemed to get but by the end of the long shift all thoughts of the shop were gone and the only comforting thought was going home and sleeping the stress away, ready for another day tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow morning came and again the shop was forgotten, as was the enthusiasm of a brand new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another day at the pub was commencing and the usual regulars were predictably pouring in as soon as the doors were opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, m'love, that'll be a whisky over here,\" came the thick Scottish request across the bar.<br>\r\n\"Bit early, don't you think, Charlie? Has your missus kicked you out again, eh?\"<br>\r\n\"Aye, bad-tempered old boot,\" he chuckled. Everyone knew that the Anderson marriage was as unpredictable as the sea. Everyone knew that they'd be back together by the end of the day. And everyone knew that it was never anything serious.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Charlie. Why do you put up with it, you know she'll take you back but the question is, why do you let her.\"<br>\r\n\"She's not that bad and she needs me. I canny leave her on her own and Lucy dusny need something like that right now. And anyhows why'd you care, fancy some of the old Charlesy.\" He had always been the charmer, too big-headed for his own good but Jessica loved him. The stories he had to tell were priceless and were well known throughout the town. She regarded him highly, almost like a second father to her and it was plain to see, he had a soft spot for her.<br>\r\n\"Cheeky, but I know, you and Maggie, you're made for each other, you are and if anything happens to that, the whole village will go under.\"<br>\r\n\"And flattery will get you everywhere.\"<br>\r\n\"You know I'm right, even if it just gives nothing to the gossip society of the village, and that being the size it is does include the whole village going under!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Green, I pay you to sell and serve drinks not to catch up with your social life.\"<br>\r\n\"Catch you later Charlie, the Demon Mistress is calling.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm off anyway, those fish won't catch themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time turned to 12:00 and the lunch orders came flooding in.<br>\r\n\"Afternoon, Connor, Liam, what can I get you? Usual?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, ta. And two pints.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem! Coming right over.\"<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\"<br>\r\nConnor and Liam were the Irish minority of the village, being an old seaport there were a lot of different cultures, mainly British but there were some French, and a few Spaniards came through every now and again. Most of them left and it was back to being majority English but there were still a few characters to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that good-for-nothing lay-about of a husband of mine,\" Margaret Anderson framed the doorway and the tavern fell silent. Whenever she walked into a room all eyes turned towards her. She had lived in this village longer than anyone and was very well respected by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was in here earlier, Mrs. A, gone out to sea just now. He'll be in soon.\"<br>\r\n\"That's Mrs Anderson to you, young lady and he'd better hope he's home in 5 minutes or he's done for,\" and with that, she stormed out and the pub was back to its lively self as though she was never there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pub gradually quietened until there was only the latenighters who were soon turfed out for closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grabbed her keys and coat and bid farewell for another night.</span></div></div>",

What the hell is going on here?\u201d Jessica demanded as she stepped in, with the help of a few bystanders, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJess, you gotta let me at him, this eejit was badmouthing Kate and I will not stand here letting him go on about her like she was a piece of meat.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, go home Liam and clean yourself up, and you!\u201d She added to the stranger, \u201cStay the hell away from my best friend, Kate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the oddly familiar stranger slunk off, Jessica led Liam home. Once in, armed with a bag of frozen peas, Jessica burst out laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re so amused by this whole affair!\u201d Liam commented wryly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Liam but of all the people to get into a street brawl, you are the last person I\u2019d expect to see!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Liam replied, a smile starting to appear on his battered face, \u201cbut honestly, you should have heard him, boasting about Kate, like she was some prize he had won.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s seeing anyone at the moment, I should know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell he seems to think she\u2019s his. But she deserves someone who respects her, someone who will really look after her, someone who loves her. Someone like...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone like... you? Liam Sheridan! Are you in love with Kate?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! How can I? I mean, she works the tables at the Plaice and I work in the kitchens and so , why should I even notice her. I mean, it\u2019s not as if she\u2019s around in the kitchen much ... but when she is you notice, and when she comes in you know the most beautiful girl in the world just walked in, rushed off her feet with incoming orders but still with that gorgeous smile.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLiam, I had no idea. Does Kate know?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. And she never will.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a chef, what can I possibly offer her?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLiam, she\u2019s just a waitress!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but a waitress waiting, waiting for her big break, which will come. She\u2019ll be living the life she\u2019s always wanted and I\u2019ll still be here, frying fish!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, you should probably head off.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk.

She turned around and shuddered, fog coming out of her mouth. It had gotten much colder tonight or maybe she was feeling cold. After all, she hadn't eaten anything since the last six hours. She had no idea how the time had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and looked around, there weren't a lot of people at that late hour. Any person who was still outside was going in their homes, leaving the streets alone and quiet once again. That was one of the perks of living in Smuggler's Creek, people went to their homes and slept at appropriate time and woke up at time in the morning for their work, job or whatever they had to do. They had a good and healthy routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed for the third time, wishing she had been a teacher so that she'd had that routine. She thought of talking to her aunt in California to let her crash there while she searched for a job but her aunt always found faults in Jessica and did not approve of anything she did. After her mother died, the only relative that was left alive was jessica's aunt and it was a shame how they couldn't spend more time together, let alone ask for help from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica decided she'd stay at this place until something good turned up or she found something on her own, without any one's help. After all, it was her goal to be a teacher, she wanted to achieve it all on her own. But for now, she needed to get going to her home and get some sleep to be at the pub again. She needed money to travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started walking quietly, making sure her breathing wasn't loud to disturb the quiet around her. It was surprising how the quietness wasn't disturbing or irritating. It was quite the opposite. It was peaceful and soothing. It allowed you to think over matters in your mind without having someone disturb your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe Jessica had that thought too early. She heard rapid footsteps, the sound grew louder with each step it took and Jessica turned to see someone stopped right behind her. Whoever that person was, he had bent on his knees to catch his breath. He had seemed to run quite a few miles in order to reach where he was. Or maybe to catch her up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gripped her bag tightly that was hung from her shoulder and she took a cautionary step back from the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Jessica managed to say but her voice came out as a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man raised his hand, as if asking to give him a minute to get his breath back. Jessica nodded, even though she knew the man wasn't looking at her. Her heart beat had picked up pace. She took in the appearance of the man before her and in his bent state, she could figure that he was around twenty-nine or something, his hair looked very soft and silky, messy and they were dark brown in colour. He had a fair complexion and had a good body, he must work out and judging by his muscles, he must have been running for hundreds of miles to stop now and catch his breath like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he stood straight and cleared his throat. He looked into the brown eyes of Jessica and smiled, \"I am James, James Tilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put forward his hand to shake and Jessica shook, \"Jessica Goldwin. Um, is there something you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' expression changed into a confused one, \"You don't recognize me? James? Sometimes called Jimmy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very sorry, \" Jessica shook her head, \"but that's not ringing any bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am one of Rum run's clients, very generous one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help Jessica at all in remembering who the young man was. She then looked into his eyes, trying to recognize him and she remembered the same blue eyes she had seen and as much as she felt embarrassed to admit, loved and admired quite a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James? As in the guy who came to the bar a few days ago and got into a fight with the drunk Cad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames laughed, \"Wow, that is not the way I wanted to be recalled. I got a really good beating out of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled, a little blush crept up to her cheeks. She had liked the man when he appeared to the bar. It turned out that he was a regular client and he had a lot of business in other countries and the pub benefited from his visits. The first time he had come to the bar, she couldn't help keep her eyes off of him and she was never that kind of a girl, oogling over a boy and getting her heads in the clouds. When James had left, she was sure that she'd never see him again and yet there he was, standing in front of her.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n840 Words</span></div></div>",

Glancing quickly around she could see that the terraced houses of the village had been left far behind her but the lighthouse was ahead but the path she had wound up on was unsteady, especially in the dark.

A boy on the rocks, no older than the Timmins\u2019 boy, Joshua. He sat there, watching the waves and suddenly turned and was looked straight at Jessica. Startled, she stepped back and he was gone.

His eyes were lonely, and he seemed so pale. Her mind whispered \"Ghost\", but she wouldn't say it aloud. It must have been a trick of light on Sue and Jimmy's boy she told herself...but why in the world is he sneaking out so late at night, he must be only 8 or 9? She'd have to let his parents know he's wandering around near the rocky cliff at night! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleep was fitful at best, dreams of ocean waves crashing around her and the soft crying of a little boy. When the 7 o'clock hour struck, and Smuggler's Cove started it's day, Jessica threw her blankets over her face to shield the unusually sunny beams coming in through the window. The phone rang 20 minutes later and there was no denying the day had begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kate, the only friend she'd made since moving to the tiny hamlet, who also happened to be the towns most notorious flirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Jessica croaked into the phone, her voice gravely from the chain smokers the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never guess who asked about you last night..\" she squealed into the receiver, her perkiness tinged with a hint of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed. \"Who?\"</span></div></div>",

The date was an absolute disaster. It wasn\u2019t believed to be possible for a person to be so boring until Bernard appeared on the scene.

It's not like the first customer walked in as soon as she unlocked the door. Besides, she was <i>never</i> late, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked up to the window that flanked the door, trying to peer in through the grime. Too many things were piled up on the shelves on either side for her to see anything. Taking another quick look at her watch, she took a deep breath and turned the doorknob just as a sudden gust of wind blew loose strands of hair into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was either stuck or locked. Jessica pushed her hair out of her eyes and looked around to see if there was a sign that told what hour the shop opened. As she was distracted, a tiny creak sounded from the doorjamb. The creak turned into a rusty shriek as the door was pulled slowly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica jumped back with a tiny shriek of her own. She stared at the old woman who stood in the doorway for a moment, then tried on a shaky smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?\" She had to push down an urge to curtsey--the woman, though shriveled with age, seem to almost require that kind of old-fashioned courtesy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What's that?\" the woman leaned closer, looking over the glasses pinching her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took a deep breath and spoke louder. \"Is your shop open yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, no, Missy! What ya think the door is locked for? Can't ya see that it's dark inside here? That's cos I'm trying to <i>sleep!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Jessica jumped back a bit, though managing not to shriek this time. The woman's attitude was so unexpected, so far against what her appearance seemed to suggest, that Jessica didn't know what to say for a moment. Then she shook herself, thinking, <i>I'm not going to let this old woman intimidate me!</i> Aloud, she said, giving the woman the courtesy that the aged had a right to expect, \"I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm new in town, and didn't know what hours you kept. Can I come back later, when your store is open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Jessica's polite tone, the woman seemed to soften a bit. She turned her bleary  gaze toward the younger woman as she said, \"Wellnow, I guess ya could.\" Then she slammed the door without warning just as Jessica started to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>that</i> was strange.\" Jessica spoke aloud without meaning to, so startled was she at the old lady's eccentric ways. A look at her watch told her she still had eleven minutes to get to the pub in time, so she put the grim little shop behind her and headed for work. </span></div></div>",

Being a small village everyone knew everyone and everything that was happening so she'd know if it was closing some time soon.

However, her job may be fast disappearing if she didn't get a move on to open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dreary walk to the Rum's Run in the unlifting fog she finally ended up in her usual routine, doling out drink after drink after drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was long and her mind kept drifting back to the little, hidden shop.

Everyone knew that they'd be back together by the end of the day. And everyone knew that it was never anything serious.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Charlie. Why do you put up with it, you know she'll take you back but the question is, why do you let her.\"<br>\r\n\"She's not that bad and she needs me.

Coming right over.\"<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\"<br>\r\nConor and Liam were the Irish minority of the village, being an old seaport there were a lot of different cultures, mainly British but there were some French, and a few Spaniards came through every now and again. Most of them left and it was back to being majority English but there were still a few characters to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that good-for-nothing lay-about of a husband of mine,\" Margaret Anderson framed the doorway and tavern fell silent.

Say something so I know you\u2019ve actually picked up!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018What do you want Kate? Do you have any idea what time it is right now?\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Oh stop whinging and listen. You remember that guy we met the other day, you know, Dean?\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018No.\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018You know, when we were out in town, he bought us drinks, works up at the castle...\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Oh yeah, how could I possibly forget an ego that big!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018What! Well, anyway, he rang me and asked me up to the castle for the day and he\u2019s going to take me round. Can you believe it?\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Gee, that\u2019s real great! Now, do you mind if i go to bed now?\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Fine, Miss Sarcastic, so it\u2019s eleven o\u2019clock, Saturday. He\u2019ll pick us up.\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Whoa, what? Us? What do you mean \u201cus\u201d?\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Didn\u2019t I say? He\u2019s bringing a friend for you.\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018You\u2019re setting me up! No way! No way am I coming!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Come on Jess, don\u2019t leave me on my own, he could turn out to be a total moron! I need you there!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018\u2019What do you mean \u201ccould turn out to be\u201d!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Jess!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018Fine! But you owe me, big time!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018You got it! Thanks!\u2019<br>\r\n\u2018\u2019Night Kate.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome with sleepiness from the long, double shift, Jessica head to bed.<br>\r\nAll too soon, the town hall was bringing the dreaming to an end, summoning all from their slumber.<br>\r\nJessica then made her way down to find a parcel left at the end of the hall.</span></div></div>",

It was 9:45. Her shift started 15 minutes ago and she still needed to set up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked around but didn't recognise anything. All the houses looked identical as they towered over her casting mysterious shadows on the cobbled streets below. She thought of turning back the way she came but the thought of going past that bizarre little building put her off. Besides, she'd turned down so many side alleys she probably wouldn't be able to find the main road anyway. No, there was no question about it she would have to keep going. In any case, she'd been going so long the maze was sure to end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like hours had passed when she stopped again. &lt;i&gt; I never knew this village was so big!&lt;/i&gt; she moaned again to herself. &lt;i&gt;I can't believe I've never been in this part of town before!&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her left, a drainpipe was dripping. Sheltered by the houses she'd never noticed it was raining till now. \"Perfect!\" she mumbled \"Can this day get any worse?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost in answer to her question, a shadow darted across the small passage way leading of the path Jessica was standing on. She strained her eyes but couldn't see anything so passed it off as a trick of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw it again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she called out with uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" The voice came from the shadows and then the owner of the voice stepped into view. It was a boy about the same age and height as herself but a lot thinner. He looked quite scruffy, as if he'd been living on the streets for a while. He wore an off-white t-shirt that was torn at the seams. His trousers weren't much better. They were a muddy khaki colour and only reached his knees. He spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come,\" was all he said in his deep silky voice, a little husky (from lack of conversation, I assumed) but still pleasant to listen to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said this, he started to run off again. When he realised I wasn't following he said again, more urgently this time \"Come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know whether or not to follow this enchanting stranger, as I'd never seen him before. Yet his charming aquamarine eyes were begging me to go with him. He almost looked as if he was daring me to go!</span></div></div>",

A sudden state of nervousness came over her as her fingers came closer to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock of hearing her name almost made her topple over. As she spun round she saw Joshua Timmins waving furiously at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Joshie, you off to school?\" Josh was nearing his eleventh birthday but everyone still called him Joshie, habit. But he didn't mind, made him feel special, having a nickname.<br>\r\n\"Yuh,huh. We're having a speaker come in to talk about water safety. Again.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, fun.\" Jessica sympathised. \"You'd better get a move on, school's the other side of town.\"<br>\r\n\"As should you, skiving is not tolerated in this here village.\" He humoured, for an eleven year old kid, he knew how to charm and was easily the cleverest in the school. He was due to move into 'big' school soon, having secured his place. The only problem was that it was in the next town which was 15 miles away. There were some disadvantages of living in a secluded, not many but there were some.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right back at me huh. See you later then, Joshie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned around she could here the town waken and Josh greeting them in his usual cheery manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then continued off to the pub to open up with more of a spring in her step. Josh had the ability to do that too. Make everyone's day. Just one smile from him and the day couldn't get worse. Even the fog seemed to lift, just a little bit, mind.</span></div></div>",

Being a small village everyone knew everyone and everything that was happening so she'd know if it was closing some time soon. As it was she hadn't heard anything, and being a barmaid, would have done from someone or other, the shop wasn't going anywhere. However, her job may be fast disappearing if she didn't get a move on to open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dreary walk to the Rum's Run in the barely unlifting fog she finally ended up in her usual routine, doling out drink after drink after drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was long and her mind kept drifting back to the little, hidden shop. The longer the day dragged, the more appealing the shop seemed to get but by the end of the long shift all thoughts of the shop were gone and the only comforting thought was going home and sleeping the stress away, ready for another day tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow morning came and again the shop was forgotten, as was the enthusiasm of a brand new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another day at the pub was commencing and the usual regulars were predictably pouring in as soon as the doors were opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, m'love, that'll be a whisky over here.\" came the thick Scottish request across the bar.<br>\r\n\"Bit early, don't you think, Charlie? Has your missus kicked you out again, eh?\"<br>\r\n\"Aye, bad-tempered old boot,\" he chuckled. Everyone knew that the Anderson marriage was as unpredictable as the sea. Everyone knew that they'd be back together by the end of the day. And everyone knew that it was never anything serious.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Charlie. Why do you put up with it, you know she'll take you back but the question is, why do you let her.\"<br>\r\n\"She's not that bad and she needs me. I canny leave her on her own and Lucy dusny need something like that right now. And anyhows why'd you care, fancy some of the old Charlesy.\" He had always been the charmer, too big-headed for his own good but Jessica loved him. The stories he had to tell were priceless and were well known throughout the town. She regarded him highly, almost like a second father to her and it was plain to see, he had a soft spot for her.<br>\r\n\"Cheeky, but I know, you and Maggie, you're made for each other, you are and if anything happens to that, the whole village will go under.\"<br>\r\n\"And flattery will get you everywhere.\"<br>\r\n\"You know I'm right, even if it just gives nothing to the gossip society of the village, and that being the size it is does include the whole village going under!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Green, I pay you to sell and serve drinks not to catch up with your social life.\"<br>\r\n\"Catch you later Charlie, the Demon Mistress is calling.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm off anyway, those fish won't catch themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time turned to 12:00 and the lunch orders came flooding in.<br>\r\n\"Afternoon, Conor, Liam, what can I get you? Usual?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, ta. And two pints.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem! Coming right over.\"<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\"<br>\r\nConor and Liam were the Irish minority of the village, being an old seaport there were a lot of different cultures, mainly British but there were some French, and a few Spaniards came through every now and again. Most of them left and it was back to being majority English but there were still a few characters to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that good-for-nothing lay-about of a husband of mine,\" Margaret Anderson framed the doorway and tavern fell silent. Whenever she walked into a room all eyes turned towards her. She had lived in this village longer than anyone and was very well respected by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was in here earlier, Mrs. A, gone out to sea just now. He'll be in soon.\"<br>\r\n\"That's Mrs Anderson to you, young lady and he'd better hope he's home in 5 minutes or he's done for,\" and with that, she stormed out and the pub was back to its lively self as though she was never there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pub gradually quietened until there was only the latenighters who were soon turfed out for closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grabbed her keys and coat and bid farewell for another night.</span></div></div>",

Glancing quickly around she could see that the terraced houses of the village had been left far behind her but the lighthouse was ahead but the path she had wound up on was unsteady, especially in the dark.

On closer examination, that object appeared to be Charlie Anderson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusting herself off, Jessica climbed up off the floor. When she looked to the direction Charlie had come from, the ominous shape of Margaret came out of the fog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Och, I'm sorry, Jessie. You'll have to forgive the missus. She's not too happy wi' old Charlie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Jessica looked from husband to wife, then pushed her way past the part of them. \"You two need to grow up. You can't keep fighting in the streets like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't you be telling me what I can and can't do, young lady. When you've lived as long as I have, with a useless lump like Charlie Anderson, then I might listen to what you have to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unbelievable! The woman is fighting in the street and still feels superior to me.</i> Without speaking, Jessica made her way along the cobbled street that turned into the winding hill to her home. Salt in the air stuck to her lips and made her thirsty. As she looked out over the cove, it took her a moment to realise she could see. The fog that swirled around the Rum Rum had disappeared. This was the first night since she moved there that she could see the waves as they crashed against the rocks. The roaring sound almost deafened her.<i> Has it always been that loud</i>? she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe touch on her arm made her shriek and jam back. She relaxed when she saw a young boy of about seven or eight standing in front of her. He wore dark trousers and a button up coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, are you all right?\" she asked, wondering what such a young boy was doing out at gone midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here? It must be way past your bedtime. Where do you live? I'll take you home.\" She reached out to take his hand, and it was icy cold. \"Oh, you're freezing. Come on, let's get you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged his hand, but he didn't move. \"No. I want to see the ships going out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're a bit early, I'm afraid. They won't be leaving for another few hours yet.\" Again, she tugged at his hand, and he didn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The ships. My pa will be leaving in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, Jessica regarded his face that was as white as marble. His pinched features added to how small he looked, standing there in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what, tell me your name, and we will think about what to do. My name is Jessica. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of revellers in the distance drew her attention momentarily away, and when she looked back, he had gone. She clutched her hand, feeling the cold spot where his had been. \"Child, where are you? Hey, little boy. We can talk. If you're scared of going home, I can help. Little boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a 360 and scanned the roads in every direction. But he was gone. Vanished. <i>That's not possible.</i> As she climbed the hill back to her house, swirling fog encircled her path. As she unlocked her front door, she had the strangest feeling she wasn't alone.</span></div></div>",

She turned around and shouted something at somebody. Suddenly, her arms jerked violently as she shook a bucket out the window. Dirty brown water came cascading down, landing on the cobblestones with a loud smacking sound. Jessica jumped back to avoid the sprinkles, but a few hit her face. She squeaked, the result of a repressed shriek, and wiped at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGlaring up at the window, for the woman was no longer there, she thought bitterly that some water safety classes would be good for that lady. Now that she thought about it, she had never had a water safety class before. The information would be nice to know. She bit her lip lightly as she thought about it. She did have her duties, after all. She had a job, and was quickly running out of time to arrive just standing there. The more she thought about it, the more she realized how much she hated working at the pub. The fights, the drunken confessions, they all wore on her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShaking her head to clear it, she pointedly turned around and stalked off. The pub could remain closed. The pub could burn down for all she cared. She would take see that water safety class and take a day for herself. She would relax and rewind.

She needed peace of mind, or she knew she would go crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to convince herself that she had made the right decision, she made her way to the school.
