Fair skin, and quite slim.<br>\r\nHeight: 180ft<br>\r\nClothes: A two piece white swimsuit with a red outline,<br>\r\nPowers: Atomic breath, monster roar, regeneration, breathing underwater<br>\r\nPersonality: Actually acts more like a feral beast than a human. Refusing to talk, preferring to roar and growl like a monster. Destructive, curious for her age so playful, also energetic. Likes destruction and terrorizing.<br>\r\nBackstory: Aokizilla was actually born back in the 1930s late, early 1940s. She was just an average girl when one day the nuclear bombs that the U.S. sent destroyed both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Her original name was Aoki, who was just an average young girl in the time period when suddenly aliens came and abducted the girl before the bombing. She was placed in suspended animation for sometime after as the aliens rewrite her memory, and soon the alien did their experiments with her and actually went to earth and grab a sample of the nuclear radiation and infuse it into the girl. She was then sent back to Earth six months later, though not the same way again. Ever since she became 180ft and gain powers, she has terrorized the land of Japan, destroying their cities and millions of lives there, becoming their Godzilla. Few even remember her, and those who did called her Aokizilla, one day the aliens came to her island home and tried to capture her, but she destroyed them, and ever since she slept in her slumber on Aokizilla island, near Japan, occasionally terrorizing Tokyo because she wants to have fun, and also rule over it as it\u2019s goddess. She likes scaring them.<br>\r\nAdditional info: She lived for many years, but still retains her kid appearance, and always was a kid at heart. She is a ruler of Japan, and rules it as a goddess, but she still rampages as it\u2019s fun to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we begin with Aokizilla?</span></div></div>",

What had been a typical day in the city of Orangeville had gone from fine to fucked up in mere seconds when the death goddess made her presence known in the heart of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down on all of them with cold eyes and a toothy grin that made her look on par with that of a psychopath. Everyone for miles could feel a chill run down their spines when they saw her and could feel the hairs on the back of their necks standing on end when she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe insulted them, belittled them, and sounded off on just how helpless they all were. The smarter one's cowered while the braver one's tried to insult the madwoman back. It was all fruitless. She could only respond by leveling a nearby tower with her pinky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched helplessly as dust and debris rained down onto the streets below. This action sent the citizens of Orangeville into a frenzy. The cries and screams that filled the air where merely an explanation point on what everyone already knew. This goddess was their omega and this was their end of days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige eyed the helpless insects at her feet with a mixture of amusement and distain. Each and every life down below mattered little to her and every tower in her way was just another obstruction to be destroyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fortuneteller had gifted her this power, this newfound status, and this city. It was all hers to destroy at her leisure and right now all she felt like doing was wiping it off the map in one sitting. She smiled brightly as she turned her attention to a nearby building and proceeded to punt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upper half went sailing through the air as the lower section crumbled into nothing.
