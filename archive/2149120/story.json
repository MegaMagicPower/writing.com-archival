They seemed pretty desperate actually, he didn't even have to go to an interview they just said show up ready to work.  When he arrived it was pretty busy.  All of the employees he saw were women and attractive ones at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit you were getting a bit nervous.  You approached the counter.  There was a very attractive blonde girl with a slim frame and wide hips with her back turned to you.  She turned around with a drink she just made and as she handed it to a customer.  You noticed her nametag read \"Troy\"   <i>Thats a strange name.</i> You think to yourself before she turned to you and signed \"Can I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain you are here to start work and she perks up immediately and gets very excited.  She shows you all of the machines and where the ingredients are and how to open the cash register.  She continues to thank you profusely.  She shows you a walk in closet full of uniforms.  Everyone in the store wore black pants with a black top and a green apron.  \"Just pick one that fits and if you ever need a change in size you can just come in here and grab another outfit.\"  She explained.  You thought that was weird, you couldn't imagine you changing sizes very often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I hired you I am allowed to quit.  Let me go clock myself out.\"  Troy said excitedly.  You raise your eyebrows and gave a funny grin.  If she really hated the job why didn't she just quit?  You thought.  You put on your uniform and go back to the front counter to start working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a blonde dude standing on the other side of the counter wearing a uniform.  There were other guys working here afterall.  He had a nametag that read \"Troy\"  He shook your hand vigorously and thanked you for taking this job.  \"Just remember nothing is free here.  Don't steal food or drinks or you will regret it.  Also don't slack off or be unproductive.  Management  has a way of getting their employees in line.\"  He had a stone cold look on his face at that last line as he ran out the front doors.  <i>Who the hell was that?</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We are excited you have decided to join our awesome and sexy team!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was watching the introduction video to his new job at this juice and coffee shop that just opened up here at the mall. He was young and needed a job but he didn\u2019t think the place was going to be this over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact the only reason he applied was he noticed all the girls in sexy outfits walking around. He figured it might be at least be a cool place to meet someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn yanwed and tried to stay awake as the mind numbing video played in the background. It went over safety guidelines, workplace rules, so on and so forth. John really wasn\u2019t paying much attention until something started to move behind the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow is the time for you to pick your workplace profile! This will determine where you work and how you interact with our customers!\u201d The woman in the video said as John looked a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen a blonde woman in a bikini appeared first. She had huge perfectly round boobs that were barely contained in her tiny pink bikini. She had light skin, waist length bleach blonde hair, and a total hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there I\u2019m Samantha! You can call me Sam or Sammi! I love making all sorts of juices and fruit smoothies for my customers! I\u2019m happy, bubbly, and every day is a party for me!\u201d She said as the TV panned to another woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen next a woman with dark hair appeared. She had darker more tanned skin. Perfectly straight Raven black hair, very large but natural looking breasts, very long legs, and great overall figure. She was wearing a skin tight black mini dress and black heels as she smiled to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Nicole. I love coffees and espresso. I like to be sensual, dark, and smooth. I make sure every piping hot cup is made to satisfy each customer I serve.\u201d She said as the TV went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the TV two drawers opened up. The first contained a bright pink bikini the other contained a skin tight black mini dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the TV there was also a button that said more profiles available, push here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...they can\u2019t be serious can they?\u201d John asked as he looked to the clothes. Was he supposed to take one of these?\u201d</span></div></div>",

This certainly had to be the most interactive orientation he had ever been in, and certainly the strangest too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is up with the women's clothing?\" John asked himself. \"Surely they didn't mess up my gender, right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there was a slip up somewhere that could be fixed, yet John wasn't too sure who he could ask for that. He was kind of all by himself in here. It was kind of creepy to be honest, even before being presented the clothes. Still, he began to wonder if it was his only way forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, perhaps all of this was just a joke to mess with him. In any case, he had to apparently make a choice. He wondered about pressing the button to view more profiles, but he wasn't sure if he wanted to do that. So, perhaps it was a spur of the moment decision, but he reached in and grabbed the pink bikini out of the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought I'd be holding one of these things....\" John mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a little light flash from where the pink bikini was, as in confirming the choice. The dresser then closed itself, with the TV screen changing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for your choice!\" giggled Samantha on the screen, every bit as bubbly as before. \"I hope you enjoy your decision every day! Have fun and welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left, the screen went over some more guidelines and stuff like that, as per usual stuff to end an orientation. John found it hard to focus though with the soft pink fabric in his hands. It made him blush at it all. Thankfully if he had to take this with him, he at least had a backpack to put it in so people wouldn't think he was a weirdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the orientation video appeared to wrap up.</span></div></div>",

He looked at himself in the mirror nearby and blew himself a pretend kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely in his hands the bikini began to glow. It gave off a soft pink light that was warm in his hands. Looking back to the mirror he didn\u2019t see his reflection anymore. He saw The girl he saw in the Video, Samantha...She had the kind of body he had only ever seen online. Huge perfectly round boobs, amazing hourglass figure, long platinum blonde hair. She seemed like the kind of perfect sexy goddess one could only dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d John called out seeing his reflection in the mirror. His body was still his own but the girl in the mirror seemed to Mimic his every move perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve chosen your new body I\u2019m so excited to have you joining our team!\u201d A female voice said behind John causing him to spin around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn saw an Asian girl standing in front in him body was incredibly lean and tight. She had long black hair tied up in a pony tail. She was wearing skin tight yoga pants and a tank top that hugged her like a second skin. She had only modest sized bust and curves but she made up for it with a lean petite figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...excuse me? What do you mean new body?\u201d John asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course! I shouldn\u2019t say new body. I meant new life! Hi there sorry for coming in like that. My name is Lin. I\u2019m your new assistant manager and training coach.\u201d She said with a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...I\u2019m not sure what is going on here, but I\u2019m starting to get a weird vibe.\u201d John said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s obvious silly! You\u2019ve just selected your new body profile when you selected your new work uniform!\u201d Lin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...work uniform? I\u2019m supposed to wear this bikini to work?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course Silly! Those huge boobs of yours can\u2019t go around totally unexposed!\u201d Lin said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...I think you\u2019re a bit confused. I\u2019m a guy who applied for a part time job at a juice bar.\u201d John said as he dropped the bikini ready to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late for that. You signed the new life agreement and you\u2019ve chosen your new body profile. The process has already started...Samantha.\u201d Lin said pointing to John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn lolked a bit confused. It wasn\u2019t until he looked down that his eyes widened. Somehow the bikini he was holding had moved. It was now attached to his body underneath his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey get this thing off!\u201d He said protesting as he pulled on the bikini but it refused to move or tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. Now the process will take some time. It\u2019s okay though no one will notice anything but you. I suggest you head home and begin adjusting to your new life. I will see you back here first thing tomorrow for your first day of work!\u201d Lin said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was about to say something when he suddenly felt a strange and odd sensation in his feet. Looking down his tennis shoes were actually changing! The front beginning to melt away as he saw his toes being exposed and they were now painted a bright pink...</span></div></div>",

He had nearly fallen back over in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the hell?!\" he cried out, wiggling his toes a little underneath his shifting shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't lying when I said you would be changing,\" Lin smiled. It was funny. Looking at her smile, you'd think there wasn't anything devious going on, and maybe there wasn't from her point of view. That only seemed to make John angrier though. He was sure he was hallucinating about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that seemed to be the end of the conversation, as Lin giggled and said good bye, though not before telling \"Samantha\" to have fun with it, not that John liked that idea at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to himself, he walked away from the store, feeling the off sensations of his feet down below. With each step, his shoes were changing more, showing more of his feet until they practically resembled flip flops by the end of it. Furthermore, to clarify, the nice socks he had worn to this were gone completely as if they were never there at all. The pink color on his toenails taunted him the whole way back, and he could swear his feet even were looking softer and more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great...\" he groaned, getting back to his car. This made him glad he had an apartment to himself. At least he wouldn't have to cover this up from anyone there. Lin said no one else would notice but he wasn't sure how much he believed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he drove back to the apartment complex, feeling occasional aches in some places. It didn't seem to be anything too major, but he tried not to focus on it. Eventually, he parked his car and went inside his place a few floors up. By now, his shoes were pretty much officially flip flops, making him shake his head as he took them off. Gosh, his feet really were soft now....and...were his legs a little soft too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his pant legs up a little just to see, and indeed it was like the hairs on his legs were slowly beginning to lighten and fall out. Actually...on that note, weren't his pant legs shorter now? His dress shirt sleeves also seemed to be shorter, barely reaching his elbows now while his pant legs barely went past his legs. It was like everything was shrinking on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really wanted to fight this. Why wouldn't he after all? However, he kind of wondered just how he would. It was unlikely he was going to get any help on this. Guess he just had to do his best. Part of him considered just not coming into work, but he figured that would do nothing to curb this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy was he in a pickle....</span></div></div>",

However he didn\u2019t seem to notice the other subtle changes happening around his apartment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decor was slowly shifting. Turning from a drab boring apartment of a young man into a bright and feminine look. One a very feminine girl his age would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen John went into his fridge and normally would have pulled out some comfort food like Ice Cream but instead grabbed a small low fat yogurt. He never even bought those before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the table John saw the family photo he kept of himself, and his parents. As he looked at it he noticed something was wrong. Instead of seeing the small boy of 10 that he was in the photo he was a small and shy looking girl about the same age...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His mother also looked very different. Instead of the average looking brunette he saw a total bimbo Barbie house wife. She had long platinum hair, huge fake boobs, hourglass figure, she was wearing a pink dress with heels. She looked a lot like what you might imagine Samantha looking like but in her mid 40s...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right...\u201d John said putting the photo down. Was this thing changing his whole life too? The thought terrified him as a sudden massive headache suddenly hit him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone was trying to shove something into his skull. Flashes and images began to appear in John\u2019s mind. Images of a life he never had...or did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the young girl in the photo. She seemed a bit older. Maybe around 13? Just starting puberty. She was awkward looking and nerdy. Her messy brown hair tied up into twin ponytails. She was crying on her bed with her beautiful mother sitting beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let those boys make fun of you. You are still growing one day you will be a beautiful woman.\u201d The mother side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey said I had mosquito bites! Lauren Summers is already a C-cup! She is 4 months younger than me!\u201d The girl said upset. She was still very flat and very boyish looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory faded as John was pulled back. It seemed so real. Like it was really his memory. Was...was that young girl Samantha? It couldn\u2019t seem possible such an awkward teen could grow up into the woman he saw in the mirror....right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was about to stand up when a sudden aching pain hit his feet. Aparantly the changes were done being subtle with his body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down John saw his feet were popping and reshaping. They were getting smaller and dainty and more feminine. They were really looking like women\u2019s feet now as the bright pink toe nails matched the feet and flip flops perfectly...</span></div></div>",

Actually seeing himself change like this and even remember different events from his past? It was very overwhelming and he wished he could just pass it all off as some bizarre fever dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was hard to ignore them all, especially with how his apartment was looking. The colors were starting to look a little brighter, looking really weird as they mixed with the drab old colors that were there. He hadn't exactly done too much to customize the place, leaving most things as they were before he moved into this apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn another note, the yogurt was surprisingly good, even if nothing spectacular. Still, it worried him given how he had never ordered something like this in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could just wake up from this,\" he said with a hand to his head, throwing the yogurt cup away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, sparing a brief look at his changed feet, it was soon followed by another sensation. He hopped a bit as his legs began to ache a little. Looking closer, his calves looked like they were becoming a lot smoother, while at the same time looking curvier as well. Actually, his legs as a whole were looking smoother, the hairs he had on them slowly fading away into nothing. He could even see more of them due to his pants continuing to change and expose more of his legs in the process. There was even another ache as they even seemed to become longer than they were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting a little more, he felt his thighs beginning to smooth as well, as well as becoming a lot bigger. Funny enough, his legs actually felt just a little stronger. He wasn't much of a workout guy, only doing some casual stuff just to keep from getting overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it wasn't like any of this made him feel any better. If anything, he only began to panic more.</span></div></div>",

As he crawled into bed he closed his eyes as new<br>\r\nMemories came flooding into his mind. They seemed to come more naturally now, feeling like pieces of his past were beginning to connect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he dreamed John saw the girl from before. She was a bit older now. Maybe 15 or 16. Puberty had not been kind to her. She was a skinny pale girl with acne, no boobs and no curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting in what looked like a waiting room. At first she seemed alone until she looked over and saw another girl about her age. She was an Asian girl. However she was very overweight an unattractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi....hi...there. My name is Samantha, what\u2019s yours?\u201d She said shyly to the Asian girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...Lin..it\u2019s nice to meet you. Did your parents bring you here too?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded. \u201cMy mom did. She said this place would make me pretty.\u201d Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Daddy brought me here...He said if I wasn\u2019t going to make myself desirable then this place would...\u201d Lin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked a bit sad and disappointed. They seemed to talk for several minutes. Finding out they were in the same grade, went to rival schools, and even liked a lot of the same movies and TV shows. They exchanged numbers and promised to hang out sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse soon appeared and called out Samantha\u2019s name as she got up and walked into the office waving back at Lin as she left...The memory ended right after as John woke up in a cold sweat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around John saw it was morning. He was laying naked on his bed as he looked around for the clothes he had on last night. They were the only things not fully changed yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around however he couldn\u2019t find them. All he saw was a skimpy white mini dress where his clothes were. Along with the pink bikini that started all this...John saw it was even still glowing softly giving off a warm light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is....Ugh...\u201d John cried out as he gripped his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden pressure building up in his hips and butt he couldn\u2019t ignore as he struggled to the bathroom to see what was happening. </span></div></div>",

He practically waddled his way over to where the bathroom was, still as naked as before. So many thoughts were rushing through his head now, both at the pain and at the memory from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes...no sense.....\" he groaned before another shock went through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way over to the bathroom and barely keeping himself upright, he watched as the pressure continued to build and intensify. For a little bit, there wasn't anything too out of the ordinary other than his hips and butt looking smoother than usual, looking much like his legs in that regard. It almost felt like anticipating a shot at the doctors or something. The anticipation was as bad as the act itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, the pressure peaked, making him cry out a little bit and lose his grip on what he was holding on, making him fall on the carpet of the bathroom. Looking back, he could feel the bones suddenly shifting in his legs, breaking and reforging into new ones which wasn't comfortable at all. It slowly forced his legs apart, along with the excess fat growing in them as they grew ever larger. Sitting up a little, he placed his hands on his hips, feeling how much wider they were becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he barely had a chance to think about it, for it soon moved to his butt next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure there was just as intense, and he immediately moved his hands there to feel the soft flesh expanding like a balloon. For a while, he wondered if it was ever going to stop, although it felt longer than it really was. After a minute or so, the sensations finally stopped, allowing him to breathe finally. However, the damage was done, his legs forced into their new positions, and even the slightest movement seemed to wiggle his butt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is...insane....\" he groaned, stabilizing himself upright again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this was hard enough to process, but seeing Lin in that dream was also concerning. What was up with that? Was she suddenly becoming someone he had known before? He had just learned her name the other day. None of this was making much sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least things seemed to calm down for a second, although his radically different lower half looked so alien to him. He was still a man where it counted, but even that felt different compared to before, like he couldn't move it nearly as well as before.</span></div></div>",

His entire apartment had changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis once boring and simple one bedroom space was now a bright and vibrant and incredibly feminine apartment. Everything from the furniture, decor, and even his clothes had all become incredibly feminine and sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d John asked himself as he saw his clothes that he was wearing had changed as well so he had taken them off. He was still wearing the pink bikini as it refused to come off. It was also emitting a soft glow that felt warm to his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden knock on his door as he was curious who would be coming over this late. Looking through the peep hole he saw it was Lin from the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He called from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help!\u201d Lin said in an excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn reluctantly had no choice but to accept her help as he slowly opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help you adjust to the physical changes. They can be rather uncomfortable. I\u2019m also going to show you how to start living as a woman.\u201d Lin said as she carried a bag with her that she showed was full of beauty products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you meant help stop this!\u201d John said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s impossible silly. If you want your old life back the only way to become employee of the month. Get the highest compliments from customers and best sales for a month and you can void your new contract.\u201d Lin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was a bit surprised to hear that. There was a potential loophole out of this mess but it would involve indulging in this mess he was in. Or he could refuse and try to find his own way. </span></div></div>",

College was already planned of course, but his parents really wanted him to get a summer job, since he hadn't had one throughout High School. It was kind of a pain, but one he had to deal with he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in light on this, he started applying to many places. Sadly, a lot of them weren't working out. He expected that on some degree, but to be refused by almost everyone was somewhat demoralizing. Still, he kept sending resumes left and right, hoping for one to stick as he didn't really have much of a preference. Well, other than fast food. He didn't want to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even as June came around, nothing had panned out. At this point, he was pretty much just waiting to truly begin summer vacation right now. Right now, he was just playing games in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, at that moment, an e-mail chimed in. Curious, he put the game down for a second to take a look. Surprisingly, it was from one of the various companies he had applied to: Ewan Inc, one of the local businesses around town that was actually pretty well known. He clicked on the e-mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Mr. Adams,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reviewing your application and resume for our Receptionist position, we are delighted to inform you that you have been chosen by our HR division for the position. We would like you to begin this upcoming Monday at 8:00. Please reply to this e-mail if this is acceptable and if you have any further questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave a nice day,<br>\r\nEwan Inc Recruiter</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, he actually got the job? Despite his reservations about getting a job in the first place, it felt pretty cool to actually be accepted. Granted, he found it funny that he didn't need to interview. Maybe it was because it was entry-level? Or maybe that sort of stuff would happen when he went there at the time they requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, whatever the case, it meant he finally wouldn't have to deal with sending in dozens of resumes over the summer. He could actually relax a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" he smiled as he went down to go let his family know about it. They would surely be excited about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****A Couple Days Later****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday came pretty quickly, almost too quickly for John's taste. He had to get up earlier than he usually would for a summer day after all. Still, he was properly suited up and ready to get started on whatever this company would have for him. He'd surely have to make sure he was the right person for the job given this would be the first time they would be seeing him physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here goes,\" he took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked out and got to his car, starting it as he usually would as he began to head out of the neighborhood, making the 10-15 minute drive over to where Ewan Inc was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When John arrived at Ewan Inc. He was greeted with a sight he did not expect. The receptionist at the front office was one of the most beautiful and sexiest women he had ever seen. She was wearing a super tight low cut blouse that showed off her huge obviously doctor enhanced boobs. She had on a tiny business mini skirt and was wearing really tall high heels. She was wearing glasses almost ironically as her hair was beach blonde and her skin a tanned bronze. She had a ton of makeup on as she was putting on a bright pink lipstick when he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the counter John tried not to stare down her shirt as he cleared his throat to get her attention. She almost seemed to ignore him for a minute before finally looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there! Welcome to Ewan Inc! How can I help you?\u201d She said with a really bright and bubbly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Hi I\u2019m John Adams I\u2019m supposed to start today.\u201d John said a little awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh if course I was told you would be coming please this way! I\u2019m Stacy by the way it\u2019s nice to meet the person replacing me!\u201d She said with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...I\u2019m taking your job? Did you get promoted?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, even better, I got engaged!\u201d Stacy held up her hand showing a huge diamond ring on her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow congrats!\u201d John said a bit surprised. Her ring was huge it must have cost a fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Jack finally popped this question last weekend. He works here as a senior VP.\u201d Stacy said as she walked John through the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn noticed something odd about the office. There were lots of secretaries and other receptionists and all of there were gorgeous model quality women. They came in all various styles, blonde, brunette, readhead, white, black, Asian, etc. However each one could easily be on a magazine cover. They all seemed to be wearing the same kind of outfits too. Low cut tops with mini skirts and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wanted to say something but he decided to keep his mouth shut as Stacy led him into a board room with several men in suits waiting for him. Each of them looked like a young professional you might see in a suit catalog or Wall Street movie. Not a single one looked over 25. John was a decent looking guy but he felt really out classed here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome John.\u201d A man said standing up and shaking his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Jack, I hope Stacy showed you here Alright.\u201d He said with a deep baritone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded as Stacy winked at Jack and blew him a kiss before leaving. Jack then offered John a seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...I didn\u2019t know this was a receptionist position.\u201d John said not quite sure what the job was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we like to start off our new hires in something simple at first. Something we think they can handle. I would think of this as a jumping off platform. A change in life....\u201d He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...sure that makes sense.\u201d So when do I start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday. Stacy will show you the ropes. I just need your signature here. This is the job contract.\u201d Jack said offering him a form to sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn didn\u2019t think much of the form. Probably just tax agreements or something. He signed the form without even bothering to read it. The only thing he notice was the ink in the pen was a dark red...almost like blood. It would bother him normally if he didn\u2019t just notice a small cut on his hand....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent....thank you we will speak again soon.\u201d Jack said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded and ignored the cut for now. He was just anxious to make a good first impression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce John had left the office Jack turned back to his fellow executives. He held up the work contract as he suddenly gave an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright gentlemen. Our next beauty is here. Now we vote on what form to give her. Submit your photo proposals and we will begin...\u201d Jack said photos of beautiful women started to appear on the white board behind him. </span></div></div>",

Granted, he never had a job before, but still, this seemed pretty strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how all those men in suits were before, and how all the women are here....perhaps he was looking too far into it but something just didn't feel right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, John?\" Stacy turned back to him as they were walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? O-Oh it's nothing,\" John shook his head. \"Just thinking,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, right at that moment, he happened to look down at his right hand, and something caught his attention. Where did that little cut come from? Obviously it was nothing big. Heck he probably wouldn't have noticed it otherwise. Still, he wondered how he cut himself. Well, it would likely heal up soon anyway. Should be nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Stacy took him to where he had first met her: at the desk near the entrance to the building. Right as John followed her behind the desk, she turned the chair and offered it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" John nodded, smiling a bit and trying to look the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed her instructions, trying to just get a hand for how working here could be. Best he be cooperative and all. He wouldn't want to explain to his parents about making a terrible first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so everything in the job is here...\" she motioned to the computer. \"Though I bet you could already figure that. Let's set up a log in and password for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded, getting ready to type. Not like using a computer was anything new to him. However, as he was typing to her instructions, there was....a strange sensation in his hands, and not from typing too much. Heck he had barely even started at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is....Huh?!\" he cried out a bit louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his hands on the keyboard, something was happening. His hands were cracking loudly, like something was up with his bones inside. Wait....were they looking slimmer? They had to be! He could see it clear as day. They seemed to be getting smaller and softer right before his eyes! And that wasn't all, for as he turned his hands slightly in shock, his nails were starting to get longer too, going well past the tips of his fingers, seemingly getting a more manicured and feminine look in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I....hallucinating?\" John stuttered to himself. He...had to have hit his head somewhere along the way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright John? Ready to get that log in set up?\" Stacy smiled, as if nothing had happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seriously, this was starting to get really wierd. What did DYC even mean? Not any acronym you were aware of. Seriously, if you didn't know better, this was beginning to feel like some kind of supernatural horror movie. That couldn't be it though. That sort of thing just didn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stuff was all fiction. This was reality. Thus, the only logical explanation was that the stress was getting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....that has to be it,\" you reasoned to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was concerning all the same, even as you were getting ready to leave the restroom. However, right as you were about to, a sudden aching feeling in your feet. A pretty severe one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwwwww!\" you groaned, balancing yourself as you looked down. 'W-What the...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a horrible compression in your feet, like they were forcing themselves to be smaller. You couldn't clearly see your feet through your dress shoes, but it was evident all the same. Even your toes were starting the feel different, especially with your toenails. You could feel them growing, lightly pushing against the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...are...they getting smaller?' you asked yourself before shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that had to be a hallucination of sorts. Some kind of stress-induced problem. Your parents did say the first day on the job could he tough for someone new. Guess they were right about that. Granted, you weren't sure if pain was a reasonable part of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should get back....\" you tried to keep yourself calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right then, you felt another sensation, one that caused you to tumble and use the wall for balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what now....\" you groaned, getting kind of tired of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it seemed to be more about your shoes, which were starting to feel oddly conforming to your smaller feet. Your black dress shoes weren't changing color or anything, but the material definitely seemed to be hugging your feet more, while also becoming a lot thinner overall. The laces seemed to b vanishing, as was the tongue of the shoes, showing more of your feet even though they were still covered by your black dress socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay this is-Owww!\" you cried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, ths was even worse. Your feet were being forcibly arched, ad the shoes themselves were doing the same. A full heel grew out of the back, comparable to those that the other women here were wearing. Additionally, the front of the shoes opened up a bit, allowing your sock-clad toes some breathing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt.... definitely looked like you were wearing high heels, possibly with women feet underneath. You...weren't sure how to take this. The clacking sound they made in the ground made you very uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully Stacy knows something that can help with stress,\" you sighed, wanting this to be over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you finally left the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

They complimented your hands perfectly. Their small dainty size and sexy arches made they perfect for the heels you now wore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you left the bathroom you were walking strangely perfect in these heels which nobody seemed to notice. All the secretaries and other receptionists smiled at you as you walked by....except one...A busty redhead that reminded you of Jessica Rabbit looked to you with a rather odd stare as you passed her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the front door to the office as you wanted nothing more than to leave. However your new feet refused to listen to you. They seemed to be guiding you back to your desk where Stacy awaited you. You wanted to scream...call out for help....ANYTHING! However you found yourself unable to. It was like another part of you was telling you to just accept this and not to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy welcomed you back as she showed you a few things about company email and how to forward calls. You found yourself paying attention like this was really interesting for some reason....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a break in your mind for a minute you managed to pull yourself back as you grabbed the notepad from the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...excuse me. What does this mean. DYC? I see it everywhere.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question seemed to pause Stacy like she was in a movie...She stood there....frozen, not moving an inch for a minute as you saw something odd. A single tear....running down her face as one of her hands seemed to be making the motion that she needed to write something down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou handed her a pen and paper as she stood there frozen while her hand wrote something.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDes.........Yo...........Con..........\u201d She seemed to be unable to complete each of the words before she suddenly shook her head snapping out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry what were we talking about?\u201d She asked like nothing just happened....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to work hopeful at least as you learned something. DYC stood for something. It seemed something foul was happening here. The problem was the more your body changed the harder it got to fight it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of you felt a tingling in your feet again as you looked down. Your socks had vanished and it seemed your pants were getting shorter...</span></div></div>",

Sure, as much as you could believe that this was all one big dream or hallucination, things seemed to have progressed past that point by now. Everything just seemed strange now, especially the fact that it felt like you only had one hand on the wheel in regards to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you had noticed that your socks were gone, leaving your feet bare against the heels. Additionally, your pants were getting shorter. You were starting to get an idea of where things were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes...\" you muttered under your breath, no longer convinced that this was just stress at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour leggings continued to rise, exposing more of your legs in the process. As they did, you groaned as it felt like there were worms underneath your legs, messing with and shifting everything. You could visibly see the hairs you had on your legs begin to vanish, being replaced by smooth skin without any blemishes. Underneath all that, the tone of your muscles seemed to be shifting too. You were never the most toned man, but you were average at least. Now, your muscles seemed smoother as well, making for a rather sleek look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leggings continued to climb up, all the while beginning to come together. Your legs were forced together as they became a single legging: a skirt basically. It continued to rise, becoming similar to that of all the other women as it became very short, exposing a large part of your legs. Speaking of which, the smooth sensation continued to climb, doing the same to your thighs as they also became very womanly. Also, you couldn't tell for sure, but you wondered if your legs were slightly longer, or maybe it was just the angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, Stacy seemed to notice nothing wrong, just keeping that same smile on her face. However, she did excuse herself for a bit, since you seemed to be getting a grip on what was needed for the job. You were okay with it, since it didn't seem like she was any more help at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, and you witnessed the completion of your small business skirt, you looked at what she was able to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Des Yo Con?\" you said to yourself. \"What could that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't enough to make any concrete guess of what the words could be. Seriously, just a few more letters probably could have been enough to make a deduction. For now, it seemed like the changes stopped with your legs, so you didn't have to witness something like your hips and butt growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with the way things were going, that was only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta do something,\" you told yourself, fully committed to finding an answer now. \"I wish I could get away from this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, getting out seemed to be hard. You found it hard to move, other than the little bit of job work you were doing on the computer now. You wondered what sort of avenue you could use to move forward.</span></div></div>",

The thought of going into the ladies room still sounded weird to you, but considering everything that is going on, that was the least of your worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for the coast to be clear as you walked into the ladies restroom. Strangely being here didn\u2019t seem as weird for you anymore. You suddenly heard a clicking noise as you turned around to see her. It was the busty redhead who looked at you strangely before. She was locking the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you send the email?\u201d You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead didn\u2019t even seem to listen to you. She just looked around the stalls making sure you two were alone. She then turned to you before suddenly pushing you up against a wall....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me carefully.....what\u2019s your name? Your real name?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJonathan Samuel Adams. That\u2019s my full birth name. Most people just call me John or Johnny.\u201d You said a bit freaked out over her forceful nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen they made you sign your contract this morning. What did you write?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....I kinda just scribbled John Adams like I usually do?\u201d You said wondering why that matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead released you and sighed with relief. \u201cThen there is hope....Listen...my fate, your fate, and all the girls here are depending on you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe contract....the contract you signed in blood to work here....it\u2019s a curse. It turns us all into beautiful women. We forget ourselves and our whole lives are erased to become what they want us to be....we need your help...\u201d She said pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d You asked as the changes now made more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe curse....it has one weakness. In order to take full effect you must sign your name fully. You didn\u2019t write your full name so it\u2019s working much slower on you.\u201d The redhead said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I stop it and these changes?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead went to one of the bathroom stalls and showed you the same three letters etched into the side. DYC....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t....I cant say...more....the curse prevents us. This is all we can say....follow the clues please help us. You are running out of time. By the end of the day you will be female and by the end of the week the curse will take you. You can\u2019t let them win....\u201d She said turning to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease....I need more information. What is your name at least?\u201d You asked Before she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI....don\u2019t remember my old name. I am Ginger now. That\u2019s what they made me.\u201d Ginger said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ginger left you were alone in the ladies room. You now understood that these changes were not some kind trick but a very real and terrible curse affecting you and all the girls here. It was somehow tied to  your work contract. You had limited time to figure find a way to stop it.....</span></div></div>",

You looked down to where you felt the pressure, feeling it coming from your hips and butt. You groaned at the inevitability of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as you began to feel your hips bones cracking and reshaping, causing a little more pain than before. Your hips continued to push outwards. Fat deposits also began to form, pushing them out even further, being greatly exposed by the small skirt. In addition, the pressure in your butt continued to build. You groaned some more as you placed your hands on your butt, feeling it grow underneath, becoming as big as any other woman here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it, you pretty much looked like any other woman you had seen here from the bottom half, with the exception of your privates, which you had to imagine would be soon enough.

Anything to help you figure out the meaning to DYC or information on the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was gone for the moment so you took the opportunity to look up any information on curses you could fine on the internet. You saw information on legends, history, and rumors, but nothing concrete. Only half baked theory\u2019s certain people had. Nothing to help you here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat your legs were crossed in a very feminine fashion. You didn\u2019t even realize it yourself. It just seemed natural this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked up information your vision was beginning to get blocked. It was your hair. It kept getting in your eyes as you brushed it away again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a minute to realize what was happening...You stood up and rushed back to the bathroom as you entered the ladies room without realizing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the mirror and saw your dark brown hair was much longer! It was touching your shoulders and still growing. It itched as it continued to grow. It finally stopped mid way down your back as it grew wavy and fuller. Like you just went to the salon.It was also changing color. It began to get lighter and lighter. The color bleaching itself out as it became a very bright platinum blonde color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes you have model quality bright platinum blonde hair. It cascaded down your back perfectly almost touching the tip of your butt. It was obvious you were on track to become one of the sexiest ones here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give in....remember your name....\u201d you whispered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn...John...John....Jessica....Jessica.....John....\u201d Wait.....did you called yourself Jessica? You shook that right out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to leave when another girl walked in. She was a brunette with medium tanned skin and  long curly hair and medium sized breasts. Her blouse also showed off her midriff where she had a bellybutton piercing. She also had a nose piercing and several toe rings and normal rings. Out of all the girls here she seemed to be dressed the most provocative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at you for a second in the ladies room before she spoke. \u201cOh....my...god! I love your hair! It\u2019s so amazing and beautiful! You\u2019re Jessica right the new girl? I\u2019m Angela.\u201d She said offering her hand to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and shook it. Playing the part for now. If they saw you as one of them the executives wouldn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should come and meet the other girls. We were heading out for lunch there is this cute cafe right around the corner.\u201dShe said super cute and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, sure thank you.\u201d You said trying to be as natural as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to leave however you felt a tugging around your butt. Your underwear was still yours but it was beginning to change. If shrunk and slid up your body as it formed a pair of sexy black lacy panties. They were skimpy and fit perfectly well with the skirt you had on to where if you leaned down anyone could get a nice view of your beautiful butt. </span></div></div>",

Ugh, this was totally nuts. You hated whoever started this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are also how you wouldn't be the same physically before the day ended, and even as you typed along, awaiting lunch eventually, you groaned as the next set of changes was already happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach was already flatter thanks to your hips and butt taking up more fat, but now it gotten even flatter, especially at the waist. It forced itself inwards, causing you more pain as it made you twist a bit, arching your back until it formed a permanent curve back there. In addition to the usual skin smoothness, it extended to your arms, smoothing and toning them like your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the changes were barely going you any time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate.... I'll barely have any time at all,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to believe it was midday already. Everything you knew had been turned upside down, and you had little to go on.

However, it was not the big change you expecting. Rather, it was your dress shirt, with the sleeves shortening and the garment getting tighter. The Hem was coming up, showing a tiny bit of middrif. The buttons lined up, except for many near the top.

She wasn\u2019t afraid to talk smack and get into arguments. She had the largest breasts, full DDs, and really wide curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela was the slutty girl. She had the most piercings and talked almost exclusively about sex. She mentioned how she also had multiple piercings in each ear as well as her....private areas. She had the most avaerage body at just C cup breasts and fairly average figure, but she made up for it being the most sexually aggressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya the black girl was the talker. She loved to talk and talk. She had a comment for everything. She had modest C cup breasts but a huge large round butt that none of the other girls came close to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Mei was the quiet girl. She was easily the smallest and shortest Girl here at barely 5 feet tall. She had the smallest breasts at only B cups but her skin was the smoothest. It was like porcelain to the touch. Pure, milk white with no flaws at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure how you fit in yet. All you knew was you had the brightest hair being a pure platinum blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all seemed to be great friends. They laughed and talked with each other. The common topics were guys, clothes, sexy outfits and lingerie, debating with each other over who was the cutest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and nodded to almost everything they said.

Going over to the mirror you pulled off your blouse to see what you feared most, your breasts were growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to pulse and grow. The skin beneath stretching and swelling as your nipples grew larger. Within seconds they were already A-cups and getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached B-cups in seconds and quickly pushed into C cups. They were nicely rounded and perky too. They continued to grow however reaching a large D cup and then grew even larger pushing a full DD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hung heavy from your chest dangling as you panted at the growth. You thought this was enough but there was one more change....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new large breasts soon began to shift and bubble. The flesh underneath changing in shape and feel as they began to rise higher off your chest. They lost their natural shape as they grew rounder and rounder rising higher and getting firmer and perkier with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pushed out even larger as they became perfectly round huge globes....Perfectly rounded breasts. Even bigger than Ginger\u2019s as they looked like the kind of perfect breasts a porn star would have. There was no way anyone would believe they were natural.</span></div></div>",

The massive globes on your chest were incredible, and not in a good way. No wonder your blouse seemed to leave so much room for them. The size was one thing, but the complete circular shape they had only added to your shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just....what am I becoming?\" you said in worry. Seriously, just what kind of woman were you turning into? This was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you tried to figure that out though, another wave hit you, and this time the aching feeling was all on your face. You knew it would happen but you still groaned and cried about it, just barely keeping your eyes open as you witnessed the change in the mirror. Part of you didn't want to, but you kind of wanted to see it happen in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, your skull seemed to round out a bit, with your jawline causing some discomfort as it changed shape. Your cheeks rose higher, while your lips plumped out a bit into something kissable. Moving up, your nose became smaller and cute, while your eyes rounded with longer eyelashes and smaller eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, you had a woman's face, not a trace of your old male face left. You were looking at a completely different person, mostly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This....I really hate this....\" you groaned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you had no choice but to go back, though getting your blouse back on took some doing. You didn't even have a bra for them, and they looked like they could pop right out any time. Sighing, you straightened things out before leaving the bathroom. You didn't even want to think about the changes to come, especially downstairs.</span></div></div>",

Asking you questions and getting your opinion on how they looked. In fact every questions they asked you was how they could improve some part of themselves or what clothes to wear to make themselves look better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like every girl there was jealous or envious about some part of you. You were like the platinum standard that set the bar for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that it hit you....you knew what your place in the group was turning into....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were becoming the flawless girl. Almost like you were sculpted to perfection. The one the others girls would all look at. The one all the men wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this because you were resisting the curse? Maybe this was their way of getting back at you? They were giving you the most beautiful body here for a reason. A way to distract you and prevent you from stopping the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you spoked and talked with the girls you found yourself slipping into character a little more. You giggled and laughed at hair jokes and even smiled and blushed at their compliments. You didn\u2019t even realize the last thing that made you a man was slipping away....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a tugging between your legs as you didn\u2019t bother to fully notice that your manhood was shrinking and sliding up inside you. Replacing itself with a wet and warm slit....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce lunch ended and you stood up you felt the strange absence between your legs. Part of you was terrified the other part...relieved. At least now your body was now complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you went back to your desk Ginger slid you a note before leaving. Opening it you read the quick message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body is finished, now the urges will and desires begin.

Of course, you kept slipping into character and joining along with the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccassionally you would get a glance from Ginger, but it wouldn't last long and she'd go back to her typical self soon enough.

Your entire apartment had changed. The decor, color, furniture, clothing. Everything was changed to match the body you had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to your room you found your drawers and closets filled to the brim with sexy clothes. Your shoe rack was almost exclusively heels. All your underwear was skimpy and sexy. Everything you had seemed to show off your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you should have realized this was going to happen.

Even in this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a tank top and a pair of yoga short to wear to bed. This was the most conservative thing you could find so it would have to do. Because of the heavy weight and size of your breasts wearing a bra to bed was out of the question. You managed to avoid looking at yourself too much as the temptation to have some....\u201dself-exploration\u201d time was tugging at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling into bed you closed your eyes but not before a strange tingling sensation began to creep up inside you....You tried to ignore it as you closed your eyes.</span></div></div>",

If you caved now, then you could probably forget about the rest of the week. You might not live to see tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling, you continued to try fighting it even as you twisted and turned in bed.

They can change you, your memories, and your desires. However they can\u2019t take away your free will. They cannot touch you or force you to do anything against your will. If they do the curse is broken....This is why you must resist your desires. If you give in to them you will lose yourself...That\u2019s their plan...Make you so sexy and so Horney you eventually give in and embrace your new body.....I should have told you this....I used to be one of the executives. My name was Gary and I helped change many people like you into sex goddesses. When I finally realized the evil of what we were doing I tried to free the girls but....I let my emotions get the better of me and I was tricked into signing a contract like yours....Remeber DYC....it means....Destroy Your Contract.\u201d It\u2019s the only way to remove the curse. However contracts cannot be simply torn, burned, and destroyed like normal paper. You have to find your blood contract first, they are hidden somewhere on the top floor. Once you find it you have to find.......Aaaaahhhh!\u201d The line suddenly went dead as all you heard was her scream....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis message hit you like a ton of bricks. Ginger had been one of those executives....She tried to rebel and paid the price. Now she wouldn\u2019t be around to help you. Her last gift of information was the last clue you needed. Your contract was the key. However not only did you have to find it you had to find a way to Destroy it. Meanwhile your body and desires were only going to get sexier and stronger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and remembered what you had to do. Your new body be damned...right?

If you had to guess, Sam would likely approach you sometime, especially since you were his secretary from today onwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you finally entered the workplace. Stacy passed by you, waving hello and all that as happily as she usually did. You did the same, not betraying anything of what you knew. You would really have to ride the line between yourself and \"Jessica\" to avoid any suspicion. In any case, you got to where you needed to go now, and that was the desk just situated outside of Sam's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...not bad,\" you said, noting the clean desk as you sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, this dress was really something. It was like wearing nothing in all honesty, yet part of you seemed to like that. Those random thoughts of liking these changes, plus imaging dates with Sam, seemed to plague your mind from time to time. Guess you'd have to deal with it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Jessi,\" Sam suddenly showed up, smiling like nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning!\" you smiled back, getting into character again. \"How is your morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All good so far, thanks,\" Sam nodded. \"Nothing new for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! All same old same old,\" you smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Sam replied, before turning and heading to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew....well at least he didn't give any indication of knowing anything was wrong. Yet, you couldn't relax. You'd have to make sure you didn't go out of line, otherwise you might tip them off. Perhaps playing the part will make them think Ginger's attempts yielded nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of made you wish you had someone else to talk to, if for nothing else than to keep your mind off things for a bit as you worked.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a plain white  shirt and PJ bottoms with flip flops. Her normal shoulder length hair had been cut to just below her ears. She wasn\u2019t wearing any make up. She didn\u2019t look sexy at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing you noticed was her eyes. They were puffy and red like she had been crying. She was sniffing and wiping tears and mucus from her face. The female part of you was grossed out and also sad as you wondered why she looked so sad and upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered something. Mei and Ginger were really close when you hung out with the girls. Mei was normally the quiet one. She also had the least extreme sexual body. She was really cute but not overly sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mei....What\u2019s wrong?\u201d You asked as she walked by your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei was carrying a note in her hands. As she looked over to you. \u201cPlease.....Ginger was my one friend here. When I heard they took her I couldn\u2019t help it....I had...I wanted to show some kind of defiance. I thought...if I showed them I\u2019m more than just their doll, that they would listen and bring her back....but....\u201dMei said as she handed you the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time you had seen Mei break character. Not only that she was having a nervous breakdown. She had slashed her hair and come in looking terrible on purpose as an act of defiance and it seemed the executives had taken notice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the note you were surprised it was addressed to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Jessica, we ask for your assistance in helping our dear friend Mei. She is having a really troubling day and she needs a friend. To make herself feel better Mei has decided to undergo a few elective procedures with her appearance. She has decided to let her hair grow out. She has decided to never cut it again...So we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if next tine we saw her, her hair was longer than her body! She has also decided to get breast implants. She loves the idea of perfect round breasts and wants ones just like yours....She wants longer nails, wider hips, longer legs, oh...and a much bigger butt....She has also decided that mini dresses like yours and heels are her new favorite outfit....We hope you help Mei through this transition period and show her all the amazing benefits to your looking your best....unless...you have some reason why she wouldn\u2019t like these new changes....unless you would want them instead? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the note as your eyes suddenly widened. You realized now why Mei was really crying....Her act of protest was going to cost her dearly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease....Help....\u201d Mei said as a tear ran through her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now in a difficult delima....They were testing your character....If you said nothing Mei would change even more and become even more sexualized....If you revealed the truth of DYC to Mei they would know Ginger got to you....This would Mark you as a threat and then you would undergo those changes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of having hair longer than your body, even longer nails, bigger boobs, wider curves etc. you couldn\u2019t barely handle what you had now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could take Mei to the restroom now and do as the note said....You stay in character and you take Mei to the restroom. You watch her change into an even more sexual version of herself.  With huge fake boobs like yours, floor length hair, longer nails, even wider curves and wearing an even skimpier dress and heels. You encourage the change and get excited for her like this is a gift. They want you to become her new best friend, show her all the benefits of being incredibly sexual....In a way give her one last chance and take this new body as a punishment and last warning..:..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease....\u201d Mei said again as you saw her short hair was aldready beginning to grow again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make a choice let Mei take the punishment changes or reveal the truth to her and take them for her....</span></div></div>",

He is taking over for Ginger.\u201d She said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a second....You looked to David as you realized something....You knew him! David was a guy you went to high school with! He was a really nice well built Asian guy who played lots of soccer. You shared a few classes together and knew each other pretty well. You hadn\u2019t talked in years but you recognized him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David reached out and shook your hand he obviously had no idea who you were....Your new body made it impossible for anyone to recognize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back and shook his hand as you wanted to scream at him. You wanted to yell \u201cGet Out!\u201d As loud as you could but you knew you couldn\u2019t blow your cover....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy led David to the conference room where the executives were waiting for him....You knew all to well what was about to happen...A few minutes later David left shaking their hands as you noticed a familiar cut on his finger...You could still warn him....Mayne prepare him for the changes?

What are the odds of them hiring another student from the high school you just graduated from a day after you were hired?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made you wonder if it was a decision made to test whether or not you would break character. Obviously someone you recognized would incite a reaction from you, more so than some stranger. You had nothing to prove if it was truly a plan or just coincidence, but you wouldn't put it above those conniving bastards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, you wondered how to proceed from here. Seeing Ginger's empty seat filled you with dread. What did they do to her? She...wasn't dead right? Would they really go that far? That was certainly a scary thought. It made you wonder just how many guys had been transformed here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, even as you watched David, you knew you couldn't do anything for now, as much as you really wanted to. Acting now would probably put you in hot water and make it impossible for you to make good on what Ginger entrusted you with. It really sucked, and you hated the idea of David transforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made your goal of getting to the bottom of this case all the more important. For your sake. For David's. For Ginger's. For all the other women here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, at one point, you had noticed Mei as she walked by. Perhaps it was a trick of the light, but she gave a brief odd look in your direction before walking off. It was a split second look, but it reminded you of Ginger when she looked at you the other day. Hmm, that got you thinking, but that would be for another time. For now, you had to play the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jessi!\" Stacy suddenly showed up, with David close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Stacy?\" you smiled back, staying in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get some work done, so I was wondering if you could train David for a bit.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Now you were convinced they were doing everything possible to make sure you knew nothing of Ginger's words to you. Putting David right in your hands like this, but unable to act out.</span></div></div>",

Giving you a really odd look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something wrong David?\u201d You asked looking to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...it\u2019s just....In getting a weird feeling that we have met before.

You wanted to tell him to run while he could before it was too late....But it seemed like it already was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood behind David as your eyes widened. His hair was already getting longer. It was beginning to grow past his ears and brush his neck as it continued to grow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to speak up but you couldn\u2019t...You had to keep your cover as you were forced to stand by and pretend nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went back to training David you saw one of the Executives Walk by with an angry look on his face. He stopped by your deck as he seems to be holding a piece of paper in his hands. You managed to sneak a small look at it as you realized it was David\u2019s contract!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me David..:Just looking at your contract here what\u2019s your full name again?\u201d The executive asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid Lee Ayoma, but I go by David Lee.\u201d He said as his contact was signed David Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...thank you.\u201d You said trying to hide his anger. You couldn\u2019t help but smile as you knew without a full signature they wouldn\u2019t be able to fully control David. You might be able to team up with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there was another side effect. Without a full signature David would begin to notice his changes. The curse would prevent him from leaving or speaking out about them but he would start to notice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact as you thought this David had already stood up and bolted to the restroom as he went in the ladies room not even realizing it like you did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to follow him in. You could still stay in character if you needed but if the coast was clear you might able to reveal your true self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly slipped away from your desk as you went to the ladies room to see a panicked David looking at himself in the mirror. His hair was now even longer than yours! His jet black hair now all the way past his butt and touching the back of his knees. His hands had also changed and his shoes seemed to be next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the restroom David immediately turned to you as....</span></div></div>",

It made you wonder if that was the same look you had when transforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First...I need you to relax as much as possible,\" you said, coming over after looking back for a second to make sure no one else was there. \"First of all....it's me. John Adams. We went to the same high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" David asked, clearly confused. \"How can that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when we had the same math class?

Look at this!\u201d David said as he spun around as his super long jet black hair flowed behind him like a cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes....that\u2019s exactly what you have to do. Trust me it only gets worse. No matter what don\u2019t give in to your desires. Don\u2019t touch yourself or any of the executives. They can\u2019t touch us or force us to do anything against our will. That\u2019s the one weakness. They simply make us so sexy and so horney eventually we give in....That\u2019s when we are lost.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll....try....it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know how to handle all this.\u201d David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither...I\u2019m just Taking this one step at a time.\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you soon left the bathroom and went back to your desk like nothing had happened. You began to show David more aspects of the job as he tried his best to forget everything and just focus on work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes progressed for David he tried everything he could to ignore them. His shoes had already morphed into a pair of sexy black heels and his outfit was beginning to fuse together. It looked like his black suit was beginning to reshape into a mini dress similar to yours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy soon approached your desk as he smiled at the two of you. \u201cHey there Danni, how\u2019s it going? Is Jessi doing a good job showing you around?\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed they were already looking to him like a female....David or rather Danni looked up and smiled. Ignoring the fact his suit was gone as he was now wearing a black mini dress just like the white one you had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...it\u2019s great. Jessi is going a great job.\u201d He said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really like your dress by the way. It\u2019s like a yin and yan thing going on here. Hey why don\u2019t we go out with the girls for lunch? Same usual place?\u201d Stacy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized what this meant as the two of you both agreed to go with no objections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni sat there both upset and terrified as he looked down at himself. His feet and legs had already changed. They were now perfectly feminine and very sexy showing off his tanned Asian skin perfectly. His toenails were also painted black to match his hair which was now braiding itself into a long braided ponytail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d They are gonna treat us like girls and ask us girly questions.\u201d Danni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust...just go with it. If what she said is any indication she gave away their plan for you.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat plan?\u201d Danni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou notice how all the girls here seem to fit some kind of model? I was planned as the Barbie girl. Total blonde sex bomb. That\u2019s why I have the big fake tits and platinum hair. They are going to do the same for you but use our history together against us. Your body is going to look very similar to mine but they are going to make us like best friends, almost sisters. This way our memories will start to blur and change faster....\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later the two of you left for lunch with the girls. Very similar to how you finished your change Danni was already looking almost totally feminine expect for his chest, butt, and privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch the girls began to chat like they usually did as Stacy suddenly turned to the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is it true? The two of you are practically sisters? Growing up together...going to school together...even modeling your bodies to look similar but with the whole black and white routine? I heard...you even got your boob jobs done on the same day and to be the same size?\u201d Stacy said with a smile as the other girls giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni was nervous...terrified he didn\u2019t know what to say. To make it worse he could feel a pressure building up in his chest...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frankly, just thinking about it made you wonder if you were beginning to think like the other women here. You had been here barely even two days, yet you talked like an expert on the subject. Kind of strange when you think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, it made you realize just how robotic the other girls sounded when Stacy so plainly described what exactly you and Danni were going to be like to each other. It sounded less like a question and more like a statement, like she was a therapist telling you how you were supposed to think about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, it was likely Stacy's way of giving you both a heads up on what to expect, so it wasn't like you could blame her. All the more reason to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Danni's changes were indeed happening similar to yours. It was kind of disturbing to actually see his grow much like your own, stretching out the mini dress to the point where it barely held them. Still, you couldn't deny that he was quite the Asian beauty, like the kind of you'd see online. You weren't fond of thinking that of David, but it was hard to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, Danni actually seemed to get into character as it happened, laughing it off and apparently enjoying having a similar body type to your own. It was at this time that even his butt grew to match your own, so your curves were the same now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls all giggled and enjoyed Danni's little act, though you noticed the slight horror in his eyes after he stopped talking. It was the first time he really slipped into character after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" you whispered to him. \"Just stay aware and hopefully we won't have too many problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni nodded slightly as he just watched the other women talk. That's kind of how it went for the rest of the lunch.</span></div></div>",

Danni played her character perfectly as she even began to walk and talk just like the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell from the look in her eyes how much she hated it. What surprised you was how well she slipped into character. There were times you forgot she was even acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day played out like you expected. Danni completed her change fully by the end of the day. Her body now just like yours.  Stacy came by several times to check on you as the two of you played your parts to perfection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to write a few notes to Danni warning her of the internal changes and to expect her apartment to be totally different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing you didn\u2019t expect was how your body was reacting to hers. It was getting hotter and more sensitive. As a guy a girl like Danni would have been your dream girl as it seemed your body was still responding to that desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to fantasize about the two of you together or even the two of you together with someone else....like Sam?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook those thoughts out of your mind doing everything you could to stay focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the day finally ended you were glad as you your mind wouldn\u2019t stop hitting you with more and more dirty thoughts. You said goodbye to Danni and the girls hoping tomorrow the two of you could work on a plan to get your contracts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were back in your apartment your body and mind wouldn\u2019t leave you alone. The urges and desires constantly bothering you. You resisted the urges at all costs as you decided maybe a cold shower would help. Jumping in the cold water seemed to calm your nerves a bit but only just a little. Stepping out of the shower you threw a towel around your body as you went to go changed when suddenly your doorbell rang....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho could that be this late?\u201d You asked yourself as you checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Danni! She looked scared and terrified. Strangely she was wearing a trenchcoat over her body. Without thinking you opened up the door still just wearing your towel you opened the door for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanni What\u2019s wrong?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m....sorry....I\u2019m sorry Jessi I wasn\u2019t as strong as you. I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to do it.\u201d She said as tears were streaming from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled for a moment to think of what she meant before your eyes widened. \u201cYou touched yourself didn\u2019t you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni nodded in shame as she opened her trench coast. She was wearing the same black mini dress as before but something had changed. It had somehow gotten even sexier. The fabric in the middle had opened up exposing her bellybutton and flat stomach. The fabric on the sides had also opened up as slots had formed on both sides on the dress to expose more skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already long hair which was held in a long braided pony tail was now even longer. Braided it now touched her ankles which meant if she let it down fully it would be longer than her body. Her boobs had gotten even bigger, her nails longer, and her heels seemed even taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry....I couldn\u2019t resist....I kept...I kept thinking about you.....\u201d She said as without warning she suddenly lunging at you. She began kissing you deeply as her hands undid your towel and dropped it to the ground as her hands began roaming your breasts and body....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure was overwhelming.....unlike anything you had ever experienced as a guy. Part of you wanted nothing but for this to continue but....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout all your strength you managed to push her off as you breathed heavily barely controlling yourself as you shit the door before you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Danni....we can\u2019t...we have to.....\u201d You said pausing as you suddenly felt a bit funny </span></div></div>",

The immediate thought of that sent a chill through your body. Surely you didn't really succumb to urges right then and there right? It barely lasted any time at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....what did I do....?\" Danni cried, hands over her mouth while she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything, you grimaced, feeling sensations flowing through your body. Though, it wasn't nearly as painful as it was the first time around, as it didn't seem like too much was changing as far as body structure. The only thing truly alarming was that, as you looked down, it appeared as if your skin was changing color slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it was, about the same color as Danni's skin now. You began to wonder what was going on, until a flash of your hair flew int your face, and you could see it darkening before your eyes, turning raven black. The cogs in your head began to work, and you tried to look for a reflective surface. Thankfully one wasn't too hard as you felt a sensation around your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight there, you grimaced as you saw your facial structure change slightly, the most noticeable change being to your eyes as they got a more distinct Asian slant to them. Actually, your face as a whole began to look familiar....it was like Danni's without a doubt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you got back up...it was like you and Danni were looking into a mirror...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh....\" Danni said, shocked of course. \"I'm...I'm so sorry....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay....\" you stuttered out, surprised a bit at your slightly different voice. \"At least...I don't think this is the worst thing...I mean, I have no idea why this happened....but it's better than the alternative at least..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni nodded a bit, and you let her in to calm down after everything. Boy, this was getting real crazy. You both needed a plan soon, especially if Danni was going to have more trouble than you were. Got to say, being a twin was pretty strange. You were a good few years older than your younger sister back at your old house.</span></div></div>",

Your huge fake boobs still blocked your vision and your hourglass shape was still a sexual marvel to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real noticeable differences besides skin color and general appearance was the hair. Before your hair was long but stopped at your mid back. Now your hair was longer than your actually body when let fully down. It actually touched the floor as you walked. Luckily if you braided it in a long ponytail like Danni did it would stop just at your ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the body differences was something you could manage the other consequences of Danni\u2019s actions were not something you could predict....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you Thought you were actually fortunate with this new change.

Either way it made dealing with your body a lot easier....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this victory was short lived....shortly after no noticed your whole apartment was changing. The decor, layout, and design. Your guest room became a filled bedroom and everything in your seemed to change as well. It seemed Danni now lived here with you as her stuff seemed to pop up everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you noticed was the new incredibly powerful sexual desires coursing through your body. Danni touching you like awoke your buried desires as you moaned leaning up against as wall. Danni was stuck to as she touched and groped her new body as you told her to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni stood up slowly as she struggled to control herself....\u201dI\u2019m sorry Jessi, I have to....I need it....I can\u2019t control it....\u201d She said before leaving the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no....\u201d You looked to your phone as it seemed a group message had been sent out. The office girls and several executives were meeting up at a dance club...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni had already left as you were still there nude in your apartment. Do you get dressed and go after her? Try and bring her home, or do you let her go knowing she will lose herself?</span></div></div>",

Honestly, trying to talk her out of it was a waste of time. It was like she wasn't listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you had to concentrate on getting your own body under control.

You saw all the girls from the office wearing the sluttiest outfits they could get away with. Each one of them grinding up against one of the executives. Your body seemed to almost immediately react to it as you felt a warm tingling sensation spreading throughout your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to find your sister....You meant...Danni....no...Wait...David. Why was it getting so hard to remember who she really was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed through the crowds of people trying to find her. It was so busy you struggled to get though anywhere as you didn\u2019t see her on the main floor. You checked th bar, the tables, restroom, nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there beautiful....\u201d You suddenly heard coming from behind you. Spinning around your eyes widened in fear as you saw the one person you had hoped to avoid...Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing there looking sexier then you had ever seen him before. Your body instantly reacted to his presence as your nipples hardened as a heat began building between your legs. It was then you realized your mistake...You weren\u2019t wearing panties! You had simply been in such a rush all you through on was your dress and heels before running out the door. This was making it even harder to resist your urges as Sam had your cornered against a wall...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m....Im just looking for my sister.\u201d You said trying not to pant or show any desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...Danni? She is with my twin brother Steve.\u201d Sam said as he gestured you to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwin brother? I didn\u2019t know you were also a twin.\u201d You said. You began to think perhaps this was a reaction to your latest change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes....he and your sister hit things off quite well. I was a bit disappointed when you two didn\u2019t show up together. I\u2019ve been thinking about you a lot recently.\u201d Sam said as he looked back to you with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...thank you. I\u2019m flattered.\u201d You said trying to control your urges. The heat and thriving between your legs was almost agony at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam led you upstairs to the private VIP lounge where several private room were. You could only guess what they were for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening one of the doors Sam pointed inside as you could see the river of dark hair you knew would lead to your sister. Following it inside you gasped at what you saw....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni was there laying on a bed naked with Steve besides her. They were barely conscious basking in the afterglow of what could only be described as the best sex of their lives....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene sent shockwaves through your body. You almost moaned just by imagining yourself in her place. You actually felt jealous for the first time as you wanted to have this pleasure more than anything....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took every ounce of strength you had to tear yourself away. Danni was lost but there was still hope for you. Leaving the room in a hurry you found an empty hallway as you leaned against the wall your body aching and more sensitive than ever....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just needed time alone to calm yourself before.....You saw Sam at the end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem troubled Jessi? Are you okay?\u201d He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...fine...I....just...need to.....\u201d You said turning to leave. You began to push past Sam when you suddenly slipped....You had slipped on your own hair! It was braided right? How? Somehow your hair had been let out of its braided ponytail so you had slipped on it with your heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a scene from a movie. You were falling backwards about to collapse when all of sudden Sam\u2019s arms scooped you up. He held you in his arms as your smaller body. Your arms instinctively wrapped around his neck as you looked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there....watch out.\u201d He said with a smile....that damned beautiful smile you couldn\u2019t resist....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t stop yourself....not this time....as much as you wanted to you felt yourself leaning up and your lips locked with his....</span></div></div>",

It sickened you all the same...and even more so how you seemed to be falling for it just like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, when you came to, you weren't sure of what time it was. From what you could tell, it was still the club. You felt exhausted that was for sure, and the sight of Sam only confirmed it. Was he asleep? You couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god....\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even want to think of what you just did. Although....did it seem like you were thinking more clearly now? Huh, you were. Perhaps that outlet was enough to finally get out some of that passion for a while. That was the most sense you could make out of this anyway. Well, you weren't going to complain one way or another. With that, you were sure you didn't want to hang around any longer than you already did.

To your shock she was sitting there on her bed. She was naked, her knees up to her chest as she wrapped her arms around them. Her hair flowing over her body like a black river. She seemed to be clutching something tightly in her hands....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanni? Are you okay?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni looked up slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry....I wasn\u2019t strong enough to stop myself.

I slipped up too trying to save you. Sam found me and well....neither of us is innocent tonight.\u201d Was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce it was all over my mind came back. I was able to think clearly and I remembered him saying something. He said something about protecting the contracts. Steve mumbled in his sleep so I went to check his clothes and found this...\u201d Danni said opening her hand as a small key was in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this opens the cabinet where the contracts are held....\u201d Danni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you jumped for a brief second. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! There is just one problem. Even if we find them we won\u2019t be able to destroy them. We don\u2019t know the secret.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...like I said Steve mumbled a lot....I heard him say his brother knows the secret....\u201d Danni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened at the possibility. If you could seduce Sam again. Give him the most amazing sexual experience of his life. You might be able to get him to accidentally reveal the secret of Destroying the contracts....However there was a serious risk here. You could lose yourself before he reveals the secret. While sex gives you a temporary relief from the urges every time they return they come back stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of discussed any other ways to try and get Sam to reveal the secret. Nothing else made sense. There was also another problem. Tomorrow was Saturday and therefore no one was at work. You would have to use this weekend to seduce him somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the beach?\u201d Danni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it? What\u2019s Sam\u2019s weakness? His pride! Why do you think he turned your body into this? Huge fake tits, super long hair? Hourglass figure? He doesn\u2019t just a sexy trophy girlfriend....he wants the sexiest most trophy sex obsessed and beautiful girl possible....We can use that against him....Tonorrow at the beach there are hosting a contest. I\u2019m kind of ashamed but I planned to go when I was still a guy...They are hosting a type of beauty contest. They take a bunch of sexy women and make them compete in a bunch of silly challenges to be crowned queen of the beach. There is a bikini pageant, wet t shirt contest, high heel competition, and dance off. The winner gets a bunch of prize money and local fame. It\u2019s mostly just a giant sexy party, buts it\u2019s exactly what we need.\u201d Danni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified of the idea of doing anything like that in public. It was one thing while at work but other people seeing you like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam is smarter than Steve. He won\u2019t reveal anything to you even by accident unless he is convinced you are totally turned.You take him to the beach tomorrow and play off like you are his new hot girlfriend. You see the contest, you ask to participate do you can prove you are the sexiest girl here. You work your butt off, win that competition and take him back here where you give him the sexual experience of his life....Once your mind is clear you whisper to him to reveal how to destroy those contracts. He will think he is dreaming and reveal the truth. Then on Monday we go and free ourselves and the other girls from this curse....\u201d Danni said finishing up her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean....it could work...it\u2019s just....What if I lose myself. I lost control today what happeneds if I can\u2019t control myself tomorrow. I\u2019m slipping already I can barely remember who I really am.\u201d You said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI Believe in you...\u201d Danni said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay....lets try it.\u201d You said nodding. </span></div></div>",

You could only hope that you would still be able to come back after another round of sexual passions with Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it did seem like the only real option. You had little alternative and you needed to get to the bottom of this fast. How much longer did you have in the week Ginger said you had? You had lost track by this point, but it couldn't be much longer. The next Monday might be pushing the end if you weren't careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you and Danni tried to have a somewhat normal night until you went to bed, ignoring as much as you could about your body. Soon enough, the next morning came and Danni helped you get everything you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Danni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, no,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Danni nodded. \"Just remember that it's for the best. This works and hopefully we can save ourselves and everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...and then hopefully get a job that's less shady,\" you smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Danni smiled and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you both made your way to the beach some time later. Already you could see all the sexy women about, though most weren't nearly as sexualized as you were. You had a feeling winning wouldn't be too much of a problem. Hopefully Sam would fall for it.</span></div></div>",

The part of you that was Jessi wanted nothing more than to show off her body and win this competition. The other part of you wanted to run as fast as you could away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the beach you were wearing jean shirt shorts and a tank top with your swimsuit underneath along with flip flops. It was probably the most modest outfit you had worn yet. Something you found ironic considering you were about to embrace the sexiest side of you possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already messaged Sam about meeting you here. Making sure to sound as girly as possible and to make sure no part of you could be detected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni was by your side as she tried to encourage you the best way she could. In the distance you could see Sam as you smiled and winked to him before turning to Danni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember....it\u2019s just one night....you give in this once. Then we fix this forever.\u201d Danni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking deep breaths you nodded. You were still terrified and nervous but you knew this was the best option for everyone, not just you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive in....just for now...\u201d You whispered to yourself as you ran up to Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let instincts take control as you ran up to him and jumped in his arms. He caught you with ease as you leaned in and kissed him deeply. The part of you that hated this was beginning to slip away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there beautiful.\u201d Sam said as he held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there sexy. Thanks for meeting me today. You wanna see my new swimsuit I got it just for you.\u201d You said jumping out of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled to you as you slid down your shorts and pulled off your tank top to reveal your new bikini. It was an all white bikini that seemed tailor made to fit your body. It showed off your huge fake boobs perfectly barely covering them while making sure they still supported. Your bottoms were little more than a G-String and tiny patch of material that barely covered your feminine slit. You were wearing about the most revealing thing you were legally allowed too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh....very nice. So how are you feeling?\u201d Sam asked almost probing your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing! Last night was sooo good I can\u2019t wait till I get you all to myself tonight...\u201d You said biting your lip as your hand rubbed his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...me too.\u201d He said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the contest starts soon, I can\u2019t wait to show all these girls who the sexiest one here is.\u201d You said jumping with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I already know who is.\u201d Sam said pleased with your responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading over to the contest area the first contest was a bikini show off. You stood up with the other girls showing off your good to the crowd. Spinning around, pushing your boobs together, giggling and laughing at the crowd. All the girls there were very pretty but you and your outfit stole the show. Easily taking first prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to ignore the fact that your body was almost in auto-pilot at this point. Your desires and urges so strong you just let go and embraced this side of you for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next contest was a weird t shirt contest which you stole easily. Your boobs were so big that no one even came close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next contest was a high heel competition. Basically who could move the quickest wearing four inch heels. Fortunately your body had adapted so well to heels at this point you almost preferred them. You outpaced all the other girls there with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final contest was a dance off. Now you had no formal dance experience but when they say dance they really meant pole dance....You relaxed and let go and just let your body move naturally which was apparently enough to steal the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the contest you had been crowned the winner as Sam couldn\u2019t look more happy with his prize as he smiled to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping down off stage you wrapped your arms around Sam as you kissed him deeply. You weren\u2019t even sure if you were in control right now....You felt so amazing, so sexy, you wanted this feeling to last forever...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to endure more changes than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, things seemed to be working out well. The rest of the day proceeded as smooth as you could ask for, and you eventually ended up at Sam's place, which was a rather nice place you had to admit. Sadly, you also had to figure how he even got such a place. No doubt a sizable amount of money came from all the women around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you played your part as well as you could, holding on to your belief that things would finally work out in your favor. You could get the info you need, finish the plan with Danni, and hopefully save yourselves, the other women, and Ginger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Sam smirked in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the evening was reaching its inevitable conclusion. Okay, time to let all that emotion out. You convinced yourself that you had to unleash everything you had during this to achieve what you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, things proceeded from there. You followed him to his bedroom, where inevitably all clothes were shed. Honestly, this disgusted you beyond all reason to pleasure this man so, but it was a necessary evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you proceeded to give Sam all the sex he could handle. Granted, it's not like you had to try. This body seemed to be all the more willing to do just that. You lost track of just how long it went on, only that it went on a very long while....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, things settled down, with both of you almost completely knocked out. Thankfully, after a little while longer, your mind did seem to be clearer once again. Thank goodness for that. You waited a bit to catch your breath, before looking over at Sam. Boy, did he look out of it, like he was high on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....Sam.....\" you tried in that seductive voice this body seemed to like using when it could. \"Tell me....what is with the contracts you keep for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully that was more than seductive enough given his dazed state.</span></div></div>",

However you couldn\u2019t risk anything else. You had to tell Danni ASAP and get out Here before he awoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the name Benson. That was last name of the CEO. Richard Benson. He was an older man with grey hair but still very handsome. He reminded you of those ads about the most interesting man in the world. You figured the blue flame must refer to a special lighter he keeps in his pocket. Only that can burn the contracts and destroy them. How are you going to get it though? Just being in the same room and Benson is tough enough let alone getting into his pockets....You had no idea what the beasts were but you weren\u2019t worried about that right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slipping your clothes back on texting Danni. \u201cI have the clue!

There was no sense in lying anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are proving to me the most difficult one yet. First we give you that bimbo body to temp you the most. Then we bring in your childhood friend to make you more accepting, then we turn you into twins you make you feel at home....and yet you still defy us??!!\u201d Sam said shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEternal beauty...love...fortune. I was going to make you my bride and give you everything. I thought after tonight you were finally mine but it was all an act....Benson said to give you up awhile ago but I didn\u2019t want you to become another one of his mindless beasts. I still saw hope for you. I guess it can\u2019t be helped...I guess you will have to become my pet first before you become my bride....\u201d Sam said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d You said terrified and unable to move. It was like something was paralyzing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince your so clever do you happen to know where our little curse come from?\u201d Sam asked as he walked over to his bookshelf.

A demon from ancient times. A symbol of lust and vanity for humans to fear. She would make pacts with humans for beauty only to find it came at the price of their freedom and humanity. Turning them into mindless sexy dolls. Just like the girls at the office. Eventually she was captured and sealed away in a silver ring....\u201d Sam said as he showed you a picture of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened. It was the ring Richard Benson wore in all his photos! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...our dear leader Benson. He sealed away that horrible demon only to find he could bend her powers to his will. The enslaver became the enslaved. Her ability to make contracts and change her victims became his along with her immortal life. Benson took this power for himself and created the powerful company you know today....We take in whelps like you and your friend. Worthless nobodies the world could care less about and give them purpose. We make you images of beauty to serve a purpose greater than yourselves...You should be begging me to let you stay and thanking me ever chance you get....\u201d Sam said slamming the book closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stole my life! My freedom! My body! Not just mine but all those girls!\u201d You said crying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEach of those girls was a nobody...like you. Where were in you life before our call? No where...You had no future you were flipping burgers hoping for a better life. We have that to you. We don\u2019t steal promising futures. We give futures!\u201d Sam said in a self-righteous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are all twisted and evil....\u201d You said spitting at Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real shame....You were by far my favorite. I guess I will have to make do with a mindless sex beast for now...Maybe one day you can learn to love me and you can earn your humanity back.\u201d Sam said as he suddenly snapped his fingers....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you understand the deal?\u201d The Corperate executive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou....you want me to turn into a girl?\u201d He asked not believing this deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust temporary...You are going to be the prototype experiment for our new gender reversal drug. Think about it like this. There are millions of people in the word not comfortable in their own skin. They seek out expensive hormones treatments and surgery to try and become the person they want to be. Now those days are behind us. With this new drug people can truly become the person they want to be. It can change the world!\u201d The executive said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...mean I understand that. I\u2019m all down for people being who they want...but why me? I\u2019m just a normal straight white guy. Why not pick someone who is actually seeking to change their gender?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause...there is too much conflict of interest in someone like that right now. The risk of them exposing the drug to others or revealing it is too great. We need a neutral third party. A plain average person like yourself to test it on.\u201d He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoo....You said this is temporary right?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. This is a 60 day trial. The transformation process itself lasts about a week. Then we will see how your body adjusts over the next two months. Once we have enough data we will begin the reversal process to return you back to normal.\u201d The executive said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I just have to be a girl for a couple months?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...in a way. Your job will be to video record all your changes and discuss your body and feelings every morning right after you wake up. We need to see and hear everything. From how the changes have progressed to any potential side effects, mood swings, etc. You do this and we agree to pay you $100,000 dollars at the end of the experiment as well as cover all your living costs during the trial itself.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more money than John had ever had in his life....what could it hurt right? He always wondered what it was like as a girl sometimes anyway. What is the worst that could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright....I agree.\u201d John said as he signed heir contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent...A laptop with video equipment will be delivered to your apartment by the end of the day along with the box of pills. You are to take ONE every night right before bed. Only ONE, do you understand?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. A pill a night and a short vlog every morning to go over myself and how I am feeling. Seems easy enough.\u201d John said as he felt like he just made the deal of a lifetime. </span></div></div>",

They were soft thankfully and easy to swallow. Could these things really change your gender completely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood in the mirror as you imagined yourself with long hair. You wondered how big your boobs would grow? Would you get shorter? Smaller? Loose weight? Would your desires and interests start to change? All these questions flooded your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to record your first video tonight. You had to introduce yourself and the experiment so people could see how you started before the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the camera you saw yourself as you took a deep breath before you hit the record button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there everyone! My name is John Adams and I am volunteering for a radical and potentially life changing experiment. Over the course of the next week and two months I will be changing my body and lifestyle to that of a female. Not just in a practice or theory but a full gender reversal. I will develop a fully functional female reproductive system, I will become a girl in every sense of the word. This is due to a powerful new medication from Genetech. I will document my changes for you every morning and go over any emotional changes as well. I am scared and terrified but also anxious.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your first video as you submitted it to Genetech as you sat back and sighed. You really couldn\u2019t go back now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up you found the bottle of pills as you took your first one and swallowed it before heading off to bed. Who knows what the morning would bring. </span></div></div>",

As you can see my hair is longer and my body is for sure changing. I\u2019m losing weight and height now. I\u2019ve already lost 15lbs and two inches of height. I except more to come. As you can see my nipples are getting bigger and starting to swell. No boobs yet but I know they are coming. My body is totally hairless now save my head. I\u2019m also noticing my manhood seems a bit smaller and not as sensitive. Will keep you updated bye!\u201d You said turning off the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality of what you\u2019ve agreed to was now starting to set in. Pretty soon you would have to get female clothes and start changing your daily routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou avoided going out now. Most of your meals were made in house or ordered for delivery. You were also starting to wear baggy sweat pants and t shirts for comfort and also to avoid looking at your changing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately no mood swings or mental changes yet. You watched TV and played video games the same you normally would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen night finally came you popped another pill and headed off to bed.

You only had a couple days left before you were fully female. Heading back to your desk you turned on your camera and began your morning vlog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey everyone. It\u2019s me, day five now. Only two days left. As you can see there are some pretty major changes to me. I\u2019m currently only 5\u20197 and barely 115lbs now. My whole body looks petite and feminine at this point. My hair is now shoulder length and feels a bit fuller and wavier. As you can see my breasts have finally started coming in. I would guess at this point there are a small B cup by the way they feel. They are really sensitive too. When I touch them I get a really odd sense of pleasure I\u2019m not used too. You can see my butt is a little bigger now, that tear drop shape is slowly getting there, my hips are definitely wider too. My manhood is tiny now. It barely responds when I touch it. We will see what tomorrow brings. As for yesterday the emotional ride I went on was not expected. It was like everything was setting me off. I guess all these new hormones and estrogen pumping in my system is having some side effects.\u201d You said turning off the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on one of your old t shirts and realized you were swimming in it now. You actually looked like someone\u2019 Girlfriend stealing their boyfriend\u2019s shirt as you couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou refused to buy anything new until the transformation was completed. You did want anyone seeing you in this in between state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your day you found yourself watching different kinds of TV than normal. You found yourself interested in reality dating shows. Celebrity gossip programs, and you even found yourself tearing up during an emotional goodbye scene on a chick flick you found on streaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed how little you ate today. You drank mostly water but had cravings for fruit smoothies for some reason. You also ate a salad for the first time in months and actually really liked it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen night time came you popped your pill and slid off into sleep. You couldn\u2019t wait for this to be over soon. </span></div></div>",

You expected your manhood to vanish tonight and the final polish to your female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came you yawned a bit looking down as you were suddenly a bit confused....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw two large mounds of flesh blocking your view as you began to realize that they were your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting upright you felt their heavy weight shift with your body. Cupping then in your hands they were far bigger than a handful as you noticed your hands looked different as well. Your nails were much longer and your skin seemed more tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up you rushed to the bathroom to get a better look at yourself as you suddenly gasped seeing the reflection staring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night you had gone to bed a skinny, pale, light brunette, with small B cups. Fairly average looks but nothing special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman staring back at you now looked nothing like that. She had beautiful tanned skin, long straight black hair that went past her waist.  Enormous round and perky breasts that hung perfectly from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a perfect hourglass shaped figure with a tight and flat stomach, and a large tear drop butt. Long legs with cute and dainty feet. Her face was very sexy with pouty lips, long eyelashes and refined cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the final did more than make you an official woman. In that regard it definitely succeeded as you saw a perfectly smooth slit now where you manhood once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...I...wasn\u2019t expecting this..\u201d You said to yourself. You were incredibly sexy and hard to keep your eyes off now. Your breasts were easily DDs or larger as you held them in your hands. Your whole body had been massively sexually amplified over night.</span></div></div>",

It did make you look more like a boy but you didn\u2019t care. That\u2019s what you were going for. You heard several guys snicker at you as you left as one of them made a joke saying you looked like a girl who asks to see a manager whenever her coupons are denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remarks didn\u2019t phase you however. You only signed up for this experiment for the money and in another two months you would be a guy again anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your nails trimmed down to short just like when you were a guy. You wanted to look as much like yourself as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading home you picked up your mail and got changed putting on a pair of sweats and one of your baggy male t shirts. Comfort is what mattered most at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a bright red letter in your stack of mail as you were a bit curious and saw it was from the drug company that sent you the pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Mr. Adams/Miss Taylor <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are pleased with the progress of your transformation and of the pills performance. Your documented videos have been a large help to our research facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever we have recently come across a small error in the programming of the nanotechnology that is used to change your body. It seems there is a self-correction error if any changes are made to the original design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore until we address the issue we strongly recommend you do not alter your appearance in any way. This includes, haircuts, nail cuts, hair coloring, etc. Once we understand how to correct the programming error we will contact you with further instructions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh...well it can\u2019t be too bad.

The dark brown locks grew back nicely framing your face and going down your back...and waist....and ankles...The hair had grown so long it almost touched the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nails had grown back to. They were long and pointed looking freshly manicured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap...\u201d You said looking to yourself.

She was currently wearing a simple blue house dress with her long blonde hair in locks that framed her round face. She had a beauty mark near her left eye which both eyes sparkled a blue color. She seemed very open as before you knew it, you were in a tight embrace where you nearly sank into her doughy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness me.\" She said releasing you from her hug. \"We better not dilly dally.\"</span></div></div>",

I need someone to stay here overnight. We have had issues in the neighborhood recently and I want someone here to watch over everything while I\u2019m gone.\u201d Ella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean sleep here each night?\u201d You asked. It was a curious request. Ella didn\u2019t seem to have any kids,  plants or pets. Anything that would require such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, for all intents and purposes you will live here for the next week. Everything will be open to you and you are free to come and go as you please. Just be home by 11pm is all I ask. I will leave an envelope of cash to pay for food, gas, or anything you run short of.\u201d Ella replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere would I sleep?\u201d You asked you noticed all the bed rooms had been converted into other rooms, one was office, the other a gym. Which you could tell she never used...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my room is the only off limits place. I will keep it locked. You ARE NOT to go in there understand? You will sleep in my daughter Lizzie\u2019s room.\u201d Ella said with a sudden stern tone which caught you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked to the last room which had a picture of an absolutely beautiful girl next to it.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/57/7b/bf/577bbfd80cefcd8e9f3279f5a1cad7c0--gentlemen-prefer-blondes-super-girls.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/57/7b/bf/577bb...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!

Lizzie was an upcoming fashion model online and even won a local beauty pageant. One day she left to do a photo shoot and never returned. Even after a full investigation the police have no idea what happened to her....\u201d Ella said wiping the tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m....so sorry.\u201d You said feeling bad you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts...it\u2019s okay sunny. I will see her again one day I\u2019m sure. I left her room just like it was. You can sleep here, don\u2019t mind all her girly stuff.\u201d Ella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed you to the room which definitely belonged to a pretty girl in her early 20s. Makeup, dresses, swimsuits, etc. everything you would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tour was over Ella handed you the keys as she left with her suitcase. You finally had the place to yourself as you relaxed on the couch. This was going to be the easiest job you ever had.....</span></div></div>",

Seeing no harm as Ella won't know, you slide the ring on your ring finger and already, it was fairly loose their. It was no surprise as Ella had fairly plump fingers to a accommodate the ring's size.
