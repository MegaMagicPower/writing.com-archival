Frodo replied, \u201cAye Lady Galadriel, the way to Mordor is filled with peril, better you take it.\u201d Galadriel already shown with the unearthly beauty of the elves, but the power of the ring could make her the fairest in all the land. Let none speak of Arwen the evening star after this! But no, those thoughts were poison she could not except the ring. It would corrupt her and turn her away from the light of the Valar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what hope was there is Middle Earth? Sauron\u2019s forces already were on the march and even if the fellowship did succeed in this most perilous quest she and her lands would diminish and she would have to fly to the west. Oh bitter fates! But here, here was a possibility. She would take the ring, freely given by this hobbit and confront the Dark Lord. Break his power and turn all of Middle Earth into the blooming paradise that was Lothlorien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel warred with herself briefly, but this was too much of an opportunity to miss. She spoke kindly to Frodo, \u201cYes I will accept this burden, place it on my finger.\u201d She extended her finger and looked down at the hobbit. Frodo trembled before this figure of beauty and grace. He thought to himself, she is wise and powerful and fair to look upon, no evil can dwell in her, she will use the ring only for good. Even though he wished with all his heart to give it to her and release the terrible burden it was a mighty struggle. But finally he forced himself to slip the one ring on her delicate hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on her hand Galadriel\u2019s power increased ten-fold. To Frodo\u2019s eyes she changed from the fairest and wisest creature in all the land into a Goddess. Awe warred with fear as she was simply too enchanting to look upon directly. Sam was also with him and both of them fell flat on their faces and wormed their way to her bare feet planting kisses on her fair feet. Galadriel was shocked at the power she wielded, her gaze poured across the land. She could sense Elrond in the halls of Rivendail pondering the events. She could see all the servants of the dark one. She saw the great lidless eye, and it saw her and shrank back in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer far sighted gaze ranged around the whole of Middle Earth taking in events from all the far reaches. Reveling in her new found power she ignored the two hobbits at her feet. She thought to herself and pondered her new found power.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nI must gather my forces quickly. Sauron will bring all the forces of his dark lands to confront me before I can fully master the power of the ring.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she must act quickly she looked down at Frodo and Sam. With a terrible but unbelievably fair voice that rang with splendor she said, \u201cIt is good that you pay your homage to me little ones but I have things to do, fetch your companions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo and Sam cried out in despair at no longer being able to worship even at the foot at this Goddess among the elves. But obey their queen they would, hastily nearly fighting each other to be first they rushed down and sought out Aragorn, Boromir, and the rest. The others rushed toward Galadriel, wondering what had worked Frodo and Sam up so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong legged Aragorn arrived first, his mouth held agape by the sheer glory of Galadriel\u2019s presence. Boromir and Legolas came next, but could do nothing but fall to their knees at the sight of Galadriel. Gimli, Pippin, and Merry could do no less either as they arrived, only Aragorn who held the blood of ancient kings could hold his ground. Galadriel smiled at them, and their hearts sang with joy that they could cause such a being so far above them even a little pleasure. It irritated her that Aragorn was not on his knees however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How dare this man stand up in my presence no matter his lineage. Am I not Galadriel? Mistress of the Ring of Power? Middle Earths only hope!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAragorn I would oppose the dark lord, in order to do this I must have all the free peoples behind me without reservation.\u201d Aragorn wanted to join his companions on their knees, but he saw the ring resting on Galadriel\u2019s fair hand. She had taken the ring for herself! His tongue clove to his mouth but he summoned reserves of strength that only he Isildur\u2019s heir could summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke, \u201cGaladriel, fair lady of the wood, you have taken hold or been given the one ring. I am on this great quest to rid that evil from the land, I would gladly follow your standard but I beseech ye, give up the ring!\u201d He spoke fair and true, but the ring had already corrupted Galadriel\u2019s heart and her pride stirred up immensely. \u201cFoolish mortal man! Your doom is to die even if you are long lived for one of your ilk. You counsel offends my divine ears, beg for my undeserved mercy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aragorn strove against the power of her voice. Any mortal man, elf, or dwarf could not resist it. Still he fought the beguiling voice inside his head and with the resolve that was forged when he was told it was his destiny to be King of Gondor he resisted. Sensing his resistance Galadriel acted at once, \u201cLoyal servants of your Goddess, take hold of him, he seeks me ill!\u201d Aragorn had fought the servants of Sauron and the wild things of the north for decades, but his companions were seven in number and three of them were stout and valorous warriors themselves. His heart was not in his struggle, how could he draw blood of so fine companions now bewitched at no fault of their own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fierceness despite their size the hobbits too assaulted him, and soon he was bound with strong elvish rope. Bound head to foot he was left at Galadriel\u2019s feet. With great arrogance she strode upon his prostrate form standing with her feet on his chest. \u201cSo will it be to all who resist me, I care for the people\u2019s of Middle Earth and no one will stop me from protecting it from Sauron.\u201d This was but an excuse, one that even Galadriel still believed. The ring had corrupted her and she would be the Dark Queen of Middle Earth, even if she still thought she was doing good and justly things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had commands for them. \u201cGimli I will give you a company of elves, rally your people and march on my fair wood, Sauron will strike hard and swift, Go now! They will see you swiftly from my borders.\u201d Gimli knelt and said, \u201cAye fair Goddess of the wood and of my heart, I will bring a mighty host to kneel before you and protect this fair land.\u201d She dismissed him and turned to Legolas, \u201cGo speak with your people in the woods of Mirkwood.\u201d Legolas gazed upon Galadriel, now a Goddess in his eyes, \u201cNothing will hinder my path, my people will ever struggle against the dark lord!\u201d He leapt up and hastened to obey her commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProud Boromir knelt and stood ready to hear his tasks. Galadriel spoke to him, \u201cRally Gondor! Return to your father and tell him a new power arises in the west, tell him if he would remain Steward to obey my commands swiftly! Or I shall place a new king upon the throne of Gondor. Aragorn whose chest now held up fair Galadriel shouted anew, \u201cNo Boromir, she had the ring do not send our people to ruin, you must\u2026\u201d His voice was cut off as Galadriel placed her perfect foot on his mouth gagging it. \u201cShut thy mouth, speak no more words in my presence.\u201d Boromir saw the command and power of Galadriel and decided swiftly that she was the one who could defeat the Dark Lord. \u201cGaladriel, you will have a mighty host of Men! The Dark Lord will quake in the halls of Barad-dur when he hears of our coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoromir left with Galadriel\u2019s blessing. The hobbits stared at the perfect vision of divine beauty and form. It disturbed them but a little to see dear Strider\u2019s face contorted by Galadriel\u2019s fair foot gagging his mouth. But on the other hand if he dared to defy their new Goddess it should be his fate to be humbled. In another part of their hearts they felt envy for his tongue was touching the fairest foot in all of Middle Earth. She turned to the hobbits and told Pippin and Merry, \u201cYou two, return to your peoples. The Shire is weak but not without strength. Rally companies of archers from all over the Shire and bring them south.\u201d Frodo and Sam would attend to her pleasure, but for now they left her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And now to humble this man who would be king. Ah but how to do this. He is too proud to kneel, so I will have to strip him of his pride and reduce him to nothing.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nStill with her foot pressed firmly into the mouth of the ranger she spoke haughtily, \u201cMight warrior indeed! An elf maiden has bested you and now you lay feeble and helpless.\u201d She had perfect balance on Aragorn\u2019s body and lightly sprang off. \u201cI will break you proud Lord! You will be diminished and then I will warp your mind until you have no hope of disobedience.\u201d Aragorn feared the lady of the wood at that moment; he at times had the gift of foresight and saw that this would be true. He cried out \u201cNo I will never obey you, my heart is given to Arwen of the house of Elrond and within me there will be no defeat!\u201d He strove against his fate, vain that it would be, he would not be broken easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed in amusement and his false hope. Galadriel lowered herself down to the ground and brought her face close to Aragorn\u2019s. Her silvery white gown gathered beneath her and her piercing blue eyes locked onto Aragorn. \u201cI will cast a spell on you to make certain your obedience.\u201d Staring back he said, \u201cI will resist it.\u201d She smiled bewitchingly at him. \u201cCan you resist the power of Galadriel? The power of my beauty, the power of the one ring of power all at once?\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cThink you can strive against my craft while you strive for your life\u2019s breath at the same time?\u201d With those words she brought forth her hands and with one sealed his mouth and with the other pinched closed his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip was firm, power from her heritage and of the ring flowed through her. In vain did Aragorn son of Arathorn struggle to toss his head aside from the blazing beauty\u2019s hands. No mercy was now in Galadriel as she pressed ever more firmly and spoke a spell of mastery over Aragorn. Her eyes glowed with power and Aragorn felt his will to fight shrink and grow ever smaller. Still he held his will within his own grasp. He was chief of the Dunedain or Arnor! He was so be called Elessar the Elfstone. He held on until his body was on the verge of bringing him into the peace of unconsciousness when Galadriel let slide her finger from about his nose. He breathed in the cool crisp clear air of Lorien. But no sooner had he done so then did Galadriel press her slim hand to his nose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn strove against the might of Galadriel. But his heart wondered, why. Why fight her, great and terrible she is, but her beauty is beyond words. He should be honored to serve such a great queen! Aragorn ruthlessly buried that thought, sensing it had come from Galadriel. Galadriel dropped subtly and bent her will fully through the ring driving home the thought of \u201cOBEY!\u201d into Aragorn. He fought and struggled and would have defeated the thought but pain seared his lungs, his attention wavered for a moment and so did he. Galadriel sensing her victory rejoiced and grew careless her hand slipping from his mouth. He breathed again, but only a breath before she shut his mouth. Her pale lovely hand a seal harder then mithril, it would not move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now Aragorn blocked all pain from his mind and focused solely on not being mastered by the Mistress of the Ring. Galadriel\u2019s anger rose at being defied and spoke harshly. \u201cIf you will not obey then you will die and the line of Kings will be forever broken!\u201d Aragorn struggled again, but in vain. The ropes held him. His small gasps of air were not enough to sustain him and he passed down into the abyss and knew no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas she slain Aragorn or will his torment continue?  </span></div></div>",

He barely gave a hint of concern at his dear friend Strider's corpse being carried out by two elf attendants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel smiled at the young hobbit and said, \"Frodo Baggins, come forth and pay homage to your goddess.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo eagerly crawled on the floor and reached Galadriel's perfect feet.  He kissed the tops of them with more passion then he had ever done with anything else.  Frodo was lost in awe and lust.  He felt his own manhood grow as he worshiped the perfect feet of the mistress of Lothl\u00f3rien.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel felt his lust and decided to torment him with it.  She kicked out with her powerful foot and Frodo flipped over onto his back with the wind knocked from him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frodo I sense that you desire me, do you truly believe you are worthy of consummating a relationship with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo shook his head sadly, \"No fair lady, I do not.  I am a lowly hobbit and you are... you are... perfect.  I don't have the words to describe how wonderful you are.  I would give anything in the world to be at your side forever.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel's musical laughter just further drove Frodo's lust higher.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disrobe then Baggins, let me see you bare as whence you were born,\" Galadriel commanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo hastened to obey.  He quickly ripped the clothes off his body and threw them aside.  Frodo blushed under her scrutiny.  Galadriel measured every inch of his body within a second.  Galadriel shook her head, \"Sadly my dear Frodo you are no fit consort for me.  However I am a kind and loving queen.  I sense your desire to spill your seed.  You will come no where near my womb but I will permit you to prove your love at my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel beckoned him forward, Frodo was slightly confused but at her direction he lay down at her fair feet.  Galadriel looked at him and with the help of the ring weaved magic on the young hobbit's manhood.  The magic she crafted would make it impossible for him to actually physically ejaculate.  It was a cruel spell as soon Frodo would be driven mad with desire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel then lifted one of her achingly beautiful feet and brought it gently down on former ring bearer's penis.  Frodo felt a thrill of pleasure suffuse his entire being.  He couldn't help but let out a moan of sheer delight at the touch of his goddess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel grinned as she watched the little one's little one grow to full size.  No where near a human's but still a good solid 3 inches fully erect.  She began to rock her foot forward and back.  This elicited further moans of pleasure, never before had Frodo felt such joy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess then a minute under her feet Frodo felt the seed within him rise up.  Yes he was about to cum all over the perfection that was Galadriel.  He spared but a moment of doubt as he wondered if she would be upset.  Just as soon he was at the point of no turning back...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Galadriel removed her foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo was jolted out of his haze of lust as his body involuntarily humped the air trying to reach her glorious foot once more.  Galadriel smiled down and said, \"I didn't want it to end so soon my dear friend from the Shire.  Surely you want to spend more time at my feet then just a few moments?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo nodded his head, \"Of course fair lady, every second in your presence is an honor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving him a few moments to rest Galadriel gently began to rub his cock again.  Frodo moaned glad to have her feet in contact with him member again.  Galadriel slowly teased him.  She lightly brushed against him and then withdrew, she then lightly brushed again and rubbed his testicles before moving to the shaft.  Frodo was going insane with lust and often he would try to push against her foot but that one would only have Galadriel lift her foot away from him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Frodo was truly enjoying the personal attention of his goddess he desperately needed to cum.  His whole body was clenching with that desire and he was sweating profusely.  He was at the edge again and Galadriel's toe was gently rocking the tip of the head back and forth.  It wasn't enough motion for him to cum but it kept him right at the edge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" he let out a moan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel laughed and removed her foot, \"My dear Frodo its like you want to have this be over and done with.  Don't you want to bask in my presence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo gnashed his teeth and responded, \"Yes goddess, I do but, please goddess it is too much let me spill my seed for you fair lady!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel wiped some of the pre-cum that had leaked onto her foot over Frodo's face.  \"Clean your seed off me and once you are done we shall try again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo did not like the taste of his own seed but hastened to obey Galadriel.  He wanted those feet back onto his manhood as soon as possible!  He sucked on the toe and licked her foot with great haste.  As soon as he was sure he had gotten all of it he leaned his head back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel couldn't help but laugh, she was never going to let the poor hobbit cum.  Galadriel once more resumed playing with his penis.  She rubbed her foot back and forth getting a good rhythm going.  In barely a minute he was right at the point of no return once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove your love for me Frodo Baggins, spill your seed all over my feet!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo gave a cry of joy as he felt her foot quicken and his body go past the point of no return.  Right as soon as he felt that occur he knew he would be shooting his load all over her feet.  He felt it, he was at that moment.  And then... nothing.  An ache filled his testicles as he felt the semen actually reverse course back down his shaft and into his balls.  His manhood shriveled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel looked down at Frodo is fake confusion.  \"Frodo, I don't understand.  What happened, do you not like the attention of my feet?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo still shocked shook his head, \"No fair lady, I don't understand it.  You are beautiful, truly you are.  I was there, I... I don't understand.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel frowned at the lust crazed hobbit.  \"Very well, I suppose we can try again.  But this time you had better prove your devotion to me.  You will anger me greatly if you do not spill your seed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo shivered at that threat because with those words he felt a brush of the true power of the ring.  Her glorious form had taken on a darker tint and malice had filled her eyes.  Fearful he nodded and felt his manhood spring to life as Galadriel's feet once more began their magic on him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen in round two?  </span></div></div>",

You are far wiser then me, if you believe taking more time will benefit me do so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel smiled at those words and decided to toy with Frodo even further.  \"You are right that it will benefit you my dear Frodo.  The question is should I take the time?  I have many things to do.  Rallying the free people of Middle Earth against Sauron is of great importance.  And yet even you are important to me but I would have you convince me.  Beg me to take longer, beg me to take hours, make me believe you truly desire this of me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo clenched his eyes tightly shut.  His frustration was so great tears were forming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please my goddess.  Take your time, you are the wisest of all.  Though I deserve it not, spend more of your precious time with me.  I beg you fair lady of the wood, do not have me spill my seed quickly.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel laughed at what she was making the hobbit say.  \"Very well then Frodo, I had almost convinced myself that I needed to go onto other business.  I would have made sure you spilled your seed very quickly, my foot would not have left contact with your manhood but your words have touched me.  I will make sure this lasts a very, very long time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo whimpered as Galadriel began teasing him again.  Her foot caressed him but did not pump his member.  Its light touches were enough to drive him wild but Galadriel made sure he did not reach that edge.  Frodo could barely stop himself from driving his hips forward with each touch.  But each time he did so Galadriel made the wait between touches even longer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning with frustration he prayed with all his hear that release was coming soon.  While he was still in awe of Galadriel this was no longer just pleasure.  A deep pain was forming in his ball sacs.  He desperately needed to unleash what was stored up.  Galadriel was true to her word however, she spent over an hour teasing him, bringing him to the edge and then stopping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she told him, \"Very well Frodo I feel that you are ready now, or do you think we need more time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo violently shook his head, \"No my queen, I am ready, I am ready please, PLEASE\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel grinned and began to trust her foot up and down upon his shaft.  Frodo once more felt his seed building, he was there, he was at the point of no return and... once again that sharp pain afflicted his manhood, he felt the cum slide back down into his balls and his dick deflated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo wept.  He didn't understand what was wrong, why couldn't he prove his dedicated?  What was wrong with him?  He cried like a babe and pleaded for forgiveness with Galadriel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel looked upon him with a stern expression.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frodo I am disappointed with you.  Do you find me unattractive?  Is it because I am an elf and not a hobbit that you can not feel desire for me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hobbit wailed out, \"No, no, I desire you more then anything!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel kept her stern expression.  \"Well you certainly have an odd way of showing it.  But I am merciful let us try again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hobbit agreed though far less readily then before.  He was now drenched in sweat.  His muscles ached with convulsions.  He felt powerful tension in his neck only felt under the strongest of stresses.  Frodo wanted to prove himself but in fact he was in agony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Galadriel teased and coaxed his manhood to life.  Once more she teased with tender flicks and slow rubs before actually moving to the main event.  Once more Frodo felt his body cumming and once more then now familiar pain wracked him and brought his seed back into his now overflowing balls.  Frodo was also noticing the pain with each attempt was growing worse and worse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo mustered his courage and said, \"Fair lady I am spent.  I have failed you but give me leave to rest, your beauty has overpowered me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel smiled sweetly and cruelly.  \"Oh no Frodo, I am no one given to failure.  We will do this again and again until you have spilled your seed and proven your devotion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cry of despair Frodo tried again to beg for a reprevive but Galadriel interrupted him.  \"No Frodo Baggins this must be.  I know you can do this.  I care not for your pains this will be accomplished!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo tried one final attempt, \"Fair lady, can I... try myself?  I have touched myself... often,\" Frodo ashamedly admitted.  Galadriel frowned, \"Are you suggesting your hand is more pleasing then my foot?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo shook his head, \"I mean no offense great lady, I just know I've accomplished this before.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel shook her head.  \"Your words offend me but I will be merciful.  So you are not tempted I will bind your hands to your side.\"  With a waive of her hand magically flowed through Galadriel and Frodo's hand's went rigid to his side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo tried to beg one last time but only got out the word \"please\" before Galadriel stomped hard on his upturned face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not another word out of you Mr. Baggins.  If you speak again you will know my wrath.  And now we begin again.\"  With those words Galadriel once more began the slow painful tease of poor Mr. Frodo's cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then she bade him rise up from the ground.  He did so eagerly.  She leaned down and kissed him on the lips, a thrill of absolute pleasure and love flowed through Sam.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel whispered softly in his ear, \"I've always had a yearning for hobbits.  The little folk have a unique attraction that few among the wise would admit openly but the ring has made me bold.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked up lovingly into Galadriel's eyes, \"Lady you are so beautiful.  Elves have always held a fascination for me, and you are the most elf like elf of all.\"  Galadriel smiled at those words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sam would you lie with me under the stars?  Would you fulfill my desire, could you do this for me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't believe his good fortune, \"Yes my goddess you are all I could ever want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel stood up and said, \"Oh but wait Sam.  I am forgetting something.  Frodo has given me the ring that is truly a marvelous gift.  If I were to be with any hobbit it should surely be with him!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel watched with cruel amusement as Sam's face went through many expressions all at once.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tried to think of argument that would convince her that he was the one who she should copulate with but with utter disappointment he could not.  Crestfallen he nodded his head, \"If that is what you desire fair lady then I must be content with your wishes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel twisted the knife deeper, \"Go fetch Frodo for me would you Sam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam meekly nodded his head.  Not only would he not be the one to be with Galadriel but he would have usher her actual lover to her!  He tried to make himself happy for Frodo but it was so hard.  Maybe if a night with her hadn't been dangled in front of him and created the thought that he would never before have dreamed to hope for... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way his goddess had given him a command and he would obey.

One was Nenya the elf ring and the other of course was the one ring that had now graced Galadriel with supreme power but also malice and cruelty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Frodo stared motionless at the perfection that was Galadriel.  Her beauty outshone the stars and put all others to shame.  Galadriel motioned for them both to pay homage to her.  They both eagerly crawled to her feet and proved there devotion with kisses.  Galadriel found that owe so fitting, she vowed that she would make all creatures of Middle Earth pay personal homage to her this way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel then lifted Frodo up by the hand and told him, \"Frodo you have given me the greatest gift of all, the one ring of power.  For such a treasure I would take you as my consort.  I would be with you as man is with woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo was filled with sudden joy.  \"My lady you do a great honor, whatever you wish I will do!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam knew there would be no other answer but in his heart of hearts he had hoped that Frodo would say he did not love Galadriel that way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel clapped her hands together, \"Perfect Frodo Baggins.  You will make me extraordinarily happy.  She bent down and kissed the young hobbit full on the lips.  Frodo was in ecstasy and had no clue of Sam's distress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned to go but Galadriel called out, \"Do not leave Samwise Gamgee!  Stay and watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways Sam was glad to stay and look upon her amazing form but for the most part he felt heartsick that he had to watch her and Frodo do what he wanted to be doing.  With ever growing jealousy he watched Galadriel kiss and gently disrobe Frodo.  She took her time and whispered soft things into his ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo was fully under her enchantment and adored every second of her ministrations.  Sam could only watch lustfully green with envy at the treatment his friend was receiving.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel fondled Frodo's member and stroked it to full mast.  And then Galadriel had Frodo lay down as she mounted his cock.  She made sure she faced Sam as she made a deliberately loud moan of pleasure.  As much as Sam wanted to close his eyes he couldn't look away from Galadriel's perfect body as she writhed in pleasure above Frodo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo lay there in absolute bliss as Galadriel took him.  He didn't have much experience but based on Galadriel's cries of pleasure he was doing something right!  Little did he know that it was all a game to her to torment his friend Sam.  Galadriel said, \"By the Valar, such pleasure, such joy you must be the greatest hobbit that has ever lived!  Oh Frodo, you are everything that I need!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo exploded into a terrific orgasm shooting his hobbit seed into his goddess.  He let out a moan of pure pleasure as he pumped his cock into her.  Galadriel smiled down at her lover and mentally communicated with him but not with Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frodo, I am going to ask you a question soon and your answer will be that you wish for me to only have you as my lover, nod if you understand.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo nodded not quite sure what was going on but eager to please Galadriel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel then spoke aloud, \"Frodo that was magnificent.  You will definitely be my consort.  And as my consort I will respect your decision on if I should have other lovers.  I see your friend Sam there and I would love for him to enjoy the same things you are, what say you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's heart jumped in his chest.  He would have a chance to experience the same bliss as Frodo!  Truly Galadriel was the perfect elf and ruler.  Sam began to weep again but this time it was tears of joy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo remembered Galadriel's command said, \"I say that I should be the only one to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's stomach flipped.  He couldn't believe the words he had just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Master Frodo please, you know how much I love elves.  And Galadriel said she wanted to be with me to.  Please, Frodo, please.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo really did want to help his friend but Galadriel sent another mental communication to him only saying, \"Tell him no, tell him that he is a gardener not fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo was stunned but he loved and worshiped Galadriel and would do anything she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam your a gardener, in no way could you possible be worthy of Galadriel.  My answer is no, Galadriel will have me and only me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had never felt more betrayed in his life then at that moment.  The despair and pain on his face filled Galadriel with sadistic euphoria.  Sam's lip quivered and his heart broke anew.  He turned to go but Galadriel harshly said, \"Stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam froze in place and turned back to Galadriel who was now standing with Frodo's semen dripping down her leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam my dear hobbit, I did not tell you that you could leave.  Frodo's seed is now within me but some has leaked onto the floor and must be cleaned.  Clean it up.  With your tongue.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo and Sam both were shocked at those words but Frodo remained silent.  Sam looked sick but meekly got down onto his hands and knees and licked the floor clean of Frodo's spunk.  While he obeyed Sam was inwardly furious at Frodo.  His so called friend had ruined his one chance of pure bliss with Galadriel.  He raged and raged as he was forced to humiliate himself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel then waved her hand, \"Now you may leave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For Sam truly was a faithful and loyal hobbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel was determined to break him.  She started having regular nightly encounters with Frodo while Sam watched.  Afterward she would always ask Frodo again if she could invite Sam to her bed afterward.  And each time she would mentally order Frodo to say no that Sam was not worthy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel even did other sex acts with Frodo that the hobbits had never heard of.  Oral sex was one example that was not done in the Shire.  To make matters even worse for Sam, Galadriel actually gave Frodo a blow job.  When he hair got in the way she had Sam hold it up for her and get a close up and personal view of her going down on Frodo!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was pure torment for the poor hobbit.  His lust grew ever greater both from her natural loveliness and through additional prodding from the ring.  Every night when Sam closed his eyes he would always see Galadriel.  Every waking moment was thinking about her and how she was with Frodo and not him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grew more sullen and more withdrawn with each day.  The other elves shunned him or mocked him for what Galadriel made him do.  He lost his enchantment with them and even with the Golden Wood of Lolthlorien.  The only thing he truly desired, cared for or loved as Galadriel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks passed and armies were on the march.  Galadriel had used the power of the ring to unite the free people's of the realm.  War was afoot across all of Middle Earth.  Galadriel directed her armies with expert precision.  She was winning the war for she inspired utter devotion in all that saw her.  Sauron trembled before the daughter of Finarfin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose triumphs were great but her true joy was in the daily torment of Sam.  The final blow to Sauron could wait for now.  Galadriel called Sam and Frodo to share joyous news with them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per usual both hobbits knelt at her feet and paid homage to her.  Though Frodo was his consort he like all the others across Middle Earth had to prostrate themselves before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frodo Baggins my loyal consort, you will soon be the father of my child,\" Galadriel told them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrodo couldn't have been happier.  Sam of course was just bitter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel toyed with Sam, \"But for a twist of fate you could have been the father of this child but Frodo denied you even one night with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam ground his teeth together.  Galadriel always enjoyed making it worse for him.  \"Come forth Sam, plant a kiss on my abdomen.  Kiss what could have been yours.\"  Sam once again cried bitter tears (as he often did now) and planted a kiss on Galadriel's wondrously fair belly.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel laughed in triumph as she felt through the ring Sam's heart break utterly.  Only hatred and envy filled his heart for his former friend Frodo.  Now that he was at his lowest should she discard the shell of the once optimistic and faithful hobbit?  Or should she keep him around as a constant reminder of what she could do.   </span></div></div>",

Not only did she greatly desire to humble and break him, but through her efforts she was learning of the ring and what it could do. She would need this knowledge when she confronted the Dark Lord. A new thought entered her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must first humble him fully. Degradation and humiliation I must use. Once he feels himself not worthy of his lineage then will his armor be pierced and I will have conquered him fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone with Aragorn she tested the ring. Her form and figure were fair indeed but she made subtle changes to herself. The rear of her bottom instead of smelling of sweet lavender and wild flower she made it smell of rot and dung. This would only effect those within inches of her fair bottom but that and more is where Aragorn would be. Taking a cloth while Aragorn slept she stuffed it deep into Aragorn\u2019s mouth and tied it firmly. Now he could only sustain himself through his nose. She then stripped him bear and disrobed herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aragorn awoke he was surprised to find himself alive. Still bound he found himself ashamed at his nakedness. Also caught off guard he nearly fell under Galadriel\u2019s spell again by the exquisite beauty of her nude form. She was slender and slim, but her breasts still held a great ripeness too them that stiffened his man hood. Controlling his thoughts he glanced away. \u201cStubborn man, I will tame you yet. Your arrogant rebellion from my just rule will cost you dearly. Look upon me and despair, you could have worshipped me but instead I will torment you!\u201d And Aragorn could not help himself but to look upon her for she was fair indeed and the ring made her more so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel kicked him lightly with her foot and told him. \u201cI would have given you mercy and the throne of Gondor, but you refused, now you will be humbled, you will breath in the repugnant air from my behind.\u201d Aragorn\u2019s eyes widened, such a cruel and degrading thing he had never heard of in all the annals of history. Galadriel smirked at his horror and brought herself down onto Aragorn\u2019s face. His nose was caught and pushed deep into her posterior. She had turned her fairness into malice and Aragorn instantly tried to wretch up the meal he had eaten before. Mastering himself he held the contents of his belly in check as there was no where for them to go with him gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel raised herself slightly and blew a mighty blast from her rear that staggered Aragorn. The stench was of death itself, he writhed in his bonds seeking freedom from the tormenting smell. But Galadriel merely lowered herself fully on Aragorn\u2019s face and marveled at the pleasure she received from this act. Not only was she debasing him, but she felt a stirring in her loins from his face pressing up into her. With a gasp of delight she touched herself and knew this was something she would do often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel expertly sat on his face. Rising only when Aragorn desperately needed air, and when he did a mighty passing of wind befouled the air from her bottom. Aragorn\u2019s eyes stung and watered from the stench. His pride was greatly diminished, who would serve a king that had been sat on? Galadriel could sense the weakening and this made the stirring in her loins all the greater. She turned around upon his face and thrust her woman hood onto Aragorn\u2019s face. Grasping his hair she thrust hard against the contours of his face. She felt bliss more pleasurable then any coupling she had experienced with Celeborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrider was beneath her and marveled at the Goddess of Beauty before him. Fully seeing her fair hair and proud breasts he felt a stirring in his loins again. The stench from her posterior was far enough away and her natural earthy smell from her woman hood was not ill at all. Humility crept forward in his thoughts. He had been used as a mere object for her pleasure. He who would have been King! If anyone knew what happened they would never respect him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Galadriel enjoyed the afterglow, she took hold of the thoughts of Aragorn and smiled. Sending summons to her elfish attendants 10 elfish maids approached. Galadriel rose from her perch that was Aragorn\u2019s face and faced the approaching women. Clothed in nothing but moonlight they were shocked to see her, but her command and presence had increased so much they thought that if the Queen wishes to disrobe so shall we! The stripped off their dresses, though none approached the fairness and grace of their Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a silvery voice that could be felt deep into their bones Galadriel spoke, \u201cCome pay homage to your queen and watch what Aragorn has been reduced to.\u201d One by one they knelt before Galadriel and planted a kiss on each of her feet. Aragorn trembled in terror of Galadriel. He was going to face the stench and that made him quail. Never before had he felt himself so unmanned. He struggled to try to speak to say he would relent just do not let this fate befall him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel sensed her victory. Lying naked, already objectified, and now in the presence of other elf women he was ripe for the plucking.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nBut why rush things? Let him suffer under me again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew herself dawn and straddled Aragorn\u2019s chest. Looking down at him with steely blue eyes his own eyes begged for pity. \u201cI told you that you were a fool, do you regret now defying me?\u201d Aragorn nodded his head. \u201cYou are not worthy to be king are you.\u201d She used the power of the ring to force that thought to stay in his head forever. Tears welled in Aragorn\u2019s eyes again and he nodded. \u201cWorthless worm of a man, you will honor me above all things and do my will forever!\u201d Again Aragorn could only nod, he was too weak to resist and always Galadriel\u2019s constant beguiling beauty worked its magic on him. He felt that this is where he was suppose to be what he was meant to do. Service this Goddess and be thankful for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and forced her butt into his face again. \u201cYes Aragorn you are suppose to do this. But No! I will not let you be thankful for it. I have control of your mind now and your resistance offended me greatly. You have no chance of disobedience now, but you will never be glad of your duty to me. You will always remember that you are serving what you fought against all of these years. You will always remember that you have betrayed your love Arwen, you will always despair but still you will always obey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight lift and a blast of stench was not the worst of what Aragorn experienced in that moment. All hope was lost. He knew he had failed the fellowship and all of Middle Earth. That sing of failure would never leave but at the same time he could not disobey Galadriel. He was the Mistress of him now. She ruled everything and he despised her and would not even be allowed to love her. Galadriel removed the gag from around Aragorn\u2019s face and said, \u201cSeal your defeat by pleasuring me with thy tongue.\u201d He thrust his tongue inside her woman hood. Galadriel\u2019s loins responded with eagerness and she grew very damp and rode his face with great pleasure. Strange it was to the elf maidens about her but whatever her Queen\u2026 no Goddess desired it would be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the elf maidens had a thought come into her mind. What her queen could do to a King\u2026 maybe she could do to a hobbit.</span></div></div>",

After forcing Aragorn to pleasure her she knew she had more work to do. She summoned her spouse Celeborn to her side. Celeborn thought himself highly blessed to have Galadriel as his life companion. As he approached her however he could see that she had been changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat nude on a throne clad only with two rings and her silver head piece. The two rings chilled him, for she had taken the one ring. Aragorn was at the base of her throne, his face her footstool. He knew it was the power of the ring acting, but he yearned to humble himself before her as well. Lo! Galadriel was the fairest creature in all the world, she radiated even brighter then before so augmented by the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he stumbled, he knew the one ring had already corrupted her, how else could Aragorn\u2019s groveling be explained? He himself tried to keep from bending knee even now knowing full well that Galadriel was not herself. Ah but then she smiled at him. And all thoughts fled from his head, her voice was filled with authority that he had no power to resist. \u201cCeleborn, worthy consort of old, kneel and join Aragorn at my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Celeborn kneel?  </span></div></div>",

Pressing kisses on the tops of her toes he vowed to obey her forevermore. Galadriel laughed, that sounded both mirthful and chilling to all in her presence. \u201cA wise choice you have made, still though I have outgrown you, no more will you by my consort.\u201d At this harsh news Celeborn wept bitter tears. \u201cBut still may you serve me. Rally the elves and prepare the defenses of Lorien.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nTime to find a more suitable consort.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleborn hastened to his task and kissed his Goddess\u2019s feet one more time before preparing the elves of Lorien. Galadriel stood up, making sure that she stood on Aragorn\u2019s head as she did so and then walked to the mirror of Galadriel. The pool of water that allowed her to see far off things. This time she bent it with the power of the ring to act as a communication device. Saruman is whom she desired to see at this moment. She saw him through the mirror and spoke to him. \u201cSaruman, your quest is in vain. You will not have the Ring and Sauron already suspects treachery.\u201d Saruman became quite startled for Galadriel had never spoken to him so, she should not have been able to spring into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel smiled as she gazed at Saruman. \u201cYes Saruman I have grown in strength beyond your reckoning the one ring is mine and I offer you this chance to pardon yourself of the crime of allying with Mordor.\u201d Saruman was visibly shaken. Galadriel continued, \u201cMore I offer you power, you will by my right hand, Rohan will be yours for the keeping, and you will be my consort.\u201d Based on past experiences he knew that Galadriel was fairer then all the other elves, still his order rarely found the flesh alluring. Was he not a Maiar? But Galadriel wove an enchantment even at this great distance and a stirring in his loins occurred and he greatly desired Galadriel at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome go to your Palantiri, your seeing stone, come gaze at what I have wrought. Saruman quickly did so somehow sensing that Sauron could not intrude on his conversation with Galadriel. Gazing into the seeing stone he saw Galadriel. She shined with radiant beauty and greatly did he desire her. More he saw that Galadriel was astride Aragorn, using the man who had the right to be King of Gondor as a mere foot stool. It filled him with great joy to see Gandalf\u2019s friend so humbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaruman responded, \u201cI will accept oh Lady of the Ring! You shall rule Middle Earth and I will be at your side.\u201d Galadriel nodded, \u201cYes you shall. First rally your Orcs, Sauron will drive north and confront my land. Send them to me and have them go with great haste and give them to Celeborn. I will journey to Isengard so that we may consummate our relationship and win Rohan fully to our cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparations were made and Galadriel had her attendants cloth her in fine elven raiment. One of her attendants named Loradriel humbly beseeched her, \u201cGoddess Galadriel, I saw the pleasure you took from using Aragorn. I beg thee, may we take the same pleasure from the hobbits that dwell in the wood?\u201d Galadriel delighted that her attendant would seek the same pleasure. \u201cYou and I are of one mind Loradriel! Come kiss my ring and I was impart to you a portion of my power.\u201d Loradriel quickly knelt and took the lady of the woods hand and kissed the One Ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike lightning her body was electrified with the power of the ring. She felt her wisdom and strength grow. But also malice entered her heart and the will to dominate the Halflings cruelly. Galadriel watched her and said, \u201cYou now have the power to change your bodily odors. More pleasure is gained when suffering is added!\u201d Loradriel beamed up at her Goddess and thanked her profusely. \u201cYes suffer they shall, like rodents they are they deserve this fate so far beneath us they are, have we not been here since an age ago?\u201d Pride, arrogance, and lust filled her to her core. Galadriel saw this and was pleased so like her she was. \u201cI will also give you Celeborn; as I rule Middle Earth you will rule the Golden Wood as my Steward.\u201d Loradriel prostrated herself fully in thanks and kissed the feet of her Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Galadriel left she announced the changes to the wood. Loradriel would rule in her absence while Celeborn prepared the defenses. All were to obey her commands without fail. Loradriel made much fan fare for Galadriel\u2019s departure. Galadriel would take a score of elves wit her as an honor guard. As Galadriel left it was arranged for every male elf in Lorien to lay side by side as a carpet for Galadriel and her 20 maiden guards. With bare feet Galadriel crossed the human carpet delighting in her chosen steward\u2019s creativity. The ring had bent her mind so much that Galadriel believed that this was only her due. Though days ago she would have been horrified by her actions. Two and Twenty fast elven steeds were prepared. For Aragorn would also travel with Galadriel and lend his sword arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel rode him as she would a pony to Galadriel. She hissed into his ear before they arrived, \u201cYour hobbit friends will suffer greatly.\u201d She spat down on his face and drew herself up. \u201cGoddess Galadriel I have brought Aragorn as you have requested, may your journey be swift. Know that your home will be well cared for and I will rule with the wisdom you have shared with me.\u201d Galadriel nodded at her subordinate and raised her voice, \u201cPeople of Golden Wood, sing no more of Gilthoniel or Elbereth, sing only of your Goddess Galadriel! The people of the wood despite their noble lineage forsook the nobility and knelt and praised and worshiped Galadriel as if she were one of the <i>Valar</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould the story follow Galadriel or Loradriel?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the journey south through the forest Aragorn was sorely used. They traveled swiftly on their mounts but rains did come. Galadriel wore soft elven boots that with her power no mud or muck could touch her. It came without thought to do such a thing such was her power. As they lay down to camp she had Aragorn prepare a fire. She though to herself about the fully obedient Aragorn, his descent was complete but she wished to add to his suffering.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWhy should I use even a token of my power when I have a slave to clean my boots?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlavery a thing no elf had practiced before was now a reality within Galadriel. She was fair and wise, and now she was terrible and wise. Her power and malice would far out darken the Dark Lord. Galadriel strode around the camp, all the eyes of the elves watched her. Though all were female, the power of the ring also awoke a lust deep within their hearts. Far beyond the light of the stars did their Goddess shine with luster that they ached to hold. Galadriel went out of her way to sully her boots in mud and horse dung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned to the center she beckoned Aragorn, \u201cA new task your Goddess has for you man.\u201d Aragorn completely unable to resist but hating himself the entire time asked, \u201cYour wish is my command Goddess Galadriel.\u201d Galadriel responded, \u201cA task fitting for your station is in order.\u201d She sat down on great log and continued, \u201cClean the filth from my boots.\u201d Aragorn looked for cloth or towel to rid Galadriel of the mud and worse but Galadriel simply snapped her fingers. \u201cWith thy tongue Aragorn! With thy tongue!\u201d Aragorn\u2019s face fell but he had no choice to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves marveled at this shocking cruelty. But if their Goddess willed it, it must be good. If Aragorn was disobedient in the past then he deserved everything he got and more! Aragorn knelt and began the disgusting work. He licked the soles and tasted the mud. Using his teeth he worked it off, he started to steady it with his hands but an icy glare and a sharp command by Galadriel had his hands behind his back. Chipping it off he spat out a chunk of mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel kicked him hard in the face and he fell on his back. \u201cWorm groveling in the dirt, you shall eat whatever is on my boot and not defile the ground with your unworthy spittle.\u201d Looming over him like a Goddess in judgment she pressed hard on his chest with her boots. Wielding the power of the ring she increased her weight three fold. Aragorn let out a groan from the horrible pressure. Galadriel pushed the toe of her boot into his mouth stifling his cries. \u201cLick you miserable cur.\u201d And Aragorn licked as his body strained under the weight. Now he could taste the dung on his mouth and his heart broke inside. He had shamed his fore fathers, here the great hero of the west was consuming the waste of a horse! Bitter tears leaked from the side of his face. Galadriel reveled in them and continued her torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAragorn had finished cleaning Galadriel\u2019s boots. Every last bit of mud and dung was consumed. The foul taste clung to his mouth. Galadriel seeing the work done stepped off of Aragorn. For she had remained standing with triple her normal weight on him the entire time he licked and sucked clean her boots. Aragorn breathed deeply and freely for the first time in an hour. His chest felt compressed and only his hearty constitution had kept him going. Aragorn thinking his plight was done for the night was dismayed when Galadriel called out, \u201cWhile we do not need sleep, we should rest the steeds they have been pressed hard. In turns use this willful arrogant man as your personal boot cleaner.\u201d She looked down at Aragorn, \u201cThis is your lot in life worm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was for the entire night. Her guards eager to avenge Aragorn for not instantly submitting to their Goddess tormented him. They too deliberately muddied their boots and brought them before Aragorn. A few even re-muddied their boots! All in all Aragorn cleaned 24 pairs of boots! Three of them did go back for more dung and mud. Twice in the night Aragorn\u2019s body could not eat anymore and he emptied his stomach onto the grass. When he did so the elves slapped him and cursed him, explaining in great detail how worthless and useless he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn arrived and Aragorn was never so happy before in his life to see it. Now at least there would be a respite. No sleep and being put to cruel use would have laid another man on his back and useless. But Aragorn soldiered on for the blood of Kings ran through his veins. To Aragorn\u2019s eyes he was no longer worthy of it. Galadriel was please to see Aragorn no longer had a proud bearing, instead he rod with his eyes and head downcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steeds were swift and Galadriel gave them extra speed weaving an enchantment aided with the power of the ring. Soon they had passed through Fangorn forest and arrived at the gates of Isengard. Saruman had provided a welcome for Galadriel. Uruk-Hai lined the path inside, on their knees they were. Hands outstretched on the rock pathway to the gate. Galadriel dismounted proceeded to walk on those hands, gleefully she increased her weight to triple again causing quite a bit of pain for the orcs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is was this a trap laid by Saruman?  Or was he true to his intentions of serving and ruling with Galadriel?  </span></div></div>",

Saruman was in awe of the grace and majesty the ring had bestowed on the already supremely beautiful Galadriel.  However Saruman coveted her power.  The Uruk-Hai meekly kneeling were a ruse as soon as Galadriel got past them as one they charged up howling for revenge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel smirked, she had expected this.  She had veiled the full extent of her power but now unleashed it.  As she turned to face the Uruk-Hai they saw a goddess made flesh.  They were conditioned from birth to obey Saruman but in an instant Galadriel erased that.  Instead they fell back onto their knees and grunted in worship of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaruman was stunned.  He was one of the <i>Maiar</i> so even with the power of the one ring Galadriel could not compel him to obey like the Orcs.  However Saruman had just had his own soldiers turn against him.  In a panic he attempted to use his staff against Galadriel.  Galadriel easily dispelled the attempt, Galadriel mocked the attempt, \"Truly they misnamed you when they called you Saruman the wise!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpringing forward Galadriel crossed the 20 feet that separated them in a moment, she hoisted Saruman by the neck and pinned him to the wall of his own fortress.  Saruman pathetically attempted to physically strike Galadriel with his staff.  Laughing again she caught the staff with her other hand and ripped it from his grasp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaruman's breath rattled in his throat.  He couldn't believe her strength but truly he should have known better.  She was one of the Noldor, wielded Nenya and was arguably one of the most powerful elves before she took the one ring.  With her wisdom and might she had quickly and easily gained the power of the one ring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill keeping Saruman helplessly pinned to the wall with his feet off the ground Galadriel mocked him, \"Saruman the many colored?  You're nothing but a fool.  I will take your fortress, I will take your staff, your palantir, your troops and everything that you are.  Your grandiose dreams of power will be for naught.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaruman kicked his legs feebly, he simply could not get any air in.  He was asphyxiating and for all his might and power he was helpless before Galadriel.  His vision grew cloudy and his long life seemed at last to have come to an end.  But was Galadriel done with him?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her magnificent form was greater then what he saw in the mirror and her eyes were fixed square on his. He worked his mouth and was able to speak, \u201cGaladriel, Queen of Middle Earth I welcome you into my home.\u201d Galadriel nodded, \u201cI seek a right hand, one worthy to be my consort. Kneel and kiss my ring swear before all oaths to obey me and you shall have power.\u201d As she said this Galadriel thought to herself.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nYes one of the legendary Maiar to be my consort a fitting thing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaruman smoothly bent knee and swore to do so. Kissing the ring and the fair hand of Galadriel he felt her immense power and knew he would keep true to these oaths. Saruman rose and said, \u201cThe orcs are already on their way. They did have to go around Fangorn as the trees deeper in hate them much, I would give you a strong army not one already depleted.\u201d Galadriel nodded, \u201cWise was your course. But orcs are distasteful we will create a new army and transform your Uruk-Hai into creatures of deadly grace and beauty.\u201d Saruman was not sure what she meant but he nodded. Anything for this fair creature if only she kept him at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel perceived his lust for her and said, \u201cAye Saruman let us consummate our relationship but first to your seeing stone.\u201d They arrived in the chamber were Saruman kept the Palantiri and they both gazed into it. Augmented by the power of the ring and Saruman\u2019s staff they gazed throughout Mordor and the preparations of the enemy. Great legions of Orcs and Trolls were massing and marching out of the black gate. Further south the forces of the East and Harad were also marching swiftly. A mighty host it was, but hastily constructed. Galadriel felt confident in being able to fend off the first thrust of Sauron, and after that her mastery of the ring which was growing by the hour would be complete and he would be unable to contend with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent is this news Saruman, I am ready to consummate our union. First I would remind one of my servants of his place.\u201d Galadriel used the ring to send a mental summons to Celeborn, \u201cCeleborn go to the pool that is the mirror of Galadriel and gaze upon me.\u201d Celeborn hastened to obey and rushed to where the pool was. He saw Loradriel reclining on the throne with a hobbit squirming underneath her feet. His heart was sad for Sam for a stout loyal hobbit was he, and better treatment he deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel smiled coyly at him and he gazed into the mirror. Soon the image formed and he saw a room. Aragorn knelt in a corner and in the center stood the bare forms of Galadriel and Saruman. Galadriel laughed sadistically as she sensed Celeborn watching them. Like ravenous beasts their lips joined and Saruman entered her. Celeborn\u2019s heart was torn asunder by this cruel jab. Bad enough for him to lose her but to have him watch her copulate with someone else\u2026 He could watch no more, he turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Loradriel had risen and she grabbed his neck and said, \u201cWatch Celeborn and see how to satisfy a Lady. Often has my lady confided in me speaking of your failings as a lover.\u201d This was untrue, Galadriel had never spoken of Celeborn this way, before she had the ring she was quite content. But Loradriel added this twist simply to further humble Celeborn. Watching the two passionately make love leading to a tremendous climax that had Galadriel shouting Saruman\u2019s name further increased the agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over Galadriel told Saruman, \u201cI feel your seed quicken, this union will generate a child of which Middle Earth has never seen.\u201d Saruman was pleased to hear this. Galadriel said, \u201cIt already quickens but there is excess that needs to be cleaned, Aragorn come and clean your Goddess\u2019s womanly temple.\u201d All were shocked both those watching from Lorien and those in Isengard. Never before in all the tales of old had anyone heard of this. For another man to consume the just spent seed of another man from a woman\u2026 never before had this been heard of. Loradriel clapped her hands, \u201cMy Goddess is so brilliant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror Aragorn began the task, his will had been broken and even though he did not want to do this with all his being he had no choice. The spells of Galadriel were alike to iron shackles. Galadriel felt a thrill of power and dominance at forcing Aragorn to do this. As he licked out the foul tasting seed her loins pulsed again and she grabbed the back of his head with her hands and forced him deeper. Demanding he lick and administer oral pleasure to her. Saruman dressed himself as Aragorn pleasured Galadriel. When Galadriel flushed in a second climax she pulled Aragorn hard into her womanhood. Holding him there without breath Aragorn\u2019s body flailed helplessly and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel went over her plans for the Orcs. Galadriel would rule a land of pristine beauty and Orcs would not be allowed to sully it with their foulness. After much planning and plotting they awoke Aragorn and took him to the mud pits. They brought with them two Orcs to experiment with as well. First Saruman cut his hand and dribbled blood into the mud. Next Galadriel turned to Aragorn and bade him strip. He did so and Galadriel placed lust in his mind. Instantly all that Aragorn could think of was the dazzlingly Galadriel. With her soft hands Galadriel placed her hands on his manhood. With a few quick jerks Aragorn\u2019s seed sprang out into the mud pits. Galadriel also gathered the power of the ring and spit salvia from her mouth into the mud. \u201cBlood of the wizard, Seed of a King, and spittle of the Mistress of Ring will transform the Orc into something more! Into the perfect graceful beautiful warrior. Warriors worthy of the Goddess of beauty, Galadriel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then threw the first Orc one of the fighting Uruk-Hai into the pit. All three watched in fascination as the Orc screamed in agony as the painful transformation took place. After several long moments the Orc was still. Then it leaped out of the pit. Lo! The creature was fair instead of gruesome! Its skin was dark ebony and it was now clearly female. It stood over 6 foot tall, as tall an elf. More muscled was the creature then any elf, and its bosom heaved as it took deep breathes, its bare breasts were larger then most human women\u2019s. Her long hair from the top of her head went almost to her waist. Black bushy hair also covered her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel smiled, \u201cOut of unclean nastiness I have brought you, now let me test your power.\u201d She commanded both the Orc and the new creature to fight. The Orc rushed her and tried to grab her. As quick as any elf warrior the new creature moved aside and grabbed the Orc\u2019s wrist. She twisted the arm and snapped the bone at the elbow, the Orc howled. Quickly she grabbed the writhing Orc and lifted it up in the air and brought its back down onto her upraised knee, breaking its spine.

I shall call you my \u201cDark Ladies\u201d as you are not uncouth but well mannered but still formidable. Turning to Saruman she said, \u201cTake the rest of the Orcs you have here and turn them into my Dark Ladies.\u201d Saruman bowed and replied, \u201cAs you say my Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill the formation of the Dark Ladies cause problems for the \"regular\" elves or should the story move along to the conquest of Middle Earth!  </span></div></div>",

The Dark Ladies were perfect in speech and manner but they looked upon the elves with a\u2026 hunger that was quite disconcerting. One elf Mindia by name soon learned to her peril how dangerous that hunger was. She had gone alone to scout what if anything the Ents were doing. Three Dark Ladies saw her leave and swiftly tracked her. Skilled in elven wood craft was Mindia but they had no problems tracking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindia sensed someone or something was tracking her but shrugged it off. Who could keep up with an elf? Soon however the Dark Ladies had trapped and cornered her and she saw them. Mindia raised her voice, \u201cI am a servant of the Goddess Galadriel, state your business.\u201d Low chuckles from the three Dark Ladies unnerved her. \u201cStay back!\u201d She drew elvish steel, a long dagger she had at her waist. The Dark Ladies were not less then 15 feet away, the largest one said, \u201cWe too serve the Goddess Galadriel, and we wish to play with your flesh.\u201d Mindia rushed the one who spoke hoping to catch her off guard. Slashing with her knife she was surprised at how quickly the Dark Lady dropped down and avoided the knife. At the same time she kicked out and Mindia had to make a short hop to avoid the bone crushing sweep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two Dark Ladies leaped at her and she quickly dodged back. They circled around her again taunting her. \u201cCome little pale one we just wish a bit of play.\u201d Another said, \u201cThy face seems a most comfortable cushion for my face.\u201d Mindia brandished her blade, \u201cBack foul creatures you shall not have me!\u201d They responded with more taunts, \u201cThy tongue calls us foul, a better use we shall find for thy tongue.\u201d All three then rushed Mindia at once. She lashed with her dagger but the arm was caught in the iron grip of one of the Dark Ladies. Crushing her wrist she dropped the dagger with a cry. Another Dark Lady grabbed her arm and the last simply smashed her fist into Mindia\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubling over and disarmed she was easily held by her attackers. Two held her while the third slammed her fist into her thrice more. A vicious backhand struck her across the face and she tasted blood. After those rapid blows the fight was completely gone from Mindia. Terror filled her eyes as the Dark Lady cut her clothing off. Completely vulnerable now, the Dark Lady admired the elf\u2019s form. Bring her face close to her captives, she whispered, \u201cHmm pretty pale elf.\u201d The Dark Lady then forced her tongue into her mouth. This unnatural action startled her. \u201cYou taste sweet, but not you will do the tasting!\u201d They threw her to the ground and the lead Dark Lady quickly straddled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaste me pale one taste me!\u201d And Mindia did so. Her tongue darted in to the loins of her adversary. The taste was not to her liking but there was little choice. The Dark Lady eye\u2019s bore into hers as she began the task of pleasuring her. Feeling more subordinate and inferior by the second her pride shrank to nothing. Her elven dignity fled swifter then a doe from a hunters bow. She looked up as her superior said, \u201cMy name is Zahra and I am your master.\u201d Mindia could only continue to lick because that is what her Master Zahra wanted her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel will know of what happened.  But is she pleased or angry?  </span></div></div>",

But they were led by their Goddess - they would not give into the fear-terror of the wraith.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead elvish bows sang as arrows lanced out and struck the foul flying steed.  It roared in agony as its hide was peppered by them.  Galadriel paid it no heed, her target was the black gate itself.  Bending the ring to her will she extended her hand and gathered her might.  The roaring wind answered her call.  The roaring wind rushed into the plains of Mordor.  The Black Gate shivered and shook at the onslaught.  Galadriel poured on more power and the winds converged into a mighty funnel that ripped the gate asunder.  Hundreds of Goblins died instantly, more were felled by the falling pieces of the shattered structure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer army gave a might cry of victory and surged forward.  Goblins fled in every direction.  The advance of the army was slowed only by the fact some of the terrorized minions of Sauron fled right into their blades.  The men of the east held better.  They stood firm and fought the men and elves.  The Dark Ladies leaped to the fore cutting swathes into the Easterlings.  They struck with the speed of elves but their blows rent armor with twice the strength.  A half dozen Dark Ladies swarmed over a Cave Troll felling it less than half a minute with only one of their number dying from a lucky strike of its massive club.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ring Wraiths greatest power was the fear they could compel but within the presence of Galadriel their fear did nothing.  Their mortal forms were smashed to pieces and their spirits fled.  Of the Nine, only the Witch-King was still on the field - and his mount had been felled by Legolas.  Galadriel hurled blasts of wind that ripped flesh from bone, no goblin or man could approach.  She stalked forward to where the Witch-King was rising.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man will slay thee, so sayeth the prophecy.  Slave of Sauron, I am no man.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Witch-King saw his doom had come and tried to flee.  A sharp gesture by Galadriel hurled his body before her.  She placed her pale achingly beautiful foot on his head and lashed out with her power.  Pinned to the ground the Witch-King could not escape the biting winds that seared flesh and spirit.  When the attack was done he was naught but dust on the wind - forever gone from Middle Earth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere her armies were victorious.  The forces of Mordor were is disarray and her elves and men were butchering them.  Galadriel smiled, her victory was near at hand.  The next target of her wrath would be Barad-d\u00fbr itself.  There she would deal with Sauron and either disperse him forever or actually bend him to her will.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Startled Sam did not kneel as he should have. Loradriel snapped her finger, \u201cHobbit how dare you enter my presence and not kneel as is my due. Galadriel, the Goddess of Middle Earth has bade me rule in her stead and you will respect that decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam quickly knelt, \u201cBegging your pardon madam elf, uh, lady Loradriel I meant no disrespect oh no ma\u2019am.\u201d Loradriel sneered at the hobbit, \u201cProve it hobbit, crawl here and pay homage.\u201d Sam dutifully crawled to the elf and kissed the tops of her feet, unlike Galadriel\u2019s feet these did not fill him with the joy of humble worship. Also they stank like rotten fish and his face betrayed that. Loradriel yelled at him, \u201cRude knave, what is the matter with you, speak truthfully for I will know if you attempt to deceive.\u201d Loradriel was toying with him for she herself using the powers Galadriel had given her had created the stench on her otherwise sweet fair feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s fear rose in him.

I am just a hobbit I don\u2019t go messing with the wise.\u201d Loradriel hissed in a sharp hard voice, \u201cDo not compound your crimes with disobedience, what made your face grimace, speak now lest I grow angry and you truly feel my wrath!\u201d Sam did not know what to do he was caught between two choices of disrespect. He thought to himself, honesty is what my ole Gaffer always said I should have so here it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell ya see lady fair, I uh well, let me put it plainly. Your feet stink.\u201d On cue both attendants let out gasps of shock. Loradriel simply stared at Sam with solemn intensity. \u201cYou dare!\u201d Sam shook his head, \u201cYou said you wanted the truth!\u201d Loradriel shook her head, \u201cYou have shamed me and for that you will suffer, if they smell then clean them with thy affronting tongue!\u201d Sam groaned in despair as he began his task. The taste was a vile as the smell. Little did he know that Loradriel with the power given from Galadriel had caused her feet to sweat with a vile secretion. Sam gagged at the taste and grew light headed from the smell. \u201cForgive me Lady! I can not they overcome me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel grew angry indeed and said, \u201cYou will obey me hobbit!

Struggle though he may he was helpless and they soon tied him with strong elvish rope. Turned face up and completely bound Loradriel lay her feet on the small hobbits face. Sam was forced to smell the horrible mind numbing stench. When he ventured to try to lick just to get this done with, the taste shriveled his tongue and he could not do it. Loradriel smiled contently as she started the days task, listening to reports from the scouts and from Celeborn\u2019s captains.

Here he was Celeborn, Lord of the Wood, Galadriel\u2019s consort now kneeling before her! Loradriel smiled and ran her hands over Celeborn\u2019s body. While Celeborn thought Loradriel a pale imitation of Galadriel\u2019s splendor; none the less she was an attractive elf and he had no problems complying with her will. After they were both satisfied she moved over to Sam who was gazing at her with fear. He begged her, \u201cPlease no fair lady it\u2019s not natural don\u2019t make me do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel gave a chilling laugh. \u201cYou are a hobbit and I am an elf. You are not fit to question me so far beneath me you are.\u201d She placed her bare foot on the hobbits neck and pressed down. As Sam choked she said, \u201cIf you dare speak without permission again I will have you scourged do you understand worm?\u201d Sam tried to make a reply but the pressure on his throat did not allow for the passage of air or sound. Delighting in her cruel game she pressed down harder. \u201cAnswer me!\u201d Sam thought to himself, \u201cWell this is the end!\u201d Hot weeping tears filled his eyes, he would never see the shire again this elf would crush his throat and that would be that. But just before he thought the end had drawn nigh she lifted her foot. He coughed horribly and croaked, \u201cYes Lady I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now clean out the seed within me. Work swiftly for my weight will bear down on your face and you are but a small one.\u201d With those words Loradriel dropped her womanhood onto the hobbits face. She actually was not that heavy, elves were slight in nature so she weighed scarcely over 100 pounds. However for a Halfling this was still a burden. Worse was that Loradriel again wove the magic Galadriel had given to her and a nauseous stench seemed to billow from her freshly used orifice. Celeborn could smell it from where he was and it made him ill he could only image what poor Sam was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam licked as fast as he could; trying desperately to suck out the spent seed. The stench made his eyes water anew and threatened to send him back into darkness. Loradriel could barely stand her own smell such was its strength. The hobbit bucked and moaned involuntarily. Loradriel concentrated on the torment she was causing the hobbit and tried to ignore the smell herself; she poured all her will to make it more and more foul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s last coherent moments were soon lost. Flashes of light buzzed around him and all he knew was pain and madness. Loradriel felt the hobbit bite. She shrieked and removed herself only to see the hobbit still madly thrashing biting his own lips. His eyes were rolled into the back of his head and the mad thrashing continued. Loradriel watched as the hobbit\u2019s seizure continued on surprised that her smell could do that! Celeborn quickly called for healers and they took the hobbit and started to try to save his life.</span></div></div>",

With care and the healing arts of the elves he should return to his normal self in a week or two. Loradriel listened to the healers report and said, \u201cSo a strong smell is enough to even kill a hobbit? How unfortunate.\u201d The healer, a wise old male elf nodded, \u201cWell a hobbit is not like an elf they do not have immunities to poison and the like and besides they are of much smaller stature.\u201d Loradriel pondered this for a moment, \u201cWould an elf be able to stand up to the smell?\u201d The healer paused, \u201cYes we should be able to but you are not really thinking of doing that to one of our people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel glared, \u201cYou dare question me? Did our Goddess not appoint me as ruler here in her stead?\u201d Sensing the danger the healer responded with great fear and trepidation, \u201cForgive Loradriel, I did not mean any offense you are the chosen ruler and all are glad for it!\u201d Loradriel stood up, \u201cYou did question me you insolent nothing, you will test your theory personally, on your belly and grovel at my feet!\u201d The elf lay on his belly and moved to Loradriel\u2019s feet. Dainty feet they were but Loradriel had already started the unearthly vile stench. Keeping his face still was an effort but he did not want to risk raising the ire of the lady any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing the tops of her soft white feet would not have been a bad chore if it wasn\u2019t for the smell seeping from them. \u201cInhale deeply; I want my stench to fill your entire body.\u201d Inhaling heavily the elf coughed, he felt his lungs burn with the vileness of it all. Laughing Loradriel said, \u201cAgain! And again!\u201d Taking large sniffs to appease her, his eyes also began to water. He started to fear that his original theory was wrong that an elf could succumb to the foul smell. Loradriel then ordered him to flip over and now she pressed the soles of her feet on the top of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping the poor elf\u2019s nose with her large and second toe she commanded, \u201cWhen I release it inhale as hard as you ever have before!\u201d Loradriel then focused all of her considerable will on the powers that Galadriel had given her to make that particular area of her foot as foul as she could make it. After a long minute the elf\u2019s dread grew as soon he would have to inhale the poison deep inside him. Releasing his nose the elf then inhaled sharply and deeply. Deep into his lungs the raunchy stench entered. As soon as he had a lungful Loradriel sealed his mouth with one foot and pinched his nose again with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was trapped in his lungs. It was so toxic he felt like it was burning the flesh from the inside out. His body tried to cough but her feet blocked any escape of it. He writhed and trashed and knew that the air needed to leave his body soon. He was unbound unlike the Halfling so he grabbed Loradriel\u2019s feet and lifted them off his face.<br>\r\nExhaling the trapped poison he immediately breathed in cleaner air. Loradriel was beside herself with fury. How dare he try to defend himself. Still catching his breath the healer was unprepared for Loradriel standing up and slamming her foot right into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing as the wind was knocked out of him he couldn\u2019t defend himself as Loradriel then slammed her heel right into his face. Again and again she battered his face and torso. Unprepared for the vicious furious assault he curled into a ball trying to weather the storm of her fury. Calling for assistance two female attendants rushed in and saw Loradriel kicking one of the kindly elves who specialized in healing. Loradriel said, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand their gaping, this elf has defied my orders and needs to be dealt with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves were horrified by this, but already the work of the ring was present. They felt a guilty thrill and actually stomping on another elf. Now three elf maidens were kicking him and stomping him. With his healer training he knew exactly the amount of damage they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracked rib. Bruised face. Black eye. Trauma to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the attendants managed to pin his arm with her foot. The other attendant worked at and succeeded in pinning the second arm. Pinned and defenseless Loradriel circled around and the adroitly jumped on his chest. Hard heel stomps followed right into the chest cavity. \u201cThis\u201d STOMP \u201cwill\u201d STOMP \u201cteach\u201d STOMP \u201cyou!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel then slapped his head with her bare feet. One of the attendants said, \u201cLady of the wood may we also have a turn to punish this unruly male on your behalf?\u201d Smiling Loradriel let them take a turn she took the other\u2019s place on the healer\u2019s arm and hands. But even as the other two stomped and slapped with their feet she was not idle. She ground her feet into the healer\u2019s hands. Stomping hard she smashed the digits of his hand until she heard the sharp snap of a broken bone. The healer cried out, these were the hands who had healed kings and queens, who had help save countless humans and elves. Now they were being ruined by Loradriel. He wept from the pain as much as from the loss of his skilled hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel enjoyed his suffering. She felt her pulse quicken as they tore apart his body. A great stirring in her loins that needed to be satisfied made her say, \u201cEnough, time to see if your theory holds true.\u201d With the other elf maidens still on his arms he was powerless to resist Loradriel. She disrobed herself and placed her nude womanhood onto the elf healer\u2019s face. \u201cPleasure me or I will use your face as my footstool every day!\u201d Despite the horrendous odor the healer forced himself to orally serve the Lady Loradriel, hoping that Sam\u2019s fate would not be his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kill if necessary but preferably capture them and drag them back here to face the Mistress of the Rings displeasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel weighed her choices carefully as she continued to use the mighty Aragorn as her footstool.  He gave a pitiful moan from beneath her feet and she smiled.  She made her decision she would... </span></div></div>",

She was good with the bow, the blade and an expert tracker.  Her eyes were fixed on the glorious form of Galadriel.  Galadriel was flawless without the one ring but with it... she almost hurt to look upon.  Loradriel knelt before the queen of L\u00f3rien.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel smiled and spoke, \"Rise Loradriel, I require your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything my queen, my goddess.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to hunt down my unfaithful consort Celeborn and Gandalf.  Capture them alive if possible but kill them if they force thy hand.  It is of the utmost importance that they be stopped, if the peoples of Middle Earth are not united under my banner the Dark Lord may yet triumph.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel's eyes flashed with anger.  How dare Celeborn betray his queen!  She would be successful.  She would hunt him down to the ends of the earth if need be.  Galadriel saw the determination and rage in her servant's eyes and she knew she had chosen wisely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take with you a company of 50 elves and take with you my personal blessing.  With the power of the ring I will weave about you enchantments that will prevent Gandalf's glamors from effecting you.  In addition your strength and speed will be doubled.  Go now and bring them back.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoradriel kissed the fair hand of Galadriel and hastily departed.  Quickly summoning her 50 elves she began sprinting for Rohan.  They would not sleep nor rest until they overtook them.  Yes they were on eagles but even the mighty eagles needed to rest and with the burning blessing of Galadriel upon them they would be able to overtake them.  </span></div></div>",
