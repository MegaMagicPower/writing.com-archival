            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just a normal day at Duel Academy, the Queen of Obelisk Blue Alexis Rhodes was taking a stroll outside as she makes her way to the Card Shop to get some cards to give her Cyber Angel Deck the boost it needs in the event that she needs to fight a duelist better than Professor Crowler or someone like Zane when he had that Cyberdark Deck, but just as she has arrived to her destination, she saw a banner that said \"Duelists Wanted! Come and Get Your Chance to Test Out the New Berserker Deck!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept what she saw at the back of her mind in case she decided to go and test out this deck for now as she makes her way inside the Card Shop, Alexis wastes no time and starts browsing through the selection as she thinks about what kind of booster pack she'll get and how many she'll buy for her Cyber Angel Deck, but her eyes were fixated on on particular booster pack with a picture of what looks like the Berserker monster that looks like a mysterious looking black hooded female with muscles that looked like they were 30 feet in size and mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you were wondering what that monster is, it's one of the monsters in that new deck all the girls are talking about called Berserker Necromancer\" someone said, and Alexis was startled when she heard someone saying that, only to sigh in relief when she realized that it was Ms. Dorothy who said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I spooked ya Alexis, I didn't know you were so fixated on looking at that booster pack\" she said in a apologetic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you Ms. Dorothy, although since your here, I was wondering if this booster pack will give my Cyber Angel Deck the boost it needs?\" she said wondering if this booster pack will give her the edge she's been looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it'll definitely give your deck a boost, for starters Berserker Necromancer is a Level 4 Dark Spellcaster Effect Monster with 1900 ATK and 1900 DEF with a special ability that brings back monsters from the graveyard when she gets sent there, although you have to pay half of your life points if you want to bring that monster back as a Berserker Monster with a 900 ATK and DEF boost. The Field Spell Berserker Battlefield gives all Berserker Monsters a 1000 ATK and DEF boost as well as being immune to spells and traps, but it also allow the duelist to banish any monster they have in their hand and bring it back as a Berserker Monster, although the kicker is that you don't have to pay half of your life points to use a Berserker Monsters effects so as long as that field spell ain't destroyed. But I've only scratched the surface of what those cards are capable of, although if you want to find out just how good that Berserker Deck is, you can go to the dueling arena at the docks where that Berserker Duelist has set up shop\" she said hoping that her explanation was enough to help out Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.....what you just told me sounded like that Berserker Deck is basically a mix between Amazoness and Archfiends on steroids! .......Although now that I've mentioned it, I want to see if what I said holds up when I duel against that Berserker Duelist, especially since I want to know if those cards can give my Cyber Angel Deck the edge I've been looking for\" she said excited that these Berserker cards might be able to strengthen her deck enough to go up against Cyberdark, Ancient Gear or Neo-Spacian caliber deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you REALLY want to duel against The Berserker Duelist, you might want to prepare yourself because I heard she's a pretty tough cookie when it comes to dueling, heck she even beat Zane when he went up against her!\" she said, but then she and Alexis noticed that the TV that was set up here has lit up, and Ms. Dorothy knew right then and their that the Berserker Duelist who's dressed up just like Berserker Necromancer is about to make the same announcement she has made ever since she arrived at Duel Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone from Slifer Red, Obelisk Blue and Ra Yellow, I am the Berserker Duelist, and I came to Duel Academy to give you a chance to go up against my Berserker Deck! This deck of cards along with all the new cards you've all seen and used in your decks at some point have been made and reprinted by own company Archfiend Incorporated for everyone here at Duel Academy to purchase and use in your decks, although every student here now has the chance to test out the Berserker Deck by dueling me, and I'll be staying here for five months straight so that everyone can be able to get a chance to pit their decks against mine! Buuuut if you feel like making a Berserker Deck of your own or adding some Berserker cards to give your deck that little kick before you go to duel me, Berserker Card Booster Packs are available to purchase at the Card Shop, and by the way supplies won't be limited, so you can buy as many of those or the other Archfiend Incorporated Booster Packs as you want. Just make sure you don't buy too much, they are plenty of duelists her in Duel Academy who want to buy those booster packs!\" she said with confidence and bravado that even rivals that of Seto Kaiba's Announcement and Speeches, and then the TV changes back to the Archfiend Incorporated logo which was the initials A.I with the head of Berserker Dragon Empress, which was the boss monster of the Berserker Deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow......I didn't think their would be another duelist let alone one who's a female that has her own company, I'm surprised she hasn't dueled against Kaiba at this point!\" she said as she was beginning to like whoever this Berserker Duelist is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that duelist came in first place at Ms. Obelisk AND Mr. Obelisk 4 times in a row, and from what I've heard from the girls who've dueled her, she's quite a looker even though she has pecs that'll make a male bodybuilder ashamed of himself just by looking at them. But if you want to know which group of girls I've heard that from, I've found that tid bit from the girls who are either into or like art and drawings of buff chicks. Although between you and me.......I'm a tad bit surprised that they are girls who are into that sort of thing, but you didn't hear that from me\" she told Alexis glad that she got that last bit of what she said to her off her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I got my hands full if I plan on dueling her, and by the way, I'm glad that I was able to help you get something off of your chest\" she said and then looks at the Berserker Card Booster Pack thinking if she should buy some and rebuild her deck with some of those cards before she goes to duel against the Berserker Duelist, or buy them later on and duel her right now. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She thought about which choice she'll make for 4 minutes since she wanted to be sure that she's making the right choice, and then Alexis decided that she'll buy some booster packs and rebuild her deck rather than to risk dueling the Berserker Duelist now with just the deck she has. So she takes out her wallet and checks to see if she has enough cash to buy either 10 Berserker Card Booster Packs or 5 in the event she's low on money, fortunately Alexis has more than enough cash to buy 10 Booster Packs, so she grabs the Booster Packs and pay's Ms. Dorothy $20 since Booster Packs were $2.00 per pack. Once Ms. Dorothy gives her the bag that has the Booster Packs she'd purchased, Alexis said's goodbye to her and makes her way back to her Dorm Room. As she makes her way to the Girls Dorm at Obelisk Blue, she noticed that Mindy and Jasmine were walking towards her, although she could tell that they were looking at her bag of Berserker Card Booster Packs with a smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.my.gosh, am I seeing things or is Alexis actually trying to step her game up?\" Mindy asked hoping that her friend is actually going through with what she said last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sighs) why would you ask her that if you can see the bag Alexis was carrying a mile away?\" Jasmine said in response to what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you two last night that I'm dead set on stepping up my game, especially since I plan on making up for getting defeated by Satorius as well as every loss I ever had in a duel by living up to my reputation as the Queen of Obelisk Blue!\" she said with a stern yet determined tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let me guess, you bought yourself a couple of Berserker Card Booster Packs to see if those cards will give you that edge you need?\" Jasmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did, although you are a bit off on how many booster packs I've bought, ......mainly because I've purchased 10 Berserker Card Booster Packs\" she answered as they kept walking, which caused Mindy to gasp in shock over what she just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis I know you are dead serious about stepping up your game, but buying 10 BOOSTER PACKS is basically considered to be overkill in Duel Monsters, you might as well bought the Berserker Structure Deck if you were THAT dead serious about stepping your game up!\" she exclaimed as they get closer to arriving at the Girl Dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindy DOES make a good point, since each Booster Pack has 15 cards per pack, which contains 10 commons, 3 uncommon's, 1 rare and 1 ultra rare. In other words, you've just bought 150 cards for 20 bucks\" she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I did was overkill, but I plan on going up against the Berserker Duelist once I'm done rebuilding my deck, so I need to know what I'm going up against and rebuild my deck using the knowledge I've gained from studying each monster, spell and trap in this Berserker Deck to create the best Berserker Cyber Angel Deck I can build\" she said a bit miffed about what they're saying as they have arrived at the Girls Dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sighs) look I really appreciate you two for being their for me as well as the support I've gotten from you, it must have been tough seeing me so down in the dumps when I've realized that I haven't improved myself as a duelist enough to keep up with the best duelists here in Duel Academy\" she said and calms herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we would do it again in a heartbeat if it meant that we can help out our friend\" Mindy and Jasmine both said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis smiled and waved her friends goodbye as they enter into the girls dorm and go their separate ways to go to their rooms, once Alexis arrives at the door to her room, she opens the door and closes it once she is inside. She quickly goes to the table she has and pours out the 10 Berserker Card Booster Packs from the bag and onto the table, then she takes a deep breath, grabs the first Booster Pack from the pile and opens the foil pack. Alexis couldn't help but take in that new card smell as she takes out the 15 cards from their foil pack prison, but she almost gawked when she saw that one of the cards that was in the Booster Pack was an Ultra Rare version of Berserker Dragon Empress, although she noticed that the artwork on the card was of a higher quality than the usual cards that everyone buys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Whistles impressively) you know for a boss monster with 3800 ATK and 3500 DEF, this is quite the appealing card for a bipedal dragoness with insanely huge muscles that makes Obelisk look puny in comparison, although I am impressed that this monsters effect basically directs any attack on a Berserker Monster to attack her instead is pretty sweet. But I wasn't expecting Berserker Dragon Empress being to pull of Contact Fusion with any non Berserker Monster so as long as said monster is a female, it's almost as if the Berserker Monsters were encouraging duelists to mix them into other decks\" she said and puts that card to the side as she reads the next card in the booster pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Alexis has only managed to open 4 more Booster Packs after carefully reading what the remaining 14 cards can do, she was impressed at the level of detail and quality that each card has. From the appealing artwork of the monsters, spells and traps, to the strong yet balanced effects each card has, but what really caught her attention were the monsters and how these women can be so pleasing to the eyes while possessing physiques that'll even make the most musclebound monster in the game sigh in shame. But Alexis noticed that these cards give off something that make the person who's holding them feel empowered, although for some reason she felt like some kind of energy was welling up inside of her waiting to be let out. It was faint but she could notice that whatever this energy is, she can feel it in her muscles, which was quite odd considering that she never worked out in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she knew what she was about to do might end up hurting her, Alexis did a double bicep that she saw on one of the cards called Berserker Brawler, albeit she did it lightly so that she won't get overwhelmed by this energy she feels within her muscles. Suddenly Alexis was beginning to blush as her once non existent biceps grew in size as she was finding herself gaining pleasure from this, but she managed to snap herself out of it and stopped flexing her biceps when they grew to 20 inches, although Alexis was still blushing due to realizing that she has just gained pleasure from making her biceps grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.......I can't believe I got turned on from doing this, and I was only flexing my biceps lightly! Although as much as I want to open the rest of these Booster Packs right about now, .......I guess it wouldn't hurt if I get the rest of my muscles to be as big as my biceps first\" she said as she does just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, Alexis managed to grow each muscle on her body to 20 inches, albeit she had a bit of a hard time doing it since she has never flexed any of her muscles before. But just as she stopped flexing her pecs, she finds herself gritting her teeth hard as she tries her best not to give into to the sudden urge to flex harder so that her muscles can grow bigger and stronger, especially since still plans on rebuilding her deck and duel against the Berserker Duelist before nightfall. But the temptation of just allowing herself to give into that urge was strong, although it's a matter of if Alexis's will is stronger than the urge she's trying not to give into.            </span></div></div>",

So she put the blue box where she has her Cyber Angel Deck in onto the table and walks back from it until she's in the middle of her room to allow herself to gain just a little bit of pleasure from what she's experiencing just to see if what she felt when lightly flexed her biceps was genuine pleasure or not, but the moment she did, she fell to her knees biting her bottom lip to muffle her brief scream of pleasure. Alexis knew right then and there that she loved the pleasure she felt from making her muscles grow, and knew that it would be a shame to not make her muscles bigger and stronger right now, so she started to flex her back muscles, traps, abs and pecs as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's it, .....just keep flexing\" she said in between pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, the shirt that was her uniform was reduced to shreds, leaving her bra being the only thing that preventing her from becoming topless. Although that bra might not be their for long since her traps, back muscles and pecs are 30 inches and rising, but Alexis doesn't seem to mind as she'll worry about finding clothes that'll fit her later, that and her breasts have melted away as her newfound pecs took their place. Once her back muscles, traps and pecs were 50 inches, she focused on flexing her abs, inner thighs, quads and calves, only to start flexing her inner thighs, quads and calves when her abs became a thick, muscular and ripped 8 pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her leg muscle get bigger and stronger, she flexes her forearms, biceps, triceps and deltoids to get them to 50 inches as quickly as she could so that she can tear her skirt in half. But by the time that she got her arm muscles to 50 inches, her now 50 inch quads, inner thighs and calves have reduced her skirt to tiny pieces of fabric, leaving her panties the only thing unscathed from her muscle growing transformation. But the pleasure she's feeling was so blissfully intoxicating that just growing her now lightly veined muscles to 50 inches just wasn't enough to sate it, so she started flexing every single muscle on her body as hard as she could causing the tiny veins on them to grow bigger and thicker, all the while Alexis was blushing red due to how much she's loving and enjoying her muscles growing bigger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Alexis, these muscles belong to a weak little princess, and you are not a WEAK.LITTLE.PRINCESS........YOU ARE A QUEEEEEEEEEN!!!!!!\" she said to herself as loud as she could without having everyone in the dorm come barging into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that her muscles and veins exploded in growth until every inch of she beef was a jaw dropping 70 inches and her veins become so big that they stick out like a sore thumb, then she stands up and begins to breath heavily due to hard she flexed her muscles while adjusting to how big her muscles are. Once she was done adjusting to how big her muscles are, she grabbed all of the shreds and tiny pieces of fabric that was her uniform and throws them away in the trash. But when she heard a knock on the door, she quickly grabs the blanket that was on her bed and covers herself with it, then she calms herself down by taking a couple of slow deep breaths before she talks to whoever is outside her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jasmine your majesty\" she answered jokingly, which caused Alexis to blush deep red and went to the door, only to open it just enough so that Jasmine can only see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long were you standing here?\" she asked quietly so that only Jasmine can hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here right around the time when you saying \"Yes that's it, .....just keep flexing\" in between pants, that and I decided to stay and watch you hulk out while making sure no one else decided to come here until you got a hold of yourself\" she said and Alexis opened the door to let Jasmine in, only to have an \"oh shit\" face when she noticed that Mindy had arrived just as she was about to let Jasmine in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmmmm.......did I come here at a bad time?\" she asked not knowing what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not at all Mindy, in fact I was just about ask if you can come with me so that Alexis can get you caught up on what's going on, isn't that right Alexis?\" she answered and looked at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wanted to explain why I reacted the way I did when you showed up here\" she said as she lets Mindy and Jasmine into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were inside, Alexis closed the door behind her while making sure that the blanket was still on her, then she makes her way towards her friends and prepares herself to get Mindy all caught up on what Jasmine saw and heard. Mindy was waiting patiently for Alexis to get her caught up on what she got herself into, although she couldn't help but notice that Alexis was covering herself with her blanket. But right when she was about to ask Alexis why she's covering herself with her blanket, she saw that Alexis knew what she was going to ask, but what happens next caused her to look surprised and dumbfounded as she sees Alexis's jaw dropping muscular and veiny body when she threw the blanket to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly molly.....Alexis how did you end up with a musclebound body that's built like a Labyrinth Tank?!\" she asks dumbfounded by what she's seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellllll......it all started when I was opening the 10 Berserker Card Booster Packs that I bought, I decided to open 5 of them first just to get a good idea of what I've purchased. But once I opened the 5th Booster Pack, I started to notice that these cards were giving off something that made me feel empowered just by holding them, although for some reason I was feeling some sort of energy welling up inside of my muscles. When I've found this out, I've decided to lightly flex my biceps to see if this energy would react to my light bicep flex, that was when I gained pleasure for the first time and stopped myself before this pleasure I was feeling got the better of me by the time my biceps grew to 20 inches. However, after I decided to grow the rest of my muscles to 20 inches, I was feeling this sudden urge to flex harder and make my muscles bigger and stronger and tried not to give into it. Buuuut as you can clearly see.....I wasn't able to do resist is, especially since I found out that I loved the pleasure I have felt from making my muscles grow after letting myself gain just a little bit of pleasure to see if what I've felt when I lightly flexed my biceps was genuine pleasure or not\" she explained to Mindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get straight, the reason why you have those huge muscles is because of some sort of energy welling up within you was being amplified by the Berserker Cards you've bought at the Card Shop?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that sounds about right\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mindy, now that your all caught up, we need to find some new clothes that Alexis can be able to wear as her new uniform without tearing it to shreds with a tiny flex\" she said, but she noticed that Mindy's eyes have perked up as it a light bulb has appeared over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't you worry about that, I got some workout clothes and uniform jackets that a friend of mine gave me when she outgrew them, so you two just sit tight while I go get them!\" she said happily as she gets out of the room and makes her way to her and Jasmines room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's a good thing that Mindy held onto her bodybuilder friends clothes, I can't imagine seeing you wearing nothing but a pair of Cyber Petite Angel panties, boots and fingerless gloves during class\" she said and saw that Alexis was blushing in embarrassment when Jasmine mentioned her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't exactly want to be wearing my blanket everywhere I go, although since Mindy is going to bring her friends clothes here, I guess I should open up the rest of the Booster Packs and organize the cards before she comes back\" she said and makes her way back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that you want to do that Alexis? You said that those Berserker Cards amp up this energy within your muscles, so you might end up amplifying it even more if you open the rest of those cards\" she said as her friend sits down on the chair that's at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do make a good point Jasmine\" she said as she thinks about whether she should open the rest of the Booster Packs now or wait until Mindy come back with the clothes that her bodybuilding friend outgrew.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although she wants to open the rest of the Berserker Card Booster Packs now and get a head start on rebuilding her deck, but she decided to do that later on and sees Jasmine heading out of her room and get the clothes Mindy got from her bodybuilding friend, although Mindy came back by the time she gets off of the chair and makes her way towards the mirror to check out her muscular body. Once she was at the mirror, Alexis was blushing red at the sight of her veiny muscles as her hands touch her pecs, although she was becoming horny for the first time as a result of seeing her veiny muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh.....Alexis...are you okay? Do you need me to be right next to you in case you start bulking up again?\" she asked concerned as she closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mindy, I would appreciate if you were right here next to me\" she answered as her eyes were still fixated on the reflection of her veiny muscular body on the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy then makes her way towards Alexis who was resisting the urge to grope her pecs as she wants to explore more of her muscles, but once she was next to her friend, Alexis was able to calm herself down enough to be able to feel her 8 pack while watching herself doing it on the mirror. Although Mindy was watching the reflection of Alexis feeling her 8 pack on the mirror in awe, albeit she was blushing lightly due to loving the veiny muscular body Alexis now has, but she decided to keep that to herself until she could be able to say that to her without ruining their friendship in any way. But when Alexis turned around so that her veiny muscular back can be seen on her mirror, she looks at Mindy with a reassuring smile on her face, which causes Mindy to blush deep red seeing as she found out that loves her veiny muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theirs no need for you to blush as hard as you are Mindy, in fact I should be the one blushing deep red since I've gotten horny just from looking at my muscles\" she said bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Are you really okay with me loving those muscles of yours?\" she asks while blushing even harder, and it didn't help that Alexis was flexing her back muscles and traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, in fact I don't blame you for loving them, I would be doing the same if either you or Jasmine were to get these muscles instead of me\" she answered kindly, but she was a bit startled when Mindy hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Alexis, you have no idea how much this means to me, especially since I thought this would ruin our friendship\" she said happily and a bit of tears rolled down her eyes as she breaks up the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindy we've been friends ever since I started going to Duel Academy, so theirs no way you loving these veiny muscles I have would ruin our friendship\" she said and to get her point across she stops flexing her back muscles and traps and turns around so that she's looking right at Mindy, then she flexes both of her biceps as hard as she could while giving her a wink and reassuring smirk, and Mindy just looks at Alexis with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad that you said what you did to Mindy, because I've been trying my best not to blush and stare at your muscles like your the hottest chick in Duel Academy ever since I saw you bulking up\" Jasmine said carrying what looks like a closet full of workout clothes and uniform jackets as she closes the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then makes her way towards Alexis's bed to put the clothes she's carrying their, Alexis then stopped flexing her 70 inch biceps and she went to help her bring the clothes to her bed along with Mindy, and Jasmine appreciated the help as the three ladies put the clothes onto the bed. Alexis noticed that Jasmine wanted to tell her something as she grabs one pair of workout clothes and a uniform jacket, so she went to her once she puts on the workout clothes which was an XXL stretchable training bra that fits her pecs like a glove and XXL stretchable shorts that only covers her quads, inner thighs and knees, and they were the same colors as the uniform that was reduced to shreds by her muscle growing transformation. But once she was where Jasmine is, she was completely taken by surprise when she kissed her on the lips, and she was blushing bright red when she broke up the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhhhhh......Jasmine? Ummmm.....do you mind explaining why you.....kissed me?\" she asked still blushing bright red while Mindy was looking at her dumbfounded by what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm not going to sugar coat it, the chances of me finding a guy let alone one who's decent enough for me to consider boyfriend material is very slim, but when I saw you bulking up like crazy.....I saw something in you that I didn't see before. So as I was getting these clothes for you, I had some time to think about what I saw, ......and I started to experience feelings I never knew I had. But once I came back here with the clothes Mindy's bodybuilder friend gave her when she outgrew them.....I realized that I've fallen in love with you, so right then and there I decided that I would confess my love for someone who has been my friend since I came to Duel Academy by kissing you!\" she answered while looking at Alexis like she was her knight in shining armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was borderline surprised and dumbstruck at what Jasmine has said to her, so it took her a while to process what she heard since she didn't think she would be able to have a shot at love again after deciding that Blair should have Jaden as her boyfriend, especially since Jasmine one of her best friends has flat out said that she loves her. But after 4 minutes of processing what her friend has told her, Alexis looks at Jasmine right in the eye, only to grab the back of her head and kisses her deeply blushing dark red while allowing herself to revel in the horniness from looking at her veiny muscular body to rise to the surface. Meanwhile, Mindy was looking at the two finding what their doing so heart warming, but she couldn't help but wonder if Alexis had feelings for her since she was okay with her loving her veiny muscles, she got her answer when Alexis to her and kissed her just like she did with Jasmine and breaks up the kiss once she's done kissing her 2nd best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that the three of us have been best friends ever since we arrived at Duel Academy, but I'd figure that we might as well be more than friends now that we've all confessed our love for each other, that and.....it'll be great if the three of us are a couple since we care a lot for each other\" she said shyly still getting used to the fact that she loves two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way Alexis\" Jasmine said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, although we should keep this between us just to be safe, you may never know if someone would decide to use the love we have for each other against us\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Alexis hasn't managed to calm down enough to stop being horny due to her not wanting to yet, she helped out her girlfriends with cleaning out her closet of the uniforms that used to fit her and put all of the workout clothes and uniform jackets which are XXL versions of jackets worn by certain students in Duel Academy into the closet, all expect one which Alexis puts onto her bed so that she can put it on when she goes to duel against the Berserker Duelist. Once they put Alexis's old clothes near the door they can take them to the Spare Uniform Shed, Alexis decides to go to the table and grabs the five Berserker Card Booster Packs, then she grabs two of the five Booster Packs she had with her free hand and goes to Mindy and Jasmine who are wondering why she's holding two Booster packs with her right hand instead of holding all of them with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindy and Jasmine, I want to give each of you one of my Berserker Card Booster Packs as a gift from me to the two of you, that way both of you can have muscles like me. But you don't have to decide right now, so you can take all the time you need to decide if you want a Booster Pack or not\" she said kindly and they look surprised at what Alexis said, although Mindy and Jasmine were now thinking about whether they should accept her gift or not.         </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Admittedly it took Mindy and Jasmine about 7 minutes to decide if they should accept Alexis's gift or not, especially since their not so sure if they'll have any muscles when they open the booster packs, but they nodded yes to Alexis while having a smile on their face as their way of saying \"The two of us will be more than happy to accept your gift, especially if it means you'll be happy\". Alexis then gives each of them one Berserker Card Booster Pack from the hand that is holding two of them and they kindly grab it from her, next both Mindy and Jasmine open the foil packs and take out the 15 cards from them, but their jaws dropped when they saw what looks like Ultra Rare versions of Berserker Monsters that look similar to Berserker Dragon Empress but different in terms of how they look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.....I didn't think their would be a monster card that would compliment the Boss Monster of this deck, although I do like the artwork of Gashira - Sword Master of the Empress, but I am a tad bit impressed that she has 5000 ATK and 5000 DEF\" Mindy said and looks at the card Jasmine was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the monster card I have is Nilana - Arch Mage of the Empress, and this monster has 4900 ATK and 4900 DEF, although I just can't help but notice that we've these are the first cards we are seeing right after the three of us became a couple\" she said wondering what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do make a good point Jasmine, especially since the first pack that I've opened had an Ultra Rare version of Berserker Dragon Empress, however that was before I felt the energy inside of my muscles\" Alexis said as she grabs Berserker Dragon Empress from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she grabs the card and puts the three Booster Packs down onto the table, she noticed that Mindy and Jasmine started panting heavily as they put down the cards they were holding onto her bed, yet Gashira - Sword Master of the Empress and Nilana - Arch Mage of the Empress fell down to the floor while the rest of them didn't. So she picked up those two cards from the floor and add them to her hand that's holding Berserker Dragon Empress, but the moment she did, Mindy and Jasmine heavy pants turned into ragged grunts as they were feeling the same energy that Alexis had starting to swell and grow within their muscles. So she went as close to them as she could while giving her girlfriends enough space for them to flex and grow, but as if on cue both of their muscles grew to 20 inches while trying their best not to scream so loud that everyone in this dorm comes busting through the door, although they both know that this is just the beginning since the veins on their muscles were becoming bigger and thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy was the first one to undergo her muscle growing transformation, and she was enjoying every second of it as her muscles were growing bigger and stronger, although she was also getting horny from what's happening to her due to the fact that she's going to have veiny muscles of her own once this transformation is over. However Jasmine's muscles weren't growing whatsoever, instead only her veins seem to be getting bigger, thicker and stronger, it was as if the energy within her muscles was waiting for Mindy's transformation to end so that it can unleash all of the pent up power inside each of her 20 inch veiny muscles, and it was driving Jasmine insane with muscle lust as she wants her muscles to grow so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alexis was watching Mindy's muscles growing in awe as she bit her bottom lip due to how horny she's getting, albeit she was blushing bright red as she was watching her muscles grow. But the moment Mindy noticed that Alexis was watching her undergoing her muscle growing transformation, her breasts melted away and her newfound pecs took their place as them along with every vein riddled muscle on her body grew to an unbelievable 90 inches while her veins became as big and thick as a steel pipe which caused her to scream in pleasure as loud as she could without having everyone in the girls dorm hearing her, all the while her uniform was reduced to tiny pieces of fabric while her Scapegoat panties were spared of the onslaught that was her muscle growing transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her and Alexis Jasmine was hyperventilating lustfully as she was instinctively flexing every muscles on her body as if this was her 12th time doing this, and Alexis's attention quickly turned to her 1st girlfriend as her muscles instantly became as big as Mindy's, although her veins were a lot bigger and thicker than the veins on Mindy's muscles, but all that remains was her pink panties since her uniform ended being reduced to tiny straps of fabric. Although she didn't scream in pleasure like Mindy did, she was moaning lustfully as she was groping her 90 inch pecs while looking at both Alexis and Mindy's veiny muscular bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Moans) I feel so stroooong and sexy, if I had known that having these muscles would feel so amazing, I would have bought myself 10 Berserker Card Booster Packs myself!\" she exclaimed as she stops groping her pecs and starts flexing her biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmmmm......Mindy could you at least try not to let your muscle lust get the better of you? Your muscles might end up growing so big that you may not even be able to wear the clothes Alexis is wearing, isn't that right Alexis?\" she said to Jasmine, but when she looked at Alexis, she was gritting her teeth hard and her eyes were the size of pinpricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis?\" she said looking a bit concerned for her girlfriend and hopes that she's alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis's heart was beating hard and fast as she begins to grunt harshly and hard through her gritted teeth, but by the time Mindy realized what was happening to her, the veins on her 70 inch muscles started growing bigger and thicker at a fast, although Mindy managed to pick up the three cards Alexis was holding which fell to the floor when she lost her grip on them. Alexis was grunting harder and harsher with every passing second as her growing veins begin to cover every inch of her throbbing and <br>\r\nbulging muscles, and the expression on her face made it clear that her muscles are going to grow again, only this time she's forcing it to happen due to being so horny and pent up with lust. Yet she looks at her throbbing and bulging muscles with a crazed yet lustful look in her eyes as wants them to grow again and actually enjoy every second of it instead of being so timid about her muscles growing, although in the back of her mind she was hoping that the workout clothes she has on won't be reduced to shreds, however those worries she had about being nude faded away her fast and hard beating heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\" she yelled at the top of her lungs as loud as she could still not want every girl in this dorm to hear her as her muscles exploded in growth and grew to an eyebrow raising 97 inches, while her veins are 10 times thicker than the ones on Jasmine's muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy and Jasmine were looking at their girlfriend with a surprised, amazed and dumbfounded look on their faces, especially since the clothes she's wearing hasn't been reduced to shreds by Alexis's muscles, although the workout clothes she's wearing now fit her like a 2nd skin due to how massive her muscles are now. Jasmine then went to Alexis to see if her brain hasn't been fried by the lust and pleasure the Queen of Obelisk Blue has felt during her muscle growth spurt while Mindy puts down the three cards she is holding in her hand onto the table where the 3 Berserker Card Booster Packs are, then she joins Jasmine as she wants to know if Alexis is okay, but her and Jasmine sighed in relief when they heard her panting heavily to get a grip on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank goodness your alright Alexis, I thought that we had to take you to the nurse so that you can recover from what you just went through\" Jasmine said glad she is alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad that I'm alright to, although I hope that I still have time to rebuild my deck, it would be a shame to go through all of this just to wait until tomorrow so that I can duel the Berserker Duelist\" she said while looking at the blue box that has her Cyber Angel Deck inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that you'll still have enough time to rebuild your deck, buuut.....I wonder how the three of us will be able to do stuff let alone wear our duel disks since we have these huge muscles?\" she said which caused Alexis to raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a really good question, especially since we have to attend classes and go to dueling sessions until graduation\" she said as she ponders on what Mindy has said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well unless we can be able to conceal as much as our muscles as we want, we might as well start getting use to being this buff, strong and veiny\" Jasmine said as Alexis is wondering if she should see if what Jasmine said is true or worry about that later and focus on rebuilding her deck.       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alexis was thinking about what Jasmine said, and although she hadn't told her and Mindy that decided to continue rebuilding her deck yet, she wanted to get one last look at her 97 inch veiny muscles before she does that. So she makes her way to the mirror and takes a thorough look at herself, and she noticed that even though her muscles are huge their compact and don't take too much space from her body, yet they are more than flexible enough so that she can be able to walk, move and flex without any issues whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you two are concerned about your muscles affecting the way you do things, but I don't think going through doors let alone sitting and laying down won't be an issue. As for being able to wear out duel disks, we can get the brace grips adjusted to fit our forearms once I'm done creating my Berserker Cyber Angel Deck\" she said hoping that she reassured them that theirs no reason to worry about their muscular bodies changing the way they do things as she makes her way back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, we might as well help you rebuild your deck\" Jasmine said as she and Mindy walk with their girlfriend to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmmm.....that's really not necessary you two, I can be able to rebuild this deck by myself no problem\" she said as she sits down on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come one Alexis, do you HONESTLY think that we wouldn't want to repay you for everything you've done for us? I mean you practically gave us the chance to be in a relationship as well as being able to have veiny muscular bodies of our own!\" Mindy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides, what better way to repay our girlfriend than to help her create her Berserker Cyber Angel Deck?\" Jasmine said and Alexis looked at them knowing that she ain't going to change their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sighs) if you really want to help me rebuild my deck, then you two might as well grab a chair, because we got some work to do. Buuuut you might want put on some clothes in case someone comes in here\" she said and her girlfriends hugged her happily glad that they'll be able to repay Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mindy and Jasmine grabbed a pair of workout clothes from the closet and put them on, as well as taking a chair from said closet to sit on, the three musclebound girls began working on rebuilding Alexis's Cyber Angel Deck. First each of them opened a Berserker Card Booster Pack and examined each spell, trap and monster as well as what their capable of, and once they were done reading those cards, they begin to organize all 150 Berserker Cards until each pile has a set number of each card. Next they begin discussing what kind of plays can be pulled off as well as finding ways to compensate for the rebuilt deck's weaknesses, and they begin to write down notes on what each of them came up with while having some fun with what they're doing. Finally after managing to figure the best build for the Berserker Cyber Angel Deck after 5 hours of discussions, writing notes and dueling with dummy decks to find out what these cards can do in a duel, Alexis was able to rebuild her deck from the ground up thanks to the help of her girlfriends Jasmine and Mindy, and she was looking at the blue box that holds her completed Berserker Cyber Angel Deck appreciating what is the first Master Deck she has ever created as well as the fact that Mindy and Jasmine have created it alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Chuckles to herself) who would have thought that after all my years being in Duel Academy, I would not only have these veiny muscles that belong to a Musclebound Queen, but fall in love and be in a relationship with my two best friends?\" she said to herself as Mindy and Jasmine overheard what Alexis said while they were putting on the XXL Uniform Jackets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way, although I guess is thanks to these Berserker Cards that we became a couple\" Mindy said as she makes her way towards Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well those cards DID have something to do with us falling in love with each other I'll say that much, buuut they only made it possible for us to be completely honest with one another, mainly because we have been friends for so long that it was only a matter of time before the three of us became more than friends\" Jasmine pointed out as she and Mindy were walking towards Alexis, who was already wearing her XXL Uniform Jacket with her the blue box containing her Berserker Cyber Angel Deck in it's holster while carrying her duel disk with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine DOES make a good point Mindy, although I'm glad that we are now more than friends, especially since I was able to repay the both of you for being their for me when I was down in the dumps\" she said to her girlfriends and they head out of her room and make their way to Jasmine's and Mindy's room once the two grabbed the cards that Alexis gave them as a gift as well as put their decks into the holsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir XXL Uniform Jackets did noting to hide the three musclebound girls physiques, in fact all they did were put their muscles in full display as they were getting looks of awe and dumbfoundedness from every girl that sees them, even the ones who weren't a big fan of muscly girls couldn't help themselves but stare at them the same way everyone else is. Once Alexis, Mindy and Jasmine arrive at their destination, Alexis decides to wait outside of their room and lean against the wall as Mindy and Jasmine went inside to get their duel disks. As she was waiting for them to grab what they came here for, she noticed that Fonda Fontaine was making her way towards her, so she waved hi to the head of the Obelisk Blue Girls Dorm and she waves back as she lean against the same wall she is putting her right next to the Musclebound Queen of Obelisk Blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect to see you here at the dormitory Ms. Fontaine, to be honest I thought you would still be at the Nurses Office tending to those 'injured\" students\" she said knowing a thing or two about the lengths the guy's will go to fake their injuries just to meet let alone see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got lucky for once since none of the boy's faked their injuries today, especially since everyone's been dueling at the arena's to test out their decks once they rebuilt them with those Archfiend Incorporated cards that have been selling like hot cakes, although I am surprised to see that those who were at the Card Shop were lining up instead of being in the usual mob crowd as they wait to buy the cards they need\" she said while trying her best not to look at Alexis's huge veiny muscles like every other girl here valuing her privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind me asking Ms. Fontaine, did you came to the Girls Dorm just so that you can talk to me or was it for some other reason?\" she asks while trying not to come off as rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I came here for three reasons, one to see if you didn't get overwhelmed by the rush of lust and pleasure from your muscle growing transformation when you opened those Berserker Card Booster Packs like the other 2 girls who have now just recovered and has fully adjusted to their muscular bodies and the baggage that comes with it, and two to just have a conversation between ladies\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's the 3rd reason?\" she asked a bit surprised that herself, Mindy and Jasmine weren't the first ones who went through this, that and it could explain why Mindy's bodybuilder friend gave her the clothes she's now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well reason number 3 is so that I could give you an invitation that the Berserker Duelist wanted me to give you\" she answered and gives said invitation to Alexis, who then opened it and started reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Alexis Rhodes, I've heard a lot about you and your reputation as a great duelist as well as being the Queen of Obelisk Blue during my time here in Duel Academy, in fact I asked Zane if he could tell me what he knew about you after we finished our duel. Once I reduced his life points to 0, Zane told me all he knew about you, he even told me that you've been down in the dumps since you realized that you hadn't improved yourself as a duelist. So I decided to send you this invitation to duel me at the docks at night, and you can bring your friends along with you to in case you need somebody to cheer you on\" she read but noticed that their was a \"p.s\" at the bottom of this invitation, so she looks at it and reads it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.s - I have a gut feeling that you bought some Berserker Card Booster Packs hoping that it'll give your deck a boost and ended up being muscular and veiny, so I'll have some people with me so that they can make sure your duel disk will fit, and they'll do the same for your friends if you bring them here provided if they ended up like you\" she read and almost gasped over what she just read, although by this time Mindy and Jasmine both got out of their rooms holding their duel disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mindy and Jasmine, I wasn't expecting you two would end up being buff and veiny like Alexis over here\" she said while wondering how they ended up with vein riddled muscles of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's kinda of a long story, but we have to go get our duel disks refitted, although we can talk about it later if you want to?\" Jasmine said as she and Mindy walk towards Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll be fine with that, especially if it means I can learn more about this muscle growing thing and why it only seems to affect females\" she said as the three musclebound girls begin to make their way out of the Girls Dorm, although Alexis was looking at the invitation she's holding in her right hand wondering if she should show the note that is written on it to Mindy and Jasmine once they are alone or decide not to show it to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though she has no clue if showing Mindy and Jasmine what she read on the invitation was a good idea since she literally knew next to nothing about the Berserker Duelist other than she's crazy good at Duel Monsters, runs a company called Archfiend Incorporated AND just so happens to be kind and understanding person who came in first place at Ms. and Mr. Obelisk 4 times in a row, Alexis decided to show them the note on the invitation Fonda Fontaine gave her once their a good distance away from the Girls Dorm. Once they were far enough away from prying eyes, she gestured her girlfriends to follow her to their dueling spot in the forest which also serves as a place where they can talk freely without anyone butting in, so the three musclebound girls walk into a part of the forest that acts as a shortcut to their dueling spot that gets them there in 2 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you two want to get your duel disks refitted, but theirs something that I need to show you and I didn't want to run the chance of someone overhearing us\" she said and opened the invitation and showing the note written on it to Mindy and Jasmine, although the two look at the note puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anything wrong with this, in fact I find this note rather sweet and heart warming\" Mindy said but noticed that Jasmine was had an \"oh shit\" look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhh.....Mindy? Read the P.s written at the bottom of the note\" she said and Mindy starts reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.s - I have a gut feeling that you bought some Berserker Card Booster Packs hoping that it'll give your deck a boost and ended up being muscular and veiny, so I'll have some people with me so that they can make sure your duel disk will fit, and they'll do the same for your friends if you bring them here provided if they ended up like you\" she read aloud and realized why Jasmine had that \"oh shit\" face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know why I wanted to show you two this in our dueling spot\" she said while Jasmine took some deep breaths while letting what she read sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis sighed knowing that it's going to take a while for Jasmine to get a grip, although a thought crept into her mind that almost caused her to bit her bottom lip, but she decided to act on said thought rather than brush it off like she usually does and begins to take off her XXL Uniform Jacket  as she makes her way towards Jasmine. Mindy realized what Alexis was trying to do and was about to tell her to think before she went through with it, only to find herself catching her Uniform Jacket, duel disk and invitation while blushing bright red at the sight of her girlfriends 97 inch vein riddled muscles. However by the time Jasmine caught a glimpse of Alexis being right in front of her, the Queen of Obelisk Blue was locking lips with her as she wraps her left arm around her back, and uses her right hand to gently grab the back of her head as she kisses Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy has no idea why would Alexis just outright kiss Jasmine.....well at first anyways, but once Jasmine started joining in on the kiss while she gropes Alexis's pecs, she realized that she's trying to get her mind off of what she read on the invitation.....albeit both of them were enjoying their little make out session a bit too much. But once they broke up the kiss after 2 hours of making out with each other, Alexis and Jasmine were panting heavily while resting the urge to go at it again, however....they stopped panting when they noticed that Mindy was grunting heavily and blushing dark red while dropping what she's holding as a result. Alexis then realized that hers and Jasmine's lust and horniness was causing her to become very horny, as a result Mindy us about to go through the same muscle growth spurt as she did, so she wasted no time and took off Mindy's XXL Uniform Jacket, grabbed her duel disk and tossed it to Jasmine who's now carrying all of their stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindy I need you to listen to me, once we get back from me dueling the Berserker Duelist, then the three of us can grow our muscles together in my room. So until then, you've got to resist this urge to let your muscles grow\" she said to her as calm and kindly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are y-y-you.......telling m-me the t-t-t-t-truth?\" she stuttered struggling to resist the urge to allow her muscles to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, and don't worry about us finding clothes that'll fit us when stop growing our muscles, we'll cross that bridge when we get there\" she said and then proceeded to kiss her deeply so that Mindy will be entirely focused on her and not the urge that's trying not to give into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine couldn't but blush bright red and drool at the thought of growing her muscles with her Girlfriends, although she was wondering if they'll be able to go from place to place here at Duel Academy once they are done growing their muscles after Alexis duels the Berserker Duelist, but she lost her train of thought when she heard Mindy moaning as loud as she could while Alexis was kissing her. But what got her surprised was Alexis going all out in her kiss as she rubs her pecs onto Mindy's thick slabs of she beef, it was as if Alexis was a completely different person when she gets horny, although she is finding the way she's acting rather hot and sexy since she got a taste of this Queen when she was making out with her not that long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(She breaks up the kiss) so Mindy? ......Was your Queen able to help you to resist that urge?\" she asked sexily as she licks the huge vein on the left bicep that she's flexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have indeed helped me resist that urge and then some your majesty\" she said as Alexis wipes the saliva off of the vein with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? .....Well then I guess we should get dressed up before anyone sees us\" she said and she catches her duel disk, invitation and XXL Uniform Jacket that Jasmine tossed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are your sure that your still you Alexis or is this the 2nd coming of the Ice Queen?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Jasmine I am still me, it's just that I'm not as....timid as I used to be\" she answered as she puts on her XXL Uniform Jacket while she noticed that the sun is about to start going down at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a relief, here I thought I needed knock some sense into you in a duel\" someone said and the three musclebound girls look into the direction of where the voice came from, only to realized that it was Fonda Fontaine, which caused them to look like they've just seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Alexis, Mindy and Jasmine, I'm not going to tell everyone at Duel Academy that you three are a couple, so your secret is safe with me. And before you ask, I was taking a stroll through the forest when I heard Mindy grunting heavily, which is why I ended up here and right dab in the middle of Alexis and Mindy making out with each other\" she said while Mindy and Alexis have just finished putting on their XXL Uniform Jackets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sighs in relief) well at least we don't have to worry about our secret being revealed, although since you are here Ms. Fontaine, would you want to walk with me, Mindy and Jasmine to the docks? I believe we still owe you an explanation as to how we ended up like this\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love that very much\" she said and the four started walking out of the forest and make their way towards the docks as the sun sets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexis, Mindy, Jasmine and Fonda continue their walk to the docks, they were having a good time talking to each other as Fonda now not only knows about everything these three girls went through as well as learning everything she needs to know about why the girls are the only one's going through these muscle growing transformations as well as the transformation itself from each of their experiences with this, but the bond that they share with each other and how it has gotten even stronger now that they are a couple. By the time they were done having their conversations, it was already nightfall when they made it to the dock, although Alexis has her eyes set on the woman that she's going to be dueling once her duel disk as well as Mindy's and Jasmine's has been refitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Alexis, I'm glad that you came here with your friends, although I am a bit surprised that Ms. Fontaine is here as well\" she said as she gestures a female wearing glasses with dirty blonde hair that's tied up in a ponytail wearing a uniform that looks like something an employee from Archfiend Incorporated would wear to go to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greeting Ms. Rhodes, my name is Helen, I'll be the one to refit your duel disk as well as the ones your friends have\" she said blushing lightly due to getting a glimpse of her vein riddled muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you Helen\" she said as she gives her duel disk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mindy and Jasmine give their duel disks to Helen, she goes to a table and begins working on them, and one by one she replaced the brace clamps with a modified version of the brace clamp that she built for her boss's duel disk. Then she made some final adjustments to the brace clamps on each of their duel disks, and when she was finished making said adjustments, she gave Alexis, Mindy and Jasmine their duel disks back and sat down on a chair that was at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Alexis this is it, this duel were gonna have will show everyone here if everything you have went through today was able to improve your skills as a duelist, and I plan on going all out so I can put those skills to the test and push them to their limit!\" she said in a stern, confident and motivating tone as she takes out her deck from it's leather box and inserts it into her gold and black duel disk, which activates it and automatically shuffles her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you should mention that your going all out, because I'm not going to pull any punches in this duel, and I plan on ending your winning streak right here!\" she said with confidence as she takes off her XXL Uniform Jacket and throws it to Mindy, then she puts on her duel disk, takes out her Berserker Cyber Angel Deck and does the same thing she did.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

So as long as this card remains on the field, I get to summon two Berserker Monsters instead of one during my turn, which means I can be able to tribute summon as well provided I got enough monsters to tribute summon!\" she said as she activates it, only to notice that Alexis had a devious smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've just played RIGHT into my hand, I activate the continuous trap card Spell Ensnarement! If you were to activate a spell card during your turn, I gain control of it until Spell Ensnarement gets sent to the graveyard, so your Summoner Frenzy is now mine!\" she said as a shadow with red eyes grabs Summoner Frenzy and brings it to Alexis's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good play on your part, but at least I can take down your Berserker Brawler! Now Berserker Archfiend Bella, send Berserker Brawler on a one way trip to the graveyard with Dark Energy Punch!!!\" she said and Bella runs directly to her prey as fast as her legs will take her, then she covers her fist with dark energy and punches Berserker Brawler right in her chest with as much strength as she could muster, causing her to be completely vaporized in a dark energy explosion as Alexis gets knocked back a couple of inches from the shock wave the explosion created but managed to remain standing as her life points are now 3,390 while her opponents life points are 3,500.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn by putting 3 cards face down\" she said as she sets three cards face down and banishes the card she has in her graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew.....it's a good thing I packing all of this muscle, otherwise I would be sent flying right now, let's just hope that I can be able to draw a card that'll help me take down Berserker Archfiend Bella\" she said in her mind as she walks back to where she was while her girlfriends and Fonda look concerned for both hers and the Berserker Duelists well being, then Alexis draws a card from her deck and smiled when the card she drew was Cyber Petite Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just what I needed, I summon Cyber Petite Angel in defense position!\" she said and summons her defense position as the display shows that she's a level 2 fairy/light effect monster with 300 ATK and 200 DEF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I activate Cyber Petite Angel's special ability, which allows me to add either 1 Cyber Angel Monster or Machine Angel Ritual from my deck to my hand\" she said and adds Machine Angel Ritual from her deck to her hand and puts her deck back into her duel disk, and it shuffles her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to put your Summoner Frenzy to good use and summon Etoile Cyber in defense position\" she said and summons her in defense position as the display shows that she's a warrior/earth effect monster with 1200 ATK and 1600 DEF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I am going to play that Machine Angel Ritual I've gained thanks to Cyber Petite Angel, and sacrifice my Cyber Gymnast and Etoile Cyber to ritual summon Cyber Angel Dakini in attack position!\" she said and did just that and summons her in attack position as the display shows that she's a fairy/light effect ritual monster with 2700 ATK and 2400 DEF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh....why would you go through all of this trouble just to summon a ritual monster that can't even be able to destroy Berserker Archfiend Bella?\" she asked as she raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right, Dakini only has 2700 ATK while your Berserker Archfiend Bella has 2900 ATK, .....but this is where my equip spell Berserker Augmentation come in\" she said and activates it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This equip spell allows me to increase the ATK and DEF of Cyber Angel Dakini by the attack points of a Berserker Monster in my graveyard, which makes her a 4990 ATK and 4690 ritual monster, and she becomes a Berserker Monster as a result of activating this equip spell\" she said and Dakini's outfit was reduced to shreds and scraps of metal due to her now 190 foot muscles, then she picks up the weapons she dropped due to the sudden muscle growing transformation and looks at her two opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Berserker Cyber Angel Dakini, cut her Berserker Archfiend Bella into piece with your swords!!!\" she said and Dakini quickly went to Bella and used and cut her into pieces, causing the hologram that is Bella to dissipate as the Berserker Duelist looks at what just happened shocked and dumbfounded as her life points went from 3,500 to 1550, but she remembered that she had a face down card that would soften the blow her life points took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've activated my trap card Adrenaline Rush, the moment my life points take damage, I gain life points equal to half of the attack of the monster that was sent to the graveyard my side of the field prior to activating it\" she said and the trap card worked it's magic as her life points went from 1550 to 2898.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say that I wasn't going to pull any punches, just consider yourself lucky that you had Adrenaline Rush face down when you did, and with that I end my turn\" she said and looks at the one card that's in her hand which is Berserker Dragon Empress, while the Berserker Duelist was looking at Gashira - Sword Master of the Empress as she wonders how she'll be able to turn this duel around as Mindy, Jasmine and Fonda were watching every second of this duel and how it's unfolding.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

So as long as this field spell isn't destroyed, all Berserker Monsters gain a 1000 ATK and DEF boost as well as being immune to spells and traps, but it also allow me to banish any monster I have in my hand and bring it back as a Berserker Monster as well as no longer having to pay half of my life points to use a Berserker Monsters effects!\" she said and inserts Berserker Battlefield into the field spell slot on her duel disk, turning this area of the docks into a medieval battlefield with broken and bloodstained weapons scattered throughout the field, all the while Mindy, Jasmine and Fonda take a look at their surroundings impressed at what they are seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know for a field spell, the level of detail here is beyond anything I've seen in any other field spell\" Fonda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At Archfiend Incorporated, we spare no expense in the creation of Duel Monster cards so that duelists can buy and use cards of a higher quality without breaking the bank, which is why Berserker Battlefield is more detailed than the usual field spell\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And speaking of Duel Monster cards, I'm going to special summon Berserker Archfiend Maria in attack position by banishing Berserker Archfiend Bella!\" she said and removed Bella from her graveyard and put the card into her leather deck holder, and then summons a naked woman with 150 foot muscles who looks like a humanoid ghoul with long sharp claws that's been exposed to even more dark energy than Bella as the display shows that she's a level 8 dark/fiend effect monster with 3000 ATK and 3000 DEF, however her she now has 4000 ATK and DEF due to the effect of Berserker Battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I'm going to activate Berserker Archfiend Maria's special ability, which allows me to bring back Berserker Archfiend Bella which was banished and summon her to the field, although I don't have to pay 500 life points for the effect to activate due to Berserker Battlefield\" she said and summons Bella in attack position who now has 3900 ATK and 3650 DEF due to the effect of Berserker Battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I have two of my Berserker Archfiends out on the field, I get to activate my 2nd face down card which is a spell card called Sacrifice for the Berserker Archfiend Queen! I can only activate this spell if I have Berserker Archfiend Bella, Berserker Archfiend Maria and 1 Berserker Monster on my side of the field, since I've met the requirement to use this spell card, I can have my two Berserker Archfiends attack Berserker Shield Warrior and sacrifice her to summon Berserker Archfiend Queen\" she said as Bella and Maria took out Berserker Shield Warrior, but by sending her to the graveyard a woman with 200 foot muscles that looks like a battle scarred She Wolf exposed to more dark energy than Maria is now on the field with her two loyal subjects as the display shows that she's a level 10 dark beast-warrior/fiend effect monster with 4950 ATK and 4950 DEF, only for her ATK and DEF to become 5950 due to Berserker Battlefields effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sighs in relief) it's a good thing I drew Card of Sanctity when I did, otherwise I wouldn't be able to draw the cards that I need to make Berserker Archfiend Queen strong enough to take out your beefed up Cyber Angel Dakini. But since I was able to pull that off, my Berserker Archfiend Queen is going to claw through your Berserker Cyber Angel Dakini with Claw Slasher Barrage!\" she said and the She Wolf howled as she attacks Dakini with a flurry of claw slashes, destroying the musclebound Cyber Angel and reducing Alexis's life points to 1930.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Berserker Archfiend Maria, send Cyber Petite Angel to the scrapheap with Toxic Fire Breath!\" she said and Maria breathes toxic green fire on Cyber Petite Angel, reducing it to molten metal as the hologram explodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berserker Archfiend Bella, attack Alexis's life points directly with Dark Energy Punch and END this duel!!!\" she said sternly and Bella covers her left fist with dark energy and runs towards Alexis as fast as her muscular legs will take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to let you win this duel that easily, from my hand I activate the quick play spell card Undying Warrior! When my life points go to 0 due to a direct attack, my life point will increase by the ATK of the monster who's attacking me directly at the end of the damage step!\" she said and gets hit right in the chest by Berserker Archfiend Bella's attack, causing her to be knocked to the ground as her life points drop to 0, only to slowly get up with the help of Mindy and Jasmine after they ran to their girlfriend as her life points increase to 3900.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping to get back up, and even though I didn't need it, I appreciate the help\" she said and her life points were now at 3900.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know that you would to, but now's not the time to act tough, especially since you've almost got the wind knocked out of you by that attack!\" Mindy said as she and Jasmine let go of Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindy is right, you should focus more on taking down the Berserker Duelist than trying to tank a hit like a badass, especially since she has three high attack monsters out on the field\" she said while pointing out the situation the Queen of Obelisk Blue is in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I got something in mind to deal with her Berserker Archfiends, you two just make sure Ms. Fontaine doesn't get caught in the crossfire during our duel\" she said and gives each of them a kiss as her way of saying that she'll be okay not caring about the fact that the woman she's dueling and her assistant now knowing their secret before Mindy and Jasmine head back to where Fonda is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well.....I had a feeling that you three might be more than friends in the way I saw Mindy and Jasmine running towards you Alexis, but since you've pretty much shown that you three are a couple, I might as well show you what I look like under this black hooded cloak\" she said and throws the cloak she's wearing to the side, revealing a red haired white woman with an dumbfounded 190 foot veiny muscular body with pecs that'll make a male bodybuilder ashamed of himself just by looking at them, causing Alexis, Mindy, Jasmine and Fonda to look at this she beef filled woman awestruck and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although as much as I like to hear your compliments from each of you....and I know you have a thing or two to say about my veiny musclebound body, the duel between me and Alexis is going to take priority over that, so I'm going to set two cards face down and end my turn\" she said and does just that, meanwhile Alexis regained her composer and draws a card from her deck, and said card just so happens to be the one of two cards that she can use to deal with the Berserker Duelists Berserker Archfiends as she allows her life points to go from 3900 to 2900 so that she can still have Summoner Frenzy out on the field.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Buuuut before I take out Bella, I'm going to activate the special ability she gained from Berserker Brawler to summon Berserker Dragon Empress in defense position\" she said and a bipedal dragoness with insanely huge muscles that makes Obelisk look puny in comparison can be seen flapping her wings above the dock, only to dive and do a super hero landing as the display shows that she's a level 9 Light dragon/effect monster with 3800 ATK and 3500 DEF, however the display showed that she was now 4800 ATK and 4500 DEF due to Berserker Battlefields effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that she's out on the field, I'll have Berserker Cyber Blader attack your Berserker Archfiend Bella and send her on a one way trip to the graveyard!\" she said and Berserker Cyber Blader skates to Bella as fast as she could, and then she punches the lizard women so hard that she was knocked down to the floor and dissipated as the Berserker Duelists life points went from 2898 to 2198.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I end my turn I just wanted to let you know that if theirs two monsters on your side of the field, Berserker Cyber Angels attack points double and becomes a 9200 beat stick, and with that I set the last card in my hand face down and end my turn\" she said as she set the one card in her hand face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Berserker Duelist was glad that she now only has two monsters, now she can put the three face down cards she has to good use in order to deal with Berserker Cyber Blader, and so she draws one card from her deck and takes a look at the two cards she has in her hand to see if their is something that she can do to protect her life points while she prepares to send that 9200 beat stick to the graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright for my first move I'll activate one of my face down cards, and it just so happens to be Mystical Space Typhoon! This card allows me to destroy a spell or trap on the field, and I plan on using it to destroy my Berserker Battlefield\" she said and her field spell was sent to the graveyard, and although her two monsters now have their original ATK and DEF as well as being vulnerable to spells and traps, she was able to decrease Berserker Cyber Blader's attack points to 8200 while Alexis's Berserker Dragon Empresses now has her original ATK and DEF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I activate the spell card Acolyte of Berserker Necromancer, this is a monster who's also a spell card that allows me to summon Gashira - Sword Master of the Empress and Nilana - Arch Mage of the Empress ignoring their summoning conditions, although their attack and defense point are halved as a result and I have to pay 1000 life points for the effect to resolve\" she said and reduces her life points to 1198 to summons two bipedal dragonesses that are both light dragon/effect monsters, Gashira has 3333 ATK and DEF due to the effect of Acolyte of Berserker Necromancer, while Nilana has 3267 ATK and DEF as the result from said effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I activate Nilana's special ability, which allows me to sacrifice two monsters on my side of the field to increase hers and Gashira's ATK and DEF by half of the combined attack and defense points from the monsters who were sacrificed\" she said and send Berserker Archfiend Maria &amp; Queen to the graveyard, causing Gashira's ATK and DEF to become 6933, while Nilana's ATK and DEF becomes 6867.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I shall activate Gashira's special ability, which allows her and Nilana to attack one monster on your side of the field, and I choose your Berserker Cyber Blader!!!\" she yelled and the display shows that both monsters combined ATK was 13800 as they charge towards Berserker Cyber Blader, all the while Mindy, Jasmine and Fonda watch hoping that the Queen of Obelisk Blue has something to counter this attack or it's game over for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just activated Berserker Dragon Empresses special ability, which sends your attack on Berserker Cyber Blader right to her and I take no damage once her effect resolves, although she goes to the graveyard as a result once she blocks that attack\" she said and the Empress of the Berserker Monsters protects Berserker Cyber Blader from the tag team attack and looks back to her and Alexis as her way of saying \"Don' worry, I shall protect you two from this attack!\", which surprised Alexis since she recalled that she couldn't be able to see duel monster spirits to this extent like Jaden, but she figured out quickly that this must've been another perk she gained from the energy she acquired from these Berserker Cards as the dragoness dissipates due to tanking the attack that would have reduced her life points to 0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn....you made a good call using Berserker Dragon Empresses special ability, now Gashira and Nilana are wide open for an attack.....and since I have no cards in my hand, all I can do is end my turn and see which monster your going to attack\" she said and looks at Alexis with a smile on her face as her opponent draws a card from her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sighs) I gotta admit that this was a really great duel I had with you Berserker Duelist, in fact I haven't had this much dueling someone in a long time....so I might as well end this duel with a bang by activating the Berserker Augmentation Equip Spell I had face down last turn, and I use Berserker Dragon Empress to increase Berserker Cyber Blader's ATK and DEF by 3800!\" she said and her monsters ATK was now 12000 and her DEF became 7100, and her muscles and veins grew to 170 feet to compliment those high attack points as a result of being equipped with Berserker Augmentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Berserker Cyber Blader, send Gashira - Sword Master of the Empress to the graveyard and end this duel with Spinning Plie Kick!\" she said and Berserker Cyber Blader skates to her opponent as fast as her legs will take her, and once she was close enough, she started spinning while doing a plie as fast as she could with one leg sticking out for the kick which connected to Gashira's head and caused the dragoness to be sent flying to right and dissipate as the Berserker Duelist kept looking at Alexis with a smile on her face as her life points were reduced to 0 while Mindy, Jasmine and Fonda cheered and celebrated for Alexis's victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest with you, I don't feel angry or sad that I've lost, .....instead I feel happy and glad that I've dueled against someone like you!\" she said as she puts her deck back into it's leather holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm glad that I was able to duel someone like you, it gave me the chance to better myself as a duelist while testing out my Berserker Cyber Angel Deck\" she said and puts her deck into it's holster once she puts on her XXL Uniform Jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they both said their goodbyes and Alexis walked to where Mindy, Jasmine and Fonda are, then the four began to walk back to the Girls Dorm before sunrise, but suddenly Fonda starts to feel different.      </span></div></div>",

Yubel suddenly felt revitalised, she flew up 10 feet off the ground straight away when suddenly she felt a warmth around her body, she looked at what she could of herself and saw her breasts, that were virtually non-existent before, growing in front of her eyes, her eyes widened as another red ray shot down and bathed her as she floated in the air, this second ray however was mutating her, she threw her head back and felt the changes begin, her muscles began to develop and grow and her tits, already large, grew even faster, as did her height, her little to no clothing ripped in an instant and she was left floating as an 8 foot muscle beast, growing slowly she simply closed her eyes and drifted back to the ground, even the limbs that connected to her wings began growing muscles, seemingly larger than her actual biceps and such, she closed her eyes and grew.. And grew.. And grew.. Opening at 12 feet tall, muscles so large they were bigger than her head, tits twice the size of those, obscuring vision almost, she closed her eyes again as she felt the warmth of another ray of destruction bathe her body, all 3 concentrating on a different part of her body, one on her crotch and legs, another on the abs and chest and the last on her shoulders, head and wings, she moaned as she reached 15 feet tall her body began widening considerably as if knowing a 4th ray was going to engulf her entire body, she became a staggering 9 foot wide and 16 feet tall, her shoulders widened and grew and rose over her head, trapezius muscles rising behind her head too, and as if on cue, the 4th ray came down and bathed her, she began moaning louder and louder as her muscles grew larger and ever so much larger, 20 feet tall and 14 feet wide, her wings at least 2 feet longer and wider together than her at all times, even though they were unusable now, her body trembled and groaned as muscle after muscle grew and expanded on her frame, her breasts absolutely massive as this point, she reached 25 feet and the rays stopped, hiding behind the clouds once more, she huffed and puffed and moaned in pleasure at the scope of her transformation, her mutations were beautiful and she loved them, she wanted more.</span></div></div>",

No details were on the card except the words written on it \"SWIPE ME\" Tori hesitated, should she swipe, it could be a trick, but all that power looks good she thought.

BY THE GODS! MORE! MMMM I SUMMON THE PALADIN GODDESS AGAIN!\" She cried, her already amazonian form spasmed and pulsed with energy as she gritted her teeth and pummeled her fists into the ground, tits pushing into the floor beneath, she reached 12 feet, 14, 18, 20 feet, she threw her head back as her muscles and tits blew out, engulfing her head in a sea of absolute power and sexiness, she forced herself to stand at 26 feet, her tits blew out again causing her to groan in a deeply sexual way, lightning still striking her pleasure centers as she grew on and on, her arms had bulked up to the point her biceps peaked at 12 feet, more muscles piled itself on top of muscle, growing and expanding all over, her abs were an incredible 30 pack, way beyond whats humanly possible, her legs were unimaginable and still growing and bulging with thick tree sized muscles as she reached 30 feet tall, her breasts once again blew out to massive proportions and with her head thrown back, eyes milked over and mouth gaping open releasing moan after moan, she threw her arms into the air and clenched her fists, screaming in rapture at her ascension, \"FUCK, FUCK-FUCK-FUUUCK I SUMMON YOU AGAIN GODDESS, MORE, MOOOREEE!!\" And more came, power filled Tori Meadows like an inflating balloon, she was growing more muscular and powerful every second, every less than a moment her power was unthinkably multiplying. With her arms still thrown in the air she cried out again and again at 40 feet tall, the tattoo card still firing godly amounts of energy into her body, her eyes glowed white as she felt godly energy fill her very being, \"YES.. ITS MY DESTINY TO BECOME THIS.. TO GROWWW!! <b>I SUMMON YOU AGAIN GODDESS AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!</b>\" She screamed as the card itself on her wrist glowed with such intensity she brought her arms down and simply flexed instead, so much power was filling her, her muscles were rapidly and uncontrollably multiplying and growing to unimaginable levels of immensity, \"HOLY FUCK.. I WILL BECOME THE WOMAN ON THE CARD, TOWERING OVER MOUNTAINS HAHAHAAA!\" She screamed again as her body bulged up to 60 feet, then 80, cum seeping down her leg as she no longer had control of her growth, her body went into overdrive and made her surge onwards, 100 feet, 120 feet, 140 feet, until she abruptly stopped at 160 feet. Cum seeping down her legs, veins and muscles throbbing and pulsating with raw power, her body a towering muscular beacon of power.. Tori felt good.</span></div></div>",
