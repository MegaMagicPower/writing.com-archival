THIS is a fine mess you've gotten yourself into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing a certain video game (Final Fantasy 10) and using a certain summon (Shiva) for the first time, you immediately felt yourself drawn to her. her curves, her strong legs, her almost flirtatious method of combat. You wished, OH you wished that she was real. And enormous, so there could be more of her to enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... bad choice. After shutting off the game for the night, you turned to head to your room... only to realize that the summon of your dreams was directly behind you, with an evil smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You are the one who has called me, eh...?\" She spoke, her head leaning down and a sexy finger tracing under your jaw and tilting your head up. \"And such an... odd desire... you want me to be enormous...? Well then... FINE!\" She suddenly shouts, her arm raised in a casting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving for cover, you see her body impaled multiple times by ice strikes... but despite that, she seemed to feel nothing... in fact... she was using the ice energy to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head touched the fifteen foot high ceiling(You lived in a big house) and the ice ceased to form, allowing her to smirk down at your quivering form. \"Hmmm... perhaps the summoner should serve the summon...? Perhaps I should...\"</span></div></div>",

At first all you feel is sheer cold from the contact with the ice entity, but soon enough the pressure starts to get painful. Bones groan and creak as she puts more weight on her foot, causing her evil smirk to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she ignores you and simply watches you futily struggle to escape. But just as you feel your ribcage about to give way she finally stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I, little summoner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked, looking down on you as though you're nothing but a lowly insect, destined to end it's life smashed into a paste under her foot. You speak quickly while you still have the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-because, w-what good am I to you if you crush me to death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to wheeze out. Shiva considers this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Excellent point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icy beauty gazes down at you thoughtfully, making you shiver. And not JUST from the ice cold foot mashing you into the floor. Wiggling her toes slightly, drumming the clawed digits against you, she grins again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what will you offer me in exchange for sparing you, little summoner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a tough one.
