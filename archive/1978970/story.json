But after pushing herself to far, she had to rest up and recover for a whole month. During that month, her friends offered her plenty of delectable treats to make her feel better. But as she ate those treats, she started to add on the pounds. Add that with no exercising and  a growing laziness and you get some weight gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering, Rainbow Dash took a look at herself in the mirror and realized how fat she was getting. Her belly was a sort of round and doughy shape and touching the ground. Her legs also had extra pudge. Her face had slightly rounder and puffier cheeks. Lastily, her flank stretched out her cutie mark enough to be 3 times the normal size. Clearly Dash was not the same pony a month ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww jeez! I never realized I was getting this fat.\" Rainbow stated as she felt the pudge of her belly. \"What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash decides to.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What happened to you?\" Twilight said as she continued to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow dash's eyes suddenly went back to normal. \"Twilight, I'd like to try a weight gain spell.

Ooh! OOOOOOH! Fatter! Fatter! FATTER! I need to be Fatter! I need more sexy fat in my body to jiggle and play with, more fat to make me get stuck in doorways!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I want be able to break chairs with my huge fat sexy ass!

Her body continued to grow and gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow dash was now screaming loudly as her bliss went into overdrive. After two hours, the gain began to slow down and eventually stop leaving Rainbow dash panting heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was gigantic! Her face now had big bulging cheeks and thick neck fat along with 30 chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her legs were now buried with rolls of fat that piled on top of each other. Her belly now consumed half the room while her butt took the other half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow just sat there, enjoying her bigger body in front of a mirror Twilight conjured up. \"Oh yeah, you're a huge fat sexy piggy. just look at your big fat piggy belly.\" Rainbow dash said as she grabbed the folds of her belly with her fat laden hooves. \"Your just a big fat slob with a huge jiggling sexy ass.\" Rainbow dash said as she turned and smacked her ass and watched it jiggle and wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rainbow dash continued to smack, jiggle, grab, and squeeze her fat body. \"You want to get fatter don't you, you big huge fatty, You fat piggy, all fat and huge.\" Rainbow said to her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she turned around, she noticed that Twilight was hugging Rainbow Dash's ass tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you for feeding me, now for your reward.\" said Rainbow Dash<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Twilight then began to gain weight, looking like what Rainbow Dash was before the spell was cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She also had feelings of lust towards Rainbow Dash as she drools from her mouth and feels wet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \"Here I come,\" Rainbow said seductively as she extended her tongue and pushed her face between Twilight's haunches. Twilight gave out a high squeal of surprise and pleasure as Rainbow pressed her entire tongue against the surface of Twilight's vagina. Rainbow moved her tongue upward and began stroking the exterior lips of Twilight's now quivering pussy. Her tongue moved up and down several times before coming to a stop at Twilight's clit. Twilight moaned loudly as Rainbow circled the tip of her tongue around Twilight's clit and pressed inward slightly. A wave of vaginal juices began trickling out and covering Rainbow's muzzle. Then, without warning, Rainbow quickly shoved her tongue into Twilight's vaginal opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Twilight gasped as she felt her hymen stretch and mold around Rainbow's invading tongue. \"Oh...Rainbow!\" Twilight's moans became louder and much more consistent as Rainbow's tongue was driven deeper and deeper into her soaking cunt. Rainbow stayed silent during this process aside from the occasional giggle and mmmm. Twilight's breathing increased and beads of sweat started sliding across the surface of her coat, which was already partially covered with Rainbow's saliva. It wasn't long before her vagina was completely encased in Rainbow's mouth, the pegasus's tongue happily driving in and flopping about in every which way. Wave after wave of sexual pleasure and satisfaction coursed through Twilight's nerves and thus caused her to give out more moans and grunts. \"Keep it up, Rainbow! Oh yes! Don't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rainbow happily followed Twilight's orders as she slid her tongue against the fleshy walls of her lover's pussy. The trickle of vaginal juices was quickly increasing and Twilight's body was shaking like mad. She's getting close. I can feel it, Rainbow thought. Twilight was becoming a sweaty mess and her mane was starting to get strewn. But Twilight didn't seem to care. She was just happy to be in this situation with Rainbow Dash. Better finish her off then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Twilight gasped as Rainbow grasped her flanks with her hooves and started massaging them. The pegasus simultaneously began pushing her tongue against the roof of Twilight's vagina, towards her clit. Twilight was shaking crazily now and she could barely give out any sounds other than moans and squeals. Rainbow's tongue began a process of bluntly slamming up, down, left, and right within Twilight's vaginal passage. Twilight felt her body go limp and all she could do was lay there and let Rainbow eat her out. \"Oh...Rainbow...I think...I think I'm close.\" Twilight closed her eyes and gasped. She could feel the rush coming. It was a powerful force that had been pent up inside her for quite some time. Now was its time to be released. \"Oh!\" She was extremely close now. Her haunches were shaking and the trickle of juices flowing down Rainbow's muzzle was hastily turning into a river. \"Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh!\" It was right there. It was just about out. \"I...I'm cumming.\" Twilight squeezed her eyes shut and her torso arched upward as her climax finally arrived. \"I'M CUMMING, RAINBOW DASH!\" Twilight's orgasm came with a rush of vaginal juices that coated Rainbow's muzzle and gushed into her mouth like an exploding watermelon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Whoa!\" Rainbow gasped as she pulled her head back and let Twilight's vagina spill out its orgasm fluid on the sheets. Twilight let out a few more groans and squeals before sighing and falling silent. Twilight's breathing had become slow and relaxed. Rainbow watched her lover's sweaty chest slowly move up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Twilight opened her eyes and smiled at Rainbow. \"You sure know how to work that tongue of yours,\" she cooed. Rainbow crawled on top of Twilight and stared happily in her eyes. Twilight giggled ticklishly as some of Rainbow's hair brushed against her face. As Rainbow bent down and kissed Twilight softly on the cheek, Twilight rolled herself and Rainbow over. Rainbow gasped as she saw that the roles had reversed with her lying on her back and Twilight looking down at her. \"Now it's my turn to pleasure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Twilight's horn flashed and Rainbow suddenly found her legs spread out and tied to the bed by magic ropes. She proceeded to give Twilight a lustful, teasing smirk. \"Into the kinky stuff, are we now?\" Twilight responded with merely a giggle. Her horn was still glowing as she moved down Rainbow's chest, occasionally kissing and licking here and there. It wasn't long before Twilight was staring at Rainbow's pulsating pussy. She slowly brought her muzzle forward and began circling the tip of her tongue around Rainbow's vaginal lips. For a couple minutes, Twilight continued a cycle of orbiting the borders of Rainbow's pussy with her tongue, licking and pressing against the clit, covering the outer lips, and then starting over. It was a pleasurable process but certainly not enough to get Rainbow going in full. \"Enough teasing already, egghead! Just stick it in me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Twilight rose her head up and then dived straight for the cyan pussy. Rainbow let out a gasp of surprise, pain, and pleasure as Twilight shoved not her tongue but her horn straight into her vaginal passage. Her hymen popped instantly and a wave of fresh juices coated Twilight's mane. Twilight began to quickly and bluntly pull her horn in and out of Rainbow's cunt. At first Rainbow gasped and moaned from the pain of her popped hymen and the stiff intruder within her; but the pain was quickly replaced with a sexual pleasure beyond anything that clopping had provided in the past. \"Oh...egghead.\" Rainbow lay her head back on the pillow and moaned loudly each time Twilight shoved her horn in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rainbow was completely loving what Twilight was doing to her. The feeling of the ropes binding her to the bed coupled with the pleasing sensation of Twilight using her horn to rut the hell out of her pussy was enough to drive her completely wild. Her mane became strewn and her panting became louder and heavier. \"Oh, egghead!\" It's coming! Oh yeah! Here it comes! the pegasus thought joyfully. Rainbow was shaking all over. Her cunt pulsated wildly in sync with the invading, vibrating unicorn horn. The pegasus was quickly approaching her climax. Her juices were beginning to soak Twilight's mane and fall down onto the bed. \"Oh, egghead! I...I'm so close now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rainbow Dash was right on the edge of her climax. She was so close that she could only lie still, tied to the bed, as every ounce of strength within her body seemed to converge on her pounded vagina. With one last, deep shove from Twilight's horn that sent her pussy ablaze, Rainbow Dash opened her mouth and seemed to scream to the heavens. \"TWILIGHT SPARKLE!\" With that, she came. A loud groan followed her scream as her climax rocked through her body like an earthquake. Ever muscle in her body tensed up and relaxed. Her eyelids closed tight in response. Her mouth hung open with her limp tongue hanging out. Her vagina pulsated like one of Vinyl Scratch's stereos and an ocean of orgasmic juices shot out and coated Twilight's head. When it was all over, Rainbow Dash was a sweaty mess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she expected, Spike stared at it and became entranced by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rainbow dash, did anypony ever tell you how sexy and fat you are.\" Spike said as he stared at her.</span></div></div>",

She had put on 2,520 pounds in total, and she definitely showed it, with a belly that sagged to the ground and resembled a large bean-bag chair, a fat face with many chins (she stopped counting around 6), and legs that looked like gigantic balloons sticking out of her body. But the biggest part of her was her gigantic ass, looking like two gigantic cyan medicine balls that jiggled every time she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of her one might think that she wasn't able to move, but Twilight's spell had also allowed her to walk no matter how big she got. (though she couldn't fly anymore, not that it mattered to her.) Speaking of Twilight, Rainbow was currently in her Library making out with the purple unicorn as she had done several times throughout the week. She had Twilight's entire body wrapped in her giant, flabby hooves as she kissed her, with Twilight grabbing and squeezing whatever of Rainbow's fat she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow stopped kissing Twilight to get some air, and gave Twilight a satisfied look. \"You know, you're surprisingly good at this.\" Rainbow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I get a lot of practice...\" Twilight said, cuddling into rainbow's fat as if it were a pillow. \"Though, not the same as Spike...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow smirked as she turned her head to look at her gigantic ass, watching it jiggle more than usual. That was because Spike was currently between her massive cheeks, plowing her asshole like there was to tomorrow! Everypony who saw it became obsessed with Rainbow's butt, but perhaps nobody more than Spike. Rainbow woke up one night to see Spike fucking her ass like crazy, but decided to not do anything about it, enjoying how it felt. Ever since then Spike has been giving her anal sex all throughout the week, it getting better and better as she got fatter, to the point where Spike was completely enveloped as he fucked her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow gave a satisfied sigh, this was the most perfect life... or was it? Rainbow suddenly got an idea to make everything even more amazing...</span></div></div>",

She had become so large that she had outgrown her own home, crashing through the walls. However, this was actually good for Rainbow Dash, since everyone had decided the most beautiful pony in Equestria deserved a home where she had plenty of room to grow to her heart's content. They began to stick together many new clouds to the ones where Rainbow Dash's original home once sat, and eventually moved on to making the building itself. After a long time of preparation, all the pegasi and unicorns had finished creating a massive castle made of clouds, all for Rainbow Dash to live in. It was mostly one giant hall with a throne in the back so large that Rainbow Dash didn't even fill half of it, though she was hoping one day she would, and everyone else did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 3 years later, and Rainbow Dash now weighed an inconceivable 3,500,000 lbs., or 1,750 tons! She had begun spilling out of the massive throne that was made for her, but it didn't faze her, nor her many fans. She was visited incredibly often, many brought gifts, and many came just to look at her. Even though the continuous weight gain spell increased her mobility, Rainbow Dash was no longer able to move on her own because of her sheer size, but it didn't bother her. All of her friends visited her daily, just as her fans did, and many of the gifts she was brought were food so she didn't have to worry about going hungry. Her life was absolutely perfect in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

'Only 500 more trees t' go today,' She thought, before her nose wrinkled as a sour smell drifted her way. 'Like an outhouse in summer,' she gagged, before looking reluctantly towards the source - Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend was still hard at work, though she seemed to be moving a lot slower than usual. Judging from the torrents of sweat pouring from her body like a firehose, she had been working just as hard. Probably to work off the visit to Sugarcube Corner evidenced by the pot belly hanging down below her. Rainbow bent over to pick up another basket of apples, and blasted a loud, bassy fart from her jiggling ass right in Applejack's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's it!\" Applejack shouted in annoyance. Rainbow dropped the basket, causing the apples to spread all over the ground. She bent to pick them up, again farting uncontrollably, but Applejack signaled her to stop. \"Uh, Rainbow,\" She said, trying to salvage the situation, \"Y'all have been workin' so hard, why don't ya take the rest o' the day off? Ah'm sure ya could use a nap or somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow blinked in surprise.

Her cheeks started to inflate, flanks expand, and sweat spots spread across her destroyed uniform. Her wings had fattened a little too, the firm muscles across the limbs covered in a soft layer of flesh, which ultimately proved too much for the fattened flier, and she plummeted to the ground. Rainbow couldn't help but grimace as she saw the ground zoom towards her, even has her cheeks began to swell over the lower part of her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her various folds and flaps of flab expand even as they flopped around in the freezing wind.

She was quickly greeted by her friend as she entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hiya Rainbow! I'm so glad you're finally here. Now we can get started tasting this cake. I bet it will be super duper delicious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow nodded,\"Well, let's find out.\" Rainbow took her seat at a nearby table as Pinkie Pie went back into the kitchen and emerged with one of largest cakes that Rainbow had ever seen. It was decked out with several different types of chocolate,fudge, and various candies. It was probably also one of the most unhealthy cakes, but it looked so delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow quickly took a slice of the cake and began chowing down, completely unaware of the mischievous smirk on Pinkie Pie's face. \"So, how does it taste, Dashie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash smiled as she finished off the first slice, \"This tastes awesome! I'm going to have some more.\"  Rainbow Dash then grabbed a second slice, soon followed by another, and another. No matter how much Rainbow seemed to eat she found herself having room for yet another slice of calorie filled cake. Cake couldn't just disappear into thin air, however. Soon Dash's figure began to expand. Pudge began to form on her belly as it slowly rounded out and began to push out a couple inches. Her thighs became thicker as well but most of the added weight went to her flank. Rainbow's rump began to squish out beneath her like a gentle cushion, becoming slightly larger and rounder with each slice of cake that she consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't escape Rainbow's notice. She dropped her latest slice to examine the changes to her body, \"What the hay? Pinkie, what's in this ca-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's sentence was cut off as Pinkie Pie shoved a large chunk of cake into her mouth. She practically forced the food down Rainbow's mouth, leaving her no choice but to swallow. Rainbow tried to protest only for Pinkie Pie to push even more cake down her gullet. All the while she continued gaining weight. Eventually Rainbow had enough and managed to push Pinkie away from her. \"Pinkie, what are you doing?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smirked, \"Nothing, Dashie. Just trying to help you bulk up a little.\" This statement was followed by a creepy giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, riiiiight...\" Rainbow began backing up towards the door, but Pinkie rushed to block her way. Soon Rainbow found herself pushed back down into chair and restrained by Pinkie Pie, who began to slowly tie her down despite all resistance. In a few minutes Rainbow was tied to the chair with no way to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can get to work,\" Pinkie said with a devious look in her eyes. She grabbed a large slice of her special cake and began to feed the helpless Rainbow Dash, watching in awe as each slice added a new inch of fat to her belly or plot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash squirmed in horror as her trim form was quickly and easily turned into a chubby one. \"How am I getting so fat so quickly?! This isn't happening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie simply laughed as she continued forcing Rainbow to eat. \"I suppose I can tell you about my secret ingredient now that you can't stop me. It's a special little substance that turns any food in a pony's belly to instant fat and keeps their belly constantly ready for more food. So all I have to do is keep feeding you sweets and I can make you as huge as I want you to be!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her facial features had thickened and she was starting to gain a double chin. Her lower body was taking most of the gain though. Rainbow's thighs were getting closer and closer to rubbing together, and her large plot was starting to squish out beyond the chair. The same chair was starting to let out slight groans from the growing weight of the pony sitting on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled as she went into the kitchen and returned with the largest fudge cake that Rainbow had ever seen. \"I can't wait to see you break that chair, Dashie.\" Pinkie then began to shovel slice after slice of the fudge cake into Rainbow's mouth. Rainbow quickly began to grow at an even faster pace then before. Her round belly was growing outward even further, nearing the size of a beachball. Her flank grew at almost twice the pace, becoming so large that half of it didn't even fit in the chair anymore. The chair began to creek and groan even louder as Dash was putting on several pounds a minute. Then, after a final slice of fudge cake Rainbow finally overwhelmed the chair's ability. Her fat body overwhelmed the furniture piece and smashed it into pieces, reducing the once sturdy chair to rubble. Pinkie watched in awe as Rainbow's entire form jiggled heavily on the impact. Rainbow let out a sigh, if Pinkie ever let her go it would take months to lose all this weight. However, without the chair she was no longer restrained, maybe she had a chance....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon she felt strange, almost as if she was in a dream. Her eyes took on a far out look as she began to lose contact with reality.  Applejack re-entered the room, pleased that her plan had worked. The apple fritter that Dash ate was spiked with a special hypnotism potion that Applejack bought from Zecora. Anypony affected by it would for a short time be hypnotized and follow any suggestion or command given to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Rainbow. Listen carefully. My family and I need your help with something really important. There's a tradition at a nearby county fair where they give out a great reward to the largest mare present. So you're going to fatten yourself up as much as possible so we can enter you in and take the grand prize. Understand?\" Rainbow gave almost a robotic nod in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom trotted up behind Applejack, \"You really think this will work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack nodded, \"Definitely.

The first spell would temporarily hypnotize Rainbow, and cause her to unwittingly act upon any suggestion afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Rainbow. Once the spell wears off you're going to stay here for the day, and you're going to eat all the food I bring you.\" Rainbow nodded absently mindedly in response.

This food would instantly turn to fat once Rainbow consumed it and would cause rapid weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later the first part of the spell wore off and Rainbow began to act on the hypnotized commands.
