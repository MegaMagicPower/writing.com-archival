Human, long black hair in a ponytail with dark red eyes. A strong young woman who always ensures her crew and ship is in working order. Though she does keep a strict order, she is still quite kind-hearted, caring much for her crew, knowing their loyalty matters above all else. However, she is anything but perfect, and can fall apart under stress somewhat easily. To this extent, she does visit the Musume-Tan service team, a crew devoted to 'relieving' the Musume-Tan's crew's stresses, as she does perform best after being sexually satisfied. She is attracted to all women of all species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Valentina, the pilot/helmsman of the exploratory vessel. Human, with blond hair and hazel eyes. She pilots the ship with a full-body integration system, enabling her to guide the ship as though it were her own body, though of course this means that in order to guide the ship, she has to be naked. For this very reason, Valentina is a nudist, spending all hours of the day, piloting or not, in the nude. Though usually quiet and serious while piloting, she's a fairly playful, energetic person when not at the helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Tachyon Omicron-344 (aka Tachyon, or Tachy for short), the ship's navigator. Celestral, with blue hair. Her people have omni-present awareness of all their surroundings, and can merge with others, organic or inanimate, granting them her abilities. She uses this ability as the Musume-Tan's navigator, enabling her to guide the ship through space very effectively. Though she's very much an organic being, many mistake her, due to her florescent form, as an AI, something that privately depresses her. She wishes to better know her crewmates, and hope that they can see her as more than a navigator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sonya Detweiler, Executive Officer of the Musume-Tan. Human, with brown hair and eyes. Sonya's well known for her sense of order and control over her past vessels, and usually shows little interest in fun or amusement. Despite being very prudish, she is, in fact, a bit of a closet pervert. She occasionally pays discreet visits to the Musume-Tan's service team (reinforcing the point that the visit is to remain confidential with each visit), and usually falls to sleep masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Nia Catarl, Communications Officer. Nekoko, blonde with blue eyes. Nekoko are already known for their good hearing, but nothing in the deep reaches of space get past Nia's (a)cute ears. She's a special kind of Nekoko, known as Tokumi, meaning that she can transfer her range of hearing to almost anywhere she wants. This enables her to hear inside any room on the Musume-Tan from the bridge, and even hear outside of the ship, despite scientific impossibilities. To this extent, she is somewhat of a voyeur, sometimes listening in on someone and easily able to picture in her mind the naughty events unfolding.   </span></div></div>",

Though many might consider the job tedious (And sometimes, it can be), the organic software interface Tali invented herself proves to be the most advanced and sophisticated method of not only maintaining, but upgrading computer and networking technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organic body is comparable to hardware, and the mind comparable to software. With this in mind, an organic engineer, be they human, Nekoko, android, or whatever, can plug directly into the Musume-Tan's network, controlling it from the inside. However, most engineers prefer to stray away from using this interface, as it requires the user to... plug themselves in through an orifice only members of the Onnachikyu federation own, and is specifically tailored so that only Musume-Tan crew members can use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is far more to the computer engineering team, their technology, and their methods than simply the organic software interface, but we'll get to that later. First, who are you going to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-T4L1-69, aka Tali. Android, short white hair and green eyes. The head of computer engineering. Though she only appears to be about 8 years old, her computer engineering skills are second to none. However, beyond her penchant for software, Tali also has a fascination with Onnachikyu 'hardware.' She has a strong curiosity of organic anatomy, as they differ so much from her cybernetic body, despite how perfectly human she appears. Despite her fascination with organics, however, Tali only seems attracted to the other androids; specifically, the Musume-Tan science officer Gwenivier, whom she holds very strong sexual feelings towards, despite, as Gwenivier reminds her, the fact that they are, in technicality, 'sisters.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Parfait. Nekoko, Red-pink hair. Just by her name, you know Parfait has a big sweet tooth! And her personality is sweet and playful to boot. Despite being in computer engineering, Parfait was also recommended as a pilot for the Musume-Tan, though declined since she wouldn't be able to move freely as much she she would have liked. She's one of the first people Tali comes to when she has a question about organics' bodies, and has one of the strangest forms of computer power sources ever; twice everyday, the Musume-Tan's central terminal gives off a signal depicted by a single color. Parfait can provide extra power from the ship by wearing panties of the same color as the signal. Many refuse to use this style of generation, as it tends to exhaust them, but because of Parfait's boundless natural energy and abundant sweet tooth, she seems to power the central terminal for days on end without any problems at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a few other crew members of the computer engineering team, but that's all for now.</span></div></div>",

Maybe they're different about that kinda thing.\" Another engineer suggested. Both engineers cringed as the 'plug' of the organic software interface slid further into Tali's vagina. \"Ugh, I remember when it did that for me.

For those wondering, jessica is both a scientist and a medical doctor. She has to make sure things like neural implants or any other living machine was functioning at 100%. Well, usually, but that wasn't the only thing she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. Finally, time to work on my little project.\" she said grabbing a few test tubes filled with nekoko, amazo, and alphazo blood. You see, her department worked on cloning. As well, the rules are very loose on this; Just three; only create replacement parts, don't clone a person unless allowe\\d by the family, and never ever clone a man. Technically, she wasn't breaking these rules; she was making a new assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright since both miss Tali and miss Miyotaka have 'signed' for this, lets begin. Okay, first take a drop of blood, and take a sample of genetic code...\"she said to herself. Her plan was to do a basic clone and insert a few memories she had created. She start extracting the codes she believed would give her the skin and muscular form of the Amazo, the body of the Nekoko, and the abilities of the Alphazo, hopefully giving her a perfect creature. Although, not much was heard of inbreeding between any of the other species on the ship, so she hoped it would work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she isolated the few genes she thought where right, and started to connect and perfect them, placing them in the cloning pod and began, only to hear a knock on the door. It opened, to have miss Miyotaka walk in with a girl in her early teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss LaRuffa, I brought with me the assistant you asked... What are you doing?\" she asked looking at the test tubes and active pod with what looked like a fast growing child in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Well, you see, I was doing an experiment of my own, and well, then clone the outcome ehh hehe?\" honestly, she was kinda sweating like a fat kid after running a mile in the summer heat. She was nervous; even though it was legal to do this, some disapprove of cloning via religion or just believing it's wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut honestly, I'm wondering the doc's view on this.</span></div></div>",

Massive enemy fleet ahead! Recommend immediate evasion!\"</i> Valentina, the helmsman, stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Captain Reiko Yushida nodded, sending a transmission to the pilots. <i>\"This is Captain Yushida!

Diversionary fire!\" Captain Yushida ordered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You got it!\"</i> Maris Suruk, gunnery officer, confirmed. \"Take this, you wiener-crotched bastards!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShips across the Otakato armada scattered as a maelstrom of gunfire burst from the Musume-Tan. Some of the fire even gave Lily just the time she needed to make some adjustments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Williams, what are you doing?!\" Aisha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it look like? Setting this thing to detonate. It's useless now anyway.\" Williams answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane! You're not blowing yourself up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not.\" Williams crossed her arms, waiting for the Battle Frame to fully engage. Her clothes burst off completely as her seating transformed, giving her a form of revealing armor. \"Flight Battle Frame! Ignition!!\" Just seconds before the explosion of her mech, Lilly Y Williams ejected herself from it, wearing what seemed to be a simple suit of armor, rigged with some heavy infantry weaponry, the destruction of her mech blowing away all the Otakato ships holding her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not taking me that easily, Y-chromo-bitches!!!\" Williams cried out, guns blazing relentlessly on some more oncoming ships. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Williams! We're retreating, not fighting a war!\" Aisha reminded her, jettisoning and activating her own Battle Frame, though unleashed a flurry of missiles to aid her escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made a mad dash for the Musume-Tan's hangar, one of them occasionally turning to stop oncoming ships from catching up to them, before they crashlanded in the hangar, both of them crashing and burning, their Battle Frames taking some damage from their long, skidding slide across the hangar, until they were both stopped by the foot of a mech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Our pilots are now aboard. All crew accounted for.\"</i> Tachyon Omicron-344, the ship's overseer and navigator stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helmsman! Get us the hell outta here!\" Captain Yushida commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wait around on my account!\" Valentina said jokingly before engaging the Tachyon Warp Drive, evading the armada entirely. Moments later, she disengaged to clear night sky. A brief pause, before... \"Evasion successful.\" Crew members of the Musume-Tan where either taking a big breath of relief, or cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" That was wild.\" Aisha sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Lily panted. \"I hope something like that never happens again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Tuska sighed, laying next to them, her one piece bathing suit for a flight uniform still wet with her frightened pee. \"I hope I can get to my mech's bathroom next time I get scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling you not to drink so much before an assignment.\" Lily groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got something you can drink, Williams!

This time, Kaori tasted Reiko's nectar without hesitation, lapping her vagina in a cat-like manner, Reiko melting into a heap of pleasure as she eventually dissolved into orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all for you, ma'am?\" Kaori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not.\" Reiko grinned. \"Let's begin with the real reason I'm here.\" She gripped one of Kaori's legs, crossing it with her own, and pulled her in nice and close, so that both their pussies were touching, before she started gyrating, their pussies rubbing together, pleasuring both of them in a way that mouths and fingers never could, making both cry out with ecstasy, Kaori gripping the sheets as tightly as she could, Reiko trying as hard as she could to hold herself steady to keep pleasuring the pair, and each one undeniably attracted to each other for more than just their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was over, both girls were laying in a heap on the bed, covered in vaginal juices, and tired, yet satisfied, by their time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Kaori.\" Reiko panted, petting her adorable little Nekoko attendant on the head, causing her to purr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be thanking you, Reiko.\" Kaori smiled, delightedly. \"It's much more meaningful when a Nekoko loses her virginity than it is for a human or some other species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I don't know enough about Nekoko as I should.\" Reiko smirked teasingly. \"Why is it so much more meaningful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nekoko are sexual creatures by nature.\" Kaori explained. \"We consider sex an act that can potentially have no meaning at all behind it; A Nekoko has more sex in their life than a human would, so the very first one a Nekoko makes love to is, for many, the most important thing in the galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Reiko blinked, not having known this little tidbit. \"So...\" She blushed, regaining some of the modesty she lost with her virginity. \"Does that mean you would rather live like an average Nekoko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking if I would rather be sexually independent, and see you as just another partner?\" Kaori clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Reiko nodded. \"Because... well... I want you to be my... PERSONAL attendant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... my only partner on the Musume-Tan be you?\" Kaori blinked, Reiko nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaori thought it over for a moment, wondering whether to go by Nekoko instinct, or her own. In the end, she decided....</span></div></div>",

I wish we could have a more intimate relationship, but I'm not disappointed that you want to live a free, promiscuous sex life like others of your species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do wish to see you again, Reiko.\" Kaori assured her. \"I very much loved our first times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I.\" Reiko nodded, planting a kiss on Kaori's lips. \"But believe me; I'll suffer plenty of stress during our voyages, and though I may have sex with many other women of many other species, I'll only make love to one Nekoko in the galaxy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reiko~....\" Kaori smiled, a deep passion for Reiko welling up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, my little kitten.\" Reiko giggled, petting the Nekoko's ears before leaving to return to the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind, Kaori?\" Ashrah asked as she helped the deflowered Nekoko wash off, so as to be presentable to her next customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recently made love to the Captain...\" Kaori muttered awkwardly, lathering shampoo in her mint green hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know.\" Ashrah smiled, cleaning the attendant's cat-like ears. \"I'm sure you must be honored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am, but...\" Kaori swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're feeling troubled?\" Ashrah blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked me if I could be her personal attendant.... and I said no. Lady Ashrah, did I make a mistake refusing her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel like you made a mistake?\" Ashrah asked. \"If so, why would you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Lady Ashrah, did you know that Captain Yushida was a virgin?\" Kaori asked, closing her eyes tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't.\" Ashrah answered with interest, pouring water onto her little attendant's head, rinsing her body. \"And you claimed her virginity, just as she claimed yours?\" Kaori nodded. \"The time you two spent together was both of your first times, so you feel twice as connected to her as you would have, had it been a non-virgin that plucked your cherry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I made a mistake, then?\" Kaori asked, feeling slightly ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that.\" Ashrah smiled, looking over Kaori's body. \"I think your decision was well justified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Kaori blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nekoko are practically born to have sex,\" Ashrah indulged. \"It's in their nature to engage in sexual activities with many others, some intercourse having little to no meaning other than satisfaction behind it. You, as a Nekoko, probably understand this lifestyle better than I could.\" She lathered a sponge with soap, and gently washed Kaori's back. \"And devotion to a single individual is something that most Nekoko never experience until they're much, much older. There are even some that NEVER desire to settle with one woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at times with the captain,\" Kaori sighed. \"I felt a bond between us; like we could devote to each other if I told her yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be...\" Ashrah nodded. \"But you are still very young, Kaori, and your first time is also your first step, and, especially for Nekoko, that step is a large one. For your kind, settling with another is one far, far greater. And a girl your age, no matter her species, has much growing up to do before she's ready to take such a step.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think I did the right thing?\" Kaori blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Ashrah smiled, rinsing her off. \"And you turned down such an offer because you wanted to experience what it felt to be sexually active with other women, with other species, before deciding that Captain Yushida was right for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Kaori nodded. \"Is that selfish of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By no means.\" Ashrah shook her head, giving Kaori a towel. \"It's the natural course of life.\" A soft tone sounded overhead. \"Oh? Excuse me, Kaori. It seems someone else requires the Service Team's assistance. Make yourself ready, now.\" She swept from the bathhouse, leaving Kaori smiling as she dried off and got dressed in her uniform bikini, confident in her decision now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment, please.\" She heard Ashrah's voice just outside, before the woman came back in. \"Kaori, it seems you're quite popular today.\" She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My assistance is needed by another Musume-Tan crew member?\" Kaori blinked, getting her top on straight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, what's your specialty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um... I specialize in marine treatment.\" Muzumi replied. \"First, we start with a bath, where we both soak to our heart's content in Umisei water, some of the clearest water in the galaxy. After that, I massage you with Mizusosa... oh, that's this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I know what Mizusosa is.\" Reiko grinned. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

But... I don't have gills like you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no problem.\" Muzumi shook her head. She reached into her mouth and pulled out what seemed to be a thin jewel of some sort. \"It's a scale that allows you to breath underwater for up to an hour. Just place it to your heart before we start to have......\" She broke off again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Reiko smiled. \"Now, is there anything we do before we have our bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one; what kind of bath would you like? A hot one? Or a cold one? I promise, they will both be quite gratifying.\"      </span></div></div>",
