It was mostly empty, save for a few pieces of simple furniture, including a large camphorwood chest with ornate carvings of dragons and phoenixes lining its surface. Inside were her songbooks and mandolin. She earned her living as a street minstrel, but today she just felt... tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on a red <i>saree</i>, took her mandolin, opened the door and looked outside. Everything was bathed in that dim half-light from a sun that had grown old. Summer had just ended. Only for seven days in the middle of summer each year did the sun become truly bright and the sky a radiant sapphire-blue; for the rest of the year everything seemed pale, ashen and covered in brooding shadows, and from mid-autumn until the middle of the next spring all was plunged in near-darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna walked down the stairs and into the streets, thinking of purchasing some fruit. It was depressingly quiet. The sound of birds singing seemed to grow rarer with each passing year. Even the cicadas, crickets and katydids seemed to sing less as well. The trees looked barren, with but a few sparse leaves on their boughs. The people on the streets all had this sullen look on their faces. They rarely talked or greeted each other, and just went about their business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna had heard rumors that the world was dying very slowly. She had heard that this was the verdict of some of the mages living in this city, who with their powers of scrying could survey the whole world and observe its changes. They found that each year fewer babies were born, the sun grew dimmer, less crops could be harvested and a giant glacier far away in the southern oceans encroached upon their continent a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reflected: could the mages do nothing about this? Was there nothing <i>anyone</i> could do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sometimes fancied <i>she</i> might be able to do something. But always she brushed the thought aside as the height of presumptuousness. What could <i>she</i> do? She was no super-sorceress. She was just a peasant girl, albeit an exceptionally beautiful girl with an equally beautiful voice and superb skill with her mandolin -- an enchanted mandolin at that which her parents, themselves mages, had given her when she was twelve, and which enabled her when played to cast a few basic spells such as <i><span class=\"cred\">heal light wounds</span>, <span class=\"corange\">candlelight</span>, <span class=\"cblue\">shield</span>, <span class=\"cpink\">lullaby</span></i> and <i><span class=\"ckhaki\">create food</span></i>. And she did not do too badly as a dancer, either. But for all that she was barely able to make ends meet for herself, let alone save a world -- a task for which her gifts would have been of precious little relevance, assuming indeed such an enormous task could be handled by human beings at all in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven just to survive a trip outside of the city's walls was a difficult task in its own right for humans. All sorts of evil creatures of the night -- werewolves, vampires, mummies, undead -- are now said to roam the wastes outside. That is why it was very rare indeed nowdays for any people, whether merchants or scholars or whatever, to travel from one city to another. Aruna's very own parents once went outside in search of special magical crystals -- and never returned. And their magical powers were much greater than that of her mandolin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear trickled down Aruna's eye as she thought of her beloved father and mother. Perhaps the best she could hope for, the best anyone could hope for, was just to live life as best she could, in the hope that she would just complete her term of life in peace. Hopefully the end of the world would not come in her limetime...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard something. It was the warbling of a songbird. The song was lovely, but it was... different. She had never heard anything like it before.</span></div></div>",

She followed the sound of the bird outside, and although the song was clear, she couldn't find the bird. The music seemed to radiate from her surroundings. Finally, after wandering about in frustration, Aruna decided to ignore it, and continue on her way to getting fruit. Immediately after she gave up her search, however, the sound clearly came from one direction - her right. She looked over and saw an alleyway that she had not been to before. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ignoring her misgivings, Aruna decided to follow the song of the bird. She walked down the alley, seeing nothing. It was a very long passage, with many curves and turns. She finally walked out into a clearing, a park that she had not been to before. In the center was a gigantic oak tree that towered over almost everything. She looked up at it, and saw an old man casting a spell, which resembled a songbird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna sighed, but did not want to have wasted her time, so she went up to the old man and asked him, \"How do you imitate the bird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man ignored her and continued with his spell casting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you listening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the old man stopped, and with agility that Aruna could not have imagined for a man of his age, jumped off the tree, tapping Aruna on the head lightly with his staff to land behind her. Aruna turned around, but the man wasn't there. She could hear his laughing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mean, you know. You shouldn't mess with people like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna turned at the sound of the voice. There was a young girl, about the age of 11, who had blonde curls and a freckled face. She was wearing a plain light blue dress and had a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Carol. The person who hit you is called Frank. He loves to prank people.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uhhhh... Hello, Carol,\" greeted Aruna.\"I'm Aruna.\" Somehow Aruna felt a strange, soothing radiance emanating from the maiden and the elderly man. It was almost as if midsummer had returned and she was basking in the noonday sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aruna... That's a lovely name,\" commented Carol. \"Suits you just fine, with your sweet face and red <i>saree</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Aruna with a smile, noting the curiously melodious quality of Carol's voice. \"You live around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" answered Carol. \"Frank and I actually used to live in the mountains north of this town; only in the last few days did we decide to enter its walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna's eyes went wide with shock when she heard this. \"What? You've always lived <i>outside</i> this city, and <i>in the mountains</i> at that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Carol. Frank nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>How have you been able to survive?</i>\" asked an incredulous Aruna. \"The wilderness outside of the cities is now infested with evil creatures of all kinds, who no longer fear the sun as its rays have grown far too feeble to be able to hurt them anymore. That is why we very seldom travel from city to city nowadays, because of the extreme dangers of leaving the safety of the city walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol stopped smiling. She looked around as if to see if any other people were around, then turned back to Aruna. \"Aruna... Can we trust you to keep it a secret if we tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna was puzzled. \"But why?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to Aruna's further surprise, the outline of Carol's form began to blur, as well as that of Frank. In a moment they were no longer there -- and two very large, beautiful birds had taken their place. The birds had a golden aura around them and feathers all made of flashing gold, and long tails trailed from their bodies. One had light blue tail feathers and the other light brown, and they flew gracefully in the air, leaving a trail of colored twinkles behind them as they did. They circled the oak tree a couple times and again Aruna heard the lovely birdsong, which she now realized had come from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two birds alighted gently before Aruna. Then their forms began to blur again, and in a moment Carol and Frank were standing once more in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're actually not human, Aruna,\" said Carol softly. \"We're... <i>sunbirds</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Oh!</b></i>\" exclaimed Aruna. \"<b>So you're...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol lifted a finger to her mouth. \"Shhhh! Not so loud, people will hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna softened her voice immediately. \"I'm sorry,\" she apologised. \"So you're actually the legendary <i>sunbirds</i>, descendants of the <i>Simurgh</i> who lives in the very Heart of the Sun? I've read about your kind in my songbooks, but always I've thought it's only a legend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're for real, Aruna, please believe me,\" answered Carol in a gentle voice. \"Now you know why we could live in the mountains without fear; no creatures of darkness would dare come within a hundred paces of us, for to do so is death for them. In fact you humans are far more dangerous to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been hunted by humans ever since our kind came to earth,\" sighed Carol. \"Hunted for our feathers or kept in cages. That is the main reason why we chose to live in the mountains -- so it would be harder for humans to find us. But we can sense that <i>you're</i> different. You're a kind person who will not harm animals. So we lured you here with our song!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna was awed. \"It's a great honor that such exalted beings as you should be desirous of befriending a mere peasant girl like me. But if you would pardon my extreme curiosity, it would seem unusual to me that you should come within this city and seek my friendship. Is there a special reason, or is it just that simple, that you wish to make friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told,\" answered Carol, \"there <i><b>is</b></i> a special reason. Our world is dying, as you know. My kind now faces extinction -- we all do -- unless somehow we can rejuvenate our sun or find a new sun. So we have decided to go around in search of as many friends as we can find, that together we may help each other and through our collective efforts find a way to restore our world. What say you, Aruna?\"  </span></div></div>",

She looked hard into each of their eyes, waiting for the 'Gotcha ya!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank continued, \"But they were. In fact, your parents were once part of the Great Order. This group was made up of the most powerful wizards of the time...maybe even of all time. I'm sure you know of the four Elements, the the three Natures, and the two Forces. The Lady Helena had power over Fire, and the Master Nathaniel had power over Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You parents were incredibly powerful, Aruna. Their power now flows inside of you; which is why we need you. Do you know how your parents died?\" Carol asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They left...they were trying to find some stone.\" Aruna answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Carol continued, \"But they were after not just any stone.

Please believe us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, then, tell me,\" asked Aruna, \"how did you come to know so much about me and my parents? And if my parents were truly that powerful, why had they not made it known to me in the past, and how could they have died? Surely with such great powers they could have protected themselves easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain, Aruna,\" replied Carol. \"You see, we sunbirds actually have the power of seeing the auras of all living things. We can give you this power if you so wish. Different human individuals have unique features in their auras which are always shared by their offspring; maybe the auras have a lot of gold stars in them, or look like pinkish clouds, or whatever. And years ago our kind spotted two humans wandering in the mountains outside of this city. Their auras were unmistakably those of mages wielding very great power -- we could tell by the presence of a third eye in their auras, just above their heads. And we found that you share almost the same kind of patterns in your aura as them, which would have been impossible unless you were their direct descendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for why they did not let you know of the true extent of their power, my conjecture is that they wanted to protect you. If unscrupulous people knew you were the daughter of two great mages, they might kidnap you for all sorts of purposes, maybe milk you of the magical power in your soul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then, what happened to my parents?\" asked Aruna with anxiety. \"You saw them, so you must know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... got killed by a large horde of vampires and werewolves, led by a lich...\" answered Carol in a somewhat apologetic voice. \"Even though they were great mages, still there were just too many of those foul creatures, and the lich raised them everytime they were slain, so your parents eventually succumbed to their relentless attacks. We were able to salvage a few things from their bodies, though. Such as this flute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol reached into her pockets and produced a short jade flute. Instantly Aruna recognized the flute with which her father so often played her favorite tunes. She would play her mandolin in accompaniment, and they would have such wonderful times together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna was now beside herself with grief. \"<i>Why didn't you help my parents when you saw them in danger?</i>\" cried Aruna, shaking. \"Oh, father!... Mother!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted to,\" explained Frank, \"but other members of our tribe hated humans for hunting us, so there were laws prohibiting that we help humans. If we were caught helping them, we would be put to death... We're sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got sick of those stupid laws, though,\" joined Carol. \"Surely not all humans are bad, and those laws aren't going to help us at a time when we're going to need as many friends as possible to join forces to save our world, including human friends. So recently the two of us finally decided to break the stupid laws, and come in search of human friends to join us in our cause. We're sorry, Aruna, truly sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna was weeping profusely. \"I... don't know what to say...\" she sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Aruna,\" consoled Carol, \"we understand how you feel, but what is past cannot be undone. We can still join forces to create for ourselves and for everyone a better future, though. We want to be friends with you. We care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna wiped off her tears and looked sheepishly at Frank and Carol for a moment. Certainly they seemed entirely sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I lost my parents, I've never really had any truly close companions all my life. If all you've said were really true, I would be most grateful for your offer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Carol smiled at Aruna. \"Life often offers painful experiences, Aruna,\" said Frank. \"We ourselves have had more than our fair share of them. But what we can do is give each other a hand and a shoulder in times of need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly there was a sound from nearby, the sound of lots of people scampering and yelling, like some great commotion was taking place. Then a man ran towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An army of undead warriors is trying to break down the city's main gates!\" the man cried. \"The gates can't hold much longer! Go into hiding while you can!\"</span></div></div>",

Aruna turned back to Frank and Carol, and begged, \"You said that the undead couldn't come within 100 paces of you. Why are they attacking the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we are in human form, our powers as Sunbirds are severely weakened. We would have to take on our true form to protect the city. But if we do...we run the risk of the people attacking us, or worse, our own kind will. Frank and I are dancing on a very fine line.\" Carol explained. She looked sincerely  remorseful. \"We have to flee; we can take you to a safe place outside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Aruna yelled. \"I have to help them! I understand that you can't, but I have to try. If I really am the daughter of two powerful mages, then I should be able to stop them.\" With that, she turned and ran for the main gate. Frank and Carol were right on her tail, trying to call her back. She ignored them and ran faster. Soon, she saw the giant double doors ahead of her. The entrance to the city was nearly broken through. A few of the townspeople were still there, trying desperately to keep it closed. Aruna could hear the screech of the undead from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Carol stopped a few feet behind her. They seemed afraid to come any closer. \"Aruna!\" Frank yelled. \"You can't stop them, not on your own. You have no training. You don't even know which Element you inherited from your parents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aruna Please! None of us can help here! Please, you must flee with us. There is little time.\" Carol begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, almost like it was on cue, the doors to the city burst open. Undead flooded through in great numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Anura didn't flinch. She remembered a single word that her mother used to say all the time to her. She knew at that moment what Element she could comand. That gave Anura the courage she needed. That word her mother used to tell her, was a spell she could use. She planted a foot backwards, and extended her left hand in front of her. She screamed, \"Feurstrum!\"</span></div></div>",

Many of them were still clad in rusted armor, wielding rusted swords and spears, and they moved slowly and in a jerky manner. The townspeople were fleeing for their lives, screaming with terror as they ran. But one didn't. He was a very handsome though rather thin young man, not very tall, with high cheekbones. Perhaps a student from the Mage Academy? He was all dressed in white and wielding a long silver wand, with which he threw showers of silver sparks at the undead warriors, though apparently they were for the most part undeterred. \"Back off, foul creatures!\" cried the young man. \"Back off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna could not remember the significance or meaning of the word that flashed into her mind at that critical instant, as the gruesome creatures closed in on her. But somehow she <b>knew</b> it would help. As she uttered the word, an amazing thing occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mandolin she had been carrying with her all along suddenly floated into the air and began to <i>play on its own</i>, while also casting a warm golden glow. It was a slow and hauntingly beautiful and soothing melody, the sounds sweet and rich like honey. Aruna remembered that it was one of the hardest songs in her songbooks, so hard she never mastered it. The music carried far in the air, far beyond the range of a normal instrument. Some of the fleeing townpeople heard the music and just <i>had</i> to stop and listen despite the danger of their situation. Frank and Carol were likewise stunned by the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine how anyone could possibly hate such wondrous music -- but the undead legions evidently did. The music caused them to shriek and convulse with agony, and before long they were retreating back <i>en masse</i> into the wastes outside the city, as fast as their half-decomposed forms would allow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently all was quiet again. The mandolin finished playing the song, then its golden glow dimmed down like a fading sunset and it slowly floated back into Aruna's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man and some of the townsfolk walked to Aruna with a smile betraying utter amazement. \"You...You're <b>amazing</b>!\" exclaimed the youth. \"Oh, I'm <b>Tsung Yun</b>, a student from the Mage Academy.\"</span></div></div>",

How did I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh...Shhhh\" Carol soothed her. \"You used an awful lot of magic back there; you need to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna became aware of weariness she felt now. Her whole body felt sore, like she had run a marathon, but she had to get a few answers. \"Please Carol, I can rest when I'm dead. How did I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was dark, Aruna could plainly see the glare on Carol's face. It was like the glare her parents used to give her when she was trying to do something that could get her hurt. \"You very well could have died. The spell you used was powerful, and your body isn't accustomed to that. It drained you of a lot of your energy, your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Aruna asked. She couldn't rap her mind around the fact that one word could kill someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol sighed. \"Alright, I will explain. But then you have to get some rest.\" Aruna nodded, so Carol continued, \"Magic exists in all of us. All beings have a limit to how much magic they posses in their bodies. The amount of magic humans have varies on a number of factors: blood, physical state, ext.  Another name for magic is spiritual energy. It is the same energy that allows you to walk, lift things, and jump.  So, when a mage casts a spell, they are, in fact, using the same energy that allows them to move. When a spell that is greater then the users spiritual energy is cast,  it will not only be weakened from the lack of energy to fuel it, but it will also kill the person because it drains them of all their spiritual energy. Now, do you understand the gravity of you not resting now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay...I will get some rest.\" Aruna replied as she closed her eyes, not being able to keep them open anymore. \"Maybe on our quest...you...could...teach me... how to use...magic.\" Aruna yawned, before drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

The divine music, the very same music that drove away the undead legions, carried through the air from her instrument and rang through the sapphire skies like the tinkling of countless crystal bells. In response a bright sun slowly rose above the eastern peaks, far brighter than any she had ever seen. Touched by its rays, the firmaments turned into an endless expanse of gold. A new dawn had come to the world! And in the disc of the sun she saw the faces of her beloved parents, who were smiling at her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up. Oh, it was just a dream, a beautiful dream. She was back in her room \u2014 and she noticed a large number of boxes, bags and parcels sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAruna,\u201d said Carol as she sat down beside her and caressed her forehead gently like a sister, \u201cyou\u2019re awake! How do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d replied Aruna as she sat up. \u201cI just feel a bit hungry. Oh, I had this really amazing dream. But anyway, where did all these boxes and parcels come from? What\u2019s in them? I don\u2019t remember seeing them around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re gifts from the townspeople,\u201d explained Frank, who was nearby and approaching with a large bowl in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re so grateful to you for saving them and the city they kept coming with gifts non-stop while you were asleep, to offer you their thanks. There are food, clothes, jewels and even sacks of gold. You can be sure there\u2019ll be more of them on the way! They actually wanted to meet you in person, but we told them you were asleep. One of them gave you a really big jar of fruit salad, of which here\u2019s a bowl for your breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFruit salad? I certainly would love some!\u201d said Aruna with delight as she helped herself to the tasty fare. \u201cHow about the two of you? Have you had breakfast yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe sunbirds actually don\u2019t need physical food most of the time,\u201d said Carol, smiling. \u201c<i>Light</i> is our food. As long as there\u2019s light, we won\u2019t go hungry. But during winter and late autumn, when darkness reigns on earth, we then help ourselves to wild fruits stored up for the season.\u201d Frank nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna listened with fascination. \u201cIn a sense I actually have no need for food either,\u201d she said, taking out her mandolin, \u201cas I can cast <i><span class=\"ckhaki\">create food</span></i> with my magic mandolin anytime I need food. The food cast by this spell is a bit plain, though, so I also do help myself to normal food when it\u2019s an available option. The mandolin is a wonderful gift from my parents; using it I can actually cast several spells, such as <i><span class=\"cblue\">shield</span>, <span class=\"corange\">candlelight</span></i> and <i><span class=\"cred\">heal light wounds</span></i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually already noticed the strange aura of this instrument from the time we first met you, Aruna,\u201d remarked Frank. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen this kind of aura another time in my life. From what I could gather, it\u2019s an aura possessed only by magic items of titanic power, but whose power is hidden so deeply inside of them that few are aware of its presence and it is not easily unleashed, or only unleashed on very special occasions. There may be yet other spells that this mandolin can cast. And what happened earlier when you drove away the undead legions was most probably just that \u2014 a liberation of the power hidden within this mandolin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t reckon the power came from Aruna instead?\u201d asked Carol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd could this mandolin really conceal such enormous power?\u201d asked Aruna, somewhat taken aback, as she looked at her mandolin, then looked at Frank again. \u201cI know it can be used for casting various spells, but\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said,\u201d explained Frank to Aruna, \u201cthe aura emanated by this instrument betrays its vast power. We can give you the power of aura vision so you can see it for yourself. Your parents have left you a truly great item!\u201d Frank turned to Carol. \u201cAnd my conjecture is that Aruna\u2019s power served mainly to <i>unlock</i> the power hidden in the mandolin, which was what banished the undead legions. Mind you, it can still take a considerable amount of power to unlock the energies hidden in a special magical item. Not all credit goes to the mandolin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis wonderful instrument would be yet another powerful ally in our quest, then!\u201d said Carol with delight as she laid an arm on Aruna\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe must find out how you can harness the full power within yourself <i>and</i> this artifact, Aruna. Once we do so, I\u2019m sure things will really start to look bright!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never thought I actually had such great power at my command, both within my person and this instrument,\u201d remarked Aruna. \u201cTruly the events of the day before have revealed much to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d asserted Carol, \u201c<i>all</i> humans have an immense reservoir of power within them \u2014 and sunbirds, too, though that\u2019s obvious. The trouble is that with most humans \u2014 though we\u2019re certain you\u2019re an exception \u2014 their power is so deeply hidden, like this instrument, that it can take at least <i>thirty years</i> of diligent daily training to bring it out. Most humans just don\u2019t have that commitment. That\u2019s why mages are such a rare breed. As for the two of us\u2026 We could have assumed our true form and saved the city easily, except that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol broke off and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe some day we will convince our leaders to discard that foolish law forbidding us to help humans, Carol,\u201d said Frank. \u201cCheer up. Who knows, perhaps Aruna could help us with that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope so, Frank,\u201d replied Carol. \u201cAs you know \u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door, followed by a youthful voice. \u201cHello? Is anyone in?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She then looked over to Aruna. \"I think you have an admirer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Aruna squeaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this kid has been over here nearly every hour on the hour demanding news of your condition. I think he's smitten for you.\" Frank smirked as he walked over to the door. He opened it. In the doorway was the young man from before, the mage who had been trying to stop the undead army. His eyes were fulled with worry. \"Well, hello again Tsung.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has she awoken yet? Is she alright?\" He asked tentatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank turned toward Aruna and gave her his devious smile. He then turned back to Tsung, and replied, \"Why don't you ask her yourself.\" Frank moved out of the way. Tsung's eyes found Aruna, and almost instantaneously brightened. He danced into the room, and knelt down beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsung gazed into Aruna's eyes as he picked up her hand into his. He brought it up to his lips and gave her hand a quick peak. \"I was so worried about you Arunar. My heart ached for you my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Thanks I... 'my love'... what are you talking about?\" Aruna tried taking her hand back, but Tsung held on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet and beautiful Aruna please accept my hand in marriage. Will you be my wife; Will you be the mother of our children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Aruna gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love... my heart is yours. You stole it the moment I laid eyes on you.\" Tsung 's head was resting on her legs now. His hands wrapped around both of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol finally walked over, and grabbed him by the shoulder. \"That is an incredible offer you made Aruna. Remember though, she just recovered. You should give her time to think about it. Head back to the inn now; Frank will come to fetch you in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Please accept my humblest of apologies my love. I will count the seconds we are apart.\" Tsung replied, never letting his gaze leave Aruna's. He blew her a kiss goodbye, and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Aruna believed Tsung was out of earshot, she yelled, \"FRANK! What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank gave her the 'innocent look.' \"I don't know what you mean?\" He defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna's eyebrows came together. \"MARRIAGE?! He asked me to marry him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol sat next to Aruna, and patted her shoulders. \"I'm sorry about that. I forgot to warn you about him. He's an Aphrodite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Aruna shifted her glare to Carol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He comes from a race of men who exist for... well its hard to explain. I guess the closest example would be love at first sight.\" Aruna continued to glare, not understanding. Carol sighed, \"Everyone's aura has a pair; another person's aura who matches perfectly with theirs. In the case of an Aphrodite, their entire existence becomes tied to their match. They become the perfect protector, lover, friend, or anything else their match needs. They are the most loyal of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tsung...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he matches perfectly to your aura, so he is tied to you. But there is another aspect to Aphrodites that you should know. They are also powerful sources of magic.\"</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s admittedly not without his charms, but who on earth ever heard of <i>asking someone you hardly know to marry you and have children for you</i>? This guy\u2019s a <i>jerk</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s perhaps too harsh a judgment,\u201d replied Carol. \u201cHis love for you is in fact genuine. We can tell. But we do agree that he could have exercised a little more restraint and commonsense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe had better exercise <i>a whole lot more</i> restraint and commonsense the next time I meet him,\u201d answered a rather irate Aruna, \u201cor I\u2019d give him a tight slap and ask him to get out of my sight.\u201d Frank could not help but burst out giggling when he heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut anyway, I want to take a look at these,\u201d continued Aruna, her attention now directed towards the bags, boxes and parcels. She brought several of them onto a table nearby and began to inspect their contents, and her face beamed with delight as she gazed upon the clothes, perfume, jewelry, food, <i>objets d\u2019art</i> and gold pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am now almost a princess!\u201d exclaimed Aruna with joy. \u201cThere\u2019s probably more than enough gold here for me to buy a mansion! And such lovely clothes!\u201d Aruna picked up one of the clothes, a deep blue silk robe with golden flowers embroidered all over it, their stems winding all over the fabric in fantastic arabesques. She draped the robe on herself and danced around. \u201cHow do I look with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look truly regal, Aruna,\u201d complimented Carol with a broad grin. \u201cJust like an empress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you try it on, too?\u201d said Aruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d replied Carol as she put on the robe. \u201cOh, this robe makes you look so beautiful, Carol! This is surely a perfect garment for a sunb \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol raised a finger to her mouth. Aruna cut herself off and just smiled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to be appreciated so much by the townsfolk,\u201d said Aruna. \u201cNever been more than a street minstrel all my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe already told you that you are special,\u201d said Frank. \u201cIn fact much more special than we expected. And with your powers, you would be a great boon in our bid to save the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aruna heard these words, she became sober and fell silent. Troubling thoughts ran through her mind as she stared into space. She now had so much wealth she could live an easy life for the rest of her days; would it be a worthwhile tradeoff to leave it and embark on a quest for the restoration of the sun and the salvation of the world? It would be most selfish of her not to do so, but what are her chances of success in such a momentous task? If it came to naught in the end, she would have lost her chance to enjoy life\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAruna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna broke out of her reverie. Perhaps she should leave all those troubling thoughts aside for now and just go for a bit of shopping. \u201cOh, sorry, I was just having a few thoughts on what I\u2019d like to buy with all this gold. What say the two of you if we go for a browse at the marketplace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked down the not-so-busy street. It was still early in the morning. People greeted her with smiles and compliments all the way. \u201cLook! It\u2019s the young sorceress who saved our city!\u201d \u201cGreetings, fair maiden, we cannot thank you enough for saving us!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have to let me invite you to a free dinner sometime, miss, just as a token of gratitude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve become very popular in this town, Aruna!\u201d congratulated Carol. \u201cYou\u2019re now the light of the party everywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna just grinned broadly in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they saw a youth running up to them. It was Tsung Yun. \u201cAruna! My love!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Aruna stopped smiling and folded her arms. <i>If he does or says again any of the stupid things he did or said earlier</i>, she thought, <i>I\u2019ll give him a slap and ask him to get lost.</i> Frank and Carol closely observed everything to see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Tsung Yun got the please-keep-your-distance-and-watch-your-manners message from Aruna\u2019s stance, and came to a halt at arm\u2019s length in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d she asked. She still wasn\u2019t smiling. A few passersby stopped to watch with amusement, trying to anticipate the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201d stuttered Tsung Yun. \u201cI just want to apologize for my rather rash behavior earlier on. I couldn\u2019t help it, actually, I was so concerned for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d said Aruna dryly, raising a skeptical eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease believe me, Aruna, I\u2019m sincere,\u201d mumbled the young mage. \u201cI-I really think you\u2019re a wonderful person. I\u2026\u201d Giggling sounds could be heard from some of the onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you care so much about me?\u201d interrogated Aruna. \u201cJust <i>who</i> are you, anyway? I have yet to get to know more about you. A lot more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m a probationer at the Mage Academy,\u201d replied Tsung Yun. \u201cSince young I\u2019ve been sent there by my parents. I\u2019ve learned many wonderful things at the Academy, things which I\u2019d love to share with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsung Yun paused for a moment, his facial expression betraying the onset of a sudden wave of inspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me to the Academy, Aruna?\u201d he continued. \u201cI can show you around the place. You\u2019ll get to see lots of fascinating things there! We have a large cafeteria there as well, where we can go for refreshments after our tour!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sounds good,\u201d said Aruna with delight. \u201dBut what do the two spells do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i><span class=\"crose\">Luck</span></i> simply improves your luck. <i>Very greatly.</i> Lasts eight hours. You can cast this on another person or creature. But it works its magic only in dangerous situations -- you can't cast this for success at gambling! <i><span class=\"cindigo\">Mystic eye</span></i> enables you to sense without error the presence of all sorts of dangers within a radius of one hundred paces, whether traps, hostile creatures, unstable houses or bridges or caves which might collapse, or whatever. Lasts eight hours also. This spell will also reveal to you any hostile intentions in people or creatures around you, so that even if they seem to be friendly, you\u2019ll be able to tell that they\u2019re pretending. And again you can cast this on another person or creature, so that he or she will be able to sense the different forms of danger mentioned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna nodded. \u201cAnd you said you can permanently make a magic item more powerful, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Madame Zohari. \u201cIf you have an item that casts <i><span class=\"corange\">candlelight</span></i>, for example, it can be upgraded to <i><span class=\"cgreen\">torchlight</span></i>, which is very much brighter. If you want lights still brighter, you\u2019ll have to get the <i><span class=\"cyellow\">miniature sun</span></i> spell, which costs two thousand gold and which by the way burns all supernatural creatures of evil disposition that come within one hundred paces, such as vampires or evil spirits. As another example, if you have an item that casts <i><span class=\"cblue\">shield</span></i>, I can make it a much tougher shield which furthermore protects all within ten paces, not just you alone \u2013 though it will still only protect against physical attacks, not magical ones. Unfortunately, if you have an item that produces <i>more than one</i> spell effect, I can upgrade <i>only one</i> of the spell effects produced by it per one hundred gold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you sell any powerful attack spells?\u201d asked Aruna. \u201cMaybe a spell that throws fireballs? Just curious.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid not,\u201d replied the old woman. \u201cThis shop specializes mainly in protective, healing, utility and informational spells, though we also carry a couple spells useful for travel and locomotion, such as <i><span class=\"cteal\">fly</span></i>, which costs three thousand gold. The kind of spells you mentioned are just too dangerous to be made available to the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you desire, young lady?\u201d continued Madame Zohari. \u201cWould you purchase the <i><span class=\"crose\">luck</span></i> spell, perhaps? Or the <i><span class=\"cindigo\">mystic eye</span></i> spell? Or have you a magic item for me to empower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a mandolin here that when played can produce five different types of spell effects, actually...\" said Aruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my child,\" said Madame Zohari, \"as I've said, I will only be able to upgrade one of them per hundred gold!\"</span></div></div>",

His stall was a medium-sized tent among a few dozen others all situated in the shade of a gargantuan banyan tree in the middle of the town square. Several very large wickerwork baskets were in his tent, with different types of fruit placed in them, though all of the baskets were only half-full. The harvests were just not very good these days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aruna came inside the tent still whistling, Chand walked up to her. \"Good to see you again, Aruna. The usual thing, I presume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please,\" said Aruna with a smile as she handed Chand a piece of silver before resuming her whistling. \"Just a minute,\" said Chand as he walked to one of the baskets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birdsong was so beautiful that Aruna could not stop whistling it. As she whistled on, she noticed that there was another person in the tent, a very handsome but rather thin young man, not very tall, with fine, chiselled features and high cheekbones. He was selecting fruit for buying, and to her he looked like he could be a scholar. Perhaps a student from the Mage Academy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed a sudden change in the young man's expression. He was staring into the basket from which he had been making his selection. Staring as if he had seen something he could not believe. Aruna was wondering what to make of this when she turned to Chand only to see him likewise staring into another basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter, Chand?\" asked Aruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... Your whistling!\" exclaimed Chand. \"It's causing the fruit to... to <b>multiply!</b> Look! The baskets are now all <b>full!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAruna looked at the baskets. They were indeed all filled to the brim with fruit wherebefore they were half empty. She realized that the birdsong, and hence the bird from which the song came, must be something extremely magical.</span></div></div>",

First, Aruna's parents <b>didn't</b> abandon her when she was a babe. They gave her a mandolin when she was <b>twelve</b>, so it could only be sometime <b>later</b> that they were lost to her. You should have read the first chapter carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" acknowledged Tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second,\" continued the man, \"You need to make up your mind. Are you and your siblings living <b>inside</b> the city, or <b>outside</b> it? Aruna has always lived <b>inside</b> the city because it's too dangerous to go outside. So are you outside just for a trip or have you always lived outside? If the former, it's not clear from what is written. If the latter, how could you have ever adopted Aruna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTan was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" apologised the man, \"I hate to spoil things for you, but you just need to get certain things right. Just because this is a fantasy story... doesn't mean anything goes. There just seem too many... problems. Here's one more yet. Are you named Gwen or Tan? Are Gwen and Tan two persons or the same person? It's not clear to me from what is written. Presumably they're two persons. And presumably you're Tan, since these four rather loveable creatures are your <b>adopted</b> offspring, whereas Gwen was supposed to be their <b>biological</b> mother. But if so, where has she gone? I haven't found any explanation. Maybe she had always lived inside the city, and threw them out of the city when they were born because she was horrified to have given birth to what she thought were monsters, and then <b>you</b>, who have presumably always lived outside the city, found and adopted them? Okay, that would be a workable storyline, but I found no such thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" stuttered Tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing. Isn't it kinda funny that you and your darlings never once mentioned Aruna? Okay, maybe you're Tan and not Gwen, so you wouldn't have known Aruna, but as I said this was never pointed out. And even then, couldn't something be said about Gwen? Is she still alive anymore? Is Aruna still living with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTan just looked blankly at the man. Her four adopted siblings stood by her side, also staring blankly at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave now,\" said the man. \"I could have erased this chapter, but I just... didn't want to... Look, maybe you fellas can go back and... make a better attempt?\" :)</span></div></div>",
