            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ughhhhhhhh...\" I groaned, as I had awoken from my deepest dream. It was about something related to being breastfeed as a baby. I don't recall exactly how I came into that dream, but I found it strangely erotic. Speaking of babies, I did a full quick scan of my body to make sure that my power hadn't back fired on me. Fully grown hands? Check. Adult male body? Check. Morning wood? Check...and tempted...but I soon had more thoughts about H.A.L.O. watching over me with some sort of psychic power than having to satisfy urges.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepy head!\"</i> Speaking of being watched over, there was that lovable little voice that I've grown into...not to the point where I don't hate to hear it every morning...EVERY.MORNING...but it's bearable now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over to my desk and saw a little hologram of my current chaperone. She's a Norway anthropomorphic rat. Along with common rat-like qualities, such as gray fur, large ears, pink-ish nose, and a tail trailing behind her, she's also a bit chunky, weighing at nearly 200 Ibs...or as far as I could guess. She also has a fuzzy, jet-black hairdo that curves down to her shoulders. She's wearing her favorite black shirt and khaki pants...the one's that hugs her body, and exposes her belly a little under her shirt. Oh, and she wears glasses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neeerrrrrrddddd...\" I slurred, as I pulled my bed covers over my body, hoping she thought that I would fall asleep in my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh hardy-har-har, Mr. Adult Diaper,\"</i> She retorted <i>\"Come on, you need to get up. I have a few missions for you today.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stood still in my bed...yet I wanted to groan so hard right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dude, I know you're not asleep. If you are, then I suppose you wouldn't mind if I had...oh...I don't know...'slipped' something in your food stash?\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nOkay...that was enough to get me up and out of bed. It's funny how I was put under the care of someone who has the power to turn food into a death weapon. Seriously, not only can she make food come to life and attack people, she can also mess with the genetic DNA of said food, and turn them into...basically a bag of unhealthy side effects. Turn a sandwich into a laxative, make them into bombs when they touch stomach acids, cause breast growth on guys, you name it, she can do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scrambled a bit in my closet to find a clean pair of clothes. A lot of the clothes I was throwing onto the floor were dirty, but I did manage to find a pure black shirt and blue pants. As I was trying to change my shirt, I noticed out the corner of my eye that she was watching me change. She appeared to be holding her bottom lip with her teeth, either trying not to laugh, or she's just enjoying the show...I couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight shake of her head, <i>\"No.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood still for a moment...hoping she gets the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh...Oh!\"</i> She realized with a a slight blush. <i>\"Sorry, I'll see you later.\"</i> With a slight wave of her hand, the hologram transmission ended. I sighed in relief, knowing that she's out of my hair for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Can't believe I had to be chaperoned by her,*\" I thought. \"*Honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal.*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****Flashback****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"THIS IS A BIG DEAL! IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN!?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid a very angry, S-rank hero, after seeing how the H.A.L.O. base was in shambles...and on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****End****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Okay...but I still think they overacted a bit.*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Few minutes later----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow...I thought those clothes I had on were clean. Turns out I was wrong. Dead wrong. Disgustingly smelly wrong. Ugh...at least my bad doesn't smell, and it's filled with perishable food items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your clothes aren't as clean as they look.\" I was completely blinded by the smell of my clothes I didn't see her standing right in front of me, as I walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, jeez! Someone should put a bell on you!\" I yelled, only for her to respond with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long were you standing there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...just long enough,\" Her small smile made me uneasy for some reason.\"Come on, let's walk and talk.\" She said, as she walked off down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught up with her and started walking backwards in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what did you get me?\" She started fiddling with her watch, and soon enough two villains were shown in a small hologram. One on the left and one on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two should be easy for you. Managed to grab them before someone else did.\" She said. She zoomed in on the villain on the right first. She appeared to be a female Tanooki. Her most promising feature is that she has D-cup breasts and she's wearing a latex suit, enhancing the fact that she has on overall curvy figure. The mask did little to cover her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First villain. A Pawn level thief that goes by the name of Cannon Fondler. She has the ability to not only grow her ass and breasts to ridiculous sizes, but she can literally shoot people and objects out of it, either by pure muscle or...by gas...last spotted at a local market, presumably Walmart...where her records has shown that she has attacked several times...judging by her patterns, she's planning to strike again within the hour. Basic search and capture mission.\" She seemed a bit uneasy stating how she can literally shoot people out of her butt by farting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fiddling with her watch, again she zoomed in on the other villain. It appears to be a arctic fox woman, who was just fat overall. Her hips were very wide,to the point where I could barely see her feet, her arm fat was hanging from where I was sure her muscles were, and she had a double chin. She was also supporting a very large belly apron. Her costume did very little to hide her identity...let alone her own width!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second villain. Another Pawn level. Goes by the name of Glu-ton She has been known to kidnap people by using her stomach as a prison cell. She then whisks said prisoners, into a life time sentence of force feeding, to the point where the prisoners can't even move. We've been hearing stories of people's stomach bursting because of her. We're not quite sure ourselves, many believe that that's just a rumor. This is a stealth mission. You pose as an innocent bystander and get her to take you away, and after you find the prisoners, and rescue them, you kick her fat ass right out of the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were these really the only missions you could get?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I just thought these would be the easiest, because--\" She just let that sentence finish itself. She knows exactly what happened last time...and we don't talk about that...EVER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...pick your target, Rando.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it cover for roughly 5 seconds, I've decided to go with...</span></div></div>",

It was a particularly rough day for the little birdie, but it's not like every day wasn't tough for her. A young prodigy, Jenny faced a lot of prejudice from her classmates, usually in the form of gross bullying or just plain rudeness. She had grown a thick skin to it over the years, and knowing that she was both smarter AND stronger than her bullies helped her cope, even if she could never reveal that they were bullying a real live super hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was always frustrating to get gum stuck in her feathers or stink bombs planted in her locker. She was just happy to be done with school for the weekend, and all she had to worry about was her part time job and her studying. She worked afternoons at a local coffee shop, which she admired because it was nice and quiet there, and her boss was a friend of her mothers and so she was very understanding when Jenny had to run out for 'unexplained reasons'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny walked into Croc's Coffee and was greated by the eponymous croc and her boss, Mrs. Levi. She was a large bodied crocodile who usually only wore an apron across her big belly and a dozen or so hair decorations in her large beehive hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Jen!\" She said, \"Rough day at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed and grabbed her apron off the rack, \"Do I ever have any other days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't be like that sugar. C'mon, let's get you a nice hot cup and we can relax a little bit before the next coffee rush comes in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, Jenny would finally have a bit of time with her two favorite things: Coffee and quiet. Well, okay, three favorite things, because Mrs. Levi was always super cool to her.

She gazed over the city, justice in her eyes. This was her realm, her Avalon, and she would serve it loyally to the bitter end, upholding her knightly vows and keeping peace, justice and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have literally been standing there for two minutes\u2026 Assuming you haven\u2019t caused the prototype battle armour to malfunction again, could you possibly begin your patrol?\u201d An annoyed voice crackled through Abigail\u2019s earpiece, snapping her out of her inner monologue. She winced, looking a little sheepish, then put a hand to her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry, auntie\u2026 I got a little lost in thought. I was just meditating on my knightly vows!\u201d She responded defensively. On the other end of her earpiece, her aunt sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbby, I indulged your Arthurian obsession with your power suit\u2019s design, but if it continues to get in the way of your H.A.L.O. duties, I can give the armour to another hero.\u201d She warned, though it was an empty threat.  Abigail\u2019s aunt Maria was the brilliant scientist and engineer behind the creation of the X2-735 battle suit that gave the hero her powers, and the experimental power source needed to keep it running. But in addition, she was also an employee of H.A.L.O., and acted as Abigail\u2019s liaison and handler within the organization. She had originally designed the suit for her niece so that she could be a test subject, but she had been astonished at how well the usually ditzy and clumsy Abigail had taken to it, performing far better than her calculations had predicted. This was reflected with the meteoritic rise through the hero ranks Abby had undergone, becoming a highly-ranked class-C hero within the space of a few months, and decimating the Los Angeles criminal population. Still, it was best if she stopped her niece from getting too big for her boots. She was still a class C, and there were a few threats she was simply not ready to handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, auntie\u2026 But don\u2019t call me Abby when I\u2019m on patrol! I\u2019m The Quantum Knight!\u201d She says proudly, striking a heroic pose. On the other end of her earpiece, her aunt sighed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh how I loathe that name\u2026 Do you even understand what the word \u2018quantum\u2019 means? It makes no sense to give yourself such a ludicrously-\u201d Maria paused. On the command console in front of her, a red light had started beeping, signaling a tripped alarm nearby. \u201cAbby! We\u2019ve got activity. A break-in at the museum of technology. It appears to be a group of between seven to ten members, from the heat-readings.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it, Auntie! Time to take them down!\u201d The jetpack on Abigail\u2019s back roared to life, sending her soaring gracefully through the city like a rocket-powered falcon, reaching the museum within three minutes. She instantly deactivated the jet-pack, dropping like a stone and crashing down just outside the door, landing in a smoothly executed crouching pose. The knight straightened up, drawing her sword and holding it at her side, electricity crackling over it. The blade itself was blunt, but the charge it could deliver was enough to knock a cow unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalt, evildoers, and prepare to face knightly justice!\u201d She raised her head, taking in the scene in front of her for the first time and seeing that the robbers were\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of them, however, were wearing skin-tight black outfits with a large green emblem on the front, depicting a dragon skull over a nuclear hazard symbol, the emblem of the Atomic Dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lookie what we got here. Looks like the brat that's been getting in the boss's way showed up, just in time for an ass kickin'!\" The poodle said, spitting on the ground and cracking her knuckles. A few of the gang members snickered, while the poodle, who was even shorter than Abigail, sauntered up to her, glaring. \"You don't look nuffin' too tough. An' all your fancy armour can't beat my feet!\" She kicked off her shoes, and instantly a rank, cheesy smell filled the air, making Abigail and most of the villains stagger back in disgust. Instantly the hero activated the oxygen tank in her mask to overcome the stink, but in her brief second of distress, the poodle had charged forwards and spun around, delivering a powerful kick to Abigail's chest... which did absolutely nothing. The poodle blinked in surprise, but before she could react, the knight's sword hit her straight in the side, electrocuting her. The poodle squealed and spasmed as the charge flowed through her muscles, before being thrown aside and crashing into a nearby dumpster, her fur sizzling and standing on end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you all surrender and come peacefully.\" Abigail said, holding her sword at the ready and glaring at the thugs. The rest of the gang members glanced at each other, then picked up their bats and chains and charged at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next five minutes were a blur as Abigail ducked and dodged through the fray, sweeping under blows and blocking attacks, and slashing her own sword all throughout it, vanquishing villains left, right and center. At one point, the massive pig managed to grab her behind in a headlock and shoved her face into the ass of a skunk thug, but before the skunk could deliver her noxious spray at point-blank, Abigail activated her jetpack, blasting skywards out of the pig's grip, before crashing back down and slashing at them both, shocking them unconscious. Soon enough, all the thugs lay unconscious at her feet, and Abigail stood panting, catching her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Why are all the villains in this city so disgusting!\" She sighed and shook her head, then looked around, considering what to do next...</span></div></div>",

He wore primarily black, including his mask.  He didn't even have a bullet proof vest or battle armor of any kind.  In terms of equipment he had 30 feet of rope, a taser and two metal tipped darts.  Eventually he wanted to put some type of tranquilizer or mild poison on them but he still had to work on his aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what will the eager young Jared encounter first?

As he adjusted his stack of papers, our heroine Amelia sidled up to him with a cup of coffee and a danish. Amelia wasn't exactly a big star at channel 11. In fact, she was pretty much the furthest from a big star as she could be. She was the coffee girl and personal assistant, (AKA personal bitch) of Ollie. Whatever he wanted, she'd get. She wouldn't call it glamorous.

Action, excitement, and sex appeal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leered at Amelia, who was trying to scrub the coffee just had spit at her off of her chest, with her tits shaking up and down as she dabbed them with a paper towel. Ollie bit his lip and smirked, adjusting his tie a little bit to 'let off some steam'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sex appeal,\" he chuckled, \"something you and that hero have in common. It's a shame you're not anywhere as useful as Golden Girl. I'm sure she'd get my latte right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia frowned, \"Of course she would. She does everything right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a fantastic set of tits! You know, on second thought, you don't even stack up to her there. You're nothing like her.

She wished she could show that Mr. Ornblatt how amazing she was. She wished she could show everyone.

With this story I'm hoping to get a bunch of people to go on an epic adventure were you play the role as your own unique anthropomorphic animal super hero or villain who does battle with each other, either to save the world, or rule it. The heroes job is to stop the villains, either trying to detain and arrest them or even at times if need be, kill them. The villains job is to destroy all the heroes, so no one can stop them, at any means necessary, either with pure force, or other 'means', humiliating the heroes in away they please. Will you play as a strong hero who stands for justice, and do nothing but stop villainy in its track? A weak, lower class super hero who can't catch a break and is constantly harassed, abused, humiliated, dominated by villains, or will you play the powerful villain who will do whatever it takes to dominate and destroy the heroes physically or mentally. The choice is yours! Your fate is in your hands!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======================================================================================================<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>The Lore</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year is 2025, we live in anthropomorphic animal world. The world has known peace for fifty years.  Though that quickly changed as a sudden increase of super villains started to rise. The future allowed new technology, new genetics, crossing DNA, making super powered people. As it was very illegal, as people feared the consequences and side effects. This didn't stop some people who had more nefarious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super powered villains weren't just from the United States they were all across the world, and the military of each nation couldn't handle the powers of the villains, as they easily rolled over them, and did as they please. One man though had enough, Leon Stryker.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA young wolf who stood seven feet, and weighed four-hundred twenty five pounds, all muscle. He was the fiercest warrior of the United States, he trained his whole life, in all types of fighting styles. He would travel around the states stopping villains, though he was only aware of the villains from other countries as some had made their way to the states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw it as his duty to defeat all villains and see them to justice, so he traveled all around the world, with each country giving their fair share of reward money for him stopping their villain problems.  Twenty years of traveling around the world, he did his fair share of stopping villains, but with age and an even more increase of villains he had to stop traveling around the world and head back to the United States. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived back to the states, he knew it would take more then just him to stop this villain menace. With his reward money from all the people he help, and a large crowd funding, he decided to make H.A.L.O. ,Hero Association for Law and Order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main base is held in Washington D.C., and smaller bases set up in each state. The only way he could get more people to help in his endeavor he needed the law on genetic experimentation approved, seeing the work he had done, they had no other choice, with this new organization the villain epidemic started to decrease drastically. Though many more ran amuck in other countries. Other countries saw how it helped the United States, they knew they had to follow in Leon's footsteps and with his help started to make more bases around the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach country had a main base of H.A.L.O and an S class hero in their ranks. Now with the world protected by this new hero organization, it seemed the world could finally know peace... until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five years, the world knew war once more, as more villains started to appear, and this time were more organized. Some working together, attacking bases of H.A.L.O, or just attacking major cities causing great panic. The heroes were out numbered once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why you're here recruit! You're here to become a hero! We need all the help we can get, we need more aspiring heroes, courageous, strong, and determined. Don't let these despicable villains destroy the world we live in. Now from the tests' I can see your class and rank is...<br>\r\n=====================================================================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Which side are you on?!</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you take the side of H.A.L.O, a strong courageous hero? Or will you take the role as a dirty villain who wants nothing but to destroy anything in their path, and dominate any silly hero who gets in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Hero or villain don't appease you? Take roll as a SM!</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't feel like being a hero or villain? How about a SM? (scenario manager) As a scenario manager you basically set up the scene for a hero or a villain to explore or experience! Have a girls cat stuck in the tree for a hero to come save, or even have a bank being robbed for a hero to stop the bank robbers, or even a villain coming in to steal the glory and wreck some havoc while their at it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Rise up in the ranks and classes!</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classes are S-C, with ranks 1-250. Depending on how strong you think your hero is, you can place them in any of those. If you're starting low, do some hero duties to rank up! Depending on how difficult the task is at hand, you could rise the ranks before you know it! If you feel like you deserve a better rank than another hero, you could do battle with them, though the organization frowns upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Be wary of the threat levels!</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach situation and villain will have their own threat level, so when dealing with a situation make sure you are ready for it. <b>Lowest</b> -  <u>Pawn.</u>   <b>Very low</b>-  <u>Knight</u> . <b>Low</b> - <u>Bishop</u> . <b>Medium</b> -  <u>Rook</u> . <b>High</b> -  <u>Queen</u> . <b>Very High</b> -  <u>King</u> . <b>Highest</b> -  <u>Controller</u> . <b>Impossible</b> -  <u>God</u> . Always take care of a situation with the the utmost importance, even if it's a pawn, treat it like you would a king, like Leon said \"Just like in chess, if you don't take out all the pawns, it will come back to bite you as a queen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b> Not all heroes are born good!</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust because you're a hero doesn't mean you have to play by the rules. A villain decided to bribe you to look the other way? Stop bank robbers from robbing the bank, but you decide you feel need of some type of compensation? Fighting other heroes too rise up int he ranks? All fine! Just don't get caught by other heroes, if caught too many times the organization will kick you out or even worse imprison you. From there you can try to come back to the organization or all else fails, become a villain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Any hero/villain, any where!</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust because you may be stationed in Japan doesn't mean you have to stay there! Travel around the world to different H.A.L.O bases. Same goes for villains, just because you are the Sledge Sisters from Russia, doesn't mean you don't need to stay in Russia, they can go, and attack anywhere they please. Don't be afraid to venture around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Large scale battles!</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeroes at times, may be over whelmed by a much stronger villain, at any time they can call back up from an nearby hero, turning the tides of battle. Even a villain, though known for being lone wolves, could also join or gang up on a hero! If that battle becomes to large with many heroes or villains, PM the author of the heroes and or villains and take it to a IM, and don't forget to post the results to the interactive!<br>\r\n=====================================================================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>RULES</b></font></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.)Most if not all fetishes are allowed! Facesitting, farting, scat, butt crushing, weight gain, vore, anal vore, feet, stomping, crushing, the list goes on.<br>\r\n2.)Death is allowed! Just try not to get to graphic with the gore.<br>\r\n3.) Make sure when you make a Super hero or Villain character leave a chapter open for someone else to make their own.<br>\r\n4.) You can't share a class and rank of an existing hero, Example: Leon Stryker is Class S Rank 1, you can't have that exact class and rank. Be mindful of the other super heroes ranks and classes.<br>\r\n5.) If you join into a SM's chapter, make sure you either link your character's profile from a previous chapter or put it in the response to the chapter before you write. You can also introduce your villain or hero into a existing chapter. EX: A hero is stopping a bank from being robbed, and the villain arrives. (You don't need to have an existing slot filled, it'd just be easier if you did)  <br>\r\n6.) Add some substance to your chapters, don't make them incredibly short.<br>\r\n7.) Grammar is a must, doesn't have to be perfect, as at times I find myself lacking in that department. <br>\r\n8.) Have fun! <br>\r\n9.) Feel free to take over for a person's created hero and or villain! </td>",
