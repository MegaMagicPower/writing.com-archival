Here he was sitting in class reading a case file when Chihiro Fujisaki the Ultimate Programmer burst in and asked him to help test her new VR game. The fledgeling detective was reluctant wondering how he could be helpful at all over say Nanami or Miu. Surely they would be better he reasoned to her.<br>\r\n\"No-no-no-no Shuichi it can only be you! Please,please,please Shuichi!\"<br>\r\n\"Bu-but Chihir-\"<br>\r\n\"PLEASE!!\"<br>\r\n\"Al-alright\" he'd stammered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not expecting the small girl to be so forceful and had essentially been dragged into her computer lab where he'd met with her other volunteers and become even more curious about why he was here.<br>\r\nThe enigmatic Nagito Komaeda and the bright cheerful Makoto Naegi were waiting inside. In addition to the two Ultimate Lucks the most popular boy in Shuichi's own class Rantaro Amami the Ultimate Adventurer was inside seemingly shielding the nervous and younger lucky student from the odd and older one. Whatever the three were up to they stopped upon seeing the Programmer and Boy Detective enter.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh it's...\" Nagito started<br>\r\n\"SHUICHI!\" exclaimed Makoto running over to the boy.<br>\r\n\"So you're here to help Chihiro too? What kind of game exactly did you want us to test for you?\" asked Rantaro. <br>\r\n\"Thank you all so much for coming everyone I'm so glad you did! I've brought you here to help me test my new invention! It's an immersive vr game called Despair Dungeon and in it you'll get captured by monsters and stuck in traps!\"<br>\r\n\"Now none of us are on Nanami's level or anything Chihiro but your acting like we're all terrible at games here. I'll have you know I've beaten a bunch of adventure games and I bet the others have beaten some as well.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually Amami I'm pretty bad at video games...sorry for being worthless trash\"<br>\r\n\"Nagito being bad at video games doesn't make you trash! I'm pretty bad at them too!\"<br>\r\n\"AHH Naegi you always know just what to say to cheer me up c'mere you precious lucky boy!!\"<br>\r\nNagito pulled Makoto into a clearly unwelcome tight hug which the smaller boy did his best to wiggle out of to no avail.<br>\r\n\"RANTARO HELP HE'S DOING IT AGAIN!!\"<br>\r\n\"Haha you two, Nagito let him go. Come on now break it up\"<br>\r\n\"Ahhh but he's just as soft as I'd always hoped...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty good at mystery and puzzle games.\" Shuichi said doing his best to neither catch Nagito's attention or Makoto pleading looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The games designed with the four of you in mind but I've made it more than challenging and realistic enough for you to still have fun.\" she continued ignoring the struggling Lucks \"All you have to do is lie down in these pods and put the helmets on to enter the game then once the system is booted up you'll enter the game. Once that happens I'll activate the pods which will do their best to simulate what you feel in the game.\"<br>\r\n\"Now wait a minute Miss Fujisaki I'm a bit concerned at that part.\" Makoto snickered at that statement for some reason.<br>\r\n\"D-Don't worry! I promise nothing in there will hurt you and I will be monitoring everything from here on this televsion here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro showed them a very large screen with several comfortable recliners set up. The one in the center had a number of keyboards set up in front of it.<br>\r\n\"Why so many seats Chihiro?\"<br>\r\n\"Ohh uhh I'll be having some assistants help me Rantaro. Now please enough questions and lets get underway. I can't wait to have you guys play my Despair Dungeon. Everybody climb into the pods please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro hustled the four boys fretting over and rushing them as they lay down in the pods and donned their helmets. When the clamps around their ankles and wrists activated they panicked a bit but were put at ease quickly by Chihiro's explanation. <br>\r\n\"It's just so the machine can't get damaged. Some people thrash about in their sleep. Alright guys off you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the flip of a switch a low hum could be heard by the foursome. Nagito was the first one to succumb to sleep with Rantaro shortly after. Shuichi's eyes were getting very heavy when he heard a voice outside the pod.<br>\r\n\"Chihiro are they ready yet?! WE'RE GETTING LIKE TOTALLY BORED OUT HERE!\"<br>\r\n\"Wha...why..Jun-Junko's hereee\" Naegi mumbled before falling asleep himself.<br>\r\n\"FUCKING FALL ASLEEP ALREADY\"<br>\r\n\"Miu??\" Shuichi forced himself up slightly fighting the unconsciousness that was rapidly overtaking him. He saw a group of different women crowding through the door some who he recognized as his fellow Ultimate students from the Academy! That last little bit of shock was too much as he gave out and fell asleep in the pod. A grinning Chihiro took his place in the lead seat in frontof the screen and gestured for his guests to do the same.<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies now we get to enjoy the show but don't forget the main event tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shuichi awoke it was to Nagito and the others over him as lay on the ground. Right away he noticed the cold floor away and was impressed at Fujisaki's programming skills. It really felt like a cold and slighty wet dungeon floor, the whole place felt drafty and wet. He tried to get up but found something incredibly heavy weighing him down also he realized that he was next to naked. All he had on was a small furry loincloth which itched a good bit in the butt (How exactly was Chihiro simulating that?) as well as a pair of heavy fur boots. Once Komaeda helped him undo the strap on his chest and he looked at the humongous sword that been weighing him down it clicked in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh I'm the barbarian of the group. Could I get some more clothes though or at least a sword I could actually pick up? CHIHIRO! PLEASE?! CLOTHES!\"<br>\r\n\"Ahh don't bother Saihara we've been trying for abit and Fujisaki either isn't there or just doesn't care about us in here. It's probably because you've got a piece of trash like me weighing you down.\"<br>\r\n\"Nagito knock that off. There's probably some problem with the system stopping him from helping us here. Chihiro wouldn't just leave us here.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah Makoto's right. Calm down Nagito she's probably trying to help us right now.\"<br>\r\n\"Ahh how just like the Ultimate Adventurer, so cool in the face of pressure. Who am I to even dare to doubt an Ultimate? I hoped I was better than that but I guess I am still just trash.\"<br>\r\n\"If I'm the barbarian what are you guys then? I'm guessing from the robes that Komaeda's some kind of mage?\" Shuichi said trying to distract the boy from one of his typical spirals.<br>\r\n\"Well done. I am the mage I suppose I tried earlier and I can make a bit of fire and ice. Hopefully I can finally be useful!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I'm the thief!\" Makoto chimed in \"I found a bunch of bottles and knives in my pockets and if we find a chest I bet I could open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at Rantaro with the sword at his side and the bow on his back he responded with an almost embarrassed shrug.<br>\r\n\"Adventurer of course. What are you gonna do. Honestly this is pretty amazing it's like we're really in the game. This is pretty great, Makoto tell your girlfriend it's amazing when she let's us out.\"<br>\r\n\"CHI-CH-CHIHIRO'S NOT MY-I MEAN WE-HOW WOULD I-WE'RE BOTH-I-I-\"<br>\r\nRantaro laughed at the quickly reddening boy before waving it off.<br>\r\n\"Just teasing you a little Makoto that's all. All things considered there's worse places to be stuck for abit.\"<br>\r\n\"I-I WOULD LIKE SOME CLOTHES!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? Ahh yeah you are kinda letting it all hang out there aren't you Shuichi Hey Makoto think you could give him your cloak at least?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course if I had more I'd give it but unless Shuichi wants to wear knives...\"<br>\r\n\"Anything helps thanks, it's so cold down here.\"<br>\r\n\"Saihara come get close to me then! I don't have anything under these robes sure but there's enough room under them for two so if you let me hold you we could warm each other up. To make it even better Naegi could probably fit in and keep us both warm with glorious Hope! Ahhh it'd be so great not to just help an Ultimate but Hope itself as well.\"<br>\r\nShuichi looked pleadingly at Makoto who shook his head and inched closer to Rantaro. The detective turned with the full intention of turning the eccentric luck down but instead was swallowed whole by a tidal wave of light blue fabric as Komaeda didn't wait for an answer to share his clothes. Underneath the robes he wasted no time bearhugging Shuichi close to him despite his struggles to pull away.<br>\r\n\"MmmppgghlemmegoNagghito!!\"<br>\r\n''Ahhhh your breath's so warm Saihara but your skin's just so cold, Naegi you should really come and help me in here with him.''<br>\r\nKomaeda's nail's dug into Shuichi's sides during their struggles.<br>\r\n''MmmpheeeheheheLEMME GO!''<br>\r\nWith that exclamation he shoved off Nagito with a shocking amount of strength forcing the older boy off.<br>\r\n''Ohh I'm so sorry Saihara! I was just trying to help in anyway I could but of course a piece of trash like me bungled it up''<br>\r\nThe boys were interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hold on a second guys.\" Rantaro interrupted \"Do you feel that?\"<br>\r\n\"Feel what Amami?\" Nagito asked but was shushed by the Boy Detective Shuichi who gestured for him to come over to a puddle he'd found. As the boy's crowded around it they observed the ripples that almost rhythmically disturbed it to the footsteps of something large drawing near. The boys looked up and saw a giant hand quickly approaching them out of the darkness. Rantaro tackled Naegi out of the way before it seized him. As the boys watched on in amazement as a giant ogre with long white hair stepped out of the shadows towards them. Curiously the horrible and warty beast wore a ripped schoolgirls uniform and trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cruel Chihiro.\" Naegi mumbled drawing the beasts attention towards the boys once more.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh and what twist of fate has brought these four to my domain? Come once more to challenge the strongest ogre Have you? I must say you<br>\r\nlook a good bit tastier than the last few that came through. I'll have to be a good bit carefuller this time so that you don't break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the giant lunged with deceptive speed quickly scooping up Komaeda in one hand as the teen yelled in fear the beast reached with the other hand for Shuichi who was frozen before it. If Rantaro hadn't seized his hand and pulled him and Makoto out of the way the hand probably would have seized him as well. Without missing a beat Rantaro whirled around and started lashing blows at the Ogres hand but all that got him was grabbed as well. He kicked and punched at it as he was lifted away while Makoto finally snapping out his trance started hurling knives at the beast with little to none effect. Annoyed at the two it distractedly swiped at the short thief who barely avoided getting caught himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were doomed at this rate and Shuichi realized it. It wasn't even paying attention to him and Naegi instead pulling down spiders web and using it to bind Rantaro and Nagito's wrists and ankles together with each other so that the older two of the were tied back to back with their wrists above their heads. It then pulled down another loop and securing it around it's own thick neck then tying it to the boy's ankles. The monster stood and allowed it's captives to dangle uspide down while Shuichi hustled Naegi down a passageway where the female ogre had no chance of fitting. They both looked on in horror at their friend's Rantaro and Nagito turned into an accessory for the beast. It took it's two massive index fingers and drove them into both teen's sides simultaneously due to their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait now let's taAAAhalk waihiht!!\"<br>\r\n\"Ahahanoot thihihis! Hahaow did you knohoww?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh delightful. I have been given a good batch of toys tonight. Do not worry I will be careful not to break you too soon.\" The musclebound beast cooed as she stroked her two up and down the sides of her pieces of giggling jewelery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto went pale at the sight of his seniors being tormented so strangely and went to try and help but was stopped by the Ultimate Boy Detective.<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you plan to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Guheehheeys heeeheehllpp!!\"<br>\r\n\"We've got to help them Saihara!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course but how exactly were you planning to do that? Your knives did nothing earlier and rushing in will only get you grabbed as well-wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile chiding Makoto, Shuichi had noticed the ogre attempting to slyly watch them. Anyone else wouldn't have noticed but Shuichi had quickly picked up on it's increasing speed in the torment of his friends. Earlier it had been careful to keep it slow enough that the boys could at least speak, perhaps it enjoyed the begging? Once Naegi had made to leave though it's attention had been divided and because of that it was going at the boys bit too hard this was leading to Nagito drooling redfacedly as he laughed in silence. They couldn't see Rantaro's face but they imagined it couldn't be much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well??\" The Ogre boomed \"You would keep a lady waiting and abandon your comrades? Are you but the basest of cowards?\"<br>\r\nShe ceased her stroking of the boys and pinched off Rantaro's boots and Nagito's soft clothen shoes. It pulled them off gently leaving both boys socked feet exposed to the dungeon air and the beasts predatory gaze. When it's large and slimy tongue emerged Makoto looked away while Shuichi marveled at how it was basically the same size as his whole body. The beast wrapped one hand around them to bring them closer and give a long slow lick.<br>\r\n\"He-hey what's ha-HAAAHWHHA?!\" Rantaro screamed as the the monsters tongue dragged over his and Nagito's feet. The sticky tongue sucked both of his and one of Komaeda's socks clean off. The remaing sock barely hung off Nagito's toes but he still clenched them tightly to keep it. The Ogre however had plans of letting him keep it and with a \"gentle\" blow of air (That could've probably knocked any of the boys off their feet) sent it spiraling down to the dungeon floor. It went for a second lick over the now naked tootsies as Shuichi restrained his remaining friend. The Adventurer and Luck struggled in it's grasp but judging from the way it smiled at their efforts, it seemed to enjoy a little fight in it's prey and used it's tongue to chase the wiggling feet down. It wrapped around them grinned as a look of pure ecstasy overtook it's face while Komaeda and Amami's faces were bright red as they thrashed to and fro in uncontrollable laughter. As the tongue curled around their feet it felt like the very tastebuds themselves were peeling apart their toes whenever they tried to scrunch them up to offer some protection then invading the sensitive, virgin and unbearably ticklish crevices.. Somehow it felt to the teens like every single sensitive nerve in their feets had two to three tongue to care for them and they did it with relish. Komaeda, overwhelmed by the sensations had lapsed into a silent gag as he was sampled like a lollipop. Rantaro had tried so hard at first to resist the laughter and clenched his teeth to try and give a little precious hope to not only Nagito but also to Shuichi and Makoto. The beast noticed it though and with an extended slurp broke the Adventurer's dam of willpower and with it came tidal wave of laughter. His normally cool demeanor was replaced with unstoppable laughter that quickly turned the green haired teen's throat hoarse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Giant finally retracted it's tongue from around the boy's feet and gave them a break. It sat and turned the boys right side up to inspect it's handiwork as the boy's greedily took in air, grateful for the respite.<br>\r\n''You two would hide while your friends suffer so? Does their torment mean nothing to you?''<br>\r\n''No! Shuichi we need-''<br>\r\n''She's trying to play us into coming out. She can't get at us in here and so she's trying to get us to come to her.''<br>\r\n''The gloomier one of you is not wrong at all. This room is to force a tough choice upon those who enter it. I prefer to have one toy to play with whom I can focus all of my attention upon until they break and I must give them to the bear. Normally those who come in here have to face that I will take one of them. Those adventurers can either leave me my prize or attempt to defeat me to free them.''<br>\r\n''And how often do they do that? Not frequently I'm assuming if you willing to tell us like this.''<br>\r\n''The scantily clad boy is right to ask. None have ever defeated me here. The only way forward is to leave something to occupy me.''<br>\r\n''Shuichi we can't leave them here! They're our friends!''<br>\r\n''IT'S JUST A GAME NAEGI!''<br>\r\n''It clearly doesn't feel like that to them! When Nagito tickled you earlier what did that feel like? A game or did it feel exactly like the real thing! Chihiro wouldn't program a roadblock like this to stop us before we even start! There has to be a way to stop it or else why would it be trying to convince us to leave?''<br>\r\n''Yo-You're right! That doesn't make sense.''<br>\r\n''A moment. You two may doubt me but I do not wish you to leave. The one of you I want is the smallest one who refuses to abandon his comrades. He possesses a strong faith in his friends that I want to test to it's limit. Should he come out and give himself to me I will release both of my captives and amuse myself with him instead. I have seen such small and dainty feet on a male and am entranced with the idea of what they will taste like. Your belly as well seems like it would be fun poke and play with before the bear prepares you for the steel horse.''<br>\r\n''M-Me?!''<br>\r\n''No! How do we even know you'd let them go?! Naegi we're not going to do this!''<br>\r\n''You wish a guarantee? Fine I will show how certain I am. That chest over there in the corner.'' The Ogre gestured towards a chest in the shadows that had escaped their notice until now. ''Opening would activate a trap. In it is a poison that would knock even me unconscious. Should one of you manage to open it I will drink it. There is no chance you could though.''<br>\r\n''You could still be ly-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi stopped mid sentence as Makoto dashed past him in the opposite direction of the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''HA! Without a moment's hesitation! Wonderful! You will be a joy to train!''<br>\r\nWith that she placed down Nagito and Rantaro and took off after Naegi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Maybe I could make it to the chest before she caught him? Would she even still honor the deal?''</span></div></div>",

He breathed a sigh of relief that he'd understood his plan then sharply turned to try and throw off the monsters balance. He sneaked a look to see if it'd worked and only saw a giant hand rapidly approaching and blocking out all light. He just barely ducked under it but still yelped when it snagged ahold of his hood. After a seconds thought he shrugged out of the jacketed cloak but clicked his tongue when his shirt went with it, He'd underestimated her speed, skill AND strength now. If it hadn't been for him being alot more nimble in the game she would've probably had him in a stew pot already. He heard a shout and saw that Shuichi had tripped and fell flat on his face. That was his last mistake though as in less than a second his small feet left the ground as he was scooped up by the monster. He beat and bit at the hand as she laughed at his fighting spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahha! Come now my little treasure. You ran a good race and had a fine plan. No doubt you thought that you could distract me long enough for your friend to reach the chest and hoped I would honor my deal.\"<br>\r\nOn the ground Shuichi clenched his fists as tears welled in the corner of his eyes. Her uproarious laughter did nothing but make the young Detective feel worse. When she suddenly picked him up like as well his stomach sank like a rock.<br>\r\n''Fret not I will honor our agreement young one.''<br>\r\nShe gently placed Shuichi by the passageway he and Makoto had previously been taking shelter in as she returned with the still weak Rantaro and Nagito. She pulled off their bindings as Shuichi still trembled at how he'd failed his lucky friend. Komaeda's hand's flashed with weak electrical energy as he tried to muster up a spell.<br>\r\n''NAGITO STOP! DON'T DO IT!''<br>\r\n''What?! But-but Naegi why?!''<br>\r\n''Stop and think! If she wanted all four of us it'd be easy right now! If she's willing to take just me you guys should be happy and just go!''<br>\r\n''No that's wrong Naegi we can't leave you! Saihara tell her to take a piece of trash like me instead!''<br>\r\n''Nagito's right Makoto we can't just leave you here!''<br>\r\n''HA-HA YOU ARE A FINE GROUP OF ADVENTURER'S! Most have fled without a word or wasted their allies sacrice on attempts to defeat me. Such honorable actions greatly interest me. ''<br>\r\n''Wait-''<br>\r\n''No that will be enough actually humans. Farewell to you now.\"<br>\r\nWith a strong breath she forced the three boys down the passage away from her and their friend. With ease she picked up a boulder and placed it in front of the hall effectively sealing it.<br>\r\nSeeing the anxious expression on her captives face she reassured him<br>\r\n\"Worry not. They are unharmed I'm sure. I took great care in that all that would happen was they would be removed from the boulders path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-well thanks for tha-UGAAHH!!\"<br>\r\nNaegi's nervous thanks was cut off by a gigantic pair of lips covering not only his face but all his upper body in one giant smooch. He tried futiley and almost cutely to push back against it but it was like an ant against the ocean as he was pinned to the ogre's hand by the force that was it's lips. When he felt the monsters hot breath start to intake he could barely breath himself and when it's tongue snaked and dragged over him he couldn't do a thing. He wanted to laugh because by god it was the most ticklish thing he'd ever felt in his life. It felt as if it was made up of a million tiny feathers that were incredibly stiff yet still wet feeling, They sucked gently wherever they touched and if he focused through the tickle induced haze over his mind he could almost hear a million tiny pops as the tastebuds moved mournfully from one ticklish inch of his body then gleefully sampled another. His legs kicked and his fists beat on her chin trying to force her to free him, but when the tongue curled and began on his face all his limbs became so much useless jelly. He'd been tickled on his nose and cheeks before by his sister and while he hadn't liked it all, it hadnt made him convulse like this. The tongue dragged around searching for something. It investigated his ears a little bit before it found what it was looking for. His poor little lips were poked and lapped at like they were so much candy. It took every last ounce of energy little Naegi had to keep <br>\r\nthem closed. Finally with a horrendous yet surprisingly gentle suck the giants kiss ended and Makoto was released from it. The giant smiled at the young lucky adventurer as he gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We-were-WERE YOU JUST TRYING TO EAT ME?!'' he screamed still dripping in saliva.<br>\r\n''Eat you? If I wanted to do that do you not think I would have there? That was but a gentle kiss to show gratitude for your telling your friends to leave the two of us be.''<br>\r\n''That-THAT'S NOT WHY I TOLD THEM TO LEAVE!''<br>\r\n''Oh? Then why did you? Could you have done it only because you knew that I could easily capture all four of you?''<br>\r\n''Well-It's....''<br>\r\n''Yes, Yes what you did was very brave and yes you are deliciously sweet. Now let us move on with this life of servitude of yours.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi shifted uncomfortably at the abrupt way she said such a horrible thing as he sat back up. Still barring some kind of miracle that seemed like what was going to happen here. There was no chance of him actually being able to defeat the ogre and he'd already tried a few times to remove the helmet and take himself out of this game. They hadn't heard a word from Chihiro since he'd put them in here. Makoto didn't want to doubt one of his friends but there was no way that Fujisaki didn't know what was going on in here. Had he maybe left the lab? Well then where could he have gone!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Remove your shoes pet.''<br>\r\nThat snapped him out of any thoughts about the Ultimate Programmer and right back to the reality of this virtual reality.<br>\r\n''Wh-wha-what?! No-no I-I''<br>\r\n''No?! Who are you to be saying no to your owner? If I wished to eat you right here would you be able to stop me?''<br>\r\n''Wait pleas-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant's finger suddenly shoved Naegi right back over onto his back. It pinned him down again and dug into his defenseless belly. He squirmed and squealed beneath the giant digit while the angry ogre continued.<br>\r\n''WaiaHHAaht!! Hehheeehahaha.'' <br>\r\n''Are you going to stop me? If I wanted your feet bare I could do it but your here to be trained as a pet So remove your shoes as ordered or the punishment your going to get will be worse.''<br>\r\n''Puhuuahnishheeeh-SNNHEK HAAHHAA''<br>\r\nAs the young Ultimate descended into snorting belly laughs he frantically waved his hands for it to stop. The cruel ogre stopped and looked quizzically at the boy who barely had the strength to to try and sit back up.<br>\r\n''The shoes, pet. Off. Now.''<br>\r\n''Pl-please don-'HEEEEHHIIIHEEENOOOOHO'<br>\r\nThe finger went right back to it shoving him back down and dug back in as Naegi broke down into squeals. He beat on the finger which only made the giant sneer and dig into his stomach deeper.<br>\r\n''Ohhaakahy Ihihi gihieeve!''<br>\r\n''Very well.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he wasted no time and got the shoes off quickly as the finger hovered over him threateningly. He showed the now empty boots to her then put his hands as if to show there was no tricks but was instead quickly dug back into. This time Makoto didn't even try and instead beat his fists meaninglessly while his ticklish tummy was tenderly tortured.<br>\r\n''Wahahy! Ihihi dihihd itehe-SNNNRK-KAHAHEHA!''<br>\r\n''Socks.''<br>\r\n\"Snnnrrkk-Ahakay juhuhs tahahp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the cherry red boy was quick to follow orders and get his socks off. His teary eyes looked up at the one who ordered them off as she scooped them up with his socks and gobbled them up. Then she came back for him with the damn finger. He tried to beg her not to but was quickly gotten again however this time she was much gentler drawing out giggles rather than snorting belly laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeheeeu I dihihd ihiht.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes you did pet. This is a treat for you,unless you'd prefer how things were before?\"<br>\r\n\"NOohohha this is fiHEEHEne\"<br>\r\n\"Now you will show me your feet. They are prizes I would like to admire.\"<br>\r\nWith that order she released him and watched expectantly. Makoto quickly sat up and unsurely presented his small feet. When the ogre motioned for it he raised them up, when it continued to motion he obeyed until eventually he was on his back once more but now with his feet in the air for the ogre to admire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roll over and keep them in the air. Do not lower them or move them at all.\"<br>\r\n\"O-o-okay..\" he rolled upon his belly while keeping his small feet in the air. On the one hand he was extremely glad to have his tummy safe from the ogres probing digit, but with his feet now clearly it's new target-<br>\r\nOnce more Naegi's thoughts were scattered by tickles overwhelming his brain. The ogres slimy tongue dragged across his unsuspecting soles and toes driving him wild. He immediately pulled away just on instinct. <br>\r\n\"Ahahawait I wasn't expecting that. I'm sorry, please I'm sorry!''<br>\r\n''One more chance. 15 LASHES. MOVE AGAIN AND THE PUNISHMENT WILL BE SEVERE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi shivered at the expression on the giants face as he rolled back over. He didn't know what she meant by punishment but the severity of it would probably be bad. The tongue came again and Makoto's hands balled into fists.<br>\r\nThat was one.<br>\r\nNaegi started pounding his fists as the second tongue lashing came, at three he bit his into his lip. At the fourth he realized that there was no chance he was going to be able to do this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Ultimate Lucky Student pulled his feet away and curled up into a ball bawling and snorting as he laughed up a fit.<br>\r\n\"Haheeha-SNNNRRK-heeehnooho-SNNRK-ahha cahan't\"<br>\r\nHe squirmed and twisted at how his soles still tingled from her assault before going quiet at seeing her expression.<br>\r\nThe ogre stared at him with raw anger, he shrank away from it and tried to stammer out an apology.<br>\r\n\"I'm so-sorry please it just tickled s-s-so much!\"<br>\r\n\"It tickled? Compared to what is coming for you soon you'll beg to go back to this. I think the bear has left me the perfect thing to punish an unruly pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she picked up Makoto by his ankles and wrapped him in her massive grasp so that only his poor still tender and tingling feet were exposed to the dungeon air. Makoto felt her start to take steps and shivered in fear at what they were on there way to. When the familiar tongue of the monster ravaged his feet once more though he thought of nothing else than how could such a massive organ so specifically target his toes?! At about 9 licks towards her tootsies pop the ogre's captive lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto Naegi didn't think his luck could get any worse. When he first came to this school as an Ultimate Luck two years ago he couldn't believe his own. His opinion of his luck had only gone downhill since then when he'd ended up getting bullied, picked on and played with by more than half his upper-classmen, four of his own classmates some of his juniors and one very mean grade-schooler in a wheelchair who'd put a frog in undies. To make it worse to him the other Ultimate Luck attending the school was one of the worst ones to him. He still shivered when he thought of what'd happened when he'd accepted his invitation for a sleepover. Two weeks later he'd been found by the headmasters daughter Kyoko hidden inside the body pillow Nagito had kept him in (To keep him safe! He'd said! I've seen that serial killer Genocide Jack near your dorms Makoto!). If it wasn't that it was experiments with Iruma, punishment games with Celestia or just generally being tossed around by Chabashira. He'd made it through all of that just to end up here thanks to one of the few people in his class he considered a close friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he blinked the sleep from his eyes he tried instinctively to stretch as though all of that had been a bad dream and now he was waking up in his own bed, warm, happy and safe. He found though that he couldn't move his wrists at all as they seemed to have been secured behind his back. He scanned the room and saw nothing but darkness until he looked and discovered two things, that he sat astride a motorcycle for some reason and that someone had undone his trousers so that his manhood now stood free before him. The strange device that was buckled around the shaft of Naegi's penis as well as the collar around his neck had the boy terrified. <br>\r\nNaegi noticed a piece of paper that hung from the handlebars and squinted in the darkness to make out what it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motorcycle Milking Cage!!<br>\r\nHello young adventurer it looks like you took a wrong choice on your dungeon crawl and ran into a Bad End! Don't worry though nobodies going to hurt you in fact we're going to make sure that the smile on your face pretty much becomes permanent!<br>\r\nWhat we have here is a situation that you will entirely influence. The device affixed to your precious organ(Kinda small isn't it Naegi? But I guess people have been saying that about you your whole life huh? Upupupu) will only trigger when you move. You might have noticed the attached to your feet and toes. Go on and give them a wiggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi did as instructed and wiggled his toes found that the device clamped to him pumped the length of his shaft roughly. The young Luck turned Rogue and now Victim bit his lip to stifle the moan from the pleasure that went through him at that and the feeling of the motorcycle jolting to life and beginning to roll forwards slowly through the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty neat huh? Now my little moo-cow that will happen anytime you move those precious little peds of yours! As well as your neck, chest, shoulders or really just in general any kind of movement! Probably shouldn't of tested that then since any kind of movement also starts up the motorcycle! Don't worry though the speed's also on the same sensor. Sit still long enough and eventually so will your hog! Squirm in class though and it'll only get worse because if there's one thing your principal hates IT'S FIDGETING MIDGETS!! Upupupu\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bike rolled forwards Naegi noted that it was barely moving at a crawl. \"All I have to do is keep still? Okay that's not that hard\" He thought to himself. That's when the collar on his chest opened a hatch. Makoto looked down to see a tiny feather come out move upwards until it was just pressed into his neck. The feather started to lazily spin in the crook of Naegi's sensitive neck causing him to try and turn away from it. When the motorcycle and feather sped up to accompany the rough pump to his penis, Naegi cursed at having been gotten again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto did not at all hate feeling of the machine. He even somewhat liked the roughness. The appearance of something large in the dark ahead of though brought fresh goosebumps on the boys skin and during the distraction the feather moved to sneak a few feathery kisses to his cute little nose.<br>\r\n\"Heeehhiii noooGAUUHH\"<br>\r\nWith the squirms brought on by the sneak attack came a fresh pump of the boy's organ and an accompanying whole body shudder brought on by the sensation, which of course got Makoto another one for good measure. This time he restrained himself but heard something clicking on the bike which worried him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto couldn't see it but the seat of the bike behind him had just opened twin compartment and was slowly extending twin round brushes under his sensitive armpit hollows. When Makoto did notice this he tried to lean away as best he could from the new torment but once again got another pump of his shaft reminding the young hero of his situation. The brushes slowly whirled to life, stimulating Makoto's cute hairless pits with their stiff bristles forcing his face to break into a gigantic stupid grin. Still he did his best to hold it in and not speed up the motorcycle which at this point was going briskly but not quite speeding along. Makoto could make out the shape in the darkness clearer as they drew closer. He seemed to be speeding towards some kind of giant ball shaped structure. That mischevious feather got the poor boy's nose again this time triggering a worst case scenario for the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh-Hehh-HAACHOO-HAAHHAHeeeee-AGGUAAAHHAH!!\"<br>\r\nThe boy's dam broke with a giggly sneeze which again got his penis a hard pump and got the motor running for the bike as well. Naegi's cute penis throbbed at this point to climax. It was swollen and the tip was glistening with pre-cum that had leaked out despite his efforts. The bike was in a similar situation and was now roaring it's way towards the cage that Naegi could see clearly now through the gloom. It was a large motorcycle cage the likes of which was used in stunt acts but with one very clear difference. The inside of the cage that Naegi could see was blanketed in white. A white that swayed back and forth with the wind. A soft FEATHERY white! Indeed the inside of the cage was lined with millions of stiff white feathers pointing up and seemingly motioning back and forth hungrily for a nice Makoto Naegi to gobble up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of different things at this exact so we'll slow down to explain this since time seem to slowed down in our unlucky hero's mind. <br>\r\nNaegi instinctively tried to yank his feet roughly up from where they were clamped on either side of the bike at the perfect height for a prime feather ravaging, he did this out of fear for what was to come.<br>\r\nThis bit of rashness triggered the pump again and this time he couldn't contain himself. Makoto Naegi ejaculated like a fountain and the hot glob of it sprayed onto the boy's chest. At this point though Naegi's head was swimming and he barely noticed it.<br>\r\nThe sensors attached to Naegi's little toesies suddenly yanked them apart and kept them that way despite Makoto's struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy struggled and pulled despite the quickening of the bike or how the machine was refusing to let his manhood droop. That's because now he felt extremely sensitive all over his body after that orgasm. The brushes teasing his armpits were drawing tears from the boys widening eyes and that pesky feather which had now settled on drilling into his navel, felt as if it could literally kill him with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEH-HAHE-HEEEHLAAHP!! HAHA AHEHANYOHNE! I'LL TAHAKE A MIHIHILLION LAHHAHASHINGS PLEEASE SAVE ME MISS OHOHOGRE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Makoto Naegi the Ultimate Luck in the despair dungeon he was nothing but a thief who had fallen in a trap. In this game mistakes would cost heavily. The motorcycle took off from a ramp towards the case as all through the dungeon the voice of a certain Programmer who had shown his true colors boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S PUNISHMENT TIME!\" Chihiro Fujisaki gleefully yelled into a microphone before his assembled \"assistants\". One of which a young self described \"girl genius with a brain of gold\" drooled in anticipation for what's to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The motorcycle landed heavily in the and to Makoto it was an instantaneous reaction. It was like his feet were plunged into an icy lake that teased and caresssed his soles, toes and tender arches. What it actually was, was a motorcycle cage filled with stiff feathers which as the bike Naegi was bound too roared along inside stroked the bottoms of his soles and sawed between his mechanically separated toes. He twisted and squirmed on the seat like he was being electrocuted while the pumped away at his tender popped manhood priming it to fire once again. On the third rotation around the cage one feather broke lose and wrapped itself around the littlest toe on Makoto's right foot. At this Makoto screamed because his attempts to wiggle it free led once again to the boy going...<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the ticklish teenage thief with the speed the bike had built up at this point due to his attempts to escape, he managed to complete an entire rotation and catch it onto his sweaty cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a never ending assault on the fortress of the lads feet and against the overwhelming force of the million feathers it crumbled just like Makoto on the bike. Unbelievably to the boy a new factor was added, although at this point he was so overloaded with sensations that he barely noticed when the seat started to rumble beneath him with the goal of stimulating his prostate. Even if he was aware Naegi was still a young teen and probably wouldn't know what that was or what it did to him( The one time he came dangerously close to finding out Kyoko and Makoto's sister Komaru had saved him before Nagito had gotten the chance to do what he was planning). All Naegi knew was that now in addition to everything it felt like a warmth was spreading inside him. It moved slowly up through the boys chest towards...<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\n\"GAAUUHHRRpleheeheesestop\" he whispered tiredly to whoever might hear him. Points of white started to form in the corners of his field of vision as he slumped in his bonds. He still twitched and jerked as the motorcycle rolled onwards using bare and ticklish feet as if they were sleds to pull through this powdery white snow but for all intents and purpose it was this third time that the boy had ejaculated when he had lost any strength to struggle. Still though he was furiously pumped by the machine as the motorcycle swirled around the cage at incredible speed. Makoto tried pleading as another glob of his own seed was coaxed out with a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\nIt caught in the tired and abused theif's hair but there was nothing he could do of course. He was limp in his bonds, whispering pleas to the empty torture chamber that he himself couldn't even hear over the roar of his torture device and the thump of the device as it milked him mercilessly. Somebody was listening to him though, an entire room of somebodies watched on screen the cute boy's torments. They'd been invited by Chihiro for what was promised to be an \"Exciting new product\". Now they watched as Makoto Naegi-<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"pleasehehheee noho mohore. Rahantaro,Shuhuhihichi,Na</font>AHHAGITOAAAHH<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHA OFF HE FUCKING GOES AGAIN!!\"<br>\r\n\"Miu like shut-up, it's hard enough to hear him. So just like shove it kay?\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed I must agree with Junko you are being much too lou-\"<br>\r\n\"ALL OF YOU SHOULD SHUT UP!! YOU STUPID OLD BAGS!!\"<br>\r\n\"Nyahaha! Hiyoko is right Miss Celestia, you should be quiet unless you want Atua's wrath. However though Chihiro<br>\r\ndo you not think he has yet had enough?\"<br>\r\n\"Not yet Angie, trust me I'll know when he's had enough and won't let him get hurt.\"the Programmer said reassuring his \"assistants\" to trust him. Meanwhile over his shoulder Makoto Naegi once again went off like a firework inside the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaauuggh!! Pl-please stohop... nohoo more...pleeeheeaase...\"<br>\r\nThe thief was limp in his bonds which at this point served more to keep him from falling off the bike than to restrain him. The teens skin was shiny and sticky with a mixture of his own sweat, ejaculate and drool which had been flowing like a waterfall since somewhere around the third time Mt. Makoto erupted. His head lolled back in exhaustion as his tongue hung out. <br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\nHe went once more triggering a full body shudder which only served to make the motorcycles speed up more. At this point Naegi couldn't even track of when he was upside down,rightside up or completely horizontal. It took a bit for him to register when the voice started trying to get his attention. <br>\r\n\"Naegi don't you want it to end?\" the Ultimate Programmer's voice said throughout the chamber.<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\n\"GAAAHHAHHYUHHHSSS\"<br>\r\nThere was silence on the other end during which Naegi completed nine more rotations of the cage and a pair of soapy brushes was added to scrub roughly at his little pink nipples. When it came back Makoto was back into his daze.<br>\r\n\"What would you do to make it end Naegi?\"<br>\r\n\"Ehehenythahang heeeheeHHAHAA\"<br>\r\n\"Anything meaning what Naegi? What would you do?\"<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\n\"AHHUHUUHgaaaa PLEEHEAASE! PLEEHUHUSE CHIIHEEHEEROO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motorcycle stopped on a dime and released him. He collapsed off the bike and panted heavily as he lay in the field of feathers.<br>\r\nChihiro smirked in the real world as he watched the Ultimate Luck's ruined form desperately try to regain his breath.<br>\r\n\"Well I stopped it for you. So what do you say Naegi?\"<br>\r\n\"Th-tha-thank you Chi-\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Chihiro roared through the chamber causing Naegi to flinch in equal parts surprise and fear.<br>\r\n\"Say thank you master, Naegi. Then stick your penis into that hole at the bottom of the cage.\"<br>\r\n\"Chi-chihiro please just let me ou-out\"<br>\r\n\"DO IT NAEGI!\" The devil yelled into the mic once more, this time punctuating his threat with a rev from the motorcycle which rolled towards Makoto threateningly. Makoto yelped and fell back on his hands and knee's as tendrils emerged from the bike and approached him. Finally with fear in his eyes he plunged his dick into the hole at the bottom of the motorcycle cage and looked fearfully back at the fully throttled torture device which retreated from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Chihiro said sinisterly as the hole shrank magically trapping Makoto's lucky length inside. He experinted gingerly with trying to extract himself until he felt feathers from all directions poke at the trapped organ. He giggled at first but had gone pale at the prospect of what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wai-WAIT CHIHIRO, PLEASE NO!!\"<br>\r\n\"You clearly need more of a lesson Naegi, and this will help you learn it.\"<br>\r\nWith that the feathers inside the hole started to rotate and spin all around Makoto's penis, assaulting it from all directions. Despite himself and his number of ejaculations Naegi found himself once again erect from the attack and once more.....<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\nMakoto bit his lip to try and hold it back but exhausted as he was from his previous trials the dam broke quickly.<br>\r\n\"AGGHHHGUUAGHH HEH-NEEEHEEHHOOOOO,PLEHHHSSEE STOOOHOHOHOPAA!\"<br>\r\n\"Beg me Naegi.\"<br>\r\n\"I AHAAMAAAHAA!! NOOOHHOOO-<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\nGUUAHAHH BEHEHHEEG\"<br>\r\n\"BEG YOUR MASTER NAEGI, ME! BEG ME AND CALL ME YOUR MASTER\"<br>\r\n\"LEHHEET IT OUUUHUHT MAAAHESTER-<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\n-PLEEEHEEHEHS AHHM BEEHEGING\"<br>\r\nMakoto Naegi's penis was trapped in what essentially a blender of feathers. He couldn't pull it out no matter what he tried. They danced all along it's length and all over it's tip as he begged for freedom from the Despair Dungeon. With another full-body shudder he released yet another wave<br>\r\nPOP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start Naegi sat up and banged his head on the glass of the pod. He...he was back?! His pants were soaked through with a mixture of his own juices but- but he was back! He was out!<br>\r\nHe ripped the helmet off of himself as fast as he could but then looked up and froze at the sight. Smiling at him from outside capsule was none other than the same devil that had doomed him and the others to this despair. Chihiro Fujisaki grinned at the terrified Ultimate Luck trapped in the capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it Naegi? Have fun? It's just a prototype but I think that slave-training programs a real winner huh? I never thought you'd have such cute feet. Made for some real competition when it was time to bid for you.\"<br>\r\n\"Chi-chihiro wh-why-\"<br>\r\n\"Motorcycle\"<br>\r\nWith that Naegi went quiet and his expression went dull.<br>\r\n\"BOO-YAH! That hypnosis stuff you put in there worked, Chihiro!\"<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP MIU! He's gone under due to the brainwash so now it's time to give him his orders.\"<br>\r\n''S-so your gonna give him to me right?! I bi-bi-bid the most!''<br>\r\n''Makoto Naegi you will not wake up until I tell you to.When you do wake up you will be terrified of Miu Iruma. You will do whatever she says out of fear of her.''<br>\r\n''YE-YES!''<br>\r\n''Shut up Miu! You will never betray Miu because if you ever do you will end up back here Naegi. Back in the pod and right back on that motorcycle.''<br>\r\nJust at the mention of the word the hypnotized boy shifted uncomfortably.<br>\r\n''At the very mention of the word motorcycle you will remember this situation and be unable to stop your laughter until you..''<br>\r\n''KISS MIU! UNTIL HE KISSES ME!''<br>\r\n''...Until you kiss Miu. Now wake up Naegi you've got a new life ahead of you as a cute little Lucky Lab Assistant.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clap Naegi started to rouse himself but froze in utter fear at the very sight of Miu Iruma the Ultimate Inventor. When Chihiro opened the pod he tried to crawl away from her.<br>\r\n''Quit fucking wasting time short-ass! Out of there already we've got shit to and a few new uniforms for you to try on. Unless you want me to come in there after you? I am feeling a bit frisky after all and there's room for two in there.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that threat Makoto scrambled out of the pod and almost screamed when Miu seized his hand. She led the petrified high-schooler towards the door. <br>\r\n''We're probably going to have to burn those clothes though.'' Miu said as her and her new assistant departed.<br>\r\n''Ye-yes Miu.'' Naegi replied as the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Alright ladies! On with the show!'' </span></div></div>",

You say four but I'm always careful when I count cards and I see only three boys in your game Chihiro\" Celestia Ludenburg the Ultimate Gambler smiled, underneath that smile though she smoldered with rage. She'd had the next highest bid on Naegi and had already been picking out the shoes she'd make him lick for the tests of her skills against his luck when that obnoxious pig Miu had cut in at the last second and undercut her. That was that though and she already had some ways of taking out her anger on Shuichi when she'd slid that bid and bet in. <br>\r\n\"Well you count right Celeste but in exchange for a discount and some new products for her and her new lover boy Miu kindly got us a new contestant in one of the other pods I have set up.

They had currently come to a stop after finding a door. Now though they were baffled by what lay on the other side of said door. Outside of this door inside this dark and gloomy dungeon was a snowy tundra. It seemed to be in the middle of a blizzard but despite the barely clothed aspects of two members of there party it seemed only the slightest bit cold. Faintly they could hear from the other side cries of \"Shuichi! Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that? They sound kind of familiar but I can't really tell who it is.\"<br>\r\n\"IT'S OBVIOUSLY MAKOTO WHY ARE YOU EVEN ASKING RANTARO?!\" Nagito shouted as he shoved both boys aside. He disappeared through the doorway despite Shuichi and Rantaro's best efforts to stop him. They followed him out to try and reason with him only to find that the door had disappeared behind them stranding the three out here. <br>\r\n\"W-where'd it go? stammered Shuichi until Rantaro shushed him.<br>\r\n\"We don't know who or what is out here. The best move is to stay low and quiet until we get a feeling of what this area's like.\"<br>\r\n\"NAEGI WHERE ARE YOU!? COME TOWARDS THE SOUND OF MY VOICE!!\"<br>\r\n\"Nagito! Keep quiet! That could be a trap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET.....GROUND.....UNDER.....ROCKS!\" the voice that had first attracted them called, parts of it's words were lost on the wind though causing puzzled expressions on the party.<br>\r\n\"That's not Makoto. I know that voice though...\" Shuichi struggled to recall the owner of the voice while Nagito plunged on through the deep snow undeterred by his lack of shoes. Rantaro meanwhile still did his best to keep lookout in the storm. He did his best but not even the Ultimate Adventurer's trained eyes would've been able to see the tufts of snow moving towards their group in a blizzard like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito could faintly make out an armored figure in the distance waving to him and motioning towards the large rocks it was standing on.<br>\r\n\"OFF....COMING....HEAR....ON....ROCKS!!\"<br>\r\nNagito motioned that he couldn't understand the figure as it's motions grew increasingly frantic.<br>\r\n\"AHH Keebo? KEEBO IS THAT YOU!?\" Shuichi yelled out on finally recognizing the voice's tone.<br>\r\n\"It's not Naegi?\" Nagito said before spotting one of the bulges in the snow approaching him.<br>\r\n\"GET UP ON THE ROCKS\" yelled Keebo finally close enough to be understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito clambered up onto the rock with Keebo just in time to avoid the hand bursting out of the snow in an attempt to grab him. He stared in shock at the almost translucent hand as it pawed around the edge of the rock before it retreated back into the snow drifts. It took off towards his friend's Shuichi and Rantaro and now that Nagito recognized it's movements he could make out a number of them heading towards them. He waved desperately to his friends for them to hurry as one of the creatures reached Shuichi. The Detective was tripped by something in the snow and went face first into a drift embarrassingly. Then in less than a second felt cold air upon his suddenly bare left foot. That thing had ripped his fur boot right off in seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro wanted to go back for Shuichi but his Adventurer's instincts told him that both of them being stuck wouldn't do anyone any good and pressed on towards the rocks to which he was much closer than Saihara. He ignored a sharp clap on his rear through the snow by one of the hands and focused on trying to clamber up the rocks. The feeling of a pair hands clamping around his ankles and trying to pull him back down made him go pale. When a similar feeling hand raked itself down one of his naked soles he burst into laughter but Nagito and the newly arrived Keebo grabbed him and pulled him up to safety. The hands shrank away toward the form of Shuichi who was struggling in the snow with the pack of hands that had caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being tripped Shuichi had tried to frantically crawl away but a daring hand digging into his buttcheeks with a ticklish clawhold had him spinning around to swat it away.<br>\r\n\"Hahahey! Get off!\"<br>\r\nIf he only knew that that's what the hands wanted more than anything. He resisted the idle twiddles being given to the toes of his bare foot and kept trying to make it to his friends. Keebo had enough and jumped down off the rocks and started running towards his friend in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands had pulled Shuichi flat and twisted his wrists around behind his back, now one of them held them there while the rest of the pack tormented all of Shuichi's pale flesh they could get at. His one shoe clad foot was safe at the moment while he kicked that leg desperately to keep them from pinning it down by the ankle like his other His heels were scratched and his arches stroked.<br>\r\n\"Nohoo faahair\"<br>\r\nHis toes were tweaked and his instep pinched, all while one hand gently stroked along the top of the poor struggling foot like it was comforting a small animal.<br>\r\n\"Cahahaamohn how did thehehy knohohow\"<br>\r\nOne finger pressed firmly into the back of Shuichi's knee making the boy detective squeal it did figure eights in the sensitive area before racing down making the Ultimate's pitch rise and his pleas get less comprehensible.<br>\r\n\"Guhauay's haahaLPPAAHA-EEHHEEHEENOOOO!!\"<br>\r\nShuichi's hips were kneaded like dough while a rhythm developed with his tummy of hard open handed slaps to it then gentle spidered scritches to the sensitively pinkened skin. This continued and with each slap the following tickle felt worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeebo tried to get closer to his friend but found a few of the hands had broken away from the dogpile and pulled at his armored boots he drove them away with his sword but Shuichi's torment continued while his rescuer was harried. A few of the hands played with the sparse amount of hiar in Shuichi's armpits, twirling it around their fingertips while drawing lazily in the hollows to tease the teen. His nipples were pinched and flicked to tense the boy up but some of the hands massaged the shoulders and back of the barbarian to keep him loose in the grip of the others. Ghostly fingers teased Shuichi's ears with gentle tickles and tortured his cheeks with hard pinches (Which cheeks you ask? Why both sets of course!) His navel was excavated by a devious finger and even his cute little button nose wasn't spared. It was painted with light tickles and strokes that served to further agitate the detective in distress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeebo's rescue was halted by the hands coming out in force to defend their prey. Between Keebo's heavy armor and sword swinging skills they were kept at bay but Keebo lost one of his boots in the melee and knew that put him at a major disadvantage to the tactics these creatures favored. He didn't want to leave his friend but if he stayed he'd end up just like him. Keebo's indecisiveness cost him his other boot, as it was snatched right off his foot while he was distracted. He swung his sword and slew the hand responsible but then got grabbed and pulled down into the snow by the hands. He tried to fight his way free until the hands got ahold of his feet and tickling his arches hard and playing amongst his toes. The Ultimate Robot burst into heavy laughter at this and lost his sword in his hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a fireball arced through the sky above and exploded between Keebo and Shuichi. The embers it released on impact drove the hands back in fear. They retreated away from both teens, Shuichi's face was bright red and he struggled to come up with a plan while his head was clear. Nagito launched another fireball spell from the safety of the rocks, landing it neatly in the center of the pack of hands that stood between the two and their friends. Keebo wasted no time in seizing his friend Saihara and throwing him over his shoulder before taking off back towards the safety of the rocks. The hands lingered for a moment before pursuing intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito prepared and launched another fireball but to little effect as it crashed harmlessly away from the hands who were moving to fast for him to target now. Rantaro did his best to cheer the others on and encourage them to move faster but knew that it was all on Keebo now (Who Shuichi and Rantaro both knew wasn't the most athletic type) to carry their friend to safety. The snowy hands literally nipped at Shuichi's heels and pulled his one remaining boot free, leaving both his feet naked in the wind. The ghostly fingertips just grazed Shuichi's soles when Keebo hurled him onto the rocks where Nagito and Rantaro pulled him up. Keebo jumped up shortly behind him  He scrambled before getting pulled up as well by the other three and just out of the grasp of those hands lurking in the snow....</span></div></div>",

HEEEY OVER HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the others saw what the trained eyes of the Ultimate Adventurer had already seen. The lights grew closer in the storm and as they began wave frantically the hands in the snow shrank back from them and eventually fled off into the blizzard. The boy's let out a cheer at that and frantically thanked their rescuers. The group of strange creatures that had saved them beckoned them down off the rocks. They resembled centaurs but with the lower body of a cat. Their upper bodies were heavily muscled yet closely resembled a human female but with six arms rather than the usual two. They seemed friendly enough at the moment as they helped the boy's down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Adventurer went last but his bare foot slipped on the rounded rock and he fell. Luckily one of their rescuers was quick to the Ultimate Adventurer's aid, catching him in her arms and held him bridal style while inspecting him.<br>\r\n\"He-hey thanks for that. That's twice you've saved me now. We really appreciate your help you know.\"<br>\r\nShe looked him up and down in her arms before turning and starting back the way her and her group had come from, still bearing Rantaro in her steel grip. When she did the other Cat-Taur's picked up the rest of the party and started marching on through the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newest addition to the group was the first to break the silence.<br>\r\n\"Ahh thank you. Umm m-my name is K1-B0 bu-but you may call me Keebo!\" His carrier ignored him and instead took an interest in his feet which she had trapped as they moved through the snow. Keebo followed her gaze and flexed his toes shyly at the realization of what had drawn her eye.<br>\r\n\"Ye-yes I lost my boots to the creatures from earlier I'm afraid. I'd actually appreciate it if when we reach your village I could borrow a pair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks again for helping us.\" Rantaro offered to his own carrier.<br>\r\n\"Like you. Want chief to give. Candy taste good.\"<br>\r\n\"I-I don't have any candy.\"<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy have candy. Chief show us. Right here.\"<br>\r\nOne of its fingers poked through Rantaro's thin shirt at his nipple causing him to blush and slap it away.<br>\r\n\"Chief have candy when he first show, tell us way to get more candy. We follow him and he get us candy. Now you here and he say he want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro was filled with questions but saved them as they approached the village. Rantaro only counted a few extra of the cat creatures but was distracted by the one carrying him laying a kiss on his cheek. The boy blushed bright red at this causing the creature to laugh.<br>\r\n\" Chief say bring him green one. We go but others stay.\"<br>\r\nShuichi,Keebo and Nagito were deposited on the ground in the village center rather unceremoniously while Rantaro was born away by his captor. Shuichi scrambled to his feet to try and stop this but found his way blocked by one of the Cat-Taur's. It licked it's lips as it shoved Shuichi back.<br>\r\n\"Chief want green one but me want candy now.\"<br>\r\nShuichi took a step back in fear but still quickly found his wrists seized by the creature. They were yanked above his head roughly to the point where the detective was standing on his tip toes in pain before an extra pair of arms each grabbed ahold of his legs and lifted them into a sitting position.<br>\r\n\"Wa-Wai-WAIT PLEASE NO! LET ME GO!\"<br>\r\nShuichi's pleas fell on deaf ears as the creature head shot forwards and bit down gently but firmly on his left nipple. It trapped the sensitive nub between its sharpened teeth and then began sucking upon the sensitive thing as if it was trying to feed.<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeheeeheeenooooo. Ah! Ahhh tha-that feels s-so weird!!\"<br>\r\nSaihara tried to pull away but the creature responded by pulling him tighter into it's embrace. It released the wet nipple from it's mouth and glared at Shuichi. <br>\r\n\"You try to take away candy? Mine. Candy mine. Maybe you giggle to keep busy.\"<br>\r\nOne of it's hands ran a finger up Shuichi's bare sole and the response was immediate. The detective stiffened up in it's grasp and his ears burned red.<br>\r\n\"Noo-no-no please no. Anything but the giggles pleeehease.\"<br>\r\nAnother pair of hands placed themselves right on Saihara's ribcage. The fingers drummed against them as a reminder to the teen about what resistance would bring. The Cat-Taur's face went right back to Shuichi's nipple this time introducing it's rough cat tongue to the poor little victim. Shuichi's breath caught in his throat stopping the pleas from flowing, and instead giving birth to a sensual moan.<br>\r\n\"Umngghhhhh\"<br>\r\nThe ears of the Cat-Taur pricked at that and the beast smiled.<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy make nice sounds. He like this?\"<br>\r\n\"N-no! No I-I don'! Pl-please stop!\"<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy lies. Like chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Shuichi could ask anymore questions the monster went to peppering his nipples with rough kisses making him bite his lip to keep from singing for the beast again. Nagito in the early stages of Shuichi's trials had lit up a fireball in his hand and made to attack the Cat-Taur that was currently sucking and biting on a hysterical Shuichi's nipples. He was seized quickly by another pair of the monsters who forced him to the ground before pulling him away from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito was taken to a platform with a strange fixture. A large hole stood in the center down which Nagito found his head and upper body forced. With his face inches from the snowy ground he felt two sturdy pieces of wood clamp around his waist, pinning his wrists as well. Nagito found himself suspended upside down under the platform with only the ability to wiggle slightly from side to side. Above him though he felt his pants dragged down to his ankles which were then tied down to stakes. One Cat-Taur then pinched Nagito's bubbly rear and the tribe laughed at how it shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS CANDY-BOY TRY TO HURT TRIBE WITH MAGIC! NOW THIS CANDY-BOY BE TAUGHT LESSON!\" <br>\r\nIt punctuated it's declaration by bringing one of it's hands down hard on Nagito's trapped butt.<br>\r\n\"Ahh! OW! STOP IT-\"<br>\r\nAnother hard slap drowned out the boy with the ringing sound of hard skin to skin contact.<br>\r\n\"OWW-<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nSTOP-<br>\r\nsmack <br>\r\nLET ME OUT-<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nAHHH-<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nDON'T-<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nKEEBO HELP-<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nIT HURTS-<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nI'M SORRY-<br>\r\nsmack <br>\r\nKomaeda's pleas went unheard as the Cat-Taur's gathered around each took turns smacking his trapped butt. The skinny Ultimate's rear was quickly becoming bright red under the assault from the Cat-Taur's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest one of them raised a hand and the others stopped spanking Nagito and looked to it. It placed a hand onto the pale skin of Nagito's ass and lightly scratched at the reddened skin.<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy sorry now? Him sore and sorry?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Veeery sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"You good candy-boy. Let make you say no more ow's and get you giggle instead. We make you beg us to give candy.\"<br>\r\nWith that she skittered her nails over the Ultimate Luck's butt.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha nonononono not that! I don't even have any candy!\"<br>\r\nNagito's bubbly posterior was devoured by eighteen evil hands. They scratched, pinched, rubbed and squeezed every inch of it. <br>\r\n\"EEHEHAHAHASTAAHAP, I-I DOHOHON'T HAHAVE ANY CAHAAHHANDEEHEEHEE-OOHHHNONO NAHAT THAHAT!!\"<br>\r\nOne Cat-Taur had pulled apart Nagito's gorgeous cheeks and sampled the forbidden fruit inside using it's tongue. It was like fireworks going off inside Komaeda's head as she probed around inside there.<br>\r\n\"GROOHOHOSSS!! AHAHAIT FEEHEEELS SOHOHO GROSS!! HEHEHEEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeebo had at first been calmly sitting down when Komaeda's trouble had begun. He was still in awe at his new body. The Ultimate Robot was made to resemble a normal teen in every way except visually. So to now have things like a navel and nipples was an experience. Just to feel the cold wind on his new, sensitive skin sent a shiver through the boy. His ears burned at the idea of what he might get up to if he could slip away for some privacy. He had ears now too! Keebo gave them a exploratory wiggle and failed to notice the Cat-Taur lumber up to beside where he was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Keebo finally noticed it he realized that it was the same one who had carried him to the village and once more it was staring intently and unashamedly at his his feet.<br>\r\n\"Ah h-hello nice to see you. Thank you again for helping us. I shudder to think at what would have happened to us out there if you hadn't happened along.\"<br>\r\n\"You have pretty feet. Want me play with?\"<br>\r\n\"C-c-come again?! Wh-while I thank you for the compliment, I would ra-rather not.\"<br>\r\nKeebo did his best to look at anything but the Cat-Taur in his embarrassment but found a pair of hands seize his face and force him to lock eyes with it. The beasts eye's seemed to to swirl and trap his gaze. Keebo felt his thoughts slip away as the creature held him still. It released him and when it did his arms went to his side limply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to play with pretty feet yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Ye-yes please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cat-Taur placed Keebo's new and very pretty feet up on the log and wiggled his big toes back and forth.<br>\r\nKeebo's hands shot to his mouth as he did a terrible job of trying to muffle his laughter. The Cat-Taur smiled at the fun she would have with this one and trailed a finger up the big beautiful sole turning the Robot the color of a tomato.<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy with pretty feet is gigglish? Him making giggles a lot\"<br>\r\n\"P-possibly, this is all r-rather new to me. I woul-would like to know if I am though and there is no better way to find out than f-f-for you to continue.\"<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy is delightful. Find if such pretty things are gigglish.\" <br>\r\nThis time all six hands came in and seized a toe each in their grasp.<br>\r\nThe creature looked at her hypnotized prey expectantly.<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy is ready?\"<br>\r\n\"R-r-ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite it having been a lengthy journey Rantaro still turned his head towards the distant sound of his friend Keebo's laughter. He worried about what was going on back with his friends as he was carried into the chief's house what he saw inside was...</span></div></div>",

Did these things catch you too?!\" the stunned Adventurer asked still secure in the embrace of the Cat-Taur.<br>\r\n\"Nishishishi they sure did Rantaro. Everything's okay now though.\"<br>\r\nThe Cat-Taur nodded at that statement.<br>\r\n\"Him good chief.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?! YOU'RE THEIR CHIEF?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeeees-\"<br>\r\n\"How did that happen-\"<br>\r\n\"Why big mean Fujisaki tricked me into getting in his smelly old pod and trapped me here. Now I'm brainwashed into wanting nothing more than to tickle you into a giggly mess Rantaro.\"<br>\r\n\"What!? WHY?! Why did Chihiro do this?\" <br>\r\n\"Who knows? All of that was a lie. I volunteered to come in here and chase you guys around. I told Chihiro if he didn't let me I'd tell Mr. Munakata about what's going on in here. He let me in on the fun after that. Help big bro get changed would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cat-Taur suddenly ripped Rantaro's armor and shirt away in a fluid motion. The normally unflappable teen gasped at how suddenly he'd been rendered bare-chested.<br>\r\n\"See I always admired that about you Amami. It was always obvious that you took care of your body but still. Big bro, you are gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro did his best to cover up in the Cat-Taur's grasp not out of embarrassment but more fear in the situation. Ouma had always been a weird kid and bit of a bully to Makoto, Keebo and some others but he'd always seemed quite fond of not only Rantaro but Nagito as well, referring to them as Big Brother despite Rantaro's frequent requests for him not too. Now though Rantaro was seeing a new side of the Ultimate Supreme Leader and he was really regretting all the times he'd chided the boy for calling him, big bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help big brother put on that special outfit I got him then you can go.\"<br>\r\n\"Want candy first.\" the Cat-Taur said visibly angering Kokichi.<br>\r\n\"There's three more you can get your damn candy from out there. I told you this one is mine.\" <br>\r\n\"Like him. Want to taste.\"<br>\r\nKokichi took a step forward balling his fists.<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you like. We had a deal. You all get the other three and I get him.\"<br>\r\n\"Make a new deal? They get others and I take both him and me husband?\"<br>\r\nWith that, she grabbed Kokichi and bent him over then quickly pulled the short teen's pants down and began spanking his bare ass.<br>\r\nAAHH<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nNOO<br>\r\nsmack <br>\r\nWE HAD<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nA DEAL!<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\n\"You me husband that also deal. Mean you belong to me and do what me say\"<br>\r\nOWIIEEE!<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nYOU GOT<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\nMEE!<br>\r\nsmack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the Cat-Taur stopped and pulled Ouma up. She stared at Kokichi who's face was streaming with tears and nose was dribbling as well.<br>\r\n\"What you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"My big bro had a genius plan. Once you were gone and we were alone he was gonna take your husband and escape.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait-WHAT?! KOKICHI I-\"<br>\r\n\"He tries to steal husband from me? Think me dumb?\"<br>\r\nThe Supreme Leader sniffled and nodded sheepishly. He did his best to try and look away but the creature forced him to keep looking it in the eye like a mother punishing a child.<br>\r\n\"He-he said to just trust him. That-that he was smarter than that dummy. BI-BIG BRO I'M SORRY! SHE'S JUST TOO SMART FOR ME!\"<br>\r\n\"WHEN WOULD I HAVE EVEN SAID THESE THINGS?! I JUST GOT HERE!\"<br>\r\n\"Candy-boy quiet now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Cat-Taur pulled Rantaro's pants down as well but instead of spanking the flustered Ultimate Adventurer she lightly began to tickle right under his buttocks where they joined the thigh.<br>\r\nThe response was immediate, Rantaro went wild trying to stop her but within the iron grip of the monster, he could barely move. He beat at her heavily muscled arms but only served to further agitate it enough for another hand to join in and start scratching all over his jiggly and sensitive buttocks.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, Koohokihihshi!\"<br>\r\n\"What else him tell you?\"<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't want me to tell you. He'd get mad if I told you any more of the things he said. Especially about how he was gonna get the straitjacket on you-OOPS! I'M SO SORRY RANTARO!\"<br>\r\n\"Straitjacket? Think you trick me?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ahh hahaha, He's lyihihi-\"<br>\r\nThe Cat-Taur cut Amami off with yet another of its hands joining the fray. Now it idly worked over Rantaro's behind like piano keys taking note of the squeals, gasps, and giggles it could create and what spots on its jiggly playground could make them.<br>\r\n\"AhhHAAheegaha noohoHAheehee KohoKIHHIHcheehee\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Rantaro as long as she doesn't put the straitjacket on you we can escape later.\"<br>\r\n\"Ha chief so bad at lying. Think he so smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fake tears from Kokichi abruptly stopped and a look of confusion overtook his face. When the Cat-Taur brandished a pair of straitjackets the color left both their faces. Rantaro once more went to frantically try to escape as his arms were pulled above his head and fed into the restraints while Kokichi slipped right out of the beasts grasp and took off like a shot for the door. He was reeled in by one of his captive ankles as Rantaro was buckled into his own restraints. The Ultimate Supreme Leader flailed and this time really started crying as he was put into the straitjacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NONONO! YOU WERE ONLY SUPPOSED TO PUT HIM IN A JACKET!! THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANTED! WAAHAHH!!\"<br>\r\n\"Little husband thinks he so smart, think me so dumb. Me see through lies because you so bad at them.\"<br>\r\nKokichi's small frame was flipped upside down so the bottom set of hands working on buckling him into the jacket would be unimpeded, but also so that his feet could be toyed with by the top pair as the beast played with his toes while he fought as hard as he could inside the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little piggy think him so smart. And this little piggie think him run away.\"<br>\r\n\"Nohoooho I'm nohoht smart at all! Stahhahahp WAAAHAHAHAHEEEEHE\"<br>\r\nShe sang along while the upside down delinquent went insane. He shook from side to side and wailed for mercy through tears. He looked up and saw his forced wife holding the next toe and grinning.<br>\r\n\"Ple-please I'm sorr-sorry...I-I-I shouldn't have tried to trick you, mommy.\"<br>\r\nIn the confusion, the bound Rantaro tried to slip away but found himself also pulled right back in with a hand placed on his head as a warning.<br>\r\n\"This little piggy bad at lies. While this little piggy just dumb and this little piggy stay in jacket until him wife get back for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she dropped the blubbering and now jacketed boy and departed leaving both of the bound Ultimates in the house together. When Kokichi worked himself up into a sitting position there was no evidence left on his face of his previous distress save for the tears still shining on his boyish cheeks.<br>\r\n\"So big bro what's your plan to get us out of here.\"<br>\r\nIf looks could kill Kokichi would have been dead right there. He smiled under the other boy's glare and continued on.<br>\r\n\"What? Why are you mad? This is the best situation I could get us with what I had.\"<br>\r\n\"I wonder why I'm mad? Could it be that because of you I just pantsed and tickled by a monster who then put me in a straitjacket?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was trying to get her to only put you in the jacket before she left. That way I could let you out and we could both hide somewhere before she came back.\"<br>\r\n\"What about Keebo and the others then?\"<br>\r\n\"Big bro I can only save who I can. Two of us getting out is better than none and we can't do them any good tied up right next to them.\"<br>\r\n\"So then why even have me put in a straitjacket at all?!\"<br>\r\nKokichi flashed a devious sideways smile and mumbled.<br>\r\n\"Well, when you save a damsel you should at least get a few minutes of playtime as a reward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro lashed out with a kick at Kokichi who flinched back.<br>\r\n\"Heeeyy that's so mean. I was trying to help you know! Don't worry I'll get us out of here!\"<br>\r\n\"Just shut up Kokichi. Why are you even here-AHH\"<br>\r\nRantaro's grumbling was cut short by the feeling of ten little ticklers down his big bare feet. He looked down to see Kokichi still snug in his restraints. A look of confusion colored his face before he was overtaken with silly snorting laughter at yet another surprise attack.<br>\r\nHe looked down to see Kokichi's bubbly little toes wiggling deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't figured it out yet big bro? Why I'm here? I'm part of the game, duh! Chihiro programmed me in to pick on you specifically good looking!\"<br>\r\nRantaro started to back away as best he could in his restraints but Kokichi followed him at a much quicker pace, still, the Supreme Leader left Rantaro enough room to stay free but still herded him towards a corner.<br>\r\n\"You-your saying some really crazy things Kokichi. E-even for you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rantaro when have I or should I say the me that you know ever been known to lie?\"<br>\r\nAmami ran out of room and found himself trapped in the corner with nowhere to go. Kokichi quickly plopped himself down in Rantaro's lap and smiled fiendishly at his nervous \"Big Bro\" who continued to try and reason with what he hoped was his classmate and friend Kokichi Ouma. His tormentor made himself comfortable in Rantaro's lap by lying down and blowing the nervous Adventurer a kiss. He then rolled over onto his belly and approached Rantaro's big beautiful feet with a hungry look on his almost demonic face. He looked back at his classmate and smiled before turning back and wrapping his lips around Rantaro's big toe and letting out a long and drawn out-\"SLLLUUUURRRPPP\". The smiles on both his struggling face and the maybe Kokichi's ecstatic one seemed to threaten to split the top's of their heads. Rantaro Amami was choking back snorting laughter as Ouma started to nip at his struggling toes he continued to try and reason with him.<br>\r\nKo-kokichihi *snort* stahap-we neeheed to gehehet-SNNRRK-ohohout...</span></div></div>",

She could be back any second so we've gotta be quick if I'm gonna help the others.\"<br>\r\nOuma's toes dug into Rantaro's big defenseless soles as the little sneak chided him like he was the one at fault here.<br>\r\n\"What?! hahaha thehen just lehehet me gohoho...\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly big bro I've wanted to have you all to myself like this for a long time. Just the two of us with no chance of someone spoiling the moment.\"<br>\r\n\"You juhuhst said-heeheehee she could beheheeha back any minute\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she and those other monsters will be busy with Nagito and the others for a while. I mean have you seen how red Saihara can get when you tickle him? It takes somebody better than me to not just see if you can make him pop! Anyways I've thought about this for a long time big bro. N-not in a weird way though. Your always so nice to everyone and me and I can't stand that! I want you to be nice to JUST ME! Remember that one story you told me about Italy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kokichi was rambling his toes had calmed down a bit on the big feet of the Ultimate Adventurer. He'd been repeatedly digging his little nails into the plump heels and dragging them up into the sensitive toe forest where they'd been running wild driving his big bro mad. When he asked Rantaro the question though they'd slowed down to now simply stroking his little toes along the side of Rantaro's foot.<br>\r\n\"Kokichi st-hehe-stop it.\"<br>\r\n\"No for real and not a lie. Do you remember telling me that one?! I guess Shuichi and Kiyo were there too but me is all I care about!\"<br>\r\n\"I re-remember it s-sure heeheehe. Kokichi gehet off.\"<br>\r\n\"Awww but I'm so comfortable here and if you don't like it then why are you smiling?\"<br>\r\n\"Heehehe because of that tihihihiHIHICKLES?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi went in for another dig between Amami's toes and easily avoided Rantaro's clumsy attempt to entangle his legs with his own.<br>\r\n\"Nishihihi you'd think an Adventurer would be more flexible and light on his feet.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you so good at thahat heeheehahaha??\"<br>\r\n\"Me and Angie used to practice at lunch.  I tried to play footsies with her one time and she turned that around quick and tortured me for a whole period. After that, I asked her to teach me in exchange for listening to her ramble about Atua.\"<br>\r\n\"Kokichi let me out so we ca-can help the others!\"<br>\r\n\"Nah. I want to help the others. I really do but I'm looking at the long-term here. Do you know what the point of this place is? Why little mister Fujisaki has you in here?\"<br>\r\n\"Mi-mister?\"<br>\r\n\"He's a guy you didn't know that? Got that info out of Makoto and let me tell you it wasn't easy. I almost had to tickle him for a whole day just to get that out of him and it wasn't even what I wanted to know. Of course, Kyoko had to come to spoil the fun after that. I never did find out where Makoto's worst spot was...\"<br>\r\nKokichi pouted as he snuggled in beside Rantaro in the corner. He looked up at the stern look Rantaro was shooting and responded with his trademark huge smile as he continued both his explanation and the nuzzling of Rantaro's feet with his own. <br>\r\n\"It's like I was saying, bro, I do want to help the others just like you but the best way to help them is with some good leadership. You guys already blew it and Naegi paid the price for that.\"<br>\r\n\"Wai-wait what? What happened to Makoto? Wh-what are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you wouldn't know about that either huh? Chihiro that enterprising little sneak set this whole thing up to get you four in this program to give you guys brains all a good scrubbing. Ooooh, how would those feet of yours like that?! It shouldn't be too hard to convince those stupid cats to bring in some soap and water...\"<br>\r\n\"Why would Chihiro do that?!\"<br>\r\n\"For money duh. Do you know how much a nice blank slate of an Ultimate would sell for? A whole lot. Even a lame talent like Naegi's Luck. That's why when you guys left him alone the program tortured him till he broke and begged for a brainwash.\"<br>\r\n\"What happened to him?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well big bro there not gonna hurt you guys in here obviously so they tortured him with tickles and stimulation. A long story short they milked Makoto. The last I saw of him Miu had bought him for use as a lab monkey I mean assistant...although I've never seen an assistant have to clean there bosses feet with their tongue...oooh Rantaro you wanna do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi had snuggled even closer in with Amami to the point that he was now basically sitting in the older boys lap. His fingers spider tickled along the Adventurer's neck while the bound teen still tried to question him.<br>\r\n\"Kokichi quihit it. So why are you in here then?! Heheheeha stahap it!\"<br>\r\n\"What a stupid question.\"  The Ultimate Supreme Leader as he tickled the straitjacket trapped Rantaro's chin with his fingers. \"The same reason as you! Chihiro wants to break my brain and sell me off to one of the many people who would just love to own a Supreme Leader of evil like myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Thehen why aren't you helping us?!\"<br>\r\nKokichi lay back and smiled as he pulled Rantaro's feet close to his face and sniffed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys need leadership. Specifically my leadership. Keebo will do whatever I tell him and Nagito will play along if he thinks there's a chance he can get Makoto back. Shuichi might be a problem but he's smart enough that when he realizes I'm his best chance he'll go along without a fight. Then following my lead we'll get out of here by doing the one thing I excel at the most. Annoying people. See if this takes too long I know that Junko and the others are gonna get impatient-\"<br>\r\n\"Jun-Junko?!\"<br>\r\nKokichi frowned at the interruption from big bro and suddenly bit Rantaro's big toe as a way of punishment. Predictably Rantaro went red in the face and started sputtering trying to hold back the laughter. Kokichi smiled at that. \"Don't interrupt its rude.\" he chided before continuing his explanation.<br>\r\n\"Anyway yeah as I was saying Junko, Celeste and a whole bunch of others are out there watching us and I'd bet money that if we stall long enough they'll get bored and jam Fujisaki in here with us. Chihiro is smart enough to realize that too of course so he's probably got some kind of back door to get out which we'll follow him through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough that entire statement, Rantaro Amami had barely managed to follow along because of how Kokichi was sneaking little kisses and licks onto his soles getting him flustered and was now full on digging his manicured nails into the big soft feet in celebration of his genius plan.<br>\r\n\"THEHEHEN WHY ARE YO-HAHAHEEHA- TICKLING MEHEHE-OHHAHHAHOHEEHEE?!\"<br>\r\n\"Your the only one that I'm not totally sure I could get to obey me Rantaro! If you're around questioning me then that'd be really bad. See the others will listen to me and do what I say but just barely. Let's say we have to leave someone behind or all end up caught. I wouldn't hesitate to leave you. The others wouldn't be so quick to leave and you'd disagree with me trying to convince them to stay and help that person.\"<br>\r\n\"We left Naegi behind and look what happened to him Kokichi!\"<br>\r\n\"EXACTLY BIG BRO!\"<br>\r\nKokichi congratulated his captive with a long and slow lick up the beautiful foot he'd been snuggling with.<br>\r\nRantaro stared at the ceiling as tears pricked in the corners of his eyes and he tried to hold in the laughter.<br>\r\n\"YOU'D NEVER LEAVE SOMEONE BEHIND! EVEN SOMEBODY LIKE ME YOU'D CONVINCE THE GROUP TO TRY AND SAVE AND THEY'D LISTEN CAUSE OF HOW GREAT A LEADER YOU ARE! That's why you have to go.\"<br>\r\nKokichi smiled wide and began devouring Rantaro's feet and toes, his own wiggling with devilish glee right in front of Amami's face. Kisses, licks, nibbles, and nuzzling were rained upon the battlefield of Rantaro Amami's feet.<br>\r\n\"See Rantaro-*lick*\"<br>\r\n\"Ahagha noooo-\"<br>\r\n\"Chihiro's smart-*lick*\"<br>\r\n\"Nonono stahap doing that Kohokichi!\"<br>\r\n\"He'd know you wouldn't let them leave somebody and that's how he'd get you-*Kisses to the toes*<br>\r\n\" Pleeheease...\"<br>\r\n\"You'd all get caught and getting your brains tickled out. *Nibble the heel*\"<br>\r\n\"Lihihike this you meeheean?!\"<br>\r\n\"Nono Rantaro. Makoto was bright red when he got out and could barely breathe. I'm going easy compared to what he got.*Nuzzles the feet*\"<br>\r\n\"He-hahe waihaht how-how did you get out of the straitjacket?!\"<br>\r\n\"Rantaro I've gotten out of dozens of straitjackets in my life. That was easy. I'd love if you listened to me Rantaro I really would. Then I could let you out of the jacket and we could go and save them-\" *Twiddles the toes*<br>\r\n\"AHAHA-NONOHOHO-THEN LEHET'S DOHO THAHAT JAHST STAHAHP!!\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmm maybe...You gotta show me that you get it and know that not only am I the boss but that I might as well own you.\"<br>\r\n\"Ahhha hahaha Kokichi...\"<br>\r\n\"Tick-tock Rantaro I can hear her coming back. Don't think I won't leave you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi rearranged himself and placed his arms seemingly back into the jacket. He snuggled up in Rantaro's lap and smiled up at the Adventurer.<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kokichi smiled clownishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhh, you got some balls talking back to me in this position!\" He eyed Rantaro's feet again. His aura changed to that of a kid who had his toy taken away. \"Aww... look at me, spending all this time talking when I could have your toes in my mouth. You know how lack-toes intolerant I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi! This is no time for jo-hohohohokes!\" The small boy looked up from his position by his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, are you gonna be like one of those nurses with no sense of humor...?\" Kokichi then grinned impishly. \"Too bad! Cause it looks like I'm the nurse now, and I say it's a perfect time for jokes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had mentioned getting out of straitjackets before, and now he was mentioning nurses as though he'd himself been a mental patient. Well, that didn't surprise Rantaro one bit. The question was, how does one handle a difficult, mischievous mental patient like Kokichi? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to appeal to his childish side. <br>\r\n\"Kokichi, listen. When we get out of here, I'll buy you all the candy you want and let you watch any cartoon you want. Then we can go adventuring around the world together. Won't that be fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neeheehee! Sure sounds like it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro gave the boy a defiant glare. \"But I'm in charge. I make the plan to save everyone and you have to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Kokichi put a finger by his lips, considering. \"Candy and cartoons? And around the world adventure? But I already get those things when I'm with my organization. What else you got...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro thought about it; he had to think fast! \"Your parents! You haven't seen them in a while due to being in a mental hospital! You could see them again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kokichi reeled and he looked horrified. \"No! No, anything but that, please!\" He started trembling and his face went paler than it usually was. Rantaro was surprised when the boy started crying. Those were genuine tears of distress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no! Don't do that! I'll be good! No, no, no, no, no!\" He closed his eyes and shook his head. It was painful watching the boy in this state. Rantaro shed some tears as well as Kokichi cried in distress. Minutes passed, and no one came into the room. (So he'd been bluffing about that.) Then, Kokichi had meant what he said earlier about the Cat-Taurs being busy with the other prisoners. It was rather distressing being alone with a crying peer you'd accidentally triggered. If Rantaro had his hands free he would have reached out to comfort the boy. As it was, all he could do was wait. Finally, Kokichi composed himself. \"I-I'm sorry... I'm sorry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up, and saw Rantaro. Narrowing his eyes at him, he spoke in a hoarse voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you're in charge. J-Just don't give me back to them, please...\" Kokichi hated how weak he sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't,\" he promised, inwardly hating Kokichi's parents. Whatever they'd done to him had severely messed him up, making them the most likely cause of Kokichi's mental hospital stay. He hated child abusers with all his heart. He might have to pay a visit to their house or jail cell later though, to have a \"word\" with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\" Rantaro said. Kokichi undid the boy's straitjacket clumsily. Finally, he was free. Kokichi muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever your plan is, it had better be good!\"</span></div></div>",

After he was done, the boy nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi was still tired from the crying, but he knew he could pull this off! The two snuck along the cave walls to find Kiibo. It got darker the deeper they went; the cave walls lit by candles. Curiosity peaked Kokichi. He loved playing with candle wax. He dipped his fingers into the wax. It was lukewarm, the perfect temperature. The wax hardened around the boy's fingers. Then he skipped over to Rantaro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guess what?\" he whispered. Mischievously, he slid his new finger-caps along the back of the boy's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahh!\" Rantaro screeched, startled. He turned around angrily. \"Kokichi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waxy fingers!\" he grinned childishly, wiggling them in front of his face. \"Nee-heeheehee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more serious!\" Rantaro warned. \"You don't want us to get caught!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sowwy,\" Kokichi pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked for a while through the cave. Things were taking too long, and Kokichi started whining that he was bored. Rantaro shushed him and said they were almost there. The boys listened and heard a faint laughing in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kiibo was ticklish to bodily repairs as a robot, he was <i>super</i> ticklish as a human in a virtual program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like they'd been at it for a while. His breath came in airy and light, not enough energy to still be frantic, and his normally pale skin was now reddened from the sensations. He'd been strapped into foot stocks and had his shirt, socks, and shoes removed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single woman rested by his feet, brushing them with bristly hairbrushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll poor Kiibo could do was laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHHAA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro hid behind a rock. Kokichi smirked. And now to divert the Cat-Taur's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ugly! Over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the woman turned around, he sprinted away. She growled and followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro then ran over to Kiibo and picked the lock of the stocks. (Kokichi had taught him how.) Kiibo was quite winded. He didn't realize he'd been rescued until he felt himself being picked up. Registering who it was, Kiibo breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you managed to escape. How is that possible?\" Rantaro kept it short and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi. He's on our side. We thought up a plan to free everyone, but it's a bit sporadic. The idea is to catch everyone off guard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly explained the plan to Kiibo. Kiibo was worried about Kokichi, but Rantaro said part of the plan was to lose the Cat-taur in the darkest parts of the tunnels. If Kokichi isn't back by the time they rescue Shuichi, they'll go back and rescue him. Kiibo nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan. Now then, off to save Shuichi!\" </span></div></div>",

He had two Cat-Taurs attacking him currently, one spidering her fingers along his neck, and the other going along his ribs. A third should be there, Kiibo thought, but maybe she left to get more tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA! BAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tried to beg, but his laughter was too strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro looked at Kiibo, nodding to give him the signal. Kiibo looked ahead and saw three tunnels leading away from this one. He had to make sure not to lead the ladies to Nagito's chamber by accident. His night vision activated, and he zoomed in on the three tunnels (somehow the program had let him keep his robo-functions, even though he appeared human). Concluding that Nagito was kept in the middle tunnel, Kiibo took a rock and threw it into the left tunnel. The two Cat-Taurs looked up, wondering what could have made the noise. They stood up and went to investigate. As soon as they left the chamber, Kiibo ran over to Shuichi. He used his heat vision to melt the metal bonds that held the boy. Rantaro untied his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... You guys came just in t-time...\" Shuichi said. Another minute, and he felt he would be done for! He rubbed different body parts to try and make the tingling go away. Kiibo scooped up the boy effortlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we need to hurry and save Nagito!\" he pointed to the middle tunnel. Not wanting to waste time, Kiibo carried Shuichi to the other room instead of waiting for him to recover. Rantaro followed behind closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito was in an arguably worse position, with two Cat-Taurs by his feet and one teasing his upper body mercilessly. They decided to give him a short break so he could beg. After all, they did find his begging adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please! Stop... Ahahaha... N-no more... Hahah...\" His face was flushed as he continued. \"A-after all... W-why waste time on a piece of trash like me...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladies smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trash boy cute. Handsome.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito didn't know how to respond. He hadn't gotten many compliments in his life. His face remained flushed as he caught his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the second Cat-taur said. \"Break over!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one scribbled her nails over his belly, while the other scritch-scratched along the arches of his feet. Nagito lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAA! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the lights went out. The Cat-Taurs were confused. They searched along the walls for the candles and torches. But when they finally found and re-lit them, Nagito was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Kiibo said to Rantaro as the boys made their escape. While he carried Shuichi, Rantaro carried Nagito. \"I looked and saw that the right tunnel leads out of here. That'll be our escape route!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We'll save Makoto once we're out of here.\" Rantaro replied. \"But first, we need to meet up with Kokichi! He helped me escape, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell? Has Kokichi returned... or has he been caught...? </span></div></div>",

Kokichi's laughter went silent. He couldn't take this! Why, why, why, why, why?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sister by his feet decided his feet were clean enough, she changed positions and went to his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know bellybutton dirtiest part of the body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kokichi had heard her, he didn't reply. He knew what was coming. She took the baby oil bottle and dumped some in his navel. Then she took a Q-tip and began cleaning it. This made the boy jerk and shed more hysterical tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHHAHAA! HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the woman was done, she used her finger to clean out the excess, swirling more than necessary, leaving Kokichi a giggling wreck. The other sister switched positions and tickled his neck, making him scrunch his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHP! AHAHAHHAHHAHAAHHAAHA! PLEHEHEHEHEHEHEEHEASE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torture felt like it had gone on for more than ten minutes. The only time he'd been tickled this much had been in a huge tickle fight with his organization. And they'd listened when he begged them to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi was exhausted. The two had decided he'd had enough, but promised they'd be back tomorrow, after they got some rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rantaro... please don't forget me....\" he muttered as he closed his eyes, ready to fall into the world of dreams. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rantaro watched the two Cat-taurs leave the room, and saw Kokichi tied to the ground. He heard what Kokichi said. Tiptoeing to his side, Rantaro bent down and started untying the ropes that bound him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't forgotten you, don't worry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi wasn't sure if he was dreaming. So he just laid back and smiled. Rantaro held the boy close and carried him out of there. At least that was over with, Kokichi thought. And it was far from the worst thing that happened to him. <i>The worst thing that happened... </i>He suddenly became really sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rantaro...\" the boy muttered against his shoulder. He may have been a bit delirious. \"I'm sorry I never told you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About my parents... and the way they hurt me... They molested me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro stopped, and examined the boy's face, looking for any sign of a joke or lie. He was dead serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I should have told the cops right away. But it wasn't all painful. Th-they made me feel... special.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy started crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wasn't special! I-I was b-boring...\" he wiped his tears away, only for more to take their place. \"They easily forgot about me and moved on to some other kid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs horrifying as that was, Rantaro listened and let him finish the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kid's parents told the cops and got my parents arrested. I hated him for that then, b-but he did the right thing. I-I didn't want them to hurt me anymore, I wanted them to love me! But I g-guess who I thought they were was a lie... I-I was born of two big fat liars!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did explain a lot... Why Kokichi hated liars despite being one himself, why he didn't want to be seen as boring, why he didn't try to get close to people, his time at the mental hospital, and why he wanted a big brother figure to protect him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we get out of here, I'm going to go to that prison and beat them up.\" Rantaro swore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...?\" Kokichi wiped his tears away. \"B-big bro cares about me that much...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, he didn't think Rantaro would believe someone like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" He held the boy close. He was a professional big brother after all. And if some bastard hurt a single one of his little sisters, he'd feel the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, big bro...\" Kokichi muttered, and then he drifted off into dream-world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro caught up with the others, who were waiting by a cave wall. He held Kokichi in his arms. Poor guy was all tuckered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you saved him. And now on to save Makoto!\" Shuichi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro couldn't help think about Kokichi and what he'd confided to him. To have gone through all that, and still conduct himself with charisma and confidence... Putting on a fake smile... Being okay with being hated so long as others didn't get hurt... The boy was a mystery, but now that all the pieces were coming together, Rantaro thought he liked Kokichi. He did care deep down, and deep <i>deep</i> down he wanted others to care for him. He just didn't want to get hurt anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing the boy's bangs out of his eyes, Rantaro kissed Kokichi on the forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll protect you from now on, little bro. You can count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro noticed the others were speaking, thinking of a plan to escape the caves and find Makoto, so he listened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they all knew what to do, they marched onwards through the darkness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shining his high beams into the darkness, Kiibo found the path that led out of the caves. With each step, everyone got closer and closer to freedom. But before they could take a step outside, a pink creature flew in front of them and screeched! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fluffy pink Pterodactyl! Not as ugly as Kiibo thought an ancient creature should be. Other than the obnoxious shade of pink, this one looked rather youthful. The top of its head looked less pink and more blonde. It had piercing blue-green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This creature looks kind of familiar!\" Shuichi said. Kokichi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reminds me a little of someone we know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a screech, and the boys backed away. Was the creature dangerous...? It seemed that way! They were going to need to think of a plan, and fast! While the other boys were deep in thought, Kokichi pulled himself out of Rantaro's arms. He started walking toward the creature. Rantaro started to move to pull him back, but Kokichi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I know what I'm doing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to the creature and grinned. She gave him a confused look. He put one hand on his hip and the other hand brought a finger to his lips. Putting on his innocent, clueless persona, he tipped his head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Miu, I didn't know you wanted to be a bird! I mean, I knew you were a bird-brain, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screeched and dove towards him. But before she could do anything, she fell to the ground. The other boys almost did a double take with how fast it happened. Kokichi had made his move. The Miu-dactyl was getting her belly rubbed, and was chirping excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a hunch this would work as soon as I figured out who it was!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys nodded, dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way to the exit, they were stopped in their tracks. Before them stood Makoto, dead eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Mmmm...\" Miu said, trying to ignore the belly rubs. \"You have to... mmm... get past him if you... ahhhh... want to get out! And I t-trained him not to show any m-mercy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto had his arms raised in a battle pose. Everyone gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him?!\" Shuichi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brainwashed.\" Rantaro said, simply. \"Kokichi told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're just going to have to un-brainwash him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged for the exit but Makoto saw and grabbed him, throwing him to the back of the cave wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that!\" Kokichi said. \"Someone's going to need to distract him while someone else makes a break for it. Trust me, I saw a couple movies like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi got up and looked to the others. Hesitantly, they nodded. \"Okay. But who's going to be the bait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we put it to a vote!\" Kokichi grinned. With the dirty looks he got from the others, it was clear they were going to vote for him. Rantaro simply couldn't let that happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I-I'll do it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rantaro... You'll be the bait?\" Kokichi said seriously. The boy nodded. Kokichi waited a second, and then shuffled around in his inventory, finding a pair of black calf-high boots. \"Put these on. They'll protect your feet in case Makoto decides to fight dirty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated. Kokichi was giving him a gift that could benefit him? It seemed too good to be true. But then again, Kokichi had been nicer to him recently. Should he accept the boy's gift?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you still don't trust me, big bro...? I wouldn't give this gift to anyone else in case you're wondering. Now hurry up! Put them on or you won't be protected!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be a trap that gives him a worse torture than Makoto ever could. Or, Kokichi could be telling the truth and it <i>would</i> protect him from the ordeal. What should Rantaro do...? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rantaro paused to think, running a hand through his straight blond hair with a green tint. It felt like everything hinged on this plan working out. He wanted to make the right decision, or else he'd be in deep trouble. Finally, he took a deep breath and a leap of faith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Kokichi. I'll trust you.\" Rantaro could have sworn he saw the boy's eyes brighten for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi grinned as Rantaro slipped the boots on. As soon as they were on, they tightened around his feet. Panicking, Rantaro tried to slip them off, but found he couldn't. They were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh! What's happened? Kokichi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, big bro! That's just the boots' mechanism for keeping your feet safe! Makoto won't be able to remove them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I</i> can't even remove them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! You're 100% safe for the rest of the game!\" Kokichi's happy demeanor changed and he started to whine. \"Now come on and fight him already..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro took a deep breath, filling his lungs with dank cave air. He was scared. He could do this. Don't panic, he reminded himself, just go! Stepping up to Makoto, he got ready to show off some martial arts skills. Makoto stood there dead eyed, but lifted his arms in preparation to fight. It was easy to block his attacks at first, but being worn down after the first minute did a number on his reflexes. Rantaro got tired, but Makoto was strong as ever. Despite this, Rantaro kept going. Makoto tried to fight dirty at one point, but he couldn't take the boots off, like Kokichi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ha!' Rantaro thought. 'Checkmate!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went for Makoto's underarms, tickling him effectively. The boy faltered, but didn't laugh. The others, minus Kokichi, seeing that they had a clear path, bolted for the exit. All of them made it successfully. Kokichi stayed with the Miu-dactyl, still rubbing her belly. It looked as though she was satisfied. But then things took a turn for the worse. Makoto grabbed Rantaro around the waist and tickled him there, turning the tables, making Rantaro struggle all while giggling up a storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MaahahaahhaaAAKOHOHOHOHOHTOOO!! STAHAAHAHAHAHAA- R-AAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA REMEMBER WH-WHO Y-YOU WERE BEFORE!! PAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHA! PLEEEEHEEEHEHEHEHEHHEHEASE! YOU CAN DOHOHOHOHOHOHO IT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's eyes remained blank. He continued following orders, going through the motions he was commanded to. It looked like Rantaro was doomed. Meanwhile, Kokichi got distracted by watching Rantaro and forgot to continue the belly rubs. Miu screeched and snapped at him. In fear, the boy doubled back, letting out a terrified shriek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi!\" Fearing his little brother was in danger, Rantaro summoned his hidden power and executed a perfect uppercut to Makoto's jaw, knocking him out. He ran over to find Miu standing over Kokichi, the boy faltering, probably afraid of her sharp beak. Miu grinned evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what we're going to do to you, little traitor?! When I take you back through the caves, you're going to face your own brutal brainwashing experience! A-ha-ha! And I think we might even bring in two special guests, a man and a woman. You might know these fuckers. They look so much like you! Maybe they're in prison now, but bringing them into virtual reality would be no problem at all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no!\" He noticeably trembled. It took all he had to prevent himself from having a panic attack. He backed up against a wall... Closing his eyes, he prepared to fight or die trying. Nothing happened. Instead there was some yelling and screeching, the sound of wings flapping off, and then Rantaro's calming voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Opening his eyes, Kokichi saw Rantaro standing over him, hand outstretched. Putting a hand to his face, Kokichi realized there were tears running down his cheeks. He took Rantaro's hand and let the boy help him up. \"I'm here... I won't let anyone hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi wrapped Rantaro in a tight hug, crying uncontrollably into his vestments. After a few minutes, he calmed and could breathe normally again. All the while Rantaro held him and didn't say a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kokichi felt safe again, the two decided on what to do with Makoto. They decided to both carry him from one end, and bring him out of the caves. Whatever awaited them on the other side, they were ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright light, and then darkness. Their eyes adjusted, and they noticed a \"Congratulations, you win!\" screen with a happy face and virtual fireworks going off. Then they woke up in the virtual pods they were placed in at the beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. We did it. We actually beat the game!\" Rantaro cheered. Everyone clapped and congratulated themselves. They helped Rantaro out of his pod. Then he helped Kokichi out of his. Curious as to what had happened while he was still in the game, Rantaro inquired about it. So they told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko was the mastermind of this whole operation. After escaping the game, Shuichi with the help of Kyoko had discovered her location, and reported it to the cops. His own father ended up arresting her. She'd brainwashed Chihiro first, and ordered him to write the virtual world code so she could use it to ensnare Ultimates and turn them into slaves. With no Ultimates around to stop her, she'd be free to rule the world as she pleased. And besides, doesn't it just fill you with despair to be tickled until you lose your mind...? It would be a win-win situation for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko helped Makoto out of his pod, noticing he was still dead-eyed. She held him in her arms. She wished she could have been there and saved him before things got this far. Kokichi offered up a solution. But nobody wanted to listen to someone like him. So Kokichi whispered his idea in Rantaro's ear. Rantaro said, \"Hey, I have an idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing what Kokichi said, he took a golden pocket watch and swung it back and forth in front of Makoto's eyes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are getting very sleepy... Your eyelids are getting very heavy... Okay. Now, when I snap my fingers, you're going to remember who you were and regain all your memories from before your torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers. Makoto woke with a start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys? Where am I; what's going on...?\" He was more confused when everyone started cheering. They said they'd explain it all to him later. They were just too happy right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rantaro brought Makoto back to normal, he wondered if he could bring Chihiro and Miu back as well. Surely it was worth a shot. It wasn't long before the other two were de-brainwashed as well. Everyone rejoiced and hugged. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright morning. Kokichi was on a white modern-day ship with Rantaro. They were about to set sail on an adventure mission to help find Rantaro's long lost sister! Kokichi had brought old timey maps and adventure gear, which he kept in his backpack. Each boy wore a white t-shirt along with swim trunks and sandals. Rantaro's swimsuit had green and blue waves, while Kokichi's had yellow and orange ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So little brother, before we set sail, I have a few questions for you. And you'd better answer honestly or the tickle snake's gonna get you!\" He put his hand in a position to make it look somewhat like a snake's mouth, opening and closing it 'threateningly'. Kokichi 'eep!'d and Rantaro chuckled. \"First question: What's your backstory with DICE? Who even are they...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi giggled at the thought of the snake. Then he became serious, letting the memories flow back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're my true family, unlike those traitors I lived with for 11 years... And it's funny... after my parents hurt me, and I was sent to a mental hospital, I didn't think I'd trust anyone ever again. I was hurting really badly... I self-harmed on a daily basis. Everything seemed to go in a downward spiral. I hated myself, and thought I was weak, pathetic, and disgusting. I didn't think someone like me deserved friends. The doctors worried that I wasn't going to make it... That's when nurse Mikan came in. She talked to me while I was in that mental state and became my first friend. At first I was defensive, wondering why anyone would want to be my friend after what happened. Repeating what her own doctor had told her, she said it wasn't my fault. I wanted to believe her, but I couldn't just yet. She also had problems with her self-esteem that her doctor was helping her with. And she urged me to reach out to people. I don't think I'd have made it this far, if not for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My second friend was maid Kirumi. I met her while she was vacuuming the facility. She's really nice and kind, like a real mom should be. Over time, my mental state improved, and I learned to smile again. I still think of her as my true mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I met a group of people at the lunchroom table. They seemed kind of like outcasts and misfits, and they all wore sad frowns. It bothered me that whenever I saw them, they never smiled. That's when I decided that my duty would be to make these people smile! I reached out to them. And let me tell you, that was the best decision of my life! Thanks to my leadership skills, those misfits and I banded together to create hilarious pranks and jokes to entertain ourselves and others! And the more time I spent with them, the less sad I was, too. I stopped self-harming. I told my psychiatrist about them, and he agreed it was a good idea to be friends with them. One day, I confided in them what my parents had done. I expected them to be disgusted with me and push me away, but they understood and comforted me. Everything hurt, but they told me it wasn't my fault. And the more they said it, the more I wanted to believe them. For the first time, I felt sure the love they had for me wasn't a lie. And that was the moment that I knew they were my true family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know I'd do anything for them, right? Well, Junko manipulated me. She told me she'd captured them and would hurt them unless I played her stupid virtual game. Ugh, it was so boring! ...Until I met you. Getting to tickle you was the only good part, heh. After Junko was arrested, Kyoko and Shuichi found them locked in a cage. They were all okay, thank goodness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro patted his back. They stayed in silence a while, the splash of the waves against the boat and the caw of seagulls were the only sounds they heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways...\" Kokichi continued. \"DICE and I all live together under one roof now. And no, it's not at the asylum. The oldest of my crew bought a house and adopted all of us legally! We call our place \"DICE headquarters.\" And hey, you're always welcome for a visit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi... that's really sweet. I'd love to. But there's one other thing I don't understand. If you're really nice deep down, why did you act so rude when we first met...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that had to do with bullies... When I went back to public school, 90% of the students would purposefully try and trigger me, or laugh when someone did, and it just went to show that 'sane' people could be the cruellest of all. That's why I didn't know if I could trust you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi...\" he reached out to the boy, who leaped into his arms, wrapping his arms and legs around him like a monkey. Rantaro lightly hugged him back. The boy made a satisfied cat-like sound. Kokichi looked up at Rantaro with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now that I know you're nice, I don't have to worry anymore! Cause I know you'll protect me from bullies and stand up for me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Rantaro said. He may not like confrontations, but he knew if anyone tried to hurt his precious brother, they'd be sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love ya, big bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Kokichi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed in silence a while, alone with their thoughts. Kokichi climbed down off of Rantaro, deciding instead to lounge in a folding chair. He made some raspberry lemonade for both himself and Rantaro, and poured two glasses full. Slipping on some sunglasses, Kokichi inserted a straw into the drink and took a sip. Rantaro sat beside him and took the other glass, helping himself, not even bothering with a straw. Idly, Kokichi thought of his other friends and came up with a new pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I wish our other friends from the Sim could join us... Then I could help myself to some Nagi-toes!\" He flashed a big grin. Rantaro rolled his eyes. \"Nee-hee-hee!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, you're going to get it!\" Rantaro showed Kokichi the 'tickle snake' clearly so he knew what was to come. Then it attacked! Hysterical, childlike laughter filled the air! Kokichi squirmed and struggled, pushing the snake away from one spot on his torso only to have it attack another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA! HAHAHAHAHAAHAAAHAAHAHAAHAHAA!! MERCY!! HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAAA! MERCEEEHEHEHEEHEE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro slowed down, then finally let up. Kokichi was a panting, blushing mess. He wrapped his arms around his stomach to prevent another surprise attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You good?\" Rantaro asked. The boy let out a few more after giggles, and nodded. \"Good. Then let's set off on our adventure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the boys left the dock and set sail. They were prepared for a whole other adventure, which, knowing them, was sure to be filled with lots of tickles and mischief. And if they were successful, would reunite Rantaro with his treasured sister.</span></div></div>",

I was planning on using those shoes to tickle you senseless! They have a special mechanism installed inside them! All I have to do is activate it with my remote!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi!\" Everyone glared at him. Rantaro, deciding he'd made the right decision, moved forward. He did better than Shuichi, actually dodging the first few blows. Makoto fought with him for a while. After a minute, he became tired, and barely dodged the boy's attacks. Then Makoto grabbed him by the foot. It was all over for him when Makoto took off his shoe and started gliding his finger along his sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAA!\" Rantaro struggled, but it was useless. He had him in a vice-grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as the others didn't want to leave him, they knew they had to in order to beat the game. Nagito took over for Kokichi providing the Miu-dactyl belly rubs because he knew the right way to lul a pet to sleep with them. He only had to do the motions for about 30 seconds before she fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a torturous 30 seconds for Rantaro, who almost went insane with how much Makoto tickled him. His poor feet couldn't handle it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAA! AHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAA! HAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else dashed for the exit. Kokichi spared a pitiful look back at Rantaro, before he disappeared into the white light to freedom with the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro still couldn't escape. He was stuck laughing hysterically for as long as Makoto still had energy. And that was a lot of energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back proved fruitless. And Rantaro tried to reach out to him and make him remember who he once was, but he couldn't get a single word out through his laughter. He felt so helpless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like forever, but finally Rantaro got some relief when he saw a bright light, and then fell into darkness. He saw words on a screen. All they said were \"Kyoko.exe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a weird dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro woke up on the floor in Chihiro's room. It was half-lit, the brightness of the computer monitor shining through the darkness. Chihiro was tied up in a corner. Everyone else who'd been trapped in the game stood before him, as well as Kyoko. Rantaro's soles still tingled, and he was exhausted, but was happy it was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyoko... you saved me...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Yes. I wrote that program to help you and Makoto escape. Looks like it worked.\" Solemnly, she looked to Makoto, who was still dead-eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think there's any way to bring him back...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Kyoko hugged Makoto tight. \"I hate seeing him like this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi stood there with a golden pocket watch. \"I have an idea. It may be a long shot, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others watched as Kokichi swung the pocket watch back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are getting very sleepy... Your eyelids are getting heavier... You can hardly keep them open anymore... Okay. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awaken. And you will regain all your memories and personality from before you were tortured. Okay? Now!\" He snapped his fingers. Makoto awoke with a start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyoko?! Guys? W-what happened...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Kyoko hugged him. Everyone started talking at once. They had to wait a few minutes to calm down and explain so Makoto could understand. In the end, he was sad to hear what happened to him, but happy that everyone escaped the program. He hugged everyone, tears running down his cheeks. Apparently Junko, the mastermind behind everything, had been arrested while Makoto and Rantaro were still in the game. She'd brainwashed Chihiro a few months ago, which caused him to become evil. Kokichi then walked over to Chihiro, ready to de-brainwash him next with his pocket watch trick. Rantaro smiled, but he was too out of energy to stay awake. He fell back onto the floor, a shag carpet the only thing to break his fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rantaro awoke, he was in bed, a blanket covering him. Kokichi hovered over him with a creepy grin. Reacting on instinct, he pushed him away with a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah! I won't hurt you!\" Kokichi said, brushing his loose black bangs out of his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nee-hee-hee! Since you don't trust me, I've decided to legally adopt you as my big brother until you do!\" he showed him the adoption papers. Rantaro did a double take, as everything looked legit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no way!\" Kokichi grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Suddenly Kokichi became serious. \"Because if you can't trust me after I've told you a devastating truth about my life, you'll never have any real friends. Look...\" He showed him some program files. Included were the black calf-high boots from the game. They listed 'full foot protection' as part of their perks. Their only downside was that you couldn't take them off for the rest of the game. No evil tickly mechanism or remote were listed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- But you said!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a lie! I didn't want to make you feel bad after making the wrong decision!\" He shook his head pitifully. Then he smirked. \"But you know... it was quite funny seeing you laugh your head off like that! Nee-hee-hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokichi!\" Rantaro jumped on him, fingers ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! No, no, no, no, no!\" Kokichi burst into laughter as his stomach was assaulted with tickles. \"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAAAHAAA!\" Rantaro laughed along with him. Maybe having Kokichi as his little brother wouldn't be so bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPros of having Kokichi as your little brother: cuddles and tickles whenever you want! <br>\r\nCons of having Kokichi as your little brother: creepy smiles at 4 a.m., and invasions of your personal space! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well. He's too cute to stay mad at!</span></div></div>",

He couldn't believe his luck! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kokichi was too busy looking at his feet to notice, Rantaro leaped on him, toppling him over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the shoe's on the other foot, so to speak!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made sure Kokichi's straitjacket was nice and tight, and then began getting his oh-so-sweet revenge, dragging a finger slowly up and down his foot. Kokichi's laughter was so adorable, he almost did a double-take. Rantaro did this with both feet, occasionally swirling circles around in his arches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NeeheeheeheeeHEHEHEEEHEEHEHEHEHEEHEHEEE!! HEHEEHEHEHEEHHEEHEHEE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you get for defying your so called big brother!\" Rantaro smiled, and laughed along with Kokichi. He couldn't help it. It was too infectious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHEHEHHEEHEHEHEHEHEEHHEEHEE!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Keebo was trying hard to contain his laughter. It wasn't working very well. The female Cat-Taur was tickling in all the usual places, and Keebo had the bad luck of being mega-ticklish in all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAA! HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAA! PLEASE, DESIST! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she got his feet, then his knees, legs, belly, navel, and made her way up his sides and targeted his underarms. He was equally ticklish everywhere. His face quickly reddening, he tried to beg and plead some more, but his laughter engulfed any attempts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Chihiro's room, the boy watched everyone's reactions to his program. He was quite pleased with himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice came from behind him and he turned abruptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what you've been up to!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kaede. He'd know that long blond hair, purple clothes, and leadership posture anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede!\" He grinned. \"Just in time! You can watch Shuichi get wrecked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you think I want? I've come here to rescue them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suuuure that's what you want? This is your one and only chance to see your hot boyfriend get tickled so thoroughly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated for a little bit. Finally, she made her decision. Taking a second look at the boy, she could have sworn she saw the look in his eyes somewhere before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... when exactly did you become so much like Monaca...?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi could feel himself going mad. He could almost remember the last time he felt like this, back at the mental asylum he stayed at from ages 11-13. One of the other inmates had tickled him to tears (his way of cheering him up). At least Rantaro's method didn't torture as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHEHEHEEHHEHEHEHEHEEHEHHEHEEE! PLEHEHEHEHEHEHHEHEHEHEASE! NOHOHOHOHOHOOHO!! STAHHAHHAAHHAAHAHAAHP! I'M SAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHORRY!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you super sorry...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEHEHEHEHEHEHEHHEEHESS!! I\"M SUUUPER DUUPER SOOOOORRY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro eased up on him, slowing down and eventually stopping. Kokichi panted, after-giggles littering in between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I think my little brother has learned his lesson... maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing! *gasp* *pant* Free me, quick before she comes back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the sound of the Cat-taur's footsteps echoed throughout the cave. Rantaro slipped into a position where he looked like he was still in his straitjacket. The woman was carrying some paintbrushes and a feather duster. This could be a problem. Scratch that. It was a huge problem! How would they get out of this now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys laughter grew hysterical as soon as the Cat-taur applied her tools to their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NAHHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHHHAAHHAAHAA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeebo lost it. He just lost it, uncontrollable laughter filled the room. He wished he was just a little less ticklish, then he could at least talk or beg for mercy. They were doomed, weren't they? Everyone had been captured, faced with being tortured for the rest of their life. He was sure, even as a robot, he could laugh himself to death. Was there no hope for them? Could nobody save them...? Was despair their one and only fate...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel his laughter growing fainter and fainter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he thought he was on the brink of death, the tickling stopped. He saw a multitude of stars and gathered his breath. Then the stars faded. Instead, he was faced with a blackscreen. White letters scrawled across it. He read the program name, trying to make sense of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it said was: \"Kaede.exe.\" </span></div></div>",

Something brought his memory back to him and put him back in the present. He was wearing a pink sweater for some reason, with long black pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and realized his surroundings were pitch black. There was something written on a screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede.exe\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? Kaede? Wasn't that the name of Shuichi's girlfriend...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think of anything else, he was pulled back into the real world. He was in a semi-lit room with a computer and chair in the corner. The others were there with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-guys...? Is it really you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others smiled at him tiredly and nodded. He pulled them all into a group hug. Then they realized they were standing in the same room as Kaede and Chihiro. Kaede was sitting by the computer, a triumphant look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede, you rescued us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I couldn't let him get away with that. It's a good thing my fingers are so nimble from playing the piano!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded in agreement, figuring out what must have happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto thought for a while over what Chihiro's punishment should be. He didn't want to do anything to inflict pain, or make him feel nearly as uncomfortable as he'd made him feel. (Chihiro had certainly gone too far with that.) The best option, if he had indeed been corrupted by the teachings of Junko, would be to re-educate him. That would be the most compassionate route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others didn't seem to share his sentiment though, as they'd pinned down and started tickling Chihiro all over as revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh well.' Makoto thought, half-smiling. 'I guess we'll do the re-education thing after they've had their fun... After all, what goes around comes around.' </span></div></div>",

As the name says it, the character who reached level 1 of libido is slightly excited by fetish situations but it's just slight so it has no real consequence. <br>\r\nThen since they're level 1 of libido and slightly excited, they'll need less point to be level 2 of libido (18 points only). <br>\r\nOnce level 2, they'll be \"excited\". Now they're more excited by fetish situations and might offer less resistance to the game due to it. They'll need 16 points to become level 3.which is \"very excited\". They think these situations are fun and will offer very small resistance. They might be tempted not only to be caught on purpose but they'll also be tempted to contaminate and corrupt their friends. Betray them so they'll know the greatness of their fetish's. They'll need 14 points to become level 4 which is \"turned on\": everything they gained from becoming level 3 of libido is now even stronger. Also they now gain a fetish for ALL situations AND their already existing fetishes are reinforced. They'll need 12 points to become level 5 or \"ultra turned on\". This is everything of level 4 but to a massively stronger level. (+ 2 points for ALL fetish situations) A normal fetish situation will give 2 libido points.<br>\r\nFetishes as follows</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro Amami:<br>\r\nFetishes: <br>\r\nTickling<br>\r\nFeet<br>\r\nSize manipulation<br>\r\nInterrogation<br>\r\nBeing powerless<br>\r\nFalling into a trap<br>\r\nTentacles<br>\r\nAss play<br>\r\nSpanking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHates<br>\r\nBetrayal or being betrayed<br>\r\nGirls (he has not interest in girls even if they're trying to seduce him)<br>\r\nHypnosis/brainwash<br>\r\nVerbal domination<br>\r\nSmothering<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi Saihara:<br>\r\nFetishes:<br>\r\nTickling<br>\r\nHypnosis<br>\r\nSurprise attacks (he secretly loves when something disturbs his plan)<br>\r\nFalling into traps<br>\r\nPowerlessness<br>\r\nDomination<br>\r\nVerbal abuse<br>\r\nCrossdressing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHates<br>\r\nBabying<br>\r\nParalysis<br>\r\nBondage<br>\r\nCapture or being captured<br>\r\nInterrogation<br>\r\nMental regression<br>\r\nMind alteration<br>\r\nMeeting anime characters <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito Komaeda<br>\r\nFetishes: <br>\r\nTickling<br>\r\nFeet (humans and cute monsters)<br>\r\nLaughing gas<br>\r\nDrug or being drugged<br>\r\nHypnosis/brainwash<br>\r\nMind alteration<br>\r\nMind regression<br>\r\nSize manipulation<br>\r\nBetrayal or being betrayed<br>\r\nFalling into a trap or preparing a trap<br>\r\nParalysis<br>\r\nBondage<br>\r\nCapture or being captured<br>\r\nInterrogation<br>\r\nAssplay<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHates<br>\r\nPhysical domination<br>\r\nVerbal domination<br>\r\nThe Feet of ugly monsters (Attractive ones are different)<br>\r\nTransformation<br>\r\nTentacles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto Naegi:<br>\r\nFetishes: <br>\r\nFeet (monsters and humans)<br>\r\nFalling into a trap<br>\r\nPhysical domination<br>\r\nForces of Nature taking controls<br>\r\nLaughing gas<br>\r\nTentacle<br>\r\nMeeting anime characters <br>\r\nParalysis<br>\r\nMental Regression<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHates<br>\r\nTickling<br>\r\nSize alteration <br>\r\nparalysis<br>\r\nBondage<br>\r\nBabying<br>\r\nCrossdressing<br>\r\nAssplay<br>\r\nHypnosis<br>\r\nBetrayal<br>\r\nSpanking<br>\r\nSmothering <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Example: Let's imagine Shuichi has a foot fetish, then if he is involved in a foot fetish situation, he'll gain 4 libido points instead of 2.Characters also have \"anti fetish\", it's a fetish situation they hate (at first but bigger levels of libido will fix that ^^), they will only gain 1 libido point if they're involved in this kind of situation.<br>\r\nOne thing: if they're not involved in battles, then at the end of each chapter they'll regain 1 HP and 2 MP. Also they will lose 2 libido points if they're not involved in a fetish situation. <br>\r\nLet's pretend one of them reached level 4 of libido and has 0 points in that level. Then if nothing happens (in term of fetish situations) he will become level 3 and will have only 12 points of libido. (It's possible to have them being normal again if nothing happens after a moment). <br>\r\nThe monsters they'll face will not only try to attack them physically but will try to have them involved in fetish situations: Example let's pretend a character faces a monster. Then if the monster tackles him and removes his shoes and socks to tickle his feet that counts as 2 fetishes (tickling + domination) so he'll gain four libido points.<br>\r\nNow if the character has a foot fetish and the monster tackles him, sits on him if the monster removes his own shoes and socks to force the character to worship it that counts as the 2 fetishes but the character will gain 6 libido points (because the foot fetish situation alone will make him gain 4 libido points) </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the rules were explained, Shuichi went to check everyone's skills, spells and techniques but he didn't have time to as a group of goblins attacked them by surprise! (+ 2 libido points for Rantaro,Makoto and Nagito. Shuichi +4 libido). The small green humanoids were quick and agile enough to catch each of the boys' ankles with their hands and make them fall on the ground. They were pulled apart from each other in different directions by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who'd gotten Rantaro was shaken off by the Adventurer who used an old trick in his playbook and shook of his boots to get out of the goblin's grasp he misjudged it's strength and though and lost his socks as well. He winced at the feeling of the cold stone floor on his now bare feet (+4 Libido to Rantaro) and squared off with the goblin who was joined by another goblin which was rather disheartening when combined with how the others were faring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito was pulled quickly away from the others but managed to cast a spell with a yell of ''FIRE'' he launched it into the goblin that had a hold of him. It rolled on the ground in pain trying to extinguish the flames. Before he could get to his feet though another hideous goblin sat down on his back.(-1 to HP) It forced a gag between his lips muffling his spellcasting abilities.(+4 to Libido for Nagito) while he clawed at it the other singed goblin sat down on him as well and pulled off his shoes. He looked back fearfully as both goblin sneered at his now bare feet wiggling it's fingers at Nagito's quickly widening eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto quickly wormed his way out of the goblin's hands but ran headlong into a whole other squad who dogpiled atop him.<br>\r\n''GET OFF OF ME! GET OFF! RANTARO|?'' (-6 HP Naegi)<br>\r\nHe thrashed under all the goblin's grabbing hands as they pulled away whatever they could grab from the boy's pockets and cloak. His dagger, throwing knives and potions were are taken away by the goblins who laughed as they showed each other their new prizes.<br>\r\n''GIVE THOSE BACK! THOSE ARE MINE! GUY'S HELP! SHUICHI?!''<br>\r\nOne enterprising goblin got it into his head somehow that it's own large scaly feet would fit into Naegi's comfortable looking soft soled thief shoes. It pulled them off roughly and tried to jam them in angrily while Naegi got increasingly desperate in the pile.<br>\r\n''NO! NOOO! GIVE THOSE BACK! NAGITO?! ANYBODY HELP ME!''(+4 Libido Naegi)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others thrashed and fought with the multiple goblins each. One particularly scrawny goblin held one very weak boy above the ground by his ankles. It cackled cruelly at the weak fists that beat at it's legs and gave the pathetic barbarian a good and humiliating shake.(-2 HP Shuichi, +4 Libido) it clumsily fumbled with his fur boots as his thoughts raced to try and come up with some way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro<br>\r\nHP 100<br>\r\nMP 98<br>\r\nLibido 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito<br>\r\nHP 99<br>\r\nMP 98<br>\r\nLibido 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto<br>\r\nHP 94<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi<br>\r\nHP 98<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 8</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nShuichi as a barbarian should've been a strong warrior capable of dealing high damage to these enemies but with the weapon he had currently that he couldn't use, he was useless to the group. He dangled by his ankles in the goblins grasp straining to try and see his friends in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin threw Shuichi over it's shoulder and began walking away leisurely with it's prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh ... What? First monsters aren't supposed to be this strong!? Am I just that weak?! GUY'S I NEED SOME HELP HERE!!\"<br>\r\nHe yelled to the others but got no response. He tried to think of some kind of plan but stopped when he felt the goblin tugging off his fur boots. He looked over his shoulder to see the monster wiggling it's claws near his naked sole filling him with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what are you doing?! Don't tell me you're gonna ..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was given his answer when he felt the goblin's fingers dig into his vulnerable feet (Shuichi +4 Libido). The reaction was immediate on Shuichi as it had him laughing out loud, wildly trying to kick off the monster, unable to focus to think of a strategy to help his friends in his current position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha ha! Please stohohohop! It tihihckles too much! Nooohohooo\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin didn't stop because of his complaint at all though, In fact it even encouraged him to tickle his feet even harder! Useless to say the poor Shuichi couldn't control his laughter at all! Especially considering the goblin's claws were deadly weapons against his poor,soft and defenseless feet! Shuichi had never felt this powerless before as this monster played with his toes and feet while carrying him wherever it was taking him. (Shuichi +4 Libido)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi laughed so hard that all his friends could hear him from their positions.They wondered what was happening to him ... Something Rantaro would understand very soon! Rantaro Amami continued his fight against the two goblins and even if he was stronger than Shuichi, he was facing two opponents at the same time. One of them tried to attack him head-on, the Ultimate Adventurer successfully blocked the attack with his sword ... while the second goblin stealthily moved around behind him, it tackled him to the ground from his blind spot and pulled his bare foot into it's lap before bending back his long toes and scratching at the stems (Rantaro +4 Libido). He furiously laughed at the unexpected attack and even dropped his sword because his toes were just too ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nohohoho! That's cheaahaheting! Leave my feet alohohohone! GEHEHET OUT OF THEHERE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second goblin sat down and grabbed ahold of Rantaro's other ticklish foot and started nipping at the sensitive flesh with it's pointy teeth (Rantaro +4 Libido). The poor boy could barely talk, let alone fight them off. He fell back and pulled at his own hair. Overwhelmed by the sensations he reached out one hand in the last direction he saw Nagito as a silent gesture for help towards his fellow Ultimate.<br>\r\nAs the chamber was filled with an Adventurer's laughter joining a Detective's a third boy met his own fate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito Komaeda, The mage of the group was an interesting addition since mages can do things other classes can't but right now he was useless due to the leather strap shoved between his teeth impairing his ability to speak or throw spells at the monsters. He tried to get his fingers around it to pull it lose but found that the goblin had it pulled too tightly for him to be able to work his finger's under it. The goblin grabbed ahold of his wrists and used them to bend his arms behind his back and sat atop them.It turned around towards those pretty feet making sure to lay a hard slap on Nagito's rear end to show his dominance (Nagito +4 Libido). He struggled to try to get free before giving up and accepting that he probably deserved this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mphgghhhkh mphhphhgh mphhgghhh\" \"I knew it, I'm a piece of trash after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fearfully anticipated the assault to come and when the goblins started to tickle his feet (Nagito +4 Libido) with their deadly claws he truly wished he'd been wrong!! If he hadn't been gagged, the others would've heard his screaming laughter miles and miles away! His feet and body were just too sensitve for a tickling attack! He remembered all times he'd viciously tickled Naegi silly to just to hear his cute laugh Now the shoe was taken off the other foot and the ball of his was currently getting clawed at by the goblins like they wanted to dig it out!<br>\r\nThe feeling of those clawed fingers digging into his soles like there was treasure was too much for Komaeda! He was happy to be gagged because this way at least goblins wouldn't enjoy his laughter. At least he had that little rebellion, but when the goblin made his littlest toe rebel by twiddling back and forth instead he screamed into his gag once more from his friends, once again.<br>\r\n'MMMMPPHGGM! MPPHGGHMMM!'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter if it was Shuichi, Rantaro or Nagito. The goblins seemed very happy to help them take a load off and laugh there troubles away. <br>\r\nBy tickling them senseless and playing with their tender feet and toes. The last of the 4 boys Makoto Naegi was scared stiff by the fact that his multiple opponents had him totally trapped. Their strength and number had him totally dominated him (Makoto +4 Libido) and they stole almost all of the items he had, including his weapons. Suffice to say that the not so lucky thief was in trouble and he feared that he knew what he'd have to face since he could hear the laughter of two of his friends. He had enough bad memories of Nagito trying to tickle his feet to know that nobody had told Shuichi or Rantaro any jokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough in his case, his ordeal would be slightly different. The two goblins took advantage of the fact he didn't have his shoes and socks on to lick all over his beautifully sensitive and small feet! The feeling of the tongue's lapping all over his soles definitely surprised him and when the other goblin began to suck on his toes he almost screamed at the odd sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEK! Wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways Nagito tickling him so much over time had helped him build up a resistantce to tickling so he was able to resist (Makoto +2 Libido) and hold his laughter. Though the worst was yet to come, the goblin who'd tried to steal his shoes was angry and decided to humiliate poor Makoto. He took advantage of the fact that the human couldn't move to shove his goblin foot into the boy's face! (Makoto +4 Libido). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin was rubbing the soles of his green foot all over the boy's face as it grew because of how there was nothing he could do against it! Nothing but to let the goblin do what he wanted to him. It felt very weird for the thief to have his feet licked by two goblins especially while a third was using his face as doormat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go PLEASE! I beg you, you have to ... MPPGHHMMH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis begging was interrupted by the goblin shoving the heel of his foot into Makoto's mouth, forcing him to suck it (Makoto +4 Libido). For some reason it started to get hard for the boy to think straight. His skin was also starting to feel a bit hot and despite himself he started to feel his pants grow a bit tighter.<br>\r\n''It's foot doesn't...taste that bad honestly?! Wait what am I saying?!'' he thought to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quartet of boys was in big trouble ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro<br>\r\nHP 100<br>\r\nMP 98<br>\r\nLibido 14<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito<br>\r\nHP 99<br>\r\nMP 98<br>\r\nLibido 12<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto<br>\r\nHP 94<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 20 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi<br>\r\nHP 96<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 16<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto reached level 1 of libido which is \u201cslightly excited\u201d since he has 20 points.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four boys were totally in the scaly hands of the goblins. They were each trapped by the goblins who laughed just as much at how the just couldn't stop laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak barbarian Shuichi couldn't do anything against a single goblin in a normal battle but things were even worse for him as the goblin was not playing fair. It had picked Shuichi up over it's shoulder like it had already won and started carrying him off to who knows where. As it marched away with it's prize he tickled away on Shuichi's naked feet driving the boy wild. (Shuichi +4 Libido).Clawed fingers were way too effective against his nerves so it was impossible not to laugh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaggha! Stohop that! Gihihve me a breaheek!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin didn't stop though, to the contrary he started to tickle him even harder! (Shuichi +4 Libido) That goblin definitely LOVED what he was doing to this beautiful boy's beautiful feet!<br>\r\n\"I can't even focus! I need to think of a strategy...but this feels...good? No...what am I thinking?\". Just like Makoto earlier, Shuichi's mind started to betray him under the games influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rantaro also had problems. He was stronger than Shuichi but he had two opponents and now they were licking his feet (Rantaro +4 Libido). The goblins loved to lick his soles as they held them tight. It tickled so bad that all Rantaro could do was cover his own mouth to try and keep the laughter contained.  The goblin tongues tickled so much...but somewhat he started to appreciate that feeling though.  \"It feels kind of good...Huh?! What am I thinking?! I've gotta get loose!\".<br>\r\nSoon his gorgeous feet were covered in drool from the slobbering monsters, Everytime Rantaro tried to reach and stop them they'd give his feet another long and slow lick breaking him back down into a helpless giggly mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were even worse for Nagito. The mage couldn't move his arms or legs and was gagged on top of that.The goblins continued to furiously tickle his feet! One of them was directly tickling his soles, while the other did something different. It sawed a feather in between each of his toes! (Nagito +4 Libido x2). <br>\r\nIt tickled so bad at the same time it felt really good to him. Nagito started to relax and feel happy under the goblins care despite himself. In fact if it wasn't for the gag, anybody could tell he was happy just by seeing the look on his face. He'd changed his mind and wished he wasn't gagged. He wanted his captors to enjoy his laughter so they'd tickle him harder! <br>\r\n\"Yes, tickle my feet even more! Feels sooo good...I wish I could laugh for them forever...wait why am I thinking this? I don't want this!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if things were extremely bad for Makoto who'd had to face a whole squad of goblins One of his skills would save the rest of the group. Before his torturers could take him wherever they'd planned to, A little marble fell out of his pocket and exploded into very powerful light. The goblins screeched in surprise as they were blinded by the powerful flash.They recoiled and stumbled about in confusion due to the explosive. The boys realized this was the break they'd needed to escape the monsters and fled, leaving behind the items the goblins had taken from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran until they were in another part of the dungeon. A dark corridor with plenty of doors stretched before them. Shuichi investigated until finding one of the doors on their left with a banner that read \"LIBRARY\" above it. He called it out to the others.<br>\r\n\"Everyone, it seems there's a library on our left, I suggest we go inside. It's a calm place and we should probably get out of the hall in case those monsters try to follow us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we're gonna get that lucky again so we should probably avoid them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost my sword and boot's against those two so I'm gonna have to agree with Makoto here. We should hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost my shoes and sword too Rantaro. It's best if we all rest in here and take inventory while I come up with a plan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see the oldest of the four teens, Nagito still trying to undo the leather strap gagging him.<br>\r\n\"Mmpghhhh...mphhhhh...MMMPHHHHHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nagito what happened?! Let me help you remove that thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later after some effort from Shuichi and Rantaro, Nagito was finally able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much! What was that light though? It saved me otherwise I'd still be caught\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that was mine. Some kind of flash bomb that the goblins didn't take from me when they took all my other items plus my shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys opened the door and noticed there was a kind of force field as well as a sign near them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rules of the library: <br>\r\nRule number 1) it is forbidden to wear shoes and socks in the library. The forcefield will continue to block persons who still have shoes and socks. Also once inside you must NEVER put them on again or you'll face consequences!<br>\r\nRule number 2) You must whisper while you're inside. If you make too much noise you'll get a warning and if that happens again you will be punished!<br>\r\nRule number 3) You can read all books you want inside the library but you do not steal anything otherwise you will be punished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were surprised they had to remove their shoes and socks to enter but since the goblins had all of their shoes and socks it didn't seem to matter.<br>\r\nOnce inside they noticed the size of the well lit room . It seemed a lot more welcoming than the dark corridor. They each took a seat and as they did that, a voice explained rules earlier spoke in their head directly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations on surviving your first battle and reaching safety! Since you ran away you gainnothing. Defeating enemies will give you xp and gold to allow you to grow stronger and buy stuff. Don't forget to check your skills as well as the enemy guide now that you entered your first enemies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? There's an enemy guide?\" wondered Shuichi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably appeared once we encountered goblins.\" suggested Rantaro<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we whould check our skills first.\" suggested Shuichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi checked his<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbarian: lv 1 skill ... passive skill: Enormous Damage. Can inflict 2 more damage melee, this does not affect range attacks. Other skill..Pierce Armor: once every 20 minutes you can use this skill to ignore the opponent's armor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro's read as<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdventurer: lv 1 skill...Double Shot: once every 15 minutes you can shoot two arrows at the same time (note: the number of arrows in your quiver is the same as Legolas that is to say unlimited), other lv 1 skill...Falcon Slash...once every 10 minutes you can attack twice in a row with your sword<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Nagito's turn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMage: lv 1 skill ... Fire...cost 2 MP but inflicts 3 fire magical damages (ignores physical armor) ... lv 1 skill...Ice...cost 2 MP but inflicts 3 ice magical damages (ignores physical armor)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was Makoto's turn <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThief: lv 1 skill ... Dagger Frenzy...once every 10 minutes you can attack three times in a row with your dagger (keep in mind daggers are quite weak weapons)...passive skill...Treasure Hunter...you can \"smell\" when chest is around...passive skill: Trapped Treasure? you have 75% of chances to be right when you guess a chest is trapped or not. Passive skill: when in a critical situation you'll automatically throw a flash bomb (can only be used once each 3 hour). Final lv 1 skill \"I Need Some Money!\": thanks to you, your group will gain 1.5 times more money by defeating enemies or in chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice continued <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian level 2 will have a skill that allows him to throw two small hatchets, the level 2 adventurer will be able to shoot fire arrows, the level 2 mage will have access to a wind spell, the level 2 thief will have improved chances to gain items from defeated enemies and will be able to craft things out of all sorts of items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So basically if we use our abilities we might have a chance to get out.\" Shuichi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure those monsters were strong!\" Makoto added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking about monsters we should check out the enemy guide\" Rantaro suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnemy guide ... monster encountered ... 1/100,000. Monster: Goblin of Depths... Strengths: Is individually stronger, faster, more agile and pretty much better at everything than you! In addition to that, Goblins of Depths are often looking for victims in groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoblins of Depths love to tickle their preys' feet using their fingers, tongues or tools such as feathers. It is not recommended to anger them, otherwise they will force you to lick their feet, suck on their toes, suck their heels etc ... unless this is what you're looking for: to be a footslave to goblins and be dominated by them and their green feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was surprised the voice was talking to them like that. (Nagito +2 Libido) Some were even slightly excited by this (shuichi +4 Libido points), However others disliked verbal domination. (Rantaro and Makoto +1 Libido). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said all of them thought it would be hot to piss some goblins off to lick their goblin feet (Shuichi, Rantaro and Nagito +4 Libido points), except Naegi who was disgusted by the idea but yet couldn't stop imagining it. (Naegi +1 Libido). <br>\r\nBut they were soon taken ouf of their fantasies with one question in head ... what will they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[since the group is resting they recover some HP, MP and will lose 2 Libido points]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro<br>\r\nHP 100<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 21 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito<br>\r\nHP 100<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto<br>\r\nHP 95<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi<br>\r\nHP 97<br>\r\nMP 100<br>\r\nLibido 30<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four have reached level 1 of libido (slightly excited), And they'll reach level 2 of libido (excited) once they'll have 38 points. <br>\r\nPoated on behalf of user Manju</span></div></div>",

He'd been going to the elite academy for almost a year and still had trouble believing that it was real. He kept thinking any day they'd realize he was nothing special and not let him in but once again as he passed the glowering Mr. Sakakura at the gate he was let in. He walked down the hallways checking each room as he looked for his friends Byakuya and Kyoko. The Luckster was once again marveled at how in middle school he got pantsed once a month but now as high schooler he was looking for his best friends the richest boy in the country and one of the top detectives in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family was even benefiting at this point from his enrollment in the academy. His mother and father had both been employed by one the former graduates and his little sister had formed an odd friendship with one of his gloomier classmates somehow. Now Toko was around the house and Komaru almost constantly. Makoto was so focused on recounting these events in his head that he still barely noticed when he seemingly ran into brick wall. The short teen fell down on his butt embarrassed at his own stupidity when the wall turned around he realized it was his classmate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Makoto you need to watch where you're going. There are far more unfriendly people than I roaming these halls.'' rumbled the deep voice of Sakura Oogami the Ultimate Martial Artist as she chided Naegi. ''Sorry Sakura. I was distracted and wasn't looking where I was going. It's an hon-honest mistake.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi couldn't help himself when he stuttered. He'd known the larger girl for more than a year and had first hand experience on how kind and gentle she was. Still when she was glowering down at him like this he still stuttered in fear before her causing her expression to darken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I see, My apologies Naegi I did not mean to frighten you.''<br>\r\n''Sa-Sakura no I'm sorry!''<br>\r\n''Allow me to help you up at least. To apologize for giving you such a fright.''<br>\r\n''N-No Sakura it wasn't you-''<br>\r\n''Allow me to help you up Naegi.''<br>\r\nSakura picked him up bodily and was surprised as the small hoodie clad teen burst into giggles in her hands. He pulled away from her and braced himself on the wall.<br>\r\n''Ma-Makoto?'' she asked in surprise.<br>\r\n''Ihihit's nothing!'' the still snickering Luck said as he pulled away from her thinking about how her large rough fingers had just run up his spine and cursing that just had been enough to to get gim giggling and red in the face. Makoto took off down the hallway quickly leaving the surprised grappler in his wake. All Sakura could think was how pleasant his laugh was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day Sakura was on her way to the Nurse's office in search of protein powder when she heard Makoto laughing again. She peeked into a class room and saw the boy on the ground once more kicking and pulling at his shoes. He was frantically giggling as he pulled at his own shoes and rolled on the ground. He spied the shocked Fighter and held his hand out to her begging through his giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sahehekura hehelp pleeheese!~''<br>\r\n''Mak-Makoto what is wrong!?''<br>\r\n''Maheehee Myheeeheehaa''<br>\r\n''Makoto what ails you my friend?!''<br>\r\n''Shaahee shoohohes!''<br>\r\n''Your shoes?! Is that what you said Naegi?''<br>\r\n''Neehhahapleeashee''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one one hand she grabbed his leg and held it still. She quickly undid the laces and pulled but found it not coming off her classmates foot. She paused not wanting to hurt the Ultimate Luck but as the boy banged his fists on ground she pushed forward. She pinched her fingers through the sole of Makoto's sneaker using the ''Mantis eats Tiny Bird'' technique before pulling the rubber sole of the shoe clean off and noticing right away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The inside of Makoto's shoe was coated in some powder which quickly coated Sakura's fingers causing them to itch mightily.<br>\r\n2. The Ultimate Luck's feet were bare inside in his sneakers and at first Sakura was distracted by how small her friend and classmates feet were and not just for a boy. Still what had happened to the boy's socks she wondered? And where could she find them? <br>\r\n3. Naegi's feet were obviously distressed. His soles flushed a an appealing shade of pink and the toes flexed and unflexed rapidly in Sakura's hand-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sahahakura pleese?<br>\r\n''Ahh my apologies.''<br>\r\nSakura quickly and easily ripped that sneaker and the other off Naegi but was confused as all this did was allow her classmate to scratch and paw at his now bared feet. <br>\r\n''Ihihitching pohohodwer! Hiyohohko put it in my shohoes and IT'S DRIHIVING ME CRAZY!! GEHEHET IT AHHHFF!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto Naegi the Ultimate Luck scratched and scrubbed at his own feet on the ground like a child throwing a tantrum. He bent his own toes back and dragged his nails from itching spot to itching spot but all that seemed to do was make it worse for the boy who's face growing redder by the second. When his voice gave out Sakura finally snapped out of it and jumped into action. <br>\r\n''Shield your eyes I'll put an end to this.''<br>\r\nThe Ultimate Martial Artist drew her hands back and adjusted before clapping her hands together and unleashing her special ''Jangu'' clap blowing the dust off her small friend's tortured feet out the window and onto one Hiyoko Saionji who was laughing in the courtyard at her perfect prank on the unlucky from the class below her. Makoto breathed easier at the clawing sensation having been removed. He sighed and rubbed at his face, wiping away the tears. Sakura placed her hand on his shoulder as he sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tha-Thank you so much Sakura. Saionji from the class above us snuck that stuff into my shoes when I wasn't looking.''<br>\r\n''What happened to your socks my friend?''<br>\r\n''She set up a bucket of water to ruin them when I came into the classroom.''<br>\r\n''M-Makoto may I tell you something?''<br>\r\n''Of course Sakura! You just saved me anything you want!''<br>\r\n''Ma-Makoto this may not be what you want to hear right now but...you have a very cute laugh.''<br>\r\n''Wh-What?''<br>\r\n''I don't mean to overstep but your laugh is very nice and if I may?''<br>\r\n''Su-Sure Sakura go ahead.''<br>\r\n''Your feet are quite...cute and remarkably small for a male. If I may I'd like to touch them please?''<br>\r\n''SAKURA NO! I mean they're still sens-I don't like..-NO! NO! DON'T!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers froze just short of touching cute feet and Makoto instead pulled his bare feet close to him while once again growing red.and crawling away from his savior even though he knew he was hurting the legendary fighter's feelings by treating her like some kind of monster.<br>\r\n''I just-I'm sorry Sakura..bu-but I do-I don't! I DON'T WANT THAT! I DON'T LIKE IT!''<br>\r\n''Naegi my friend I did not mean to-''<br>\r\n''It'-It's fine Sakura I'm sorry but I don't-It would..I don't like-''<br>\r\n''Makoto are you perhaps ticklish? There is no shame in a boy being ticklish my friend I was just admiring yo-''<br>\r\n''I'M NOT! I'M NOT TICKLISH AT ALL! BOY'S AREN'T TICKLISH SAKURA SOJUST DROP IT!''<br>\r\n''Mako-Naegi--''<br>\r\n''It's fine! It's fine Sakura I just don't-I've- I have to leave now!~''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter and to Sakura's opinion better of the two Ultimate Luck's currently attending the academy stormed off in a huff leaving Sakura flabbergasted by her friends tantrum. It hurt deep down as she had considered Naegi a very close friend here at the academy and to have him snap at her in such a manner was very disheartening to her considering the difficulty she'd been having making friends among her classmates.<br>\r\n''AH'' she said looking over at the pile of shredded rubber and fabric. ''Naegi forgot his shoes.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day once more again Sakura was roaming the halls. After having a frank discussion with her very close friend Aoi Asahina she'd received the advice that she should speak with Naegi again and apologize for frightening him. Though he was not just a teenage boy but an Ultimate at the prestigious school in the world he still had his faults. Aoi had let the martial artist know that one of those faults was that he felt useless and weak in the face of the other Ultimates. Most likely being carried by her and turned into a giggling puddle by a prank had not very good for Makoto's sense of self-worth. Considering the feelings of others was something that Sakura was embarrassed to have forgotten and she would apologize to him when she found him for her error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard Makoto Naeigi...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you not like this?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's well trained ears heard the taunt and her head snapped to the source of the sound. She peeked into another unused classroom and found Kokichi Oma the Ultimate Supreme Leader instead of her friend like she'd hoped. He was seated atop some sort of strange throne that certainly befit one with his talent. However his trademark scarf was atop the arm and seemed to be concealing an object which he drummed his fingers atop as he evaluated her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ohhh woow! Sakura right? From the class above me? Hii!~'' he said in his sing-songish tone that made Sakura feel like he was mocking her. It was not a new feeling to her.<br>\r\n''Greetings Kokichi my apologies I am looking for my classmate and thought I heard him in here for a second,''<br>\r\n''Huuuh? Who were you looking for cause I think I saw Byakuya go by a bit ago. He was heading down towards the gym I think I heard.''<br>\r\n''No the classmate I was looking looking for is-''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Hmmppgh!''</font><br>\r\nKokichi dug his nails into the scarf covered armrest which if Sakura had been paying attention to she would have seen that it quivered in response to the boy's fingers. This was because the scarf hid the trapped foot of Makoto Naegi the Ultimate Luck who was trapped inside the chair. Instead though Sakura focused on the strange noise that had drawn here unaware that her friend was in a predicament right before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Mmmhemhmm!''</font><br>\r\n''Pardon me do you hear that?''<br>\r\n''Hmmm? Hear what? I don't hear anything.''<br>\r\n''To answer your question from before no I am looking for my friend Makoto.''<br>\r\n''Who's that?'' the mischevious boy asked adopting an inquisitive look. Absentmindedly he fiddled with the cloth pulling the toes of the trapped Makoto Naegi back and spider tickling the stretched skin.<br>\r\n''Makoto Naegi the Ultimate Luck? He is a member of my class surely you must have met him. The student body of our academy is not that large.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOma ignored her and instead focused on his toy under the cloth drawing numbers then feiging having to erase with his thumb<br>\r\n''One One Zero Threeeee''<br>\r\n''Kokichi are you paying attention to me?''<br>\r\n''SEVEN! HA-HA!''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Mmmhmhmhf! Hmppfmm''!</font><br>\r\n''There it is again! Kokichi are you listening to me?''<br>\r\n''Oh!

I am standing right in front of you how could you forget me?''<br>\r\n''Oh that was a lie.''<br>\r\n''A lie?''<br>\r\n''Yeah I do that alot.''<br>\r\n''What? Why would you do that?''<br>\r\nKokichi focused on drawing letters on the concealed sole now and went back to barely paying attention to Sakura as he scribbled nonsense all over Naegi's foot under the scarf.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Mmmgghmm!!''</font><br>\r\n''I do that all the time.''<br>\r\n''Why?''<br>\r\n''Because I'm a robot controlled by somebody else.''<br>\r\n''Th-That's nonsense and I refuse to believe it!''<br>\r\n''That's good because it was a lie.''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Mmmskkra!''</font><br>\r\n''Kokichi what are you doing with that scarf AND WHY ARE YOU NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS!''<br>\r\n''Jeez why are you noisy? I don't like and I see why Naegi didn't want me to tell you where he was going. Ooopsie!''<br>\r\n''Kokichi what are you doing there?''<br>\r\n''Me? Just practicing some sleight of hand that Himiko showed me.''<br>\r\n''I find that hard to believe.''<br>\r\n''That's good Ogre-mi. It was just another lie!''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Hmmmppf!!''</font> Naegi whimpered from the back of the chair hoping the girl would realize that it was all lies!<br>\r\n''Do you know where Naegi went Oma?'' the Martial Artist said tersely. She had heard that hated nickname he thought that he had so cleverly snuck in.<br>\r\n''Ohh are you mad at me now Sakura-chan? I'm sorry I didn't mean to lie but Makoto asked me to!''<br>\r\n''What? You know where he went?''<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Hmmffmmnn!''</font><br>\r\n''What is that noise?''<br>\r\n''Huuh what noise? Anyway Makoto-chan was really scaaared.''<br>\r\n''Hmm of what?''<br>\r\n''YOU SILLY! He was all upset saying Kokichi please if Ogre-mi comes in here don't tell her I'm going to hide in the dorms! She's so scary and mean looking!''<br>\r\n''That-That does not sound like him.''<br>\r\n''Ohh really? Booo that was a lie but doesn't it sound like something that people say about you?''<br>\r\n''Mind your tongue Kokic-''<br>\r\n''So if it sounds like something people say about you and Makoto was running from you than are you so sure that it's not true?''<br>\r\nWhile taunting her Oma drew an I down Makoto's poor little foot making sure to dot it with a heart and twiddle the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">''Mmmghgf!!''</font><br>\r\n''You just said he never said that-''<br>\r\n''That was a lie jeez are all big people stupid? I thought it was just Gonta. He was scared of you and went to hide in his dorm. Can you blame him?''<br>\r\n''Naegi would never...We are friends...''<br>\r\n''Heeeeyy are you lying? I don't like it when OTHER people lie! Even if it's just to themselves!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto Naegi tried to shake his head back and forth from his hiding place in the back of the chair but couldn't due to the restraint's not only holding his head still but also keeping him gagged and the headset over his eye's so that all he could see was the image of a smiling Miu Iruma beckoning him into a hug. The Ultimate Luck of class 11-C begged and pleaded to whoever was listening for his friend Sakura to not believe Kokichi's lies. Not just because they were terrible but also because HE REALLY WANTED OUT OF THIS FUCKING CHAIR! SHIT PLEASE! SAKURA DON'T BELIEVE HIM!<br>\r\nGreat now he was talking like the insane inventor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*Earlier in the day!*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''HAHAHAHA OF COURSE I'M SURE IT WORKS!!''<br>\r\n''Reeeally Miu? Are you super-duuuper one hundred percent suuure? What if it breaks huuuh? Shuichi could get really hurt and then he'll never like you! Just like the rest of world!''<br>\r\n''Tha-That'd nev-never happen! I-I triple checked everything twice you evil little grem-gremllin!''<br>\r\n''Nishishishi I know you did Miu. Did you think I was doubting the Ultimate INVENTOR?!''<br>\r\n''Ye-Yes-''<br>\r\n''WELL THAT WAS A LIE! Gosh your dumb!''<br>\r\n''No I'm not! I'm a genius!''<br>\r\n''Then where's Shuichi?''<br>\r\n''I-I-I don't know.''<br>\r\n''Yes you do Miu. I don't like it when other people lie so don't do that.''<br>\r\n''Bu-but I don't know where he is-''<br>\r\n''Yes you do! He's with Kaede and NOT YOU! Jeez Miu I just said stop lying are you even really the Ultimate Inventor or is that a lie? Kidding! We both know that Shuichi's with Kaede and not you right now!''<br>\r\n''We-well he's not here-''<br>\r\n''So then he's with KAEDE, MIU! And why is he there?''<br>\r\n''Because my tits are too big for that virgin bit-''<br>\r\n''BECAUSE HE LOVES HER MIU! HER AND NOT YOU! So c'mon Miu what's this machine for?''<br>\r\n''TO MAKE HIM LOVE ME AND NOT HER!''<br>\r\n''That's right!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked over to Miu Iruma the Ultimate Inventor's new creation. The love throne five thousand and three! Guaranteed to make Shuichi Saihara forget all about his girlfriend Kaede and fall solely in love with the gorgeous girl genius with the brain of gold Miu Iruma! At the flip of a switch of this high-tech throne would open up and whoever was sitting in it at the time would fall inside and become trapped within where the padded restraints inside would keep them entombed in an incredibly comfortable silk cushion prison. All of their body would be hidden inside except their feet which could then be stripped bare due to their placement into each armrest of this high-tech throne where they'd be under the fingers of whatever big-titted brilliant godess was sitting in it. The victims mouth would be gagged with a lemon flavored gag held in place by an iron bar making sure that they couldn't make any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're sure Pooichi likes lemons?''<br>\r\n''Oh yeah he loves them. He's crazy about sour things but they've gotta be crazy sour ! That's totally true and not at all a lie!''<br>\r\n'What?''<br>\r\n''NOT A LIE!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside all the poor person would see is what the headset would show them which in this case would be Miu Iruma showing off her best ''assets''. They'd be completely immobilized and entirely at the mercy of whoever was sitting in the chair when it was activated and they were dragged inside. Miu had been assured multiple times that this would lead to her crush the shy Shuichi Saihara the Ultimate Detective to fall in love with her because....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-1. According to Kokichi: Shuichi love to be dominated. It was a kink of his which Kaede had found out about and exploited to get the young sleuth's to date her.<br>\r\n-2. According to Kokichi: Shuichi was insanely ticklish especially on his feet. Something he was ashamed of causing him to hide his eye's out of fear someone figured it out. Something which Kaede had found out and used to trap the youthful crimefighter into dating her.<br>\r\n-3. According to Kokichi: Shuichi was actually secretly into being tickled and had always fantasized about getting his brains tickled out by the person who would one day marry him and many loving tickle filled nights with. Something which Kaede had found out and used to enslave the young gumshoe's mind.<br>\r\n-4. According to Kokichi overwhelming a person with things they loved could allow you to add a new and mkae them love it. This was information Kokichi had gotten directly from the Ultimate Therapist herself!<br>\r\n-5. According to Kokichi none of these were lies at all.<br>\r\nAs Miu left to find Shuichi and bring him back to the trapped throne Kokichi smile since only one part of that was a lie. Still as Miu went off to get Shuichi this plan of his looked bulletproof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when a giggling Makoto Naegi stumbled in Kokichi amended his plans to include him. Now all he had to do was get Sakura to leave and he could see if if more than one person could fit in there...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Groaning as she woke up, Kaede\u2019s eyelids fluttered as she struggled to get her bearings. The last things she remembered were that both Shuichi and her had found an unlocked storage room in the upper levels while exploring. When they went in to investigate after hearing something being knocked over, her companion\u2019s strangled cough could be heard before her vision went black\u2026 Oh god, something had attacked Shuichi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cupupupupu\u2026 Wakey Wakey, Rise and Shiney!\u201d Trying to turn her head to see the source of the familiar yet creepy laughter, the blonde gasped at finding herself strapped down to a pianist\u2019s chair by a thick metal band over her thighs. Luckily for her, it seemed that was all Monokuma had done, judging by the fact that her pink sweater, white school shirt and purple-motifed skirt hadn\u2019t been tampered with. \u201cW-What\u2019s going on! What have you done with Shuichi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo impatient\u2026 And to think I even brought you a present!\u201d Covering his grinning mouth with one paw, Monokuma jumped off the black object in front of Kaede. As the lid opened to reveal a grand piano, a few pages of sheet music were lowered onto their holders. \u201cAs for what your boyfriend is doing\u2026 Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m working on turning that frown upside down. And that\u2019s a promise, kiddo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding some relief that Shuichi was at least still alive, the ultimate pianist temporarily turned her attention to the pieces of paper. While <i>Fantasia No.2 in D minor</i> was quite an advanced song, it wasn\u2019t anything too troublesome if someone of her skill level were to play it out. With the items given to her, it couldn\u2019t possibly be that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you\u2019re so smart in finding that hidden area, I\u2019m pretty sure you have an idea of what to do, don\u2019t you, Kaede-chan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me\u2026 To play the song? Is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpupupupu, you\u2019re much more clever than you let on\u2026 Maybe even too clever\u2026\u201d Monokuma sat on the glossy cover, kicking his legs as he mulled about. \u201cA-Anyway, don\u2019t get too carried away! If you can play the song without making any mistakes, I\u2019ll let you and that emo-detective go free!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if I mess up?\u201d Feeling a chill run down her spine as the lifeless beardroid turned to face her, Kaede could have sworn that its glowing crimson eyes were digging into her very soul. \u201cI don\u2019t think I'll need to tell you what happens if that comes around, Kaede-chan. It would be extremely troublesome to clean someone\u2019s guts off of this large noisemaker, upupupupu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a small knot of fear at the insinuation of the hidden threat, Kaede slapped both her cheeks with her palms. If she, the ultimate pianist, couldn\u2019t play this piece of music, what hope did everyone else have with Monokuma\u2019s little challenges? Closing her eyes as she calmly breathed out, her fingers placed themselves on the first notes from years of practice. Opening her eyes with newfound determination, the blonde began to play the first part of the tri-factra masterpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh did I forget to mention Kaede-chan\u2026\u201d Kaede tried to ignore Monokuma\u2019s eerie words. Just nearby however, her trained ears could barely make out the sound of something over the flowing music\u2026 Was it clapping? \u201cYour wonderful audience would also like a more\u2026 interactive participation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two ghostly floating hands now coming into view, the blonde gulped as her eyes followed the moving appendages, even as her own continued to play the song from pure memory. Closing her eyes to block out the new interference, Kaede almost squealed in surprise when the two hands clamped against her sides with wiggling fingers. \u201cW-What! Y-You didn\u2019t say anything about floating hands!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, did I? My bad, upupupupu~!\u201d Snickering as Monokuma watched the hands work their magic, Kaede failed to suppress a crooked grin from appearing on her mouth. While their movements were somewhat ticklish, the woolly thickness of her sweater prevented most of the distracting prods from doing their job.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She played the notes with ease, filtering out the distractions as more hands approached her. Her outstretched arms flowed over the keys with grace and beauty, that is, until something poked her armpit. She flinched violently, almost pressing a wrong note. Unable to suppress a grin, she twitched and squirmed as another hand began lightly teasing her other armpit, almost causing her to fail the task at hand. \"Nnnhhp!\" She grunted under her breath, continuing the song. The hands began scratching at the sensitive skin, causing her to break into panicked laughter, trying not to fail playing the song. <i>C</i>! The discordant note rung out, and Kaede knew she had failed. The grand piano was slowly pulled from view as her hands were forced above her head, and strapped to the newly extended chair. \"Upupupupu! Looks like the pianist failed!\" Monokuma cooed, snickering at her misfortune. She glared at the bear, squirming in her bonds. \"Let me go, you... sadist!\" She snapped at him. He said nothing, but she could feel the presence of more hands, and somehow she knew some were armed with tools...</span></div></div>",

The only thing that scared the the piano freak at the moment was the fact that Monokuma had chosen a very long song for her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpupupupupupu!\u201d Monokuma laughed sadistically, prompting Kaede to glance in his direction. \u201cIt seems like your body is rather well protected there, isn\u2019t it? Well that\u2019s no fun, so I\u2019m allowing the audience to break through the barriers in order to see their favorite Ultimate smile!~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monokuma finished his sentence, Kaede soon felt multiple hands tugging at her clothes, the girl struggling to stay still. It wasn\u2019t really a problem, though, and Kaede was wondering what this had to do with the entire small speech that Monokuma had just presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she\u2019d learn it\u2019s meaning moments after her initial thoughts, as her sweater and the off-white dress shirt underneath it were ripped off of her body with force, making her almost fall over. She soon felt uncomfortable, the reason being unknown to most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Monokuma didn\u2019t classify under that category of most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, it seems that the piano freak is a bit...hmmm, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for?\u201d Monokuma rubbed his cheeks, pretending as if he was actually looking for the dreaded word that plagued Kaede\u2019s mind whenever she was exposed like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! She\u2019s fat!\u201d The black-and-white bear stated, grinning evilly as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamatsu began to struggle with her focus on that. Whenever she was around any of the other girls, she just felt hopelessly outclassed in looks and her body. Things like the more toned bodies of Maki and Tenko, the more slender bodies of Tsumugi, Kirumi, and Angie, and the more plump yet still skinny body of Miu made her more than aware of the extra weight that her body held compared to all of the other girls...except Himiko, but it looked like she hasn\u2019t actually hit puberty yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the deep, dark thoughts plaguing Kaede\u2019s mind, she played the song with no issues. Unfortunately, that wouldn\u2019t last long, as a hand poked her now exposed side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYAAAAAH!!!\u201d Kaede squeaked, her body slightly jerking away from the hand and almost making her input a wrong note. Her eyes widened as she realized that if this were to be how she would act whenever the hands touched her, the life of Shuichi would be sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpupupupu! Looks like the your clothes were the only thing protecting your body, tubby~\u201d Monokuma stated as he chuckled into his hands, clearly enjoying the desperation that had appeared on Kaede\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the hands descended all over her belly. Add the fact that Monokuma had just called her \u2018Tubby\u2019, and the torturing of the poor blonde had increased significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-NOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO <br>\r\nSTOHOHOHOHOHOHOHP!!!!!\u201d Kaede exploded into some of the most delightful laughter one could hear, even rivaling her piano skills in how much one would want to hear. Contrary to her laughter, though, Akamatsu refused to move around enough to make her mess up. As much as the ticklish torment and the insulting comments and name-calling hurt her, nothing would hurt more than to, lose her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her belly was easily one of the most ticklish spots on her body, making it way too hard to fight the tickles~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpupupupupu, looks like we\u2019ll need to up the game a bit~\u201d Monokuma said, the hands soon slowing down so that they could stop. However, in that time, Monokuma discovered a little secret about Kaede\u2019s pudgy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNYAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!\u201d Kaede laughed even harder as the hands lightly stroked her belly. It seemed that not only did verbal teases torture her, but lighter, more teasing tickles on her belly worked even more. It was almost enough to make her mess up, but she stayed strong as her slightly chubby belly was tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonokuma chuckled, knowing that the girl would be quite resilient in this circumstance. After all, her life was on the line, and if she died, Shuichi would possibly be stuck wherever he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bear didn\u2019t want her to win! So, he decided to move onto his next plan of attack...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c...nnnnn\u2026\u201d A rather quiet groan could be hear from the young girl that currently occupied quite an intriguing chair. That young girl was none other than the Ultimate Gamer, Chiaki Nanami! The usually sleepy girl seemed to be in quite the deep slumber, as she has yet to arouse and learn of her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a certain someone was getting rather impatient with how the girl was sleeping for the past five hours, and commenced to pinch her cheeks. \u201cCome on my little gamer~\u201d Verbalized the shadow of the being who wished to play with Chiaki, their voice being both feminine and rather\u2026well...seductive~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after minutes of pinching the chubby cheeks of the gamer girl, she began to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl let out an adorable yawn. \u201c...nnnnn, Hajime, it\u2019s only been a few hou-\u201c Chiaki began to say, the girl\u2019s eyes beginning to open. She was expecting to see the face of her best friend Hajime Hinata, who\u2019d try to put on an annoyed face, but fail to hide a small grin. It was a face that she trusted; it was a face she wished to wake up to all the time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo imagine the gamer\u2019s surprise when, in lieu of a kind, welcoming smile from her friend, she aroused to find her face literal centimeters away from the face of the Ultimate Despair/Fashionista, Junko Enoshima!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-Hu-Eh?!\u201d Chiaki let out an uncharacteristically surprised yelp as she commenced to try and get away from the girl. Unfortunately for the damsel in distress, her arms and legs were clamped tightly onto the chair, making her elusion infeasible. The chair itself was made entirely of metal, the seat of the chair elongating to make her legs stretched out plenarily. She tried to move her feet around, but found them locked into a pair of stocks blocked from her view by the Fashionista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAHAHAHAHAHA, YOU WERE EXPECTING YOUR BELOVED HAJIME, WEREN\u2019T YA?!!\u201d Junko laughed hysterically, relinquishing Chiaki\u2019s cheeks and holding her stomach as she kept laughing. She then suddenly jerked more proximate, making Chiaki recoil scarcely and hit her head against the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, aren\u2019t you just the cutest~\u201d Junko stated, holding Chiaki\u2019s head from underneath her chin and pushing it up, obviating the lethargic girl to be unable to jerk her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what do you want from me, Junko?\u201d Chiaki asked, the girl glaring at the mastermind. She was scared, no, TERRIFIED at the moment, but she couldn\u2019t back down at this point. For the hope of the future of her and her friends, she can\u2019t just submit to Junk-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer noetic conceptions were interrupted by Junko pulling out a knife and stabbing it into the chair right adjacent to Chiaki\u2019s head, making the pudgier girl flinch belligerently. Junko leaned in and licked Chiaki\u2019s neck, wanting to hear her moan. She wanted to torture her mental state with sexual torture, a tried-and-true method that destroyed all of its victim\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that thought left her mind as an incipient, far more devious thought came to be when she got a different reaction from her precious Nanami~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nehehehehehe!\u201d Chiaki giggled softly, her mellow laughter far surpassing any laugh that Junko had ever auricularly discerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gamer was actually tickled often by her friends. Mahiru would do it to make sure she didn\u2019t doze off in the middle of conversations; Hiyoko would do it as it was the only way she could mess with the gamer girl; Hajime would do it to...hear her laugh. Of course, those were all mostly inculpable motives (even if the tickler would conventionally not back off until she was in tears), so the lick on her neck was rather unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, it seems wike my widdle Nanami is a widdle tickwish~\u201d Junko commenced the teasing baby talk, her face the same distance a sit was when Chiaki had woken up, the girl taking the knife and beginning to shred Chiaki\u2019s apparel into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, a scarcely exasperated-looking Chiaki was wearing nothing more than a bra and jacket-which was cut to abstract her sleeves and expose her armpits. Her shoes were additionally sliced up, revealing her adorable feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiaki was irate and terrified concurrently, the latter being the currently more vigorous emotion. She was an extremely ticklish target and she doesn\u2019t handle torture very well, so she could only hope that someone preserves he-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her hopeful conceptions could be culminated, the girl squeaked as her pudgy belly felt the long, slightly sharp, polished nails of Junko gradually making their way up and down the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!\u201d Chiaki blew up in laughter, Junko finding both an impuissant spot and one of her weaknesses. Her slightly chubby belly was insanely ticklish, and the slower, more teasing tickles absolutely destroyed any attempt the girly and at resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpupupu, looks like someone doesn\u2019t like these long nails~\u201d Junko verbally expressed, licking her lips as she relished the adorable cachinnation being exctracted from the girl. She knew Chiaki was a mentally strong girl, so to try and soften her up, she kept up the teasing tickles while leaning in and breathing onto her neck as she whispered into the gamer\u2019s ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not submit to me now? This could all be over in a moment~\u201d Junko offered, conspicuously telling a prevarication. She wanted to see the hope-filled girl break, and just wanted to give her a ficticiously unauthentic option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiaki kept laughing her loud, angelic laughter. She didn\u2019t beg, or even speak with the Ultimate Despair, as she knew it\u2019d be as fruitless as submitting to Junko. There was no point to verbalizing or listening to the torturer, who\u2019d endeavor and capitalize on her phrenic state being messed with. There was no reason in doing anything but trying to tank all the tickles like a tank class would tank attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, Junko had ceased the torture, unsatisfied that no imploring or such was engendered by the Ultimate Gamer. She checked the stats, and Chiaki had a 10/10 ticklishness on her belly, and she still resisted it so well! (Even if she was in tears and desperately try to regain her breath.) <br>\r\nSo what was the fashionista going to do to make her beg?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, and idea sprang forth in Junko\u2019s head, the Fashionista smiling evily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat idea was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Judging by the fact that they were currently in Maki\u2019s room, it was safe to conclude that Kokichi had privily peregrinated in and commenced to taunt Maki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with neither Kaito nor Shuichi around to pacify her, she soon lashed out truculently after a snide comment was made on Kaito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you to get out of my room for the last three minutes; I tolerated your intrusion of my privacy and constant remarks for longer than I should\u2019ve.\u201d Maki verbalized, her eyes glowing with pure death, the girl looking as if she was ready to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kokichi knew better than that. If she killed him, she\u2019d kill herself, as she\u2019d come clean to the murder right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he wasn\u2019t surprised when he was dropped onto the floor, only smiling inculpably as if he had no malfeasance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow get out before I actually strangle you to death.\u201d The pigtailed girl turned around, heading to the door to open it. She felt something hard hit her back, and optically discerned Kokichi had thrown a gun at her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse it already, I\u2019m getting bored~\u201d He verbally expressed as his face went black, making it very obvious that he had come here to execute a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaki sighed and walked over to him. \u201cFine, if I have, I\u2019ll drag you out.\u201d She said serenely, prehending Kokichi\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn\u2019t expect was the final attack of Kokichi Oma, one that was passed down each generation by all other Oma\u2019s!...which was a lie, but she still didn\u2019t expect for Kokichi of all people to have somehow discovered her most sizably voluminous impotency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she learned the arduous way, which was another way of saying that she soon felt a dyad of hands on her armpits, tickling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTickle tickle, Maki~\u201d Kokichi teased, expecting some remotely bellicose reaction that would make her flinch back. But seeing the girl collapse onto the floor due to relinquishing him and then being stuck in a fit of cachinnation was just so much better for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-NOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!!!!\u201d Maki laughed a surprisingly loud, adorable laugh. With the girl keeping to herself most of the time, auricularly discerning her laugh was something of an astronomically immense surprise, especially when it seemed the tickles made her defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi sighed in assuagement that what Monokuma told him was veridical. Now, it was time for him to consummate a promise he made to Miu, the Ultimate Inventor, and how he did that was by wearing a pair of metallic gloves. He then proceeded to dig right back into the armpits of Maki, the girl\u2019s eyes widening in horror as the gloves took into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWH-HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA???!!!!!!!\u201d Maki\u2019s laughter multiplied, the assassin struggling to elude the tickles. She didn\u2019t know why, but her vigor was gradually diminishing the longer the tickles proceeded, soon making her physically more impuissant than even Kokichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBingo! Just what I wanted!\u201d Kokichi verbally expressed as he felt her body starting to go limp, the minute boy commenced to pick her up. While it was quite the struggle, he managed to get her on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-D-Do you optate to d-d-\u201c Maki tried to say her signature, conventionally menacing line, but it was anon revealed that Kokichi didn\u2019t care, as he held his hands out. After a bit of waiting, thick thread commenced to emerge from the gloves, wrapping the assassin\u2019s hands to the bed posts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi, smiling malevolently, decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>''Well you all voted! Rantaro will be sacrificed! How sickeningly noble of Mr. Amami!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro Amami the Ultimate Adventurer cast his eye's downward. He knew they'd do it. He begged them to do it. He'd pleaded with Tsumugi to let him sacrifice himself to save them and as his platform and her's lowered down he thought to himself that he'd do it all again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-One year later-</div><br>\r\n''Oh Rantaro. Rantaaro wake up.'' the familiar voice of the person who he'd believed to be Tsumugi Shirogane woke him. His eye's slowly opened to her smiling face holding up a protein bar. It was the peanut butter one again, he knew it. He'd told whoever she was once during the Killing Game that he hated peanut butter. Now ever since she'd declared herself his manager that was all he'd eaten for a year. She'd hand feed it to him saying his physique was a big selling point of his popularity and that he'd need the energy for his training session. That had led to 'Monokuma's Special Workout'' 8 hours of Rantaro in weight machine holding a 25 pound weight in an incredibly specific position above his head. If even a single inch was moved the special devices would activate and stiff peacock feathers would whirl in his bare and oiled armpits at a steady pace. Loose shackles keeping his hands above his head but with enough room to incur ''Punishment Time'' if he tried to slack off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his usual daily workout Rantaro was given a fresh set of clothes and underwear and hustled off for a ''press conference'' about his future plans. Tsumugi reassured him by saying ''Nobody's going to hurt you Rantaro. It'll be nobody but your adoring public. They love you to bit's! We'll stop them before they do that so don't worry.''<br>\r\nHe was brought out before a crowd all wearing ''Danganronpa'' shirts and hat's. There were two raised platforms one had a podium with several microphone's Tsumugi took up place there. The other had a set of stocks Rantaro assumed that was his. He was shoved by his ''bodyguards'' towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tsumugi now re-really.''<br>\r\n''Come on now Rantaro-chan we've worked together for a while. You know how your fan's can get. Team Danganronpa needs to protect our product! This is just so you don't get carried off during the ''Fan Interaction'' segment. Alllso call me Tsumugi-kun we are former classmates after all.''<br>\r\n''Still though thi-this is''<br>\r\n''Do you want to disappoint your public? Get in there Rantaro-chan or we'll just have to auction off some merchandise to calm them down. The clothes off your back seem like they'd be in high demand.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagining that this wouldn't be any better for him in his birthday suit Amami bent over towards the opened stocks but was stopped by a heavy hand on his shoulder. He looked back at one of his bodyguards who was shaking his head.<br>\r\n''Other way kid.'' <br>\r\nRantaro was spun around and roughly shoved into the stocks. In unorthodox fashion though he was face up in the bonds so that now he was staring up into the blue sky with his back uncomfortably arched. The support staff clamped in a padlock to keep him there as Tsumugi stepped up to the microphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Upupupu~~ hello all of my fellow fans of Danganronpa!'' the crowd cheered as she continued on.<br>\r\n''Let's announce the first of our lucky winners for fan particpation! Will the two who got 49 and 53 step forward?''<br>\r\nRantaro craned his neck to see two females step forward. One who's sensible pantsuit immediately identified her as a middle aged office lady, The other a heavily tanned teenage girl sporting twin pigtails with Monokuma hairclips to be like her idol. The Ultimate Adventurer swallowed as they climbed the stairs onto the podium taking up positions next to him. The Office Lady lifted up his shirt and blushed while the Wannabe knelt down next to his head and gave him a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n''I can't believe this! It's really you! Ohhh you taste just like I thought. I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN FOR SOOO LONG! I wanted you to survive to the end buuuut I'm not gonna turn this down..'' the high-pitched Wannabe squealed. The Office Lady though wasted no time in digging her fingers into Rantaro's hips. The Ultimate bucked as she stepped over to mount him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Neehaahee Laahadies please we can taaahalk about this pleehse!''<br>\r\nThe Office Lady sneered as she teased Rantaro's hipbone's with her nails. She pinched his left hipbone and drew a circle before turning to her fellow winner.<br>\r\n''We don't know how long we'll have with him girl so I'd suggest doing what you want while you have the chance.'' <br>\r\n''Sorry Rantaro-nii!~ The old lady has a point!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the Wannabe muffled any protests that the Ultimate Adventurer had with a lip lock. Rantaro struggled feebly but between the Wannabe's own obvious skills in tongue twisting and the Office Lady's games with his hips there was really nothing he could do here. As he was led by the tongue and guided by the hips his manager continued her conference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We're very thankful to all of the fans of Danganronpa, The Killing Games and Monokuma himself of course for helping us make Season 52 so great. Rest assured Season 53 is being worked on as we speak and will have something that changes this genre!''<br>\r\n''QUIT BEING SO MODEST WE LOVE YOU TOO TSUMUGI!''<br>\r\n''Tsumugi'' blushed and shot a smile to the fan with the cap who had complimented her before shuffling the cards in her hands.<br>\r\n''Thank you very much! That sweet fan as well whoever has number 71 please step forward and enjoy our participation event!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tsumugi fanboy in the cap as well as an older man in a sweatsuit both stepped forward. The hat boy pulled his cap down but  couldn't really hide his excitement. Neither could the Sweatsuit guy but it seemed to be in a different way. While Hat Kid froze up on the platform, Sweatsuit instead stepped forward with purpose and knelt down by Amami. With a shooing gesture to the Office Lady he pulled down Rantaro's cargo pants to his knees and slapped a hand hard on the boxers clad bottom of the Sacrifice of Season 52. <br>\r\n''Shithead.'' he growled ''You got my favorite girl from last season killed. Had to go solving the murder huh you brat? Should've just died.''<br>\r\n''Hey pervert!'' the Office Lady chimed in ''Your interrupting my prize here!''<br>\r\n''Just give me a second here.'' <br>\r\nHe pulled the boxers down as well before landing a hard open handed slap on the Adventurer's bare and surprisingly bubbly butt. He then laid in another followed by another while shouting.<br>\r\n''SHOULD'VE JUST LEFT IT ALONE! GOT HER KILLED THEN JUST GAVE YOURSELF UP?! SHITTY KID THEN WHAT WAS THE POINT!!''<br>\r\nHe spanked Rantaro's ass hard, fast as many times as he could. Before he could complain though Rantaro mouth was once filled with the Wannabe who chased his tongue around in there like a snake catching it's dinner. The Office Lady smirked at her plaything's situation and watched as the Hat Kid came forward on his hand's and knee's. The boy grabbed ahold of Rantaro's leg and almost ripped off his shoe. The boy stared at Rantaro's socked foot and could barely contain the excited tongue flopping out of his mouth. The Office Lady pulled Rantaro's shirt up and blew long, hard and lovingly blew a raspberry into Rantaro's stomach as the Hat Guy showered the socked foot with kisses while slowly undressing it by pulling off the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumugi answered questions as Rantaro squirmed and bucked in his bonds. The Hat Boy admired and began worshipping his bare foot as she went on. She spoke on the plans for Version Fifty-Three as Rantaro's senses were assaulted on so many different fronts that it was driving him mad. Pleasure from the Wannabe and Office Lady, Pain from the Tracksuit and Confusion at Hat-Boy caressing his toes inside his mouth. The girl formerly known as Tsumugi and now only known as it made a mental note to give Rantaro a break for a while. She hadn't expected the fan's to be peppy today and they were using all that extra energy to torment the Ultimate Adventurer. Hat Boy was licking up and down the bare foot now which was causing Rantaro to moan under his gag that was the Wannabe who would use the reflex to get her own tongue further down his throat. When the Hat Kid took Rantaro's wiggling and desperate toes into his mouth like a fish to bait that's when Tsumugi decided...</span></div></div>",

I'm super happy to be-''<br>\r\n''That's nice your already in so calm sweetie.''<br>\r\n''I'm sorry but I'm just so excited to be here with my favorite Danaganronpa characters! I loved you and Rantaro last season!''<br>\r\n''Oh stop you'll make blush. Don't stop our Ultimate Adventurer's massage though. He's earned his break I think.''<br>\r\n''Yes, Yes of course. Does it feel good Rantaro-chan?''<br>\r\n''Yeah...it feel's good. '' the tired teen responded still wary that there was a trick on the way. After a long and exhaustive Q&amp;A, Rantaro had been unlocked and hustled off stage back to the limo by Tsumugi's guards who had brought along the boy in the hat at her orders. She'd decided that the skill that the young Shuichi had shown would be a nice a reward for Rantaro after a few of daily exercises and photoshoots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the limo shuttled the three of them away the fact that the fan's were already buzzing about the two of them together was something she'd not get in the way of as she checked her phone for the updates. Still though Rantaro's fan's were watching these 24/7 streams for his suffering as much as his sweetness. As she emptied the packet of powder adorned with a Monokuma into Rantaro's sneakers that would be for keeping him in line later but for now as she checked her phone for the latest numbers on the Danganronpa fan's watching Rantaro's live-streams she smirked as they continued to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRantaro didn't trust this new addition to his new post Killing Game life but was finding it hard to resist the new boy Saihara's massaging of his back (He'd sweated straight through his clothes again at fan appreaciation.) and growing less aware of his surroundings by the second because of it. It was too tempting for the Ultimate Cosplayer to resist though. Something about the new boy Saihara was drawing to her so she looped her his shoulders and pulled him over to her. She lightly tickled the not quite all there fanboy's belly and delighted that his laugh was as cute as he was and checking her viewers count apparently so did the fans. She indulged herself in pulling up the comment's so that she could see them gush live...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirlGenius473: I thought Tsumugi and Rantaro were too perfect together but now this new boy has me interested....<br>\r\nToeTiggler7: It's so nice seeing Rantaro happy! He should be really that they didn't pick my number at that fan appreciation. I'd have seen if those toes of his are as ticklish as I heard on the message boards. No loving stuff like the new boy. I'd have twiddled those piggies till they came off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she'd thought they were buying into this big time. As she made a note to reach out to ToeTiggler7 in her head she pinched at the young Mr. Saihara's belly getting him laughing for the fans. Shuichi didn't even try to bat her hands away and actually pulled his shirt up to give her easier access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''M-myhehe belly button's too ticklish Tsumuhugi.''<br>\r\n''Oh is that so? Such a sweet boy.''<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the ''Ultimate Cosplayer'' played with the boy's navel, Rantaro felt a twinge of sympathy and stepped in trying to separate the two but was stopped at the sound of a metallic clink securing his wrists to the seat. He pulled at them to no avail as Tsumugi laughed and let Shuichi fall into a giggling heap on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well done Sweetchi but the people watch these for Rantaro not you. Though with some time I'm sure we can mold you into something special.''<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers and another set clamped around his waist keeping him still. She laughed haughtily as he pulled futilely at the clamps. She pulled on his feet into her lap as he gave up on trying to muscle his way out and moved on to begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh-how?!''<br>\r\n''Do you really think we wouldn't have some fun things in here? C'mon Rantaro it's like you hate your fans! I'm just giving all your fans a show!''<br>\r\n''Tsumugi c'mon please we were all having a good time! Why are you ruining it like this?!''<br>\r\n''I'm still having a good time though Rantaro. Are you not? Ohh you aren't are you? I can tell by the look on your face! What's the matter?''<br>\r\nTsumugi stroked a finger down the boy's sole watching the numbers climb and his toes jolt. Rantaro drew his legs away as best as he could despite his bonds. She pouted before having an idea form in her head on how to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ohhh Sweetchi! Could you help me and Rantaro-nii here a bit?''<br>\r\n''Yes! Of course what can I do Tsumugi!?''<br>\r\n''C'mon on over here and sit on our stars leg's Mr. Fanboy! I think he's coming down with cold feet! Hold him still so I can warm them on up!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi climbed up and sat across the backs of The Ultimate Adventurer's legs pinning his feet helplessly to his ''Manager's'' lap. She ran her fingers lightly down her captives soles getting her star smiling despite himself. She picked at the ball of his foot and admired the pink soles and soft skin. Rantaro's scheduled sessions with the Ultimate Pedicurist were definitely worth it. Every single blister and callus had been scrubbed or sanded off and all that was left was a pair of size 12's without a single bit of hard skin that were just a delight to the girl's fingers. She scratched her nails from the big toe down making loops until reaching his heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tsuhuhmugieheheeee!!~''<br>\r\n''What was that Rantaro?! I'm afraid I was reading these comments instead of paying attention to my star.''<br>\r\nToeTiggler7: The toes Tsusmugi! THOSE TOES NEED TWIDDLING! THEY'RE BEGGING FOR YOUR ATTTENTION!<br>\r\nDespair4Lurv: Rantaro-nii's feet are a dream!! They look like you could sleep on them!<br>\r\nCol.11037HA:How could anybody sleep when they were that close to the Ultimate Dreamboat!?!<br>\r\n''They love it! Rantaro your fans are almost as happy as you are! Shuichi isn't it great how they're all laughing together!?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumugi dragged her nails down the soles towards the heels which she pinched and teased causing her captive Rantaro to bite into the upholstery of the seat rather than give her the satisfaction of laughing with them. Tsumugi barely paid attention Rantaro's small defiance's though cause instead she found herself unable to look away from the fanboy's smiling face.She didn't want to stop looking at it so she had an idea just as great as that first killing game. She reached up and grabbed ahold of her new cutie Saihara and pulled him over so that he landed on his back. She carefully positioned her pretty pawn so that his head fit snugly between those adventurous soles she was punishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tsu-Tsumugi!?''<br>\r\n''Sweetchi support staff are to be seen and not heard. So shush now and be a good looking prop. Are your legs still holding down Rantaro?''<br>\r\n''Ye-Yes Tsumugi.''<br>\r\n''That's good and on a scale of one to ten how ticklish would you say your ears are?''<br>\r\n''Like a Nine?''<br>\r\n''BAD PROPS GET TICKLED FOR LYING SWEETCHI!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumugi picked at Shuichi sensitive ears and simultaneously tickled along the sides of Rantaro's soles getting her fanboy giggling and her star to tear out a mouthful of the cushion. She clucked her tongue at Rantaro's childish action before snapping her fingers once more summoning another set of clamps to secure around Shuichi's waist and Rantaro's legs sealing both boys movements and keeping Shuichi good and stuck between his new pillows. He tried to say something but before he could Shirogane shoved her fingers into his mouth. She pulled them out and started scraping them up Rantaro's quivering soles driving him up the wall on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''AHAHAAGGHHAAAHAASTAHHPGAAHADAAHAHAHAMMNN!!''<br>\r\n''Tsk,tsk Rantaro such language in front of a minor? Sweetchi you didn't pick up anything bad there did you?''<br>\r\n''Mi-Miss Tsumugi ple-please wait! Let me go!''<br>\r\n''Aww cold feet? Want me to warm them up?''<br>\r\n''N-no wait please!''<br>\r\n''PUNISHMENT TIME!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that a pair of Monokuma's entered and went to work with their prep. The robot's went to work using their claws to tear out the laces of Shuichi's shoes and pull them off the lad exposing his socked feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToeTiggler69: THEY'RE SO CUTE!! SOOO CUTE LOOK AT HIS LITTLE TOES! GET THOSE CUTE LITTLE TREASURES THEIR OWN SHOW!!<br>\r\nKamakuraQween8: Those Monokuma sock's are too precious! That is soooo cute. I love this kid! Great catch Tsumugi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Monokuma's pulled off Shuichi's socks and handed one to Tsumugi. One of them then took other and fashioned it into a blindfold for Rantaro who knew better than to fight it at this point but once again regretted all his decision when they yanked down his cargo pants to his ankles along with his silken boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''TSUMUGI! HEY THIS ISN'T FUNNY! YOU-YOU SAID NO MORE 18+ STUFF WITHOUT WARNING!!!''<br>\r\n''Yeah I did...but you got a new little brother so it even now!''<br>\r\n''NO IT ISN'T!''<br>\r\n''It's plain to see your unhappy but all of your fans are going rabid over you and Sweetchi here. So we've gotta put on a show here or risk a riot! What better way to break in Danganronpa's newest star Shuichi than with this new Punishment?''<br>\r\n''Wait- What?! I love Danganronpa b-but I'm not part of it!''<br>\r\n''Sorry Sweetchi but you're plainly wrong.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsumugi went on a device popped right between Rantaro's legs and in front of Shuichi's feet. It resembled a shaft and had to set's of leather straps sticking out of it. The Monokuma's pulled Rantaro into position to strap his penis and testicles to it as well as both of Shuichi's feet. They ran a pair of metal wires as well around Rantaro's genitals so he wouldn't be able to move them at all and another to tie back Saihara's toes so that his soles were taut and immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You see Mr. Fanboy we had some people visit your parents today. In exchange for the amount of money and to see their sweetie on the most popular series....EVER!! they were more than happy to sign you over to Team Danganronpa! How would you like to be an Ultimate Detective? A Boy Detective would be a fun new ''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That's when the feather's emerged from the device.</span></div></div>",
