Though I suppose that's just a mage...though I doubt that naive child even has the potential to use magic!\" Iago laughed as he finished concocting his potion, pouring it into a glass bottle. It bubbled and churned, glowing a faint purple color. \"No matter. If he can't move...Then my job is done. Now, how to convince him to drink it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin had returned to his treehouse dwelling after a hard day of battle and work. While he initially planned to grab a snack before resting, a purple glow was sitting on his side table. \"Huh?\" As he approached it, he realized it was actually a vial of a purple liquid. A small note was attached to it- <i>Dearest Corrin, please enjoy this lovely drink for all your hard work.Your secret admirer, - I</i> \"Aww, how nice!\" Said the oh so naive Corrin. He popped off the cap of the drink, a purple ethereal mist floated up from it. Corrin thought for a moment. This did just pop out of nowhere. Was there anyone in the army with the letter I as the first letter of their name...? Hmm. There was Izana. It also could've been a stylized L, for Lilith? Eh, who would've gotten into his room to poison him? He decide not to doubt and drank down the liquid. It certainly was sweet, and overwhelmingly so. Perhaps the brewer was still getting their legs about brewing. And then...it hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started in his stomach. A loud growl. \"What's this...feeling?\" The bubbling in his gut was becoming uncomfortable. Discomfort turned to pain, as he doubled over. \"Guh...That smarts...\" And a lurch. He felt his abdomen begin to jut out. \"H-Huh? My belly?!\" As the bubbling continued, Corrin's belly followed, growing outward, jabbing into his armor. His armor was specifically tailored to a certain size, so it certainly wasn't helping the growing pains. He felt himself stifle a burp. \"This...isn't what I expected!\" Corrin wasn't sure if this was better or worse than poison. His belly continued to grow outwards, causing the armor to shift out of place, loosening under the new constraints of Corrin's ballooning girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was spreading. Corrin felt it in his hips, beginning to push outwards and thicken, his frail black pants stretching out to accommodate for his rapidly increasing size. His butt wasn't safe either, going from somewhat toned to a pair plushy cheeks in a moment. The armor on his legs began to dismantle as well, being pushed apart by layers of new flesh. Tears began forming down the sides of his tights, obviously never meant for the size he was growing to. Pale blubber stuck through the tears, ripping them ever further as his figure became ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was fairing no better, jutting out rather far now. The plated armor covering his abdomen finally began to snap off, ricocheting off the floor. Then another piece, and another, until his bare belly was exposed. He stared on in horror as the armor on his legs started popping off as well. He finally snapped out of it- He had to do <i>something</i>, but what? Given what had happened so far, if he was growing at this point like this he would no doubt be unable to move within the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can I do?\" He pondered.</span></div></div>",

He began waddling towards the exit of his home, just managing to squeeze out of the door. His gurgling gut burst off another piece of armor as he entered into the night. Crickets sung as Corrin stumbled his way into the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...Finding help.\" He gazed through the fort, looking for anyone who might've been awake. Who would know how to take care of potions?...<i>Leo</i>. His brother would help, no doubt about it...Oh no, wasn't he on the other side of the fort though? That...wasn't optimal. Maybe it'd be better just to find anyone near by. There were a lot of people who knew magic here, especially curses, like Nyx and Odin. Surely he'd stumble into one of them, right?...He didn't have much time. His quivering belly was growing bigger, and his legs weren't helping as they continued to expand. He heard a ripping noise as the seat of his pants burst out, much to his embarrassment. He began his great trek once again, waddling off into the night to find...</span></div></div>",

Surely he had received a gift or something left behind by one of them that could help. First thing he saw was Yato. It was a legendary sword, but...didn't really that unless he was cutting himself open. Which would likely kill him. As his belly continued to widen, he realized that the expansion was getting faster! He needed to work fast now. He waddled towards one of his drawer sets and began going through them as fast as possible. \"Clothes, books, more clothes, knickknacks...Here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin had pulled out a drawer filled with different potions, each shining a rainbow of different colors. Camilla, Elise, and Leo always gave him their experimental brews. Usually they had positive effects, and sometimes did nothing- there was once or twice something out of control happened, but they always got in back under control. So it could go poorly, but it could also go exceptionally well to offset the spreading fat. Speaking of, he was still growing. Quite large, actually. He heard a <i>riiiip</i> as his butt blew out the back of his pants, and a <i>gloooorp</i> as his belly filled out further, tearing even more of his armor apart. He had walked in a warrior, and had now descended into an swollen and bloated excuse for a prince. The feeling was spreading all throughout his body, spreading to his chest, neck, and cheeks. Those were about to blow up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to pick a drink. It was better than doing nothing. As he felt his chest begin to swell up, Corrin chose a...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't complain if it helped, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemly worked, the gurgling of his stomach settling down, his swelling rear stopping in it's tracks, and chestplate, while snug, held on true. He decided to check the tag to see if it had any effects. It seemed this was one of Elise's potions, specifically a healing one. Essentially, the potion was more for mild bruising and cuts, and was supposed to be...poured on? Well, drinking it suddenly seemed like a bad idea. There was a sudden tightness in his chest...And then his chestplate burst off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo fleshy orbs were to blame, making quick work of Corrin's undershirt. His new set of moobs sat atop his belly, as it roared back to life. The sudden weight caused Corrin to nearly stumbled right onto his stomach, but he kept up- partly because another wave of fat hit his rump, splitting the tear ever further. His neck gained a layer of blubber, adding a chin to the single one Corrin already had. The base of his arms began to distend, further destroying his already ruined armor, and his cheeks bubbled up in size, restricted his mouth. \"Gah!\" The prince grunted, as his shirt tore off completely, thanks to his fattened pectorals. His boobs could rival Camilla's at this point, perhaps even past her size, and he wasn't even supposed to have them! He attempted to push them back where they came from, but already knew it was pointless. What could he do though?...There were still more potions left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to pick another, and time was running out. His pants tore ever further as he continued to balloon every which way, and wouldn't take much more. Neither could he, really, a little more weight and he'd be on the floor. And once he went down, he doubted he had the strength to get back up.</span></div></div>",
