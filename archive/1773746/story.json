Then, he places you in a baby seat and straps you in. Afterwards, he sits in the driver's seat and proceeds to drive home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the car ride, you feel safe and secure, as if nothing is going to hurt you. You feel happy to be going home with such a nice man as the host as your daddy.

Kevin Anderson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our contestant tonight is Heather.\" The host continues. \"She will be risking his adulthood for the chance to win up to 10 million dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spotlight illuminates a confused woman. You guess that no one has told her the rules of this game yet either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curtain drops, revealing on one side of the stage a plie of money and on the other a Chronotron, Suddenly the show makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know it's almost impossible to obtain reproduction permits.\" The host explains. \"The only alternative is to find a willing volunteer to be physically regressed to childhood and adopt them. Tonight, if Heather fails to win the money, she will be that volunteer for one lucky couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approaches the woman. \"Now, before we begin, you must decide how much to risk. Will you risk being returned to the age of 6 for the chance to win 2 million or risk being returned to the age of one to play for 10 million dollars?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll play for 2 million.\" She answers timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the the audience responds with applause, others boo her lack of courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules are simple.\" the host explains. \"I will ask you 20 questions. If you get more right than wrong then you'll take home 2 million dollars. If you get more wrong then you'll soon have a much earlier bedtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions start easy and Heather seems to find some confidence early on. However harder questions follow and she begins to look more afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you did after all 20 questions.\" the host says when the round is over. There is a drum-roll and a large screen displays Heather's score. \"Oh no. You have 9 right and 10 wrong. You know what that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shakes her head. \"No. Please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo large men appear and lead her to the chronotron, locking her in the transparent glass chamber. She begins to cry while the audience cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host pushes a large red button and the chronotron comes to life with flashing lights. Soon Heather begins to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it's over, her skirt has fallen off her far-too skinny waist. Fortunately her blouse is almost long enough to reach the floor. She looks like a little girl who has dressed up in her mother's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pod opens and an attractive woman approaches the girl and leads her back to her chair in the middle of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits there in here baggy blouse, crying as a man and woman are led onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time to meet your new mommy and daddy.\" The host introduces the couple. \"Mr and Mrs Thompson here's your new little girl, Heather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey run over and hug the girl as music starts and the credits roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the screen pondering what you just saw.

While he was dressing you, you noticed something peeking out of his pajama pants, it looked like a pull up. \"Are you wearing a pull up too?\" You asked curiously. He laughed a little, embarrassed. \"Technically it's a goodnite.\" He replied. \"I pee the bed sometimes.\" He admitted. \"Do you wear 'em in the day too?\" You asked. He replied</span></div></div>",

Then a fake look lf surprise hit his face, and then he was pushing out a large load into his pull up. \"See, I just pooped my pants and I'm 12! You're what 4 or 5?

Its hers.<br>\r\nYou know all too well what she'll say. She'll try to stop you, to get back together, tell you to find a job... perhaps she was right. Perhaps you aren't at the end of your rope after all. Perhaps you could answer and let her talk you out of it. Let her take control of your life again. Let her live off you again. Let her shout and yell at you, and blame you for everything. Let her offer you comfort when you need it. No, thats not the head, but the heart that's talking.

Players who aren't regressed win a portion of the money bet against them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this get us a baby?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When signing up to be a contestant, all applicants must submit the name of a caretaker and the caretaker must be in attendance during the game,\" You read the answer aloud from the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we need to get someone to volunteer for us,\" Jessica sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we don't,\" You say, turning to Jessica. \"I'll be a contestant and list you as my caretaker. If I win, then we'll win a bunch of money and can apply for a permit. If I lose, then you can be my mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hugged you tightly before giving you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much,\" Jessica said in between kisses. \"I can't believe that you're willing to do this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished making out with Jessica you filed all of the appropriate paperwork to the casino. It would not be long before you received a response. You waited patiently while Jessica stroked your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to have a baby,\" Jessica purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou received a response from the casino within minutes. A Regression Roulette game was planned for the following evening. This game had quite the following and was going to be broadcast live. They would send a limo for you the following day to ensure that you and Jessica arrived promptly to the casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to bed baby,\" Jessica whispered as she licked your ear. \"Mommy wants to give her special boy a treat tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stood up and walked towards the bedroom. You watched her hips sway as she left you alone. Your pants had grown significantly tighter and your heart was racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to you, were you really serious about going through with this ridiculous wager? Did you really want to risk your manhood over money? Jessica seemed certain that you would be regressed. There was an opt-out clause in the contract. You still had time to change your mind. On the other hand, Jessica was waiting. What's the worst that could happen?</span></div></div>",

Once inside your bedroom, you find Jessica lying on the bed in a nightie. You smiled at your girlfriend; she knew that the nightie she was wearing was your favorite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, baby,\" Jessica purred as she patted the bed next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over and sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" Jessica interrupted. \"You can't get into bed like that. You need to change into your pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica moved behind you and lifted your shirt up and over your head. She then reached around you and undid your belt before unzipping your pants. You relaxed as you let Jessica undress you. Moaning in pleasure, you closed your eyes as Jessica stuck her hand under the hem of your boxers and slowly pulled them down your pants. No wonder Jessica was always turned on whenever you undressed her; there was something empowering and erotic about letting go and letting your partner take control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce fully nude, Jessica pushed you down onto the bed. You lay on your back and looked up at your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy has a special treat for her special little guy,\" Jessica whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later you felt Jessica's mouth wrap around you penis. A loud moan of pleasure erupted from your lips as Jessica moved up and down. Her tongue licked and tickled its way over every inch of your manhood. Soon you were exploding down Jessica's throat and she swallowed everything you offered. You couldn't remember the last time she had done that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my baby feeling?\" Jessica asked as she lay next to you and rested her head on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel amazing,\" You whispered. \"I love you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too,\" Jessica replied. \"I can't wait for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you feel asleep in each other's arms. It was the happiest you had been in years. Your night was filled with happy dreams and you awoke feeling refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the limo arrived the following afternoon you were feeling like a million bucks. You were certain that you were going to become filthy rich off this little stunt of yours. The limo driver and all of the staff at the casino were courteous to you as you made your way to the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on stage, you found yourself surrounded by twenty-three other contestants; most of the contestants were male, but there were a few females mixed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get started,\" The emcee announced loudly through the microphone. \"We have one final offer to all twenty-four contestants. If you choose to skip the roulette and be regressed immediately, we will pay you and your caretaker a grand total of 500,000 Union Credits. This of course, will forfeit your chance to win any more money throughout the evening. However, this also prevents you from walking away empty handed. You might be asking, what's in this for us? Everything with Regression Roulette is a gamble. Right now, people are betting on who is going to accept the offer. Think it over, you've got thirty seconds to decide!\"</span></div></div>",

Did people really think you were going to bail on the game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contestant pool was now down to sixteen people. Each person stood on a number at random. The first spin seemed to last an hour. All of the eyes were glued to the wheel. As the wheel slowed down you breathed a sigh of relief. You only had twenty-three more spins to survive. The unlucky contestant wailed in exasperation at his unfortunate luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to act like a baby just yet,\" The announcer declared. \"If your number is hit again then you'll be spared the Chronotron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty-two more wheel spins were played.

You don't want to be hungry on the long ride to your new house! It'll take over an hour to get there!\" She scoops you into her arms and carries you to a baby chair positioned at a table. She slips you into the chair and ties a bib around your neck and walks out of your sight. This is not happening, you think to yourself, but in the back of your regressed baby mind, you know that it is. Sophia then returns with a jar and a small spoon. \"Now open wide!

Once you agreed to our terms we sent an extraction team to your apartment to bring you here. Don't worry, all of your possessions have already been sold and your lease has been terminated. The money from the sale will be put into a trust fund. Once you fulfill your obligation you will be released and entitled to all of the principal and interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I dressed like a baby?\" You ask, finally realizing what you're wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you agreed to,\" The nurse replied. \"We specialize in servicing Chronotons.

We have a wheel of ages, and a wheel of parents. If you spin the wheel of ages then we'll regress you to that age and you'll go home with the parents who chose that age.
