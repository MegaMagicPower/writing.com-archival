You move your mouse and scroll over the screen, reading an email sent from your old classmate. You shift in the chair, feeling your butt is going asleep on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been in your room for hours. Looking at the newest anime and having heated debates with Hero Aca.\u2019s version of Reddit. You won\u2019t call this a life. A stay at home life. You can\u2019t even keep a job. And you had such a bright future too. Till you found your quirk never manifested. Somehow, it broke your spirit. It\u2019s not like you were aiming to be a Hero. Not really....... but it certainty made you feel like an outcast. Your parents did try to be supportive but you couldn\u2019t help but imagine to worst of yourself. Now you lock yourself in your room, not stepping out unless it\u2019s for school or food. (<i>Is this really the case or is it a lie? Your choice.</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the email sent by your old friend. The one who supported you always. Always sneaking dirty magazines to you, though you do have the internet. Which you had tried telling your friend but they won\u2019t give up trying to find other ways to connect with you, always coming over to visit. This person hasn\u2019t been seeing you as much now, with everything that has been going on at U.A. However, that doesn\u2019t stop this person from emailing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis newest email is an ad for U.A.\u2019s Culture festival. Why would your friend send you this? You can only assume your friend is asking you to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over your dark room. It is so messy. Sniffing yourself, you realize you might need to take a shower. You look back at the email. After thinking about it for a bit, you message back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Alright, just for you. See you tomorrow.\u2019 You smile when you sent that. At least you know you still have someone you can still count on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn off the computer and head off to bed. It\u2019s 3:00 in the morning. Kinda early for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, your alarm went off and you flop yourself out of bed. 7:00am? Too early. You were about to head off to bed till you remember your promise. Groan. No backing out now. You took a shower and put on the nicest clothes you have. U.A. is across the city. You think. You should have checked for directions last night but you are already out the door. You can always ask someone for directions. You actually started to feel a bit excited to spend time with your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking 5 blocks into the city, you realize you are lost. Checking the time, it\u2019s 7:35. The Cultural Festival starts at 8:00, right? You start quickening your pace, looking at your phone to keep an eye on the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of no where, you bumped into someone. You were taken aback and fell on your butt. \u201cOuch.\u201d You look up and see...</span></div></div>",

You accepted her offer, grabbing her hand. As you got up, you felt strange, almost like your body is lighter than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019m so sorry I ran into you like that.\u201d You feel a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big round brown eyes looks you over, checking for any injuries. Finding nothing wrong, the U.A. student smiled. There is genuine joy on her face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I wasn\u2019t looking out to where I was going either. I lived in this city my whole life so I can get little careless.\u201d She is so polite too. So this is a pro hero in training. U.A. must be one amazing school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl is wearing U.A. school uniform. A gray jacket with a bit of dark green lines located at the wrists and shoulders, a red tie over a white shirt and a dark green skirt. Also she is wearing some black tights. Wait... tights? Is that part of the school uniform? In all of the image\u2019s you\u2019ve seen, non of the girls wear tights. Huh. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/WjXdqM\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/WjXdqM</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute. Shouldn\u2019t you get going? You are running behind. \u201cOh no. I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d Damn, this is what you get for sleeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLate for what?\u201d The brown hair U.A. student asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU.A. has a Culture Festival going on right now. My friend invited me but I don\u2019t know where U.A. is.\u201d This is bad. You don\u2019t want to let your friend down. Maybe you should look up directions on your phone. You feel pretty dumb not thinking about that till now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up your phone, looking up the address. The U.A. student ponder before speaking up. \u201cI can take you to U.A.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up from your phone. \u201cYou can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe U.A. student smiled. \u201cSure I can. Besides, I don\u2019t think U.A. would simply let a non student like you in if you walk to the front gate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Wait, wasn\u2019t there something in the news about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe U.A. student shook her head. \u201cWe have had one too many villain related incidents recently. Even if we didn\u2019t, the school isn\u2019t known to be accepting of the public. As, you know, a caution against villains.\u201d Oh, rrriiiggghhhttt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite, slender teenage girl suddenly grabs your hands. \u201cLet\u2019s get going. If we wait around any longer, we\u2019ll miss the first event.\u201d You can feel pads on her finger tips as she held your hand, pulling you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, her hand feels like she has really fair skin. \u201cW-what\u2019s your name?\u201d You just realized you haven\u2019t introduced each other yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe U.A. Students turns her head to look back on you. \u201cMy name is Ochaco Uraraka. Student No. 5 in Class 1A.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \u201cHello <span class=\"cpink\">Uraraka</span>. <span class=\"cbrown\">My</span> <span class=\"cpink\">name</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">is</span>...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Hunter hopes they are doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka slowed her pace. \u201cActon Hunter? Are you foreign?\u201d She lets go of Hunter\u2019s hand as they turned a corner. Hunter rubs his hand a bit because Uraraka tugged on it a bit forceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah. My parents are both from out the country. They moved here for work and I was born after they settled in.\u201d Hunter said. He fidgets with a coin he had in his pocket. \u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents have been living here their whole lives. Both of them are in construction, building structures around the city. They work really hard, working tirelessly around the clock.\u201d Uraraka smiled. Hunter could see how much she must adore her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Hunter notice Uraraka grow a little sad for some reason. Hunter decides not to push further. He just met the girl and they probably won\u2019t see each other again once they reach U.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter is 3/4 German and 1/4 Hispanic on his mother side. Dirty blond hair with a bit of slickness to it. His skin is darker than Uraraka\u2019s but you can\u2019t tell at first glance. He has a small nose and wide eyes, giving off the impression that he has a lot of interest in the world. He is 3 inches taller than Uraraka and while he is mostly slim, he does got a little chubby-ness on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter is wearing casual clothes compare to Uraraka\u2019s standard U.A. uniform, wearing nice, deep blue jeans and wearing a green, plaid shirt, button up in the middle. He figured he can\u2019t go too formal, it is a festival after all. It had occurred to him if his face looked a little meaner, he might be mistaken for a delinquent. He tugged on his jeans, making sure they didn\u2019t fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, that\u2019s nice. Construction is a very important job in our society. I imagine how much the people would suffer from hero and villain clashes if someone wasn\u2019t there to construct them back or improve on what we already have.\u201d You wish you had something more clever to say. It\u2019s just that you don\u2019t know that much about construction to make better compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work because Uraraka\u2019s spirit went back up. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be happy to tell them that.\u201d And they continue walking in silence for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later, the U.A. school was in sight. Or at least you think so. It looks a bit different from the photos of it online. You look back on your phone. \u201cUm... we are going to be late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to Uraraka and there is this really intense expression coming from her. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We should run.\u201d Uraraka took off and you put the coin back in your pocket before chasing off after her. It\u2019s almost 8:00! Please <span class=\"cpink\">don\u2019t</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">miss</span> <span class=\"cpink\">opening</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">announcements</span>. </span></div></div>",

His blue and white sneakers hit the cement sidewalk, carefully to dodge incoming people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka doesn\u2019t seem to share this problem. She looks like she is jogging while Hunter struggles to keep up. So this is a U.A. student. They are really keeping their students in shape. Hunter looks at Uraraka\u2019s legs. Even through her pantyhose, Hunter could see Uraraka\u2019s legs look tone and firm. It\u2019s makes sense the school would be working on her stamina to becoming a hero. He just wish she would slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka suddenly stops. Hunter stop as well. \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d He asked after catching his breath and asking why he didn\u2019t just die right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouldn\u2019t even bother getting an answer. He looks up and sees a float. It seems to have crashed. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the attractions for the Culture Festival. They must have gotten permission to make and retrieve it.\u201d Uraraka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe float looks... weird. It\u2019s a balloon of All Might and a really big one too. The balloon looks... well, bad. Sort of sloppily made. It looks kinda deflated right now, blocking the street. You say kinda because it\u2019s not completely deflated. You can see some air, or that is what you think it is, holding All Might up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird, because getting a float outside the school would be counted as a security flaw, but Hunter doesn\u2019t question it further. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we keep going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka looks around, since we can\u2019t go straight. \u201cThere!\u201d Uraraka pointed to a street to the left, and an alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka takes off. She seems determine to get to the Culture Festival as well. As you trail behind her, Hunter seem to realize that he forgot ask her why she was in the city in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the left street, Uraraka takes a right and Hunter follows. There is an unexpected drop, as the alleyway is at a down hill. Uraraka waits for Hunter before going down it. Hunter follows, trying not to be left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, tired, couldn\u2019t keep his footing, falls forward, with a girlish scream. Uraraka hears it and turns back only to see him fall on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter lands on her back and the both of you fall on some cardboard, that slide on the floor, taking off some of the impact. Hunter slides five feet down the drop before the cardboard stops. He doesn\u2019t even notice the glow around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter is dazed and disoriented. The fall scared him bad and took the wind out of him. Lucky for him, he landed in something soft.

It wasn\u2019t the alley floor. It\u2019s like he is sitting in between the crevice of two firm water beds. And it kinda smell bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter eyes grew wide. Something is wrong. The buildings. They are so much bigger. That side door too. It\u2019s huge! What happen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shifted, and felt a cold draft. He look down and finds himself naked. \u201cWhat the...?\u201d He whispers in bewilderment. Hunter is small, and not only small but he had shrunk out of his clothes! He looks down and can see his shirt laying a foot away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGroan...\u201d Hunter can hear a loud noise coming from behind him. He looks back to find Uraraka, laying on the ground. However, Uraraka seems a tad bigger. Doesn\u2019t it seem like Hunter is on top of her? Hunter looks down. He find himself sitting comfortably on Uraraka\u2019s skirt between her butt cheeks, explaining why he isn\u2019t sitting on cement. That\u2019s... kind of hot, actually. But a problem. He should find a way off of her before she finds him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could do anything, Uraraka wakes up and slowly rolls off her belly to a sit up position. The ground quickly approaches Hunter. Acting fast, Hunter pulls a Legend of Zelda move and tuck n\u2019 roll to escape any fall damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka sits up. \u201cOwey.\u201d She rubs her hurting forehead. She must have bumped it in the fall. Looking around, she can\u2019t seem to find Hunter. \u201cHunter?\u201d She calls out, with no response. Where did he go? Did he run into her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she spies her left shoe that had slipped off and is laying a couple feet from her. Uraraka sighs. Well, this is a pleasant start of her day. She push down on the ground and picked herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad that he survived not getting injured from falling from Uraraka butt, Hunter looks behind him. He heard Uraraka calling for him but didn\u2019t reply because he is worried how she would react to him in this state. He watches Uraraka stand up and make her way to her shoe. Which is passed Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter\u2019s blood drain when he realized Uraraka didn\u2019t notice him. And she was coming this way.

Hunter yells again and Uraraka turned her attention downward. \u201cH-hunter?\u201d She is surprised to find a tiny Hunter in front of her. Uraraka blushed and turn her gaze away when she noticed Hunter is naked and has both of his hands covering his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter, what are you doing? Why are you naked?\u201d Uraraka asked, in her seemingly booming voice. She isn\u2019t surprised by Hunter\u2019s appearance as much as one might think, because the world is filled with different quirks. She is surprised that Hunter isn\u2019t wearing any clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blush. He does not like this anymore than Uraraka. Being naked in front of a girl he just met a half an hour is not how he thought his day was going to go. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. I tripped and bumped into you. Next thing I know, I\u2019m small and naked.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter doesn\u2019t mention the part where he woke up on Uraraka\u2019s butt. The whole thing is clearly an accident.

She is having trouble hearing Hunter. \u201cIsn\u2019t this part of your quick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pain shot through Hunter\u2019s heart. A perfectly normal question, except no way Hunter could have done this. He\u2019s quirkless, isn\u2019t he? \u201cActually no, I\u2019m quirkless. I thought this was because of your quirk.\u201d And be able to change him back. He\u2019s friend is waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka shook her head. Knowing Hunter isn\u2019t doing any of this on purpose, she turn back to Hunter, but made sure she was looking only at his eyes. \u201cNo, my quirk is Zero Gravity. Anything I touch, I can make weightless or float. It doesn\u2019t change size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter frown. \u201cBut... that means I can\u2019t change back?\u201d Hunter feels a little panicked. \u201cWhat am I going to do? I can\u2019t stay like this. I need to get to U.A. or I\u2019ll let my friend down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka tries to comfort him. \u201cI\u2019m sure your friend would understand that you can\u2019t make it because of... circumstances.\u201d Uraraka\u2019s eyes darted over Hunter\u2019s body. She couldn\u2019t help it. She just felt more comfortable with the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter hung his head. \u201cActually, no, I don\u2019t think so. My friend has been inviting me to events for years now. I\u2019ve... always been avoiding them and telling my friend some story. Most of them involving quirks. \u2018Sorry, couldn\u2019t come because I was turned into a tire and back.\u2019 or \u2018I couldn\u2019t help it, I was taken prisoner by a Sludge monster.\u2019\u201d Hunter looks really down. Uraraka felt bad for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe more and more I said those things, the less my friend invited me. This is actually the first Time in half a year that I heard from my friend. I think this is my last chance.\u201d Hunter said. He felt like crying, because how much it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka didn\u2019t say anything. She close her eyes and think. After a moment, she open her eyes and looked at Hunter. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take you to U.A. to find your friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter lifts his head. \u201cReally?\u201d Is she taking time out her day for him? \u201cI-I mean, I didn\u2019t tell you that for you to go out of your way to help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka made a kind smile. \u201cI already said I\u2019d bring you to U.A. Besides, what kind of hero ignores someone in trouble?\u201d Uraraka straightens her back and puffs out her chest, making her seem heroic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked a little silly to Hunter that he laughed. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll accept your help, Ms. Hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka smiles and looked at your clothes. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to bring those with me. U.A. security would stop me if I were to bring in suspicious clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter frown. \u201cWhat about me? Wouldn\u2019t they stop us if they found a naked, 5 inch boy trying to get into U.A.?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka nodded and frown. \u201cI\u2019m not carrying a bag with me and my uniform doesn\u2019t have any pockets to hide you in either.\u201d Uraraka\u2019s face gets intense while she is thinking this through. Hunter isn\u2019t coming up with anything either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Uraraka thought of something. She felt uneasy about it but she isn\u2019t able to think of anything else. She looks at Hunter. \u201cI do have a way to sneak you into U.A.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looks up and shivers. He really wishes the wind would stop blowing or at least god would give him some clothing to wear. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asks. Uraraka doesn\u2019t seem all that comfortable about her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka hesitates for a moment, before her face looks determined. \u201cI will hide you in my uniform.\u201d Her hand moves from her shoulders, over her chest, and all the way to her knees, indicating where she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinks a couple times. He is having trouble understanding what she means. \u201cUh... where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka bit her lip, and after summoning up some courage, she grabs Hunter\u2019s <span class=\"cpink\">tiny</span>, <span class=\"cbrown\">naked</span> <span class=\"cpink\">body</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">and</span>...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUraraka?! What are you doing?\u201d Uraraka bend over and picked Hunter up in her bare hand, wrapping itself around his tiny body. She lifts him into the air, nervously holding him as she stood back up on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter is scared stiff, as he is afraid of heights. Why is Uraraka picking him up? Hunter is confused (and happy) as Uraraka held him. A girl is touching his dick. Kinda. It goes against his thoughts on what the first time a girl touching his dick would be. But then again, he never thought to be 5 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka feels Hunter\u2019s dick pressed against her bare palm and blushed, briefly closing her eyes. \u201cWe need to get you into the Culture Festival to meet your friend. This is the only way we can get you in without alerting anyone.\u201d Uraraka reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter is not connecting Uraraka\u2019s line of thinking. \u201cWhat way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka doesn\u2019t answer. Her face is very deep red as she looks at tiny Hunter. After a full minute, Uraraka takes her free, left hand and reaches for her school issue tie. She loosens it and unbuttons the top two buttons on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait wait wait wait! Uraraka, why are you...?\u201d If Hunter wasn\u2019t blushing before, he is now. He could cover his face if Uraraka\u2019s right hand wasn\u2019t pinning his arms at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka revealed her cleavage to Hunter. Her face was a mixture of nervousness, embarrassment and shyness. \u201cW-we n-need a place to hide you so we can get you in the school. W-we are running out of time s-so I\u2019m using the c-closest place we can use. Between my breasts.\u201d She stutters. Uraraka brings Hunter closer to her face. She breathes nervously. Her hot breath hits Hunter\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could Hunter say? He could protest further but he couldn\u2019t think of anything better either. That, and this could be a once in a lifetime chance for him. Through an accident or whatever turned him small, he is going to be squished between two boobs. And that is erotic. Uraraka winced as she felt Hunter\u2019s dick getting hard in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka continues, reasoning it\u2019s a normal boy\u2019s reaction to this situation. She turned Hunter around, facing him away from her. It is awkward enough for Uraraka, and this would be easier if Hunter wasn\u2019t looking at her at the moment. Uraraka lowered Hunter till his feet touched her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter thanked Uraraka in his head for doing this for a stranger, before closing his eyes. He can feel his decent downwards into Uraraka\u2019s chest. His feet getting swallowed up by her meaty fats. Her soft skin slide up his body, reaching his knees. Is Hunter dreaming right now? If not, Hunter should buy her lunch after he gets big again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka lets one finger go at a time. She is weary that Hunter might fall if she isn\u2019t too careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process took 2 minutes but it felt like an eternity for Hunter. The best part is when Uraraka\u2019s ring finger lets go of Hunter\u2019s waist and his dick slips into her cleavage. The sweat between her breasts act like lube, however smelly it is, rubbing Hunter\u2019s cock as he falls down. Hunter feels a little a guilty, enjoying this while the girl who\u2019s breasts are wrapping around your body is trying to help you against any discomfort this causes her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Uraraka was sure her breasts had tight hold on him, Uraraka lets go of Hunter and with her index finger, pushes on Hunter\u2019s head. \u201cW-we need to hurry.\u201d Uraraka said as she puts on a brave smile. Hunter\u2019s head is almost gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Good bye, alleyway.\u2019 Hunter thought as his head submerge between Uraraka\u2019s flesh. Now Hunter finds his whole body, not counting his feet dangling out of the bottom, covered in Uraraka\u2019s boobs. They seem pretty big to him now, though he never got a good look of them while talking to Uraraka before. His mother always taught him to never stare at woman\u2019s breasts who you just met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka quickly buttons up her shirt again and fasten her tie. She can feel him moving around against her chest, supposedly getting comfortable. Uraraka took a moment, to think about what she just did. \u2018T-This should be ok, right?\u2019 She thought. She doesn\u2019t know and it\u2019s really getting her heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka wobbles to her shoe and puts it back on. She grabs Hunter\u2019s clothes, and carefully hid them behind some cardboard boxes. They should be safe till she, or rather a teacher, can get Hunter back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter is feeling pretty uncomfortable. He can feel Uraraka moving when gravity changes when she bends down or moves up. Her heart is loud and her sweat here between her boobs is making him slip. It\u2019s a battle to not fall to her belly. And possibly the floor. That would be quite the drop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the complaints, Hunter\u2019s dick betrays his mind. Hunter\u2019s cock is tightly squeezed (thanks impart by Uraraka\u2019s bra)by Uraraka\u2019s flesh, squeezing, tugging and massaging it. Hunter can\u2019t deny how good it feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Uraraka leaves the alleyway, pretending everything is fine, what <span class=\"cpink\">does</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">Hunter</span> <span class=\"cpink\">focus</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">on</span>?</span></div></div>",

She is walking down the side walk on this sunny day with a naked boy between her breasts. She freezes up a little when some people walked by her. No way for them to know but Uraraka is on edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly two blocks away. We are really close. Are you alright in there?\u201d She whispered to her breasts while facing forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looks up. \u201cI\u2019m doing just fine. We need to get there and then we can find something to cover me with.\u201d Hunter said. Soon, he hopes. Hunter didn\u2019t hear a reply but that\u2019s ok. His voice might have not carried or Uraraka is walking next some people and is remaining quiet. As long as Uraraka can get him inside U.A., he\u2019ll find his friend and maybe they can get him back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked over his surroundings. There isn\u2019t much to see. But there is light, however faint, peeking through her clothes. It allows him to view Uraraka\u2019s breasts. Goodness, Hunter can see little sweat droplets running off the top of her breasts and fall into the crack with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter loves breasts and being squished between them is fantastic. Though, as much as his own body is begging him, he must not take advantage of this. He is allowing his brain to take several photos in his mind to remember this by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter is enjoying his ride, he realized an error. The hot day is making Uraraka really sweaty. She is even panting and groaning due to the heat. Hunter is feeling the heat as well. The space between her breasts is getting really moist. What was once a gift from god ride, is turning into a sauna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you take a quick break and cool off?\u201d Hunter suggested, though he doesn\u2019t know if Uraraka is anywhere close to shade. However, there was no reply. Instead, Hunter felt himself sinking. Uraraka\u2019s breasts were really sweaty and it\u2019s were sliding Hunter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Hunter became aware, he started flailing. He grabbed Uraraka\u2019s breasts and try pulling himself back up. They weren\u2019t providing much of a grip with how moist they\u2019ve become so Hunter has to really continuously grab the top of her breast to lift himself up. He\u2019ll fall through Uraraka\u2019s shirt and out her skirt if he stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka, feeling a lot of sudden activity in her chest, put a hand over her breast. She just reached the check point to enter U.A. so she can\u2019t tell Hunter to settle down. She is notice some wet spots on her uniform. But it isn\u2019t that bad to her and the teacher, a Ectoplasm clone, at the check point just noticed her approaching so there no taking care of it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Uraraka, what are you doing here?\u201d The Ectoplasm clone said in surprise. Uraraka could only tell by his tone because of his purple, menacing helmet covered his face. \u201cYou are running late. The Culture Festival has already started.\u201d Uraraka glanced past the gate. Even that All Might float from earlier is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there was this line at the hardware store that we needed for our class. Deku initially volunteered to go but I also needed to run some errands for myself so I went.\u201d Uraraka said, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ectoplasm clone look over at Uraraka\u2019s hands. \u201cBut you are not carrying any bags.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, the line was too long and my class wanted me back as soon as possible so I had to leave it behind.\u201d \u2018Stop moving around, Hunter,\u2019 Uraraka thought as she feels Hunter\u2019s little legs kicking against the bottom parts of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ectoplasm clone doesn\u2019t seem too convinced but also knows Uraraka is a good student. Besides, she doesn\u2019t seem to have anything out of place on her to warrant concern. \u201cAlright then. You may pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief washed over Uraraka. Ectoplasm didn\u2019t seem to have noticed Hunter\u2019s movements. She said her thanks to Ectoplasm and was on her way before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise body check!\u201d A woman with long, black hair popped out of nowhere. It\u2019s one of U.A.\u2019s staff, Midnight! She is wearing her Hero costume, which is a reminder to dominatrix\u2019s style of clothing. Her breastless leotard worn over a white bodysuit, which brings attention to her breasts, body, and legs along with black thigh-high stockings and black knee-boots. She seems to be tilting on her feet. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/sTo4Fg\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/sTo4Fg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka frozen in shock. Hunter isn\u2019t, however, finally settled down, as he found one stop in Uraraka\u2019s breasts that wasn\u2019t slippery from sweat. He heard yelling but thought it had nothing to do with them. How wrong he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-surprise, what?\u201d Uraraka doesn\u2019t understand what Ms. Midnight is doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidnight...\u201d There was a warning tone in Ectoplasm\u2018s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight brushed it off. \u201cBody check. We never know if students are bringing in harmful things from the outside, knowingly or not. What if a villain is trailing after you with a tracer? As teachers, we need to look into all security flaws. So being super careful pays off!\u201d She said, bending over, smiling at Uraraka through her small red, domino mask outlining her eyes. Midnight seems a bit... off balance. What is that smell on her breath?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMidnight looks at the Ectoplasm clone. \u201cI\u2019ll be a few minutes.\u201d She grabs Uraraka\u2019s wrist, her own handcuff jingle a bit with movement, before hearing a reply and hurries her off to the staff room in the check point building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka pleaded with Midnight. If Hunter is found out... \u201cPlease Midnight-sensei, I need to hurry to my class. I\u2019m...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight silenced her, putting a finger on her lips. \u201cShhhhhh... body check. Got to make sure you aren\u2019t hiding anything.\u201d She said that like she was singing. Her face is beat red, with a lustful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh god,\u2019 Hunter thought, hearing all of this from inside Uraraka\u2019s chest. \u2018Am I going to <span class=\"cpink\">get</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">found</span> <span class=\"cpink\">out</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">here</span>?\u2019</span></div></div>",

She must have something on Ectoplasm for him not take any action on her when he saw her clearly drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka is still hoping to avoid this. Hunter is in her chest right now and a body check could expose him. \u201cMidnight-sensei, you know I\u2019m a good student. I never would bring something in that would harm U.A. Please let me go. Tsuyu and Momo are waiting for me.\u201d Tsuyu and Momo wanted to hang out before the festival started, which is too late now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight suddenly hugs Uraraka. \u201cWwwwwwhhaaaaaaatt? Don\u2019t you want to spend time with your favorite teacher?\u201d She said, her mouth quivering as she talks. Her alcoholic breath flew into Uraraka\u2019s face. Uraraka puffs her cheeks out as she held her breath against the disgusting smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Hunter held out his arms as Midnight\u2019s breasts push against Uraraka\u2019s. Hunter tries to push back against Uraraka\u2019s flesh but his weak little arms could do little. He soon finds his space getting tighter. Before, Hunter was able to hide his boner, so he would not make Uraraka feel uncomfortable. With Uraraka\u2019s breasts compressing around him, she blushes when she feels Hunter hard penis pushing between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018H-hunter?\u2019 Lots of questions are going through her head as she realize Hunter is turned on by being between her breasts. A possibility she kept away from her mind till now. \u2018W-what do I do?\u2019 She wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight backs away when she realize Uraraka was being so quiet. \u201cU... Uraraka?\u201d Midnight looked at Uraraka\u2019s face, beat red. Midnight instantly recognizes the expression. \u201cMy goodness, Uraraka. I never knew you felt that way for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Uraraka is confused, momentarily forgetting Hunter\u2019s hard penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight shook her head. \u201cNo need to play dumb with me, Uraraka. It\u2019s ok to have those feelings for your teacher. But school rules, made because of me, says no teacher and student relationships.\u201d She says that but she seems to be getting increasing more excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, Uraraka realize there is some sort of misunderstanding. \u201cMidnight-sensei, I think you may have gotten the wrong impression of me. I was just...\u201d Uraraka tried to explain but it\u2019s hard to think of an excuse when she can feel Hunter\u2019s penis being noticeable against her flesh. And it\u2019s not that Midnight isn\u2019t attractive. She looks very beautiful. Uraraka currently has other dick- THINGS on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight doesn\u2019t seem to accept it, already getting herself turned on. Her thighs squeeze together as her drunken self is imagining something lewd. \u201cNo no, you are getting shy on me, now that I called out your feelings. Don\u2019t worry...\u201d Midnight slurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight approaches Uraraka, trying to stay on her feet. Uraraka backed away, feeling Midnight\u2019s imposing aura. Uraraka stops as her butt hits the table. Midnight noticed and lunge her arm out, grabbing Uraraka\u2019s waist. \u201c... I\u2019ll hold myself back, as your teacher. We may not have any sort of student/teacher relationship, even though you want to. But I can relieve some of those suppressed desires with a \u2018body check\u2019, like I have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Uraraka could protest, Midnight grabbed Uraraka\u2019s breasts with her left hand as she held onto Uraraka\u2019s waist with her right. \u201cMmmmmhhhh~... I wonder if I will find anything <i>dangerous</i> in here~.\u201d Midnight coo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka closed her eyes. Fighting a drunk Midnight is a bit pointless. And stopping her after getting this far would seem suspicious, especially after with what happened with Tooru. Because of that, the girls in class A don\u2019t fight against Midnight. Midnight honors the deal, behaving as a teacher when she isn\u2019t drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka started huffing. She feels herself getting turn on by Midnight\u2019s touches. Most of the time, Uraraka can ignore it but her breasts feel extra sensitive since she put Hunter in there. \u2018Oh god, please don\u2019t find Hunter.\u2019 Uraraka prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter himself is terrified. Out of no where, Uraraka\u2019s breasts started moving. He heard everything outside and knows it\u2019s one of Uraraka\u2019s teachers. Which seems insane she is doing this to one of her students. But Hunter can\u2019t worry about that. He finds himself fighting for dear life as Uraraka\u2019s breasts open and close around him. When they close, he can\u2019t move. When they open, his body falls lower down Uraraka\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take Hunter <span class=\"cpink\">long</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">to</span> <span class=\"cpink\">panic</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">and</span>...</span></div></div>",

He can no longer keep a firm grip on Uraraka\u2019s sweaty, C cup breasts while they rapidly move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Hunter, Midnight is in her own world. She thinks she is playing coy, but in her drunken/horny state, she doesn\u2019t realize how aggressive she\u2019s being. She leans closer, pressing her firm, large DD natural breasts on Uraraka\u2019s back. Feeling bold, she leans over and kisses Uraraka\u2019s left ear. Midnight gives her little kisses on Uraraka and softly moans in her ear, letting her know what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka reels a bit. She loves her teacher Midnight but she isn\u2019t interested in... this right now. Uraraka wiggles a bit to see if she can get out of Midnight\u2019s grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight notices and slumps forward, using both hands and grabbing hold of both of Uraraka\u2019s breasts. \u201cI got you, my little Uravity.\u201d She said, still playing her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight squeeze her hands around Uraraka\u2019s breasts, hoping to insight a reaction. It does, just to the wrong person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Uraraka\u2019s chest, Hunter was getting tired. It\u2019s hot in her cleavage, and smelly. Her musky, booby sweat filled his nose as he try to breathe. And he is quickly getting exhausted. Maybe it would be better to take his chances and hope to fall on Uraraka\u2019s shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of no where, Uraraka\u2019s boobs tightly squeeze together onto Hunter. Hunter had turn his back on Uraraka\u2019s boobs as he tried to climb up her chest.

Her breasts are inflating right before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fleshy breasts grew against her school uniform. The fabric strain against the meaty expansion, while the buttons try to keep it together. Her red tie that was hanging over her breasts, is now being pushed up. Instead of hanging, it is getting comfy and laying across her expanding tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka is shock, but not horrified. She seems to be enjoying it. Her nipples harden (and got bigger?), becoming noticeable imprints on her uniform. She would like to touch them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka\u2019s breasts stop growing after a little while. Uraraka frown but shook her head. Now is not the time. She has more important things to worry about. <i>How did her...? Was that Hunter\u2019s...? Wait, oh no, Ms. Midnight!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka turned around. Oh god. Did Midnight notice her bigger breasts? Is she going to get more exciting and hold her here making her miss the festival?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight, however, had closed her eyes. She slump forward on Uraraka\u2019s back and her hands had let go of Uraraka\u2019s breasts. \u201cZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\u201d Midnight snored. The alcohol must\u2019ve tucked her out. Midnight was on the planning board for the Culture Festival. She could\u2019ve been up all night and started drinking this morning once she got some free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka sighed in relief. She didn\u2019t want to imagine what Midnight would do to her if she were to find out here and now. Uraraka slowly turned around and grab Midnight\u2019s shoulders. She looked around and spotted a chair nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka silently activated her quirk on Midnight, making her weightless. She pull Midnight over and set her in the chair. This is better than having her sleep on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka release her quirk and silently walked out the room, to the back door. After she pulled the door close, she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!! Thank you!! I never want to do that again!\u201d Hunter says, as he lay on his back on Uraraka\u2019s palm. She had released him from her meaty prison and had him resting on her hand. Hunter doesn\u2019t look so good. He looks like a melted, little gummy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka had ran behind some trees in UA\u2019s forest. It\u2019s very close to the festival, as they could hear laughing and cheering nearby. The trees are pretty thick. No one would be able to see them from the Culture Festival stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka had to stop here. She couldn\u2019t meet her classmate nor enter the school due her new ample bosom. She would meet with too many embarrassing questions. Besides, she\u2019s holding the one responsible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka grab her poor breasts, only for her brain to received a pleasant reaction. <i>Oh! W-why are they sensitive? And... wow. I\u2019m bigger than Momo right now too.</i> Uraraka thought. The thought of having such impressive breasts made Uraraka feel a little happy but what if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter breathes flesh, cold air, he looks back at Uraraka. She looks exhausted, and staring down at her chest. And holy... Hunter was stuck in there the whole time. He didn\u2019t notice anything but wow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka had taken her tie off and undress a little. Her breasts had grown bigger than what she had before and it became increasingly uncomfortable. She unbuttoned her entire top and took off her bra, lying in on the ground next to her. Now her breasts are hanging out, K cup and all. Her nipples are pink and hard, with her vanilla skin a little wet with sweat. But she is still wearing her uniform. It\u2019s only button up right under her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUraraka... you... how...?\u201d Hunter is at lost for words. He doesn\u2019t even hide his boner. Uraraka\u2019s breasts are far more bigger than when he first saw them. Now they are... plentiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka pulls her left hand off of her breasts and <span class=\"chotpink\">look</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">at</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">Hunter</span>. <span class=\"cbrown\">She</span>...</span></div></div>",

Uraraka\u2019s breasts are as tall as him now, 5 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka shook her head and smiled. The embarrassment on her face didn\u2019t last long. \u201cWe know that can\u2019t be true. You must have a quirk. First your height shrank and now my breasts have grown to be this big... There is definitely a size changing quirk involved. And it\u2019s not my quirk, cause...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka moved her hand away from her breasts. Her left hand went over Hunter\u2019s head and touched her fingertips on her right hand. Some pink light glowed behind you and Uraraka retreated her hand away from you. Her left hand touch her right boob first and then her left boob, making them float.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... See? My quirk makes things weightless.\u201d Uraraka looked back at Hunter and smiled friendly. It\u2019s odd Uraraka is comfortably doing this with Hunter but she unknowingly seem to grow a little bit of a bond with someone who had traveled between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka\u2019s breasts,which were slumping down due to their weight, raised up. Her nipples no longer pointed down but now leveled next to Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah. I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Hunter said in a daze. He doesn\u2019t even feel like agreeing. Just one of those nipples are the size of his head. And they look rather hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that great?\u201d Uraraka said excitedly. \u201cNow we can work on getting you back to normal. Now there is no need to explain to your friend why you are so small, we can enter the school, find a male uniform that matches your height and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUraraka?\u201d Hunter spoke up. He doesn\u2019t want to interrupt this girl who has been helping him but his focus on something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Hunter?\u201d Uraraka looked passed her breasts to the small boy. She notice then that Hunter doesn\u2019t seem all that thrill to return to being big as she thought he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I... play with your tits?\u201d Hunter asked bluntly. Hunter feels like there are butterflies in his stomach. It\u2019s such a weird question to ask a girl he\u2019s known for a few hours but he really, with the purest intent, wants to play with Uraraka\u2019s big boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka, understandably, was caught off guard. \u201cW-wha? P-play with my t-tits?\u201d Uraraka said nervously. Her eyes darted to Hunter\u2019s cock, which he didn\u2019t even cover. Midnight\u2019s groping is still fresh in her mind and the cold, fall breeze only made her nipples harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Uraraka was asked this normally (probably from Mineta, wouldn\u2019t be surprised), Uraraka would shoot it down. In her bubbly way. But in this very weird situation, with her switch turned on by Midnight, Uraraka had trouble thinking of a reason to say no. She thought of Deku but shoot that down. She wants to keep those feelings tight inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stayed motionless. What he is asking is absurd. His mother always did tell him to take chances and to grab opportunities, even though she probably didn\u2019t imagine this. Ultimately, it\u2019s Uraraka\u2019s choice. \u201cI-.... I want to play with your breasts. I want to rub my penis on them till I cum. Your breasts are so big and your nipples are so pink, I... want experience them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments of silence, Uraraka spoke up. \u201cI need to meet with my class shortly. I do not have much time. But...\u201d Uraraka lifted her right hand so Hunter and her could see each other on the same level. Uraraka has a deep blush on her face and nervousness in her eyes. \u201cI-I can let you play ONE game with my boobs. Then I\u2019ll take you as far as the boy\u2019s changing room. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter lighten up. Uraraka must think he\u2019s a massive perv right now but now he is giving brief freedom with her boobs. His friend can wait a bit longer. After all, it seems like it\u2019s going to <span class=\"chotpink\">be</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">a</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">long</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">day</span>.</span></div></div>",

She then puts him under her skirt (making a Deku somewhere jealous for a reason) then uses her free hand, she makes some space between her panties and her skin and drops him in. Hunter now found himself in a dark place and he could barely see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches out blindly making contact with Ochako's soft skin (and hair?).

It hasn\u2019t even been 30 minutes since he turned small. The smell of Uraraka\u2019s foot is also getting to Hunter. In a concerning way, as Hunter has gotten use to the initial terrible smell. And the more he breathes, the better the smell was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter realize after a few moments, Uraraka isn\u2019t moving. It sounds like she is on the phone with someone. Hunter is having trouble enough hearing Uraraka, so he quickly gave up trying to listen in on the conversation. He instead focused on getting out. He tries moving his arms, finding them firmly pinned beneath Uraraka\u2019s sole. But not impossible to pull out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter pulls on his arms, lifting his shoulders. After a bit of wriggling, he pulls out his right arm. He lays his arm over Uraraka\u2019s foot and focus on pulling out his left arm. Uraraka shifts a little of her weight off of Hunter, making it easier to slide his left arm out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yes! I got my arms free.\u2019 Hunter is glad that he is no longer restricted. \u2018Now... what?\u2019 Hunter can\u2019t moved himself out, with his head already pressed against the end of Uraraka\u2019s shoe by her foot. But his arms are free now. Maybe he could hit Uraraka\u2019s foot to notice him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Hunter thought he could hear Uraraka say \u201cBye.\u201d Suddenly, Uraraka press down on her foot as she crouched down. Hunter\u2019s body got crush by this lovely foot (lovely?) and it took all his will power to keep it together. Then, he felt the shoe constrict on his arms. Uraraka had squatted down to tighten her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka got up and started walking. Every step she took, kicked the wind out of Hunter. He braced himself every time he felt himself being carried in the air. He hopes Uraraka doesn\u2019t start running anytime soon.Hunter knows she is taking him somewhere against his will and he doesn\u2019t know where that is. How will he meet his friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no light, barely any sound, Hunter travel in Uraraka\u2019s foot with only his sense of touch and his sense of smell. A smell that only got stronger over time as Uraraka left the alleyway and walked in the sunlight. The smell of her increasingly sweaty foot is attacking Hunter\u2019s senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, while Hunter is suffering in the shoe of this cute hero in training, he <span class=\"cpink\">was</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">starting</span> <span class=\"cpink\">to</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">feel</span>...</span></div></div>",

She can feel her entire body sweaty from the heat. Her armpits are damp, her cleavage is sweaty and her pink cheeks are almost dyed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka can see the school. She knows she is reaching the entrance to U.A. at a later time than she thought. She should have ran there but some sort of pebble in her left shoe is bothering her, telling her not to run. She will have take it out once she gets inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets closer to the gate, Uraraka thinks she can see Ectoplasm-sensei guarding the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Uraraka\u2019s shoe, Hunter struggles not to get his body crushed anymore. He feels relief every time Uraraka lifts her foot but then feels pain when she brings her foot back down. He grabs Uraraka\u2019s big toe with his left hand. He couldn\u2019t even get a good grip because the big toe is bigger than his own hand right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter moves around, his naked penis rubs against the bottom of Uraraka\u2019s foot. He tries not to think about it but Uraraka has soft feet. Her pantyhose\u2019s fabric rubs softly on Hunter\u2019s growing pole. Hunter can feel himself losing to his primal instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka approaches the school gate. \u201cHello, Ectoplasm-sensei.\u201d Uraraka greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Uraraka. Aren\u2019t you late for Class 1A\u2019s event?\u201d Ectoplasm kindly asked. His kind voice really doesn\u2019t match his scary mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka nervously scratched her head, tilting her weight on her left foot. \u201cN-not really. I still have time if I hurry to change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter felt Uraraka stopped walking. Hunter is having trouble, as her musky scent from her foot is starting to smell very attractive, adding to the stimulation. His cock is now hurting, as it strain to have attention as Uraraka\u2019s foot teases Hunter. Hunter continues to ignore it, using his willpower to focus on getting out. One of his concerns is why hasn\u2019t Uraraka noticed him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka says bye to Ectoplasm and heads off into the school. She picks up the pace a little, her toes, meanwhile, are now banging against Hunter\u2019s head. Her squishy toes may be soft but it forces Hunter\u2019s head against the end of the shoe. He dodges and ducks his head underneath her toes in the arch of her foot. The smell is even stronger in here then before! Oh god, Hunter can feel his arousal. If he doesn\u2019t get out of here soon, he might start masterbating on Uraraka\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka enters her building. She turns a few <span class=\"cpink\">corners</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">and</span> <span class=\"cpink\">runs</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">into</span>...</span></div></div>",

He has ash blond, spiky hair that was easy for Uraraka to identify him before crashing into him. He didn\u2019t even noticed Uraraka till she cried out his name. His sharp red eyes look down and stared down at Uraraka. (Bakugo is 5\u20197 and Uraraka is 5\u20191)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUraraka. Where have you been? Did you get the materials?\u201d Bakugo said calmly but with a little bit of annoyance. To Uraraka, even when he is calm, Bakugo\u2019s voice sounds like slow, low burning charcoal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka fidgets, still keeping eye contact with Bakugo. \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t find them in time and had to hurry back.\u201d Well, that and the villain that got the jump on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugo kept the same posture even after hearing that. His eyes did seem to get a little angrier, though. \u201cLucky for you, that damn nerd Deku went ahead and grabbed them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka\u2019s heart skipped a beat when Deku was mentioned. Deku is a fellow classmate of Uraraka and Bakugo. His real name is  Izuku Midoriya. A green, messy hair student striving to become a hero. Uraraka has developed a crush on him, but she is confused to whether follow through on her feelings or put them aside for Deku\u2019s sake and her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole time, Bakugo was holding something in his hands. \u201cPut this on.\u201d He said in a commanding tone, breaking Uraraka\u2019s thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka grabbed what appear to be clothes. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad I found you on time. We\u2019re about to be on in a 5 minutes and we can\u2019t do it without you, so hurry up and change.\u201d Bakugo said turning his back and heading off for the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka quickly shifted through the clothes. \u201cWhere are the shoes?\u201d Uraraka asked. Her left foot is bothering her. Like something squishy is in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I know? I was just told to find you. Now hurry up and change.\u201d Bakugo yelled back as he was already down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka went to the nearest restroom and she used an empty stall. She begins to unbutton her uniform, shredding her clothes off as quickly as possible. Her shoes... no, there is no time. She will have to take them off after the Cultural Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka soon stood in her underwear in the restroom stall. She folded up her uniform and place it on top of the toilet. She then bend over to pick up her clothes that Bakugo gave her. If someone was standing behind Uraraka as she bend over, they would have gotten a heart attack from seeing Uraraka\u2019s big, round butt cover in pink panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka looks at the clothes she is wearing for the Class 1A\u2019s event. It looks a little tight but manageable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cpink\">The</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">Class</span> <span class=\"cpink\">event</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">is</span>...</div></span></div></div>",

She shuffled her feet a bit, rubbing Hunter\u2019s naked body, unknown to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Uraraka looked behind her at a nearby mirror as she button up her black dress. After that was done, she took the white apron and slid her head through the strap, finishing it off by tightly wrap a white sash neatly around her waist in a bow. She grabs a head piece and place it on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka grab her stockings. Ugh, she knows she didn\u2019t have time to take off her shoes but she has to. Uraraka went into a stall and sat on the toilet. She lifted each leg up one at a time and undid the laces. She grab the shoe and slid them off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gasp. Uraraka\u2019s foot finally lifted off of him. He lifts his head and looks down at his stomach, cover in his cum. Hunter blush in embarrassment. He must\u2019ve a lot against Uraraka\u2019s foot without him realizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hunter is recovering his senses, Uraraka grab a stocking and slide her leg into the hole. She pulled the stocking up till they reach the base of her butt and did the same for the other leg. Hunter gets up, having no intention of sticking around. He looks up and stops when he sees Uraraka\u2019s leg in the air, lifting her dress up for Hunter to see the giantess pantie cover pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hesitation cost him, again, as Uraraka grab her shoe and slid her foot in wher Hunter is. Hunter panic, jumping up and yelling again. Of course, she didn\u2019t heard him and her stocking covered toes ran towards Hunter. This time, Hunter moved himself above Uraraka\u2019S toes, lying across her foot top, no longer having her foot on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she put her shoes back on, Uraraka looks in the mirror, pleased with what she sees. She turn her hips and watch the ends of the dress flutter. She smiles and hopes Deku likes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka glance at the clock. Uh no! She\u2019s late! Uraraka picked up her school uniform and carried them in her arms as she hurried to her locker where she shoved them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, she arrived in class. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late!\u201d She cried out. She leans over catches her breath. She notice that annoying feeling at the bottom of her foot is gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up and sees her classroom. It is completely decorated, looking like an Europe style room then a classroom. \u201cOh my gosh, what happen?!\u201d She blurted out, her face looking absolutely shock by the fine decor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo, in a tightly maid outfit equal to Ochaco, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/jbTyXC\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/jbTyXC</a> approach Uraraka. \u201cDo you like it? My family has had hotels room renovated before. So I asked my family for help for today but... they didn\u2019t expect the room to be so small...\u201d Momo said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yep, she\u2019s a rich girl...</i> Uraraka thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo lifted the clipboard and look at the paper. \u201cSo... there has been some changes to the schedule. Like before, the boys will be gone to help Class 1B\u2019s remake play of Yuri on Ice. I already have Shoto recording it for us and we can watch it after they are done.\u201d Momo said. Uraraka\u2019s mind wanders to what part Deku play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo continues. \u201cThe problem is that Class 1B\u2019s girls are coming over here and we needed to create new positions so we shifted the positions around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, where will I be?\u201d Uraraka asked. She can see some customers waiting patently at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo blush. \u201cWell, i\u2019m having you choose. There is four girls not assign to anything right now. You, Toru, Tsunotori, Kendo. And we have four positions left too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused. She seems really embarrassed right now. Uraraka felt nervous by Momo\u2019s silence but ask anyway. \u201cWhat are them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo waited a second then list them off. \u201cYou can be a Geeter, greeting customers at the door, or be a waiter and server them at their seats, or w-work at the t-titty bar or be part of the special menu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka blink. \u201cT-titty bar? Special menu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo seem a little uncomfortable. \u201cThose are the positions that were somehow approved of. Someone wrote that, \u2018It won\u2019t be realistic if the maids weren\u2019t providing all kinds of services,\u2019 and there was back and forth between the girls of both classes. But since we were low on time, we ultimately had to accept it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka pushed. \u201cBut we could still not do it, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo nodded. \u201cYes, we could but we get review from the other students. They could give us bad scores for leading them on. Bad scores effects the class and effect opportunities later on in the school year.\u201d Momo explain, keeping herself rational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka seems deject. \u201cWell, none of us have to do it. We can ignored it we choose. Bad scores will hurt us but I think we\u2019ll recover. Besides, you can be a greeter or a waiter.\u201d Momo said, trying to be positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka stood there for a moment. Nodding to herself, she looks at Momo. \u201cAlright, <span class=\"chotpink\">I</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">want</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">to</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">be</span>...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Uraraka blushed in embarrassment. \u201cI-I want to be part of the titty bar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Okay. Let me just fine one other person who else may join you.\u201d Momo said, still surprised Uraraka is looking forward to show off her breasts willingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne other person?\u201d Uraraka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we have five girls here and four positions. I\u2019m thinking we could have one girl try helping each station while we are open. She would be free to help what ever station we are lacking.\u201d Momo explain with her big, beautiful brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going to be?\u201d Uraraka asked. Underneath her foot, Hunter struggles to get free. Uraraka is resting on her heels, so her foot isn\u2019t putting pressure on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo indicate towards the entrance. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the greeter. Since I\u2019m in charge of managing the Cafe, I need to be free to move around. If I was in or helping... \u2018Special services\u2019,\u201d Momo said in a quieter tone, \u201cOr at being the Titty Bar, I won\u2019t be able to move around to handle any issues we may have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo got quiet for a moment. Her brain working out a problem she raised herself. \u201cHm... I could have Toru handle the special menu. She is the most comfortable out of all of us to be naked. Kendo is on waiter and<br>\r\nTsunotori can be that extra member. Her hooves can run around back and forth! Yes!\u201d Momo cheered, as she just figured out her problem. Her worried expression went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka giggles. It was the adult activities that had Momo worried. She was just trying to figure out everyone\u2019s roles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown at Uraraka\u2019s foot, Hunter mange to squeeze himself around Uraraka\u2019s big toe. He grab the little fibers on Uraraka\u2019s legging and pulled himself across the top of her foot. Uraraka, however, somehow didn\u2019t feel any pressure from under her foot, now feels something small crawling on her foot and she looks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Then we can get stuff started...\u201d Momo began to say before getting cut off by a loud *MEEP!* from Uraraka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo turn in surprise to her and saw she was looking down at her feet. Both girls look down to see a tiny, naked. Hunter on her foot with his face bright red. Not sure what to do, he smiled up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls didn\u2019t know what to do or say and neither did Hunter, who was being stared at his naked self by two giant goddesses. But that didn\u2019t stop his quirk from activated just then. Uraraka suddenly felt her maid outfit started to strain against her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't tell that Hunter is growing her body but when she glanced back up at Momo, she was completely pale and in shock. Uraraka quickly became aware she is looking at Momo at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-who are you?\u201d Momo asked, looking down at Hunter, not noticing Uraraka\u2019s growing problem. She was about to grab him but she hesitated when she noticed he was completely naked. Her face is deeply concern. She should get a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m...\u201d Hunter was about to answer but his voice is quiet. The worst situation that could ever happen to him has happen and his uncontrolled quirk is giving him away how he is small without saying a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anymore could be said, Toru and Tsunotori approach from behind. They had finished preparations for the Cafe. \u201cHey girls. We are done with the setting up. Do you know where we\u2019ll be, Momo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo turned around, failing to notice Uraraka. Momo tried to distract them from the naked little teen as Uraraka bend to grab Hunter but he manage to get away before her hand could reach him. She has now grown to be as tall as Koji and her breasts are bigger than Momo's, not to mention her ass and thighs were also getting wider/bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka could hear the frabic of the maid outfit stretch from her GROWING!!! body. The fabric ripping was loud, that Toru and Tsunotori notice. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Toru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka froze. She lost Hunter and her body has noticeable gotten huge. What if the other notice? Is her body forever this big? Oh god, what will her parents say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts nothing!\u201d Momo said, trying to keep their attention on her. \u201cNow Toru, take your clothes off before anyone from our class comes. They should be here in a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru was about to press further but gave up. She walked away, while unbuttoning her own maid uniform to prepare herself as the special menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter has ran off and found action figure with some clothes that could fit him. He now look like he was part of World War 2. He tried to fined a was about with out getting seen. He didn\u2019t even realize where he was hiding till Uraraka ran over and sat in a chair next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly unbutton her own maid outfit till her chest was exposed. She went behind her back and unclasp her bra and took it off. With her tits exposed, she rested them on the table next to some plastic cups. She blushed when she realized that her breasts became so big in a short amount of time that she didn\u2019t even need to bend over so her breasts could touch the table. Uraraka nervously hope no one notice the change in her cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka calmed down from her earlier thoughts. The upside, she has bigger tits to serve as the Titty Bar. If Deku comes by and asks for some... sigh\ud83d\udc95. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka thought of Hunter and got a little upset. \u201cThat villain... he must be still around. He couldn\u2019t have gotten far. As soon as I\u2019m done serving milk, I\u2019ll find him and make him change me back to normal size.\u201d She thought. Her hands reach out to her nipples and tease them a bit for warm up to get her faucets going. She blush at the nice feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, she could go to Easerhead after the Culture Festival is over. It would be a little embarrassing but she might just only annoy him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, someone <span class=\"chotpink\">came</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">through</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">the</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">door</span>. </span></div></div>",

The bag was still intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looks around. That girl, Uraraka, is she hurt? Hunter remembers falling forward and hitting her but after that, nothing. Hunter stood up. The alleyway is empty and there was no sign of Uraraka anywhere. Did she run off without him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took a step forward and slip, losing his balance. \u201cShit!\u201d He cried out in surprise. Hunter braced himself against a wall but it only slowed his decent. He landed hard on the cardboard, his tailbone hurting a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter look what caused him to trip. It was a girl\u2019s skirt. Not just any skirt. It was the same skirt Uraraka was wearing. Hunter crawled closer and found more of Uraraka\u2019s discarded uniform. Her shoes lie on their side with the pantyhose in them and her shirt looks like a deflated balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Hunter said, in confusion. Is Uraraka running around naked? No, that can\u2019t be right. But what are her clothes doing here? Hunter reached out and grab the skirt and pulled it closer to him. Hunter gave it a closer look. Yep, definitely the skirt that girl was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked back at the clothes and noticed a pair of pink panties. He didn\u2019t notice them before. Probably because the skirt was over them. He reached out and grab them. \u201cUm...\u201d Hunter isn\u2019t sure what to do. He has held panties before but never of a girl he doesn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a little bold and brought the panties to his nose and sniffed it. It smells sweet, like how he imagines a girl\u2019s butt would smell like. Hunter\u2019s dick grew a little harder in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter reach for Uraraka\u2019s shirt, now looking for a bra. His consciousness is telling him to not go further but his teenage self tells him to not waste the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stick his hand down the neck hole and feels around. Feeling the bra, he grabs it and pull it out. It\u2019s pink as well and soft. He isn\u2019t sure what he is going to do with these clothes but he is heading to U.A. so he can give them to a staff once he gets there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter look into one of the bra cups and is surprise to find an unconscious, naked Uraraka! Her feet drape over the edge of the cup and her arms hang out over the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stuff the panties into his pocket. \u201cU... Uraraka! Are you ok?\u201d Hunter frantically ask the naked tiny. No answer. She is still unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter began to worry. What happened to her? Why is she so small? She was just normal size a few moments ago, talking about her family. Is this her quirk? No, that can\u2019t be it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter is thinking this out, Uraraka shifted and laid on her back. The movement caught Hunter\u2019s attention and look at Uraraka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka\u2019s naked body looks gorgeous. It looks really tone for a cute girl. Not too muscular but noticeable fit. Her chest is a good C. No D but Hunter could tell despite her being tiny, they are firm. Her sleeping face is really cute too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer Hunter stares at the tiny, naked Uraraka, the harder Hunter\u2019s dick is getting. Hunter shakes his head but he can\u2019t clear his thoughts. His mind getting blurry and his judgment is getting cloudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka stir in her sleep. She looks like she is about to get up. Hunter makes his decision, whether to be a <span class=\"cpink\">hero</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">or</span> <span class=\"cpink\">not</span>, <span class=\"cbrown\">and</span>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amari tried to argue against it but being so small and alone with no way back to her regular size wouldn't end well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmari waited, nervously as Uraraka lifted her up by her waist section, slowly, and starts to unbutton her blouses top buttons, so as to not squish her. \"This is only until we can get you some clothes, Amari,\" Uraraka said, talking to Amari, but saying it more so for her own sale rather then Amari:s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmari closed her eyes and began to mentally prepare herself as she saw Uraraka has finished unbuttoning her blouse's top buttons and was now lowering her tiny naked body in, trying to avoid drawing a lot of attention. Amari couldn't help but feel embarrassed and blush heavily as her bare feet touched the warm flesh of Uraraka's mounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step and could feel her breasts wobble and bounce slightly as her weight shifted to one foot to the other and she started to sit down. As she sat down the suddenly shift of weight combined with Uraraka's suddenly jolt into moment sent her tumbling between her boobs. She managed to catch herself and climb up slightly, causing Uraraka to moan softly, which drew some attention to Uraraka. She nestled herself in, finding a spot that was both comfy and well hidden. It also gave her a great peeping hole to see out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka stared down before saying \"Amari, c... Could you not squirm so much, please\" she squeaked as she quickly looked up to avoid getting weird stares from the other customers. She began to walk down the halls and soon found the doll accessories aisle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walled down it, Amari could feel the 'ground' beneath her bounce and nibble and wobble ever so sightly, until it all came to a stop as Uraraka ended <span class=\"cppink\">up <span class=\"cbrown\">picking <span class=\"cppink\">out <span class=\"cbrown\">a...? </span></span></span></span></span></div></div>",

However, she instead grabbed a generic looking outfit, similar to what Amari was wearing earlier. She lowered it and asked quietly \"Amari, how do these look?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmari peaked through the buttons and was relieved to see a regular outfit pinched between Uraraka's fingers. \"They look good\" she said in relief. With that affirmance, she could feel the movement beneath her once again as Uraraka headed towards the checkout. She got more and more anxious as the heat around her began overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Uraraka walked out of the store, she glanced down and saw Amari, just about passed out. She quickly dashed toward a restroom and removed the tiny girl, who had sweat pouring down her whole body. \"Amari, are you ok?\" she asked, wiping the sweat off of her, inadvertently brushing against some of her more...sensitive...areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmari shot up with a shock, feeling her whole body go numb. After collecting herself, she looked up at Uraraka and, finally realizing, covered herself again and replied \"y-yeah. D-do you have the c-clothes?\" Uraraka giggled a bit at Amari's nervousness before handing the clothes to her. Amari quickly put on the blue shorts and white shirt and turned back to Uraraka, who was looking away, still giggling slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm dressed now, so that's an improvement. Now how about we get back to the festival before we miss out on it\" Amari said, her small sizing having become a second thought to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka looked the the small girl and bit her lip. \"Maybe we should go find help for your current condition. The festival can always wait\" Uraraka said, reminding the girl of her <i>small </i>predicament. Amari blushed a little from the realization, now pondering what they should do. </span></div></div>",

Whether it's my own quirk, which is highly doubtable, or someone else's, I've never heard of someone being able to remove the effects of one\" Amari says, sighing at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka lifted the small girl and nuzzled her against her cheek. \"Oh, you have so much to learn about heroes my dear. I know just the teacher to take you to. Now, where would he be?\" she replied, pondering her own question. Amari pushed the giant's face away and looked at her curiously, unsure of who she was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Amari was going to ask, Uraraka said \"Ah, I remember. He should be in the 1-A classroom. I <i>should</i> be able to get us up there, although you will need to stay hidden. Does that sound like a plan?\" Amari nodded, all be it reluctantly. Uraraka nodded back, lifting Amari and tucking her neatly in her shirt pocket, then taking off back towards the school. Compared to her original hiding spot, Amari enjoyed this spot much more, almost falling asleep on the journey over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere minutes, Uraraka arrived at the school, which was still bustling with all sorts of people, quirk or no quirk. She weaved in and out of the crowd before being stopped by none other than All Might, his frail (story takes place after the Final Exams Arc) body still towering over the young student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka jumped back, almost falling. Luckily, she avoided a nasty spill using her quirk. All Might held out a hand and pulled the girl back to her feet As she faced him once again, he could see the concern on her face. He asked \"Uraraka-san, what is troubling you?\" He cheeks went bright red as she looked back at All Might, before asking quietly \"c-can we go see Mr. Aizawa? I n-need to talk with him.\" All Might replied with a silent nod and the two headed into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving to the classroom, Uraraka headed over to Aizawa, much to the teacher's surprise. \"Well, just as I thought I would get a quiet afternoon to myself. Now, what seems to be the problem Uraraka-san?\" he asked in his usual grainy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...bumped into someone on the street on the way to the festival. We ended up traveling together when...\" Uraraka said, her voice trailing off as she reached into her pocket, retrieving Amari from her resting place. The small woman rubbed her eyes as they adjusted to the light once again. As she was placed down on the desk, she got a full view of Aizawa, taken aback by his appearance. \"This is Tamako Amari, the person I bumped into. When we arrived at the festival, she suddenly shrunk and has been stuck like this since. Since there aren't any students here who can shrink others, I thought...maybe they may have a quirk without knowing, a quirk able to shrink themselves?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would like me to try removing their quirk. Very smart Uraraka-san. Let's see if your theory holds up.\" Aizawa said, smirking at the student's intelligence. Amari watched as he stood up, the cloths around his neck beginning to float around him. His eyes began shifting from black to a slowly glowing red. Just as he was about to fully activate his quirk, Amari screamed out \"wait!\" Aizawa looked at the small person in confusion, his eyes turning back to black and his cloths setting back down. He huffed \"what is it?\" Amari glanced up at the man, intimidated by his gruffy appearance. \"My clothes, they...don't change with me. If I do grow back, these clothes will...\" stammered Amari, her eyes wandering downwards in embarrassment. Everyone eyed each other, sharing the same embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of someone clearing their throat broke the silence. In the doorway was none other than Momo, a small smile on her face. \"Well, sounds like you could do with a clothing change then. Try this\" she said, tossing over a small jumpsuit to Amari. Amari glanced back up at Momo, confused. \"Thank you but...how is this going to help? And more importantly, how did you know?\" she asked. Momo looked over at Uraraka and smirked, \"I could tell just by the way Uraraka was acting that something was up, so I tagged along. And lucky too, considering your situation. That jumpsuit I gave you is made of the same material as the one Mt. Lady wears, meaning it will adapt to your size easily. Now, get dressed and let's see if you truly have a quirk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmari blushed a little, a mix of excitement and enthusiasm filling her. Without thinking, she pulled her shirt off, much to the surprise of everyone in the room. As she realized what she just did, she covered herself with the shirt again and frantically asking for some privacy. Of course, everyone immediately obliged, turning away as the woman changed. Once she finished, she gave Aizawa a big thumbs up, her face full of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizawa took a deep breath and stoop up once again. His started activating his quirk, his eyes glowing a bright red and his cloths floating from his shoulders. As his eyes glowed brighter, Amari took a deep breath and closed her eyes, ready for whatever came next. As his quirk fully activated, Amari could feel a weird sensation flow throughout her body, as if something went missing. Amari kept her eyes closed, not knowing what was going on. Then, Aizawa's grainy voice rang though her ears, telling her to open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as the teacher said and to her disbelief, she was back to normal. She looked at everyone in the room. All Might was in utter shock while Momo and Uraraka had big smiles on their faces. Uraraka rushed over to Amari, grabbing her in a big hug. \"We did it! You <i>do</i> have a quirk!\" Uraraka yelled, overjoyed. Amari hugged Uraraka back, just as overjoyed as her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now the big question remains: What does Amari do with her new found quirk? Does she become a Class 1-A student to get her quirk under control and become a hero or does she seek guidance from somewhere else, maybe from those less than trustworthy?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly Amari feels her hand rising as Uraraka's back starts to lift it up. Her height seems to... increase? Scared Amari pulls her hand away from Uraraka's back while her whole body pushes outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka starts to pant and blush as her clothes are becoming tighter and tighter. Her thigh socks start wandering down her upper leg while her sleeves crawl up her arm. Her shoes pop open because of her feet becoming larger as well. Quickly her feet cover her shoe's soles as well as the remains of the rest of them. At the height of her knees are her thigh socks starting to rip apart. Her sleeves follow the same fate as they stop crawling up at her elbows. Her top's buttons start popping open when Uraraka reaches the height of 6'. The growth spurt seems to come to an end when the glow suddenly fades away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmari looks at Uraraka leaning forward at 6'1\". She stands up trying to control her panting. \"Whoa... I don't know what just happened... I think I accidentally-\" she stops talking as she looks down to Amari who is in eye contact with her breasts. Blushing and with an rising voice she looks down at herself looking at her devastated shoes as well as her shredded thighs. She blushes when she notices her west being unbuttoned and half of her arms revaeled because her sleeves are also shredded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-Wha-What have you done?\" Uraraka asks while she desperately tries to button her west again. \"I didn't do anything intentionally.\" Amari defends herself. \"But I'm so much bigger now. Like a feet or so.\" \"I know. But I didn't know that I could do something like this.\" Amari explains. Uraraka looks up at her in shock. \"You didn't know you had a quirk?\" Amari looks at her hands. \"No. I'm sorry I did this but, I didn't even knew I could do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUraraka looks at the small girl and doesn't know how to react. At first she was a bit embarrassed and angry. But now that she heard the confusion of Amari she puts her hand on Amari's head and says: \"Ok... It... It wasn't your fault then. Now that you know about it, can you try it out by changing me back to normal?\" Amari looks up to the now slightly taller Uraraka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods her head. Uraraka smiles at her as Amari's despair changes into hope. Amari looks at her hands again clenching them to fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea how you did that?\" Uraraka asks. \"Hmm... I think it happened when I touched you. My hands started glowing that moment.\" \"Ok. So touch me again and change me back!\" Uraraka says spreading her arms aside. Amari gulps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it fails? Will Uraraka be angry at me? I have to try it anyways. Here it goes!\" Amari thinks to herself and reaches out for Uraraka's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmari concentrates on changing Uraraka back to her 5'1\u00bd\". Her hands start glowing as they touch Uraraka's breasts on accident. Uraraka blushes as a feeling starts running through her body and her whole body also starts glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around Amari <span class=\"cpink\">starts</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">shaking</span> <span class=\"cpink\">as</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">she</span> ...</span></div></div>",

Her breasts grew to twice the size they should be at Uraraka's current height IF every part of her grew at a constant rate, but clearly that wasn't the case. Amari stepped back as the giant had to lean over. If Amari was close to Uraraka, her breasts would look much bigger than Amari's head. \"I-I didn't mean too! I'm sorry!\" Amari said worried Uraraka would he angry. Uraraka stood back up and looked over her body.

She was almost triple Amari's height as she sat down criss cross apple sauce. \"Thanks a million, Amari!\" Uraraka exclaimed as she pet Amari and forced her closer. \"No... no... problem.\" Amari responded worried as Uraraka stroked her small body. \"I am indeed an amazon now. All thanks to you.\" Uraraka said. \"Y-yeah. Your welcome!\" Amari replied scared as Uraraka grabbed her leg. Uraraka stood up and held Amari in her hand as if she was nothing. \"See. Look!\" Uraraka said as she moved Amari to her behind. Amari's face was filled with Uraraka's round, huge ass. \"You like ththe view?\" Uraraka asked playfully as she moved Amari over to her breasts and shoved Amari's face into her gigantic cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always have fun.\" Uraraka suggested as she moved Amari back to her ass. \"What now?\" Amari asked in fear. \"Touch it! I want more.\" Uraraka ordered. Amari complied and Uraraka grew once again. Her ass was huge. She could fit a person in there, and her cleavage could act as a seat if Uraraka placed the person correctly. Uraraka was now 21'8\" and was about as tall as the nearby houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my dear.\" Uraraka said as she sat Amari on her left tit. \"Of course. I'm just happy I could please you after my mistake.\" Amari responded. \"Good. Now, whenever I tell you touch me... you will comply.

The house was actually an apartment that had two bedrooms and two bathrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ochaco and Amari walked into the house, Ochaco saw that the living room area has a huge couch that went from the wall to her far right up to about the door area where the two girls had entered (roughly a 5 foot couch), a recliner that was brown that was next to the wall where the couch was, and also a TV on a entertainment center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, nice living room,\" Ochaco commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Amari said. \"Me and my brother worked hard to get this stuff in here, and also to buy the stuff too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother?\" Ochaco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M UNDEAD!\" A voice yelled, mixed in with music and also another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the shells hit the floor,\" another voice said that was blended with the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH UNDEAD!\" The same two voices from before yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start a war!\" The third voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up one second,\" Amari said to Ochaco. \"GAVIN! TURN DOWN YOUR MUSIC OR WEAR HEADPHONES! I HAVE A FRIEND OVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male with brown hair and brown eyes came running from down the hallway in front of them. He came from the room farthest down and stopped in front of Ochaco and Amari. He wore a black T-shirt that looked like mercy for a band... though Ochaco couldn't tell what it said for she couldn't exactly read English fluently. Not yet anyways. He also wore jeans that had no holes in them, and also white socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked at Ochaco and then at Amari, and then back again. He kept this up for a few more seconds, and then looked at Amari and smiled. \"You finally brought over a friend,\" the male said. He turned to Ochaco, and held out his hand for her to shake. \"Hi, I'm Gavino Amari. Tamako's brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOchaco shook Gavino's hand and felt a slight shock from it. She instantly pulled her hand back said, \"Ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavino seemed surprised and then realized what was wrong. He instantly bowed and looked at the floor and said, \"Sorry. I had one of my quirks activated unintentionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Ochaco said. Then her mind did a retake. \"Wait, one of your quirks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda have a quirk that allows me to <span class=\"cbyellow\">Wish</span> for stuff, and I wished for a lot of powerful quirks, like All Might's. I've actually learned a lot about quirks thanks to my quirk, Wish,\" Gavino explained. \"Your quirk is interesting, as I'm able to identify quirks by looking at someone's face and into their eye which would give me a background history and a few more bits of information. I would've applied for UA, but I think I might try and go back to America to be a hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"America?\" Ochaco questioned. \"Were you born there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be a story for another time,\" Gavino dodged. \"After all, you're here to play with my sister with that new quirk of hers. Isn't that right?\" Gavino looked at Tamako with a look that says, 'I know what you're going to do. So you might as well confess.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Y-Yeah, we w-were,\" Tamako stammered. \"You better not do anything weird while my friend is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a god you know,\" Gavino said cockily. \"I wouldn't care less what you do cause I could do instantly do it with you guys anyways. I literally am able to snap and erase half the universe. So, you guys can go ahead and mess around. Oh, and just so you know Tamako, I edited your quirk so clothes don't rip when you expand someone. Just know that.\" Gavino then walked to his room and closed his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he... really a god? And did he really edit your quirk?\" Ochaco asked scaredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, yes. He did and is,\" Tamako said. \"If only he wasted his quirk on something stupid when he learned instead of infinite wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did that?\" Ochaco asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. He's literally immortal, and a god in every way. Not even that villain All For One can take his quirk. And somebody with a mind control quirk couldn't even control him or even make him use his quirk for their evil wishes or whatever. He's made sure only he can willingly give or use his quirk. I doubt he'd even give it away,\" Tamako explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we should leave him alone,\" Ochaco realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and never talk to him while we're messing with my quirk,\" Tamako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamako led Ochaco into her room which had several posters of American bands, animes, and also of certain video games. There was a shelf with photos of Tamako and Gavino when they were kids, going into elementary, going into middle school, a prank Gavino played on Tamako when they were 13, and them going into high school. They posed in most of the photos, except the prank where Gavino's had was cut off and on the floor by a pool of blood that Tamako was scared by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamako set her bag on her bed that had pink sheets and blankets, along with a few stuffed animals that looked old to Ochaco. Ochaco placed her bag on Tamako's bed as well and took off her uniform's top and skirt to reveal the tank top Ochaco always wore underneath and also the pair of skin tight shorts she wore under her skirt due to being insecure thanks to a certain pervert in her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamako then stretched. \"Okay, as we agreed, we were going to basically mess with my quirk and also expand like crazy. Not too crazy, but still expand. So, who should we start with? Me, or you Ochaco?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOchaco realized that this would only go two ways. One, she chooses Tamako and she could probably suggest what too expand. Or two, she could chose herself and then Tamako expands her from what Tamako wants to expands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOchaco made a decision, and said...</span></div></div>",

I should have watched where I was going.\u201d You climb up on your knees and onto your feet while the observant girl watch you, her index finger is touching her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the girl and notice her features. She is short. If you had to guess, 4\u201911 or 150cm. She has long, dark-sea green hair that she has tied up in a bow behind her back. She looks at you with her very wide eyes with pure black pupils in the center and some distinctive lower eyelashes. She has a wide, straight mouth across her face.

She reached out her own hand and shook Hedoro\u2019s hand. Asui\u2019s own hand feels soft but a little slimy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKentaro Hedoro is 5\u20198 (172cm). He has blond, crop hair with glowing green eyes. His green eyes has a black cross as pupils. He is wearing a long sleeve jacket with a Star Wars shirt underneath (The Millennium Falcon, of course ;)).

I guess. I do have a lot of free time now. But...\u201d <i>This is strange. Why does this short girl want to hang out with him? It is kind of out there. And her expression is making it hard to guess what she\u2019s thinking.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui stared back at him, waiting for his answer. Hedoro does feel a little creeped out but not so much that it bothers him. \u201cWell, I guess I can.\u201d Hedoro said with little confidants. Whatever she wants to do, it seems like it would be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui smiled. \u201cThank you, ribbit.\u201d The frog girl said cheerfully. <i>Maybe she lonely?</i>, Hedoro reason. <i>No, that can\u2019t be it.

She closed her eyes for a moment as her bangs brush over her eyes. Her yellow dress lifted a little and Hedoro was able to get a quick peek of some yellow, stripped panties. Well, that is some tiny underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro quickly looks at Asui\u2019s eyes and waits for a moment for Asui to say something but she stays quiet. He can\u2019t tell if she noticed him peeking. \u201cSo, uh, where do you want to hang out?\u201d He says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui\u2019s eyes snap to attention. \u201cI know a place.

If you want, you can pay back someday, ribbit.\u201d Asui said. There was a hint of kindness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she turn back, Hedoro mentally kicked himself. Sure, he won\u2019t pay for a ticket for agirl he just meant but he should have at least payed of himself. Unless he is out with his sister, then he has no problems with her paying.

Hedoro sigh, noting how good Asui looks, before opening the door and heading into the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theater is dark. The main commercials are already playing. Hedoro looks across the rows of chairs. He looks at the ticket. It\u2019s kinda hard to see in the dark. He thinks he is sitting in one of the far, back rows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo middle age women walked pass Hedoro as he walked to his seat. They were giggling silently to each other like teenagers, trying not to disturb the theater. Hedoro has a passing thought that they must be friends when he heard, \u201cOh god, he looked cute.\u201d Hedoro turn around in surprise but the two women had already exited the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro sat in his chair comfortably but he is anxious as well. Tsuyu has been in the bathroom for a while. Is she ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro looked around the theater. There weren\u2019t a lot of people here. Some spread out among the rows. There doesn\u2019t seem to be around near him. Which is good, cause he wanted to sit with the frog girl alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Popcorn. I should have gotten some popcorn.\u201d Hedoro said to no one in particular. If he had some popcorn, he would have some snacks to eat. Oh! And if he had a soda, Asui and him would share and... the idea made him feel tingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was imagining the indirect kiss, the theater stop showing commercials and the light dim even further. The movie was about to start and Asui was nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro is really getting consider. Perhaps he should go check on Asui...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could even get up from his chair, Hedoro\u2019s world started to get bigger. His feet lifted off the ground and his arms are having trouble holding onto the armrest. His grip is getting too small to hold anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-? Help! Someone!\u201d The panic Hedoro shouted, to no one. His voice has gotten too small to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro, who has shrunken so small that he could no longer wear his clothes, stood up on his seat, with no idea on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro\u2019s theater chair, which is a recliner, stood up to Hedoro\u2019s shrinking weight. The panic Hedoro fell on his stomach and grip onto his chair for dear life. His clothes drop between the crevice, onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro is now naked and 1 inch tall, holding onto the seat. If he lets go, he will fall and break a couple of his bones. He\u2019s only able to hold on because his hands can grip the fabric now in his tiny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t... why am I small? Someone...\u201d said the terrified Hedoro. His grip is weak and he\u2019s going to fall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden jerk, the seat level out out suddenly. Hedoro bounce and now lie in the center of the seat. The sudden movement stunned him a little bit he is ok now. He looks up to whoever saved him only to find a giant ass falling towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait-.\u201d Hedoro voice is cut off as the ass sat down <span class=\"chunter\">on</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">his</span> <span class=\"chunter\">tiny</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">body</span>.</span></div></div>",

She looked briefly at her ticket for the seat number but she couldn\u2019t read it well. She was able to find her row but misread the 8 for a 9 and sat in the seat belonging to Hedoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui looked around, surprise to not find her companion waiting here for her. Where is Hedoro? She figured he would be here while she was in the bathroom. Perhaps he went to the bathroom after she did? Asui put a finger on her chin as she contemplated what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Asui\u2019s ass, Hedoro is shocked by the sudden development. Asui\u2019s butt fell down from the sky and her butt cheeks landed on his body. Hedoro groan in surprise as the force made him hit his head on the semi soft chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro open his eye but his vision is blocked off. He didn\u2019t even have time to figure out what happen when he heard the girl above say \u201cRibbit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the butt that landed on him moved. Asui was moving back to reposition herself, causing her to slide her ass on the naked Hedoro. Hedoro stayed still, frighten her black shorts would catch him and push him off the chair to a long fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Asui stopped moving, Hedoro felt something softer and causing far less pressure on his little body. He looks up and saw his torso and arms are free. But his legs are... gulp... under Asui\u2019s swollen pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, swollen isn\u2019t the right word. It\u2019s not big or fat. But it\u2019s making a notice imprint on Asui\u2019s black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro gulped as he stared at the giant pussy pinning his legs to the ground. Maybe he should first get out. He lifted his leg only to feel his leg slightly went in between her lips. Hedoro blush and quickly dropped his leg, leaving himself still under Asui\u2019s pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That ribbit earlier... it was from that girl, Asui! Oh god. What is happening to me? How did I get so small and...\u2019 \u201cGulp\u201d, \u2018How do I explain myself?\u2019 Hedoro thought as he continue to look at Asui\u2019s pussy. He doesn\u2019t even notice his cock is getting quite hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hedoro is having a reality and sexy crisis, Asui continues to look around the theater for her new friend. She is getting concern. If he was in the bathroom, then he is taking a long time. And what if he isn\u2019t in the bathroom and just left?

Not sure what was happening he tried to ignore it and the weight shifting above him from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuyu was embarrassed to admit that she was feeling a bit frustrated lately, looking at the cinema entrance to look for Hedero, but he wasn't there. Thinking that it couldn't hurt to release some pent up stress, she lowered her hand to her breast,  rolling it around and feeling hotter by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Hedero was trying to pull his legs free from his imprisonment until suddenly his legs became slippery. He felt relieved as he was now able to pull free... however his relief was cut short when his legs got caught by a hand and Tsuyu's ass shifted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuyu lowered herself deeper in her seat, into a more comfortable position,  in case someone saw what she was doing. Not knowing that she had moved her date deeper towards her pussy. While rolling her breast with her one hand she spread her legs and started rubbing up and down, imagining Hedero being there to rub her up ... unknown to her that in a way he was. She kept rubbing her panties, trying to hold back her moans. She stopped for a bit, and her juices caused you to stick to her fingers. She moved her other hand from her breast to remove her panties, revealing to Hedero her dripping pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedero watched in awe and horror at how his circumstances unfolded before him, but got distracted when he felt hot drops of some liquid falling on top of him. He looked up and saw Tsuyu's tongue slowly creeping down her arm until it slid over you but somehow not sweeping you away. You closed your eyes until you heard squishing sounds. You open one of your eyes as you saw her pumping her own pussy with her tongue. The squishing stopped and her tongue left its cave only for you to be shoved into it. You got pushed and pulled within your new environment. You could hear her heartbeat pounding through her canal, almost like someone turned the bass all the way up on speakers all around you. You heard her heartbeat increase, as well as the tempo of her hand and her moans were accelerating. In one final thrust, you hot separated from her hand and pushed forward against her cervix and at that exact moment she orgasmed opening a passage for you straight into her womb.</span></div></div>",

Isn\u2019t it kind of early?\u201d Hedoro asked. It\u2019s almost 8am, same time the Cultural Festival was going to begin. Restaurants are places you would go for maybe lunch or dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but I am planning to meet a friend of mine for Breakfast. The restaurant serves in the morning too, ribbit.\u201d Asui said. The street is slowly getting busier and the sidewalk they were standing was getting busy as well. \u201cLet\u2019s start heading there.\u201d Asui suggested and Hedoro nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A restaurant? I-is this a date? No no, that is silly. No way this cute frog wants to date a total stranger. C-could she?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui and Hedoro walk to this mysterious restaurant as the street grew livelier. The city is getting more alive, with students and workers walk past them. Hedoro notice a pro hero in uniform as well, across the street. She looked a little like a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who are you meeting?\u201d Hedoro brought up. He might as well make some small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRibbit?\u201d Asui didn\u2019t understand the question. She is avoiding the oncoming crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell- oof,\u201d Hedoro bumped shoulders with a girl with pink skin. He quickly tried to apologize but the girl is already gone. \u201cYou mention you are meeting a friend. Who are you meeting with?\u201d Hedoro reaches out a hand and grab Asui\u2019s shoulder, to make sure she didn\u2019t get too far ahead. The morning crowd tried to push their way through the other of them, hoping to reach the train in time. The touch cause her to croak in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend from U.A. is meeting me. She is suggested we eat there this morning before we do our activities.\u201d Asui said, politely shaking off Hedoro\u2019s hand as the crowd lessens. Her tongue dangles a bit out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hm? Her friend? So she wasn\u2019t lonely? Then why did she invite me? I guess it was too much assumption to think of this as a date.</i> Hedoro thought. His glowing green eyes darken with his anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning a corner, Asui comes to a pause. \u201cWe are here, ribbit.\u201d Hedoro looks up and <span class=\"chunter\">read</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">the</span> <span class=\"chunter\">restaurant\u2019s</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">name</span>.</span></div></div>",

Nothing. Maybe it\u2019s because he is using English characters to translate and not Chinese\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui looks at Hedoro in surprise. \u201cWow, you said that in one go.\u201d She said, a little impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took a Chinese class when I was... more active in school. I don\u2019t know many words, but I was rigorously taught about pronunciations.\u201d Hedoro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui nodded. Her face is giving nothing away. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s go in. I\u2019m starving.\u201d Asui walked forward and open the door. Hedoro closely followed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese restaurant interior is gorgeous. There is a mix of green, red, and gold colors scatter around the place. Hedoro looks around, startling a bit when he turn his head and sees a statue of a dragon! Eating people. Hedoro chuckle. That is some dark humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui approach the counter, where are server girl is waiting. \u201cTable for three or possibly four, ribbit?\u201d She ask. She straighten her back a little as she talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tsuyu! It\u2019s been awhile. How have you been?\u201d She eyes Hedoro for a second. \u201cDoing well I see. Uh, I believe we have a open table in the back. Follow me.\u201d The Chinese lady said, chatting quickly. Hedoro felt like he missed something but went along with it. He thought they would wait for a bit but it appears there is little to no wait in this restaurant. Business must be slow, Hedoro figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese lady grab a couple of menus and walk away from the counter. Asui grabs Hedoro\u2019s hand, which made him blush. She pulls him along till they reach the back table. \u201cTake your seats.\u201d The Chinese lady suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro sat down on the soft, red cushion. This table is really nice. Wait, it just occur to him. Who is going to pay eating at a fancy place like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hedoro contemplates the money, the cute frog girl sits next to him, instead across, blocking Hedoro in. Hedoro didn\u2019t notice till Asui\u2019s hips touch his. Hedoro turns his head but Asui acts like nothing is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese lady smiled slyly. \u201cWell, would anyone would like some water while you look over the menu?\u201d Asui raise her hand at a faster speed than Hedoro has seen. The cute frog really likes water. Hedoro shyly raise his hand too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese lady smile politely and left, leaving Asui and Hedoro sitting in silence. <i>Ok...</i> Hedoro knows this is not a date (maybe) but he should get to know her. ... No, nothing is coming up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up really quickly, Hedoro reaches out for the two menus. Only for his hand to be slapped by... a tongue? \u201cSorry, but those are special menus. I have one and my friend has one. Think of it more like a surprise for you, ribbit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? That\u2019s kinda weird.\u201d Hedoro said, rubbing his hand. But ultimately stops. If she is not letting him see the menu, she is probably is going to order for him. Which means she might pay. That doesn\u2019t seem right but he left his wallet at home and she did insist both of them to come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute pass and Hedoro finally thought of something to ask. \u201cHey, Asui.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui stopped looking out for her friend and looks at Hedoro. \u201cRibbit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we\u2019ve only know each other for an hour but can I call you by your given name? Like the server lady who went to give us some water.\u201d Hedoro likes the idea of calling her Tsuyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsui looks at Hedoro for a moment and said, \u201cMy friends call my Tsu. Why not that, ribbit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-ok. Tsu.\u201d Did she just call him a friend?

I\u2019m sure she will be here.\u201d Tsuyu said comfortably in a neutral expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server lady bowed her head and left. After the server left, Tsuyu reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. She seems to be trying to figure out where her friend is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro sighed. This isn\u2019t as exciting as he thought it would be. Well, his mind was making unrealistic expectations. Especially from a stranger he just met. Though, it wasn\u2019t like he had anything else going on for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro looked around and notice there are less people around. Huh. He didn\u2019t see anyone leave. Maybe he miscounted. He looked over at a woman he couldn\u2019t see the front of. There was a wet yellow sandals discarded next to her table. Probably a person who doesn\u2019t like to wear shoes in restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRibbit...\u201d A sad sound came from Tsuyu. She stared at her phone and scrolled through her messages. With a look of defeat, she locked her phone and put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Hedoro ask, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuyu sighed. \u201cMy friend isn\u2019t coming today. She already... ate. She had somewhere to be and so she had to eat without me.\u201d Tsuyu lean forward and rested her head on the table, looking glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro nodded but he doesn\u2019t know what he is nodding for. Perhaps, if he got to know Tsuyu more, he could cheer her up. If anything, break this tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro grabbed his glass of water and took a drink. He took a gulp before setting the drink down. His mind felt a little off quickly by the drink that it surprised him. Isn\u2019t this water and not alcohol?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuyu spoke up again. \u201cI\u2019ll have to eat by myself today, ribbit. One tasty Hedoro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHedoro is confused but the feeling of dizziness grew stronger. His motor skills are failing and his consciousness is fading. He look at Tsuyu, who is watching him, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nooooooooo... what? I don\u2019t...</i>Hedoro is panicking. He doesn\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on but he knows it\u2019s bad. He musters all of his willpower to do something, anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Hedoro sees before losing consciousness is that <span class=\"chunter\">his</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">hands</span> <span class=\"chunter\">are</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">glowing</span>.</span></div></div>",

Well, asking what she is like might be too vaguest the moment. He is about to meet her anyway. He suppose he should ask something more specific. \u201cWell, when did you both started coming here to this restaurant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuyu paused and put her finger to her chin and looked up, thinking. \u201cWell... I guess it was a couple months ago. We ran into each other on the street. I was heading home for the day, after I went to buy groceries. We met near by and, if I remember, ribbit, she was the one who noticed me. We talk a little while before she invited me here for my first time. The food was delicious. All it took was one try to make me want more. And since then we come here every weekend, ribbit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuyu ended it off with a growl from her stomach. She blush and looked away.<br>\r\nHedoro chuckle in respond. \u201cThat was a simple story. Did you leave anything out?\u201d Hedoro said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo clue, ribbit. But the food here is amazing.\u201d Tsuyu said. Her tongue is starting to get moist. Most likely getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Tsu!

Their vigor would have impressed Hedoro, were his attention not already drawn to their still expanding curves. In fact, were he more lucid, he might have just noticed the slight glow around both their curves, and his own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls just kept eating, more and more, up to 12, 13, 15, 18 meals. But they still weren't stopping. They both noticed that they were getting some strange looks from surrounding patrons, but they chocked it up to how much they were eating, still completely oblivious to their expanding assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they both finished their 20th meal, an extra large order of orange chicken for each of them, they sighed in unison and rested their hands on their stomaches. Ironically, one of the few places on them that didn't grow, dispite the ridiculous amount of food they both just consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm stuffed finally.\" Mina was the first to speak up. \"I can't believe we both ate all that. This has to be some new world record or so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were cut off by a cartoonishly loud burp erupting from her. It made her blush from embarrassment, but almost immediately after she started chuckling at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Mina?\" Tsuyu spoke up as well. \"Were you always this...Large?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you...W-WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina finally looked down, and saw her now soccerball sized melons of breasts, with an ass to match. Tsu then looks down and notices her own curves, a shocked expression coming over her face. She wasn't looking much different, albeit very slightly smaller, due to her being smaller to begin with. But with their new sizes, the difference makes little to no difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina looks over at Hedoro, and noticed him staring at them, still entranced by this. \"You! Did you do this!\" She practically screamed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?\" Hedoro was finally lucid again. \"N-No! I don't even have a quirk! I couldn't have done it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina, still a bit angry and embarrassed, huffed at this. She couldn't tell if him saying no was worse than him admitting to it. At least then they would have gotten an answer as to what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get out of here at least! Come on Mina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina nodded in agreement, and Hedoro got up to let Tsu out. Both girls had hard times getting out, as their expanded thighs were running against both the table and their seats. They quickly get out of the restaurant, and into a nearby alley. Moving was very awkward for the 2 girls, especially Tsu, who couldn't hop around like she was used to, due to her breasts and ass being squished against the sidewalk whenever she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in the alleyway, they had some time to breathe and calm down, but that's when the girls noticed...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s a big deal in your family, like the Super Bowl for families of old. It was enjoyable to watch but the highlight was the tournament. There was a lot a cool action and different quirks clashing together, but the best part was when Shoto faced off against that green hair boy. Such power. It may have been your imagination but it felt like you could feel the shock wave from your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I never seen something so grand in my life!\u201d You squeal. Here you are, standing in front of someone famous. It feels surreal. You don\u2019t even notice your arm turning back to it\u2019s normal color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Shoto seemed impatient. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad my ice didn\u2019t hurt you too bad. I need to be off. I have important business to attend to. I hope you have a pleasant day.\u201d With that rush send off, Shoto turned and begin to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait...\u201d You began following him.

I, too, was not looking where I was going.\u201d The girl accepted your hand and you pulled her up on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the girl is standing, you realize just how tall she is.

I have to wear this outfit I had on from the Sport Festival for an  event later and I left the school grounds with it on without thinking.\u201d The girl chuckle a little, like she was relieving some of the awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that does make sense. Sort of. You have no idea what part she is talking about but now you have someone to lead you to the school. \u201cUm, well, I\u2019m actually heading for U.A. but I got lost. Could you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pause. She frown a bit while she is in deep thought, looking over to her right. Your eyes wander a bit, looking down at her developed chest.

You smack yourself mentally for being so blunt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you probably don\u2019t want to be recognized for that. I just realized I knew your name and blurted out the correlation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright, it\u2019s been happening quite often so I\u2019m getting used to it,\u201d she replies as she starts  walking. You follow slightly behind and to the left of the U.A. student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to let the awkwardness to last you say, \u201cso you participated in the festival. I hear that hero agencies use the event to spot talent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do. It\u2019s a great opportunity for heroes in training to get noticed. Being spotted in the tournament can allow students to make a presence in the pro world, even if only a tiny one,\u201d Momo responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have in fact. I\u2019m in the final round,\u201d she says with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a dress code for the festival or...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe festival is set up so the first two rounds will narrow down the number of participants. Before the third and final challenge there is a field day for those who lost. This allows for some fun for students who were dropped from the competition and gives them another chance to show off their quirks. Apparently it is a tradition that the girls not participating dress in cheer outfits for the event\u201d she explains while swaying her hips hypnotically. Being a hormonal 15 year old her listen as best you can while trying not to stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d you say as a breeze causes her skirt to ruffle. Averting your eyes as so not to be called a perv, you take the chance to adjust your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more walking you see stalls and a large arena ahead. You assume this is the place and speed up to walk beside your guide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, I guess the school makes plenty of money from these events. Most my school gets is a bake sale for the football team,\u201d you offer mindlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose the school is quite profitable,\u201d Momo concludes with an off tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked you add, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that in a judgmental way. I\u2019m happy that a school that trains our future defenders has plenty of money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, one can\u2019t put a price on knowledge,\u201d Yaoyorozu asserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk to an entrance to the arena and Momo stops. \u201cThis is where we part ways. It was nice to meet you Kibo Hinata.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for you Momo Yaoyorozu,\u201d you say as you extend your hand for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, she accepts your hand. You blush at her quiet beauty and get lost in the moment. Feeling a tightening in your trousers, your mind wanders. By accident your quirk activates and the girl slowly expands. Only slightly in the bust and hips before you realize what you\u2019re doing and release her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, goodbye,\u201d she says and walks away. You attempt to ask her to wait to explain and reverse what you\u2019ve done, but shame overwhelms you and your throat catches. Hearing the noise she turns around to see you with your hand raised and smiles before waving and continues walking. A deep crimson adorns your face and neck. You shove your hands in your pocket before trudging away.</span></div></div>",

I apologize for the shift from previous chapters.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibo tucked his chin into the high color of his grey jacket while his hands rested deep in its pockets. His face was still burning as he entered the tunnel that lead to the seats. He felt so bad. He'd been doing so well in controlling his quirk for the last few years, but the second he meets a pretty girl his looses control. He stopped at the foot of the stairs and banged his head against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time he'd altered peoples sizes. All through out junior high he'd augmented the proportions of his classmates and teachers, each time by accident. Kibo's erection was still raging from the experience. He hit his head on the wall again. \"Go away dammit,\" he cursed. It didn't help that he was a macrophiliac. Whether this was a result of his quirk or just a cruel coincident he didn't know. A text pulled his attention. Grabbing his phone, he saw he had a text from his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Where are you?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>In the arena.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Cool, I'm in section D. Row 45.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point all Kibo wanted to do was go home, but he made a promise that he'd come. He was already late so the least he could do was watch the final round. He made his way up the stairs and maneuvered carefully through the crowd. As he searched for a sign from his friend heard the announcer declare the beginning of the recreational games. He turned to see the cheerleaders dancing on the sidelines before the announcer pointed out the female students of class 1A. When he saw Momo his blush came back with a vengeance. He pulled the collar of his jacket up over his cheeks and rushed up the stairs. A loud whistle stopped him. Looking to his left he saw his friend waving at him. Kibo tiptoed passed the seated audience members  to reach his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't the police tell you to stop using your quirk in public?\" Kibo asked as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like they'll even know I used it here,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hayden Goto: His quirk Whistle. The volume and pitch of his whistle can rival that of a fog horn.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the people around you would complain about their bleeding ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. It wasn't that loud. Not like that time at Kyda's house,\" Hayden smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure bringing up the time you shattered all the windows in a house is a good way of changing my mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a buzz kill. You know, you where a lot more fun in middle school,\" he said causing Kibo to grimace. With a shoving of Kibo's shoulder Hayden said, \"dude. Chill out. It was the past. You need to get over it and look at the here and know. For example.\" He gestured toward the game that was currently being played. Kibo watched and tried to put his shame out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on and Kibo actually found himself enjoying himself. He and Hayden laughed and cheered as the recreational section of the festival, then things moved onto the fourth and final part of the festival. A bracket tournament that would decide the winner. It was enjoyable as it started, save for the part where he and hayden where nearly frozen solid by Shoto Todaroki. It wasn't until the sixth match that Kibo actually cared what was going on. Fumikage Tokoyami vs Momo Yaoyorozu. Watching intently, Kibo noticed that Momo's uniform didn't zip up all the way. That was his fault. As soon as the match began Tokoyami unleashed a series of quick strikes. All Momo could do was create a shield to attempt to stay in the match, but it was ultimately fruitless. Momo looked so distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Was that my fault. She looked like she was distracted at the beginning of the match, and she looked like she was off balance. She lost because of me</i>,\" Kibo thought as he clenched his fists. He quickly stood up and headed for the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom?\" Hayden asked to Kibo's back. Taking the stairs two steps at a time, Kibo ran down the steps before grabbing the railing and using it as a pivot to swing around a corner. He then began to run around wildly looking for the waiting area for the combatants. After much searching for what felt like an eternity Kibo eventually found Momo walking slowly toward a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaoyorozu!\" he shouted. She looked up to see him as he fell to his knees, slammed his head on the ground and slid to a stop in front of her. \"I'm so sorry,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata?\" she questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry. It's my fault that you lose. My quirk is Size Change. My vulgar mind caused your breasts and hips to grow. It threw you off and caused you to lose. There is no excuse for this deviant act. Especially after you were so kind to help me. I submit to you. Punish me as you wish. Call the police, tell the pro heroes, beat my worthless body. I deserve it,\" Kibo sobbed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kibo,\" Momo said as she looked down at her chest. She hadn't even noticed. Looking down at the wreck of a boy before her,, Yaoyorozu knelt down and put a hand on his back. \"It wasn't your fault Kibo. Tokoyami overwhelmed me. Your augmentations did nothing to change the results of my match,\" she reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so. I defiled your body,\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done no such things. If anything you helped me in my match,\" she assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?' Kibo asked as he looked up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My quirk uses the lipids stored in my body to fuel my creations. By increasing my bust, you increased the stores I had available,\" she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still...\" Kibo was interupted by Momo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You admitted to the act and are obviously repentant, so I forgive you. Now please forgive yourself,\" she pleaded and held out a hand to help him up. Kibo took it and rose to her feet. \"Your quirk isn't activated by touch is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I have to activate it but I have to have physical contact with a person if I'm to affect them, but I sometimes have trouble controlling it when it comes to others,\" he explained while looking at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so what caused you to activate your quirk?\" she questioned. Kibo blushed again at the question and averted his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she said with a subtly smile \"well then. I can think of only one thing to do.\" Kibo looked up at her. \"I will have to help you gain control of your quirk. Hand me your phone.\" Kibo did as told and Momo took it before imputing numbers. \"This is my number. After this festival is over, I will contact you and work out a training schedule for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo handed the phone back and looked at Kibo who stood dumbfounded. \"I...\" he stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will talk to you later Kibo Hinata,\" she informed before turning around and walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"</span></div></div>",

You can also do so if you want.\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking to the U.A. while chatting along the way. \"For what reason were you heading to the U.A.?\" Yamomo asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what the reason was, realizing you were distracted from your original objective. \"Ah. I was meeting up with a student there. We have chatted over the internet for a long time now but haven't met yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that student?\" Momo asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ochaco Uraraka. We both started looking for a penpale couple of months ago and have texted since.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Ochaco-chan. She didn't tell us about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't ?\" You ask in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo shakes her head. \"Never. I don't know why.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamomo grew silent.

That w-would be weird wouldn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo giggles. \"You are just like Ochaco. She would have made the same reaction.\" You giggle back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitada Ayako is a 5'ft tall girl with black hair with white tips going down to her waist. She wears a baggy, thin pullover that reveals her shoulders and also baggy jeans that are hanging on one side of her hips but don't touch her black shoes with a white bottom because they have been especially cut for her comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of walking you and your new friend changed the topics multiple times already. Yamomo is very kind, fun person to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Yamomo notices something on your hand. \"Hold on a second!\" She saids, taking your hand. She inspects it throughly, making you blush and squirm a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, her face relax and she lets out a sigh. \"Only a little dirt. As I thought. Let me clean it.\" Yamomo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her arm started glowing as a tissue emerged out of it. \"Wow!\" You said in surprise, as you watch Momo pulling out the tissue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry. I didn't tell you my quirk. I can create thing out of my body. Now hold still.\" She rubs of the dirty space on your hand. You smile at her for her kind behavior although you didn't notice the dirt and it didn't bother you. \"Now we can go.\" Momo says after throwing the tissue into a trashcan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Momo stops again after you kept walking for a while. She didn't look good. She tried to cover it up with a forced expression in her face but you see she isn't feeling good. You step closer to her holding your hands steady above her if she would fall over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is fine. It's just my quirk. Don't worry.\" She said, putting up a strong face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly find out that was a lie.

Because she had used her quirk earlier she had become very hungry and dehydrated. She was on her way to U.A. already before she met Ayako. Creating the tissue has then overpowered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold her as Momo pants in slight pain. You don't notice your hands are glowing as they touch Momo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. I can stand again. Thanks for catching me.\" Momo says trying to stand up again. But just as she tries to stand up another feeling strikes her causing her whole body to glow. \"Oh no. Not again.\" you say as you realize your hands are glowing as well as the white tips of your hair. You raise them a bit away from Momo's body until you hold Momo only with your wrist and lower arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo starts shaking and drops the pom poms as she feels the strange feeling flowing through her whole body. Suddenly her skirt's belt digs into her waist while her boobs a pushing against the uniforms top. Her socks start crawling towards her feet and the edge of her skirt upwards revealing more and more of her legs. Her bra and her panties also dig into her body as she seems to be growing in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look frustrated at the U.A. student growing in your arms. You know you have a lot to explain once this is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo grows by any second that passes. After a short time her socks start to rip apart when they are close to her ankle. Her skirt rises to the point where they uncover her panties. The top of her outfit lays on her breasts mostly and shows her underboobs already. The back of it starts ripping apart revealing her bra strap shortly after. The front also start giving away as her boobs push outwards more and more. Her growth come to an end before her skirt also starts falling apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now hold a heavily panting 7'10\" student with slightly demolished clothes in your arms. Worries start to form inside of you because you used your quirk, you tried to hide, accidentally on the student that was so kind to you and wanted to lead you to the academy. Now you fear that Momo will react shocked or angry at you when she realizes that you have grown her on accident. Plus she is now standing in the middle of the street with some of her private parts revealed. If she moves a bit her clothes will probably burst apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo catches her breath again. She raises up from your arms and says: \"Thanks for holding me. I haven't eaten since a while now. My quirk needs large amounts food. Sorry for concerning you. I wanted to-\" she stops midsentce as a light breeze blows between her thighs and around her underboobs. Scared at first she covers her revealed body parts, although she is used to her rather skimpy hero outfit. But her somehow shortened cheerleader uniform catches her by surprise. \"Wha... What happened?\" she whispers leaning forward. You look away from her saying \"It's my fault. It was my quirk that grew you. Sorry I didn't mean to. I can't control it completely.\" Momo looks down at the embarrassed you. \"I... I understand. Would you please try to shrink me back to normal again.\" she says in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo understands your insecurity and isn't angry about your uncontrolled action. You look into her eyes that are surrounded by a blushing face. The small amazon is seemingly embarrassed about her new height and the clothes that reveal special parts of her body. You nod your head as you want to help her out of her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will try.\" you tell her. \"Try is better than nothing.\" Momo says as she stands up again still covering her body. You rest your hand on Momo's waist and concentrate on your power again. Your hand and hair's tips start glowing again as you touch Momo. Momo can feel her body having a strange feeling again. She looks down at you <span class=\"clred\">worried</span> <span class=\"cbyellow\">and </span><span class=\"clred\">watches </span><span class=\"cbyellow\">you</span>...</span></div></div>",

Your pullover starts rising above your shoulders and your jeans also correcting it's position until both sides of your hip are covered by your jeans again. Independent from your black part of your hair, your white hair tips start growing longer. As you grow larger, they also do. Within seconds you pass Momo's boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Momo starts shrinking again. Her clothes become comfortable again. Her skirt wanders down thighs again and her top cover all of her boobs again. Relieved Momo sights as you pass her boobs.She doesn't notice your growth until you reach her chin with your now ass-long hair. Your pullover already starts stretching and your jeans transform into skinny jeans as you grow. You feel that you or actually your clothes have reached their limits. Although your clothes were made to hold until you are 8' tall, they already start making stretching noises at 7'5\". You stop immediately growing, because you don't want your special clothes to rip apart. After that your hair now hangs down to your knees. The half of them now consists of a white part. Sighing you open your eyes to look at Momo, but yelp as you now have to look down to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo realizes something is wrong. The cheerleader clothes she is wearing still aren't fitting. But instead of being very tight they are loose. The neck hole of her top is nearly falling off her shoulders and the half of her hips is revealed by her also loose skirt. Shocked she stares up to you. A bit surprised you look at the now 5'5\" instead of 5'8\" tall Momo. You turn your head towards the ground in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... As I said, I can't control my quirk perfectly... Sorry. Let me fix this.\" you tell her and rest your hand on Momo's shoulder. Momo grows above your boobs. You shrink by 3 inches while she grows by 3 inches. Also your hair looses length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Momo checked everything on her body and clothes, she starts asking you. \"What is going on here? Could you please explain... everything?\" \"Yes.\" you respond. \"I owe you an explanation.\" You start walking towards the school again. On the way you explain to her: \"First off, I want to become a hero. But I am just a shy little girl. And as you just witnessed, I can't even control my quirk. Expansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Imagine the quirk explaining voice from the anime.* <i>Expansion! It's owner can grow, absorb or shrink an part of his body or his entire body by absorbing the air particles around him that transform into the needed matter. The same can be done to someone else or someone else's body parts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of impressed, Momo looks up to you. \"Wow.\" she says looking at her pom poms. \"Your quirk is kinda interesting. And, as of now, you aren't that little.\" A bit cheered up you look down at her. Momo continues: \"Don't be so turned down by just that little accident. We all had a rough start. I'm sure you will be accepted by our academy. Then you will improve time after time. I guarantee you, you will become a pro student just like us. Trust me.\" All her negative emotions are kind of gone. She isn't angry at you or mad about what happened. Puzzled you look at her. \"Why are you so kind to me? I just grew you to amazon size and gave you a little fright. Your clothes are all stretched out and destroyed.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" Momo responds shrugging her shoulders. \"We all have started bad. Accidents happen. You will be a super hero after all. I remember how I have accidentally created bombs instead of... several things. I actually don't want to talk about it. But still. You can also become a hero. Like I want to.\" Her smile kinda warms your heart. You burst out in tears and kneel down in front of Momo. \"Thank you!\" you cry out on her shoulder. Momo acts surprised as you, a 7'2\" tall amazon, rests her head on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Momo are close to the school and are still chatting about the awesomeness of the <span class=\"cred\">U.A.. </span><span class=\"cbyellow\">Suddenly </span><span class=\"cred\">you </span><span class=\"cbyellow\">notice</span>...</span></div></div>",

You look at Momo while you start to panic just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Momo asks you. \"Just follow Midnight-sensei. You'll be fine.\" Momo assures you but she smile quivers a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a large gulp, you follow Midnight closely. You have to slow down a bit every once in a while or you would get to close to Midnight, due to your complicated size. Before entering the U.A., you look back at Momo one last time. She waves at you. Another friend of her also starts waving at you as well as a common friend of yours. Uraraka stands right beside them and saw you already at the front gate. Encouraged, you enter the building to get to the assignment with the head teachers of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the school is build for all kinds of people with different quirks, you hit your head a third time by now on a door frame. The first time right at the entrance was already embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here.\" Midnight says pointing at a chair and leaving the room again. Multiple chairs and desks are inside the room. This must be the room where you will meet the pro-hero teachers of the school. You are really nervous by that point. What if you mess up? What if you are not passing or answer something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the teachers enter the room and sat at their respective desks. One desk is empty and you can't see Allmight. He must be some where else. The last one to come in Eraserhead, looking as tired as always. He seems to be looking around the room. Perhaps as a precaution, using his quirk to check if the walls were effected. You are fine because you aren't trying to grow or shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we can start.\" Eraserhaed says sleepy as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you must be Kitada Ayako. Nice to meet ya.\" the principal starts talking. Aw, he looks adorable. \"So you want to attend this school, right? May I ask you, why do you want to attend the school?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... I want to... I want to become a hero.\" you answer simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we hear a lot.\" Earaserhead says plain. His words cause a cold shower on your back. You already start to get frustrated but try to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy are they here? This isn\u2019t a normal U.A. evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" The principal continues. \"What's your quirk? I wasn't able to read your file and therefore don't know your quirk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain your quirk as detailed as possible. But describing isn't enough. The principal wants you to show it. So you have no other choice but to just do it. \"Which part of it... should I present you?

Dressed in the uniform of The U.H.C, the student looked at you with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, I didn't even notice that you were there!\" Brushing off the detriment from your clothes, the girl patted you down until she got every speck of dirt off of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine.\" You reply. \"It wasn't too hard of a landing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking more closely at the girl, your mined racked itself in thought. Where had you seen her before? Wait a minute, you remembered! She was a part of that one class with that kid who kept breaking his limbs. That..that boy was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aren't you Pinky?\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl brightened up and gave you a small salute for confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I am and whom do I have the honor of speaking with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply with your name. Nodding, Pinky seemed quite happy. Half-mindedly looking at her wrist,the student gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at the time, it seem like I gotta go.\" She exclaims. \"I need to get back onto campus for the festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, festival.\"</i>You think as she begins to walk away. \"Oh, excuse me, but I'm actually going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hand onto the girls shoulder, but unfortunately, a certain embarrassment rears its head. Your Quirk, which seems to have a mind of its own, activated at this moment. A slight tingle throughout your body, then a ripple across your target,which then results in either two effects.</span></div></div>",

You then said loud enough for Mina to hear, \"Motherf*cker! I hate it when my Quirk does it's own thing. F*ck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you didn't do this?!\" Mina asked as her breast slowly grew in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"My Quirk... It doesn't always listen to me. Probably because I barely use it and it happens to act on it's own sometimes. Like a person yearning to do something and they do something rash even though they're told not to do anything.\" You look back at her breasts and they are roughly 1.5 times bigger than her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Why do I get the feeling this isn't stopping anytime soon?\" Mina thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to avoid any unwanted glances, we should probably leave the street,\" you said to Mina while looking at the normal people who were passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... where should we go?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alleys are probably going to have criminals so that's a no. Abandon buildings might also have criminals and villains and probably really fragile and dangerous, so also no. The only other option I could think of is my house, and it's close by,\" you said to Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's go. This would be really embarrassing is one of my classmates saw me like this. Especially the perv! He'd probably try to touch my boobs and then...\" Mina shudder at the thought, and you had no intention of asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly navigate the street to your house and you quickly get Mina inside your house before closing the door behind you. \"That... was easy,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina nods and stretches with her hands in the air. She then yawned as if she was tired...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then she fell backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rushed over to her and saw why she fell. Her breasts were roughly 3 times bigger than when they first met, and they almost doubled the last time he checked their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Mina said in a whiny tone. \"This feels so good yet I know it's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure what to do,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try using your Quirk on me,\" Mina suggested. You quickly shook your head and also but your hands in front of you and waved fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! I don't want to mess up again. What if I expand your breasts even more, or even somewhere else!? Hell, maybe even shrink you or make you grow tall, like a giant!\" You countered, scared that you might do something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it!\" Mina yelled at you. You still were too scared to do anything, and she realized this. She then quickly pushed herself up so she could stand even though now she had to hold her breast so she wasn't falling over. '<i>My breasts my be even bigger than Momo's!</i>' she thought. She pushed that thought aside as she walked to you and <b>kissed you on your lips.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and when she pulls away, you are left speechless. \"Please... Just try,\" Mina begged.

Maybe you should've worn those gloves your friend gave you for your birthday last year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina then wiggles as she appears uncomfortable. \"Why did I have to wear a tight shirt today?\" Mina asked, as her shirts dug into her breasts and seemed to hurt the pink girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to do anything, so you simply looked away blushing. That kiss she gave you was really affecting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, um...\" Mina said while getting your attention. \"Now that I think about it, you didn't give me a name. What's your name so I can at least know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You're scared that she might report you because of this, but you simply sigh and said, \"Mike Walters. My name is Mike Walters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mike,\" Mina said, \"do you mind unbuttoning my shirt? It's a little too tight on me, and also I can't reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" You're not sure about this, but you also realize that you kinda need to help her since your Quirk decided to be a dick to you. \"Okay... But are you sure? I mean, we just met and...\" You're just uncomfortable with how this situation is made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm sure! I also meant that kiss as well,\" Mina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... okay fine! But I'm not that convinced about that kiss,\" you said as you move in front of Mina and start to undo the buttons of her uniform. You realize that the buttons are basically glued on thanks to the intense pressure that both of her breasts are under, so it took you a while to undo her buttons... though Mina's shirt was slightly ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*pant*, *pant*. Thank you,\" Mina says as she smiles now that her breasts are somewhat free. She had a undershirt on in the form of a white shirt that also covered her breasts, though now that her uniform top was unbuttoned her undershirt started to lift up and it eventually pulled back to the base of her neck where her newly sized breasts met her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time you checked the size of her breasts when you glanced at her, her breasts were triple the size they already where. Now you realized that they were the length of your upper body and also the width of a melon (longways).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, these puppies are big,\" Mina joked, despite the fact that she could barely move now thanks to the weight of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is now really a good time to joke?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but might as well enjoy them while they're there. Am I right?\" Mina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're the one with the huge breasts,\" you retorted. Though she's actually the one bearing the huge breasts that you can say are beanbag-chair sized, you can't help but want to squeeze them. You resist the urge to, since you've just met Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you mind explaining a bit about your Quirk now?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then explain your Quirk and it's affects to Mina. She is surprised the whole time, and is impressed by what your Quirk can do. You then finished explaining your Quirk's abilities to Mina. \"To recap, I can expand any part of a person, or make a person grow. I can also do the opposite and make a person's part small and also shrink them too. I can't effect clothes though, which is why your clothes didn't grow with your breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Mina said, impressed by your Quirk. \"So... how much control do you have over it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" you said sheepishly, remembering the multiple times you've accidentally shrunk/grown your friends (both male and female) when they were at your house. Those were some weird days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Mina was currently thinking to herself and trying to decide what to do. \"I could help you control your Quirk,\" Mina offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You questioned. Were you hearing things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you control your Quirk,\" Mina said as she looked at her breasts and rubbed them. She noted at how soft they were and also how they also had this sloshing in them. Were they filled with milk? Mina didn't want to know as she was slightly scared to know the answer, though she was slightly excited and turned on because of that. Why was she turned on? She didn't even know herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" You asked. \"I already feel guilty by accidentally using my Quirk on you, and now we both probably have missed the Festival...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Mina ordered as she slapped you. It hurt and stung, and it also shocked you. \"Now you are going to let me help you, because that's what a hero does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" you replied, still surprised and baffled by Mina's willingness to help you, and also that slap you received in your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Can you shrink these too? I might need to move in order to help you,\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to not f*ck up and you shrunk Mina's boobs down until she said stop. Mina knew that the current size of her breasts was the same size of Momo's, but you don't remember the exact size and assume that's their original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina stood up and stretched as she was kinda stuck as her beanbag-chair sized breasts were on top of her legs. After that, Mina looks at you and smiles. \"<b>It's time to help you.</b> Now... <span class=\"chotpink\">let's begin with</span>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>Choose how Mina will expand/grow/shrink.

It sounds fun and interesting,\" Mina said. \"Plus, then we'd technically have more room for me to expand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you're right,\" you said. \"Though I think you should probably remove your clothes, since you're clothes will come off when I shrink you, and it's better to have them in a place then just there on the floor, where we could probably run into/trip over, since I'm not shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Mina said. \"Where should I change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step in front of Mina and look down the first hallway that is to your left. There are three doors, one being the basement living area and also bedroom with it's own bathroom down there as well in the first door to the left. The second is on the right and also is the laundry room. The last door is the bathroom you never have used, and you think has never been used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the bathroom and opened the door. Mina came up behind you and she peered into the bathroom. \"Wow, it looks so clean,\" she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's never been used once since I've been in this house, and even then I come in here and clean every Sunday,\" you informed. \"You can change in here. I'll be in my room at the farthest door on the right from the front door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Mina said while nodding. She then entered the bathroom and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went to your room, roughly 12 feet in length and width though you also think it's technically 13 and a half feet in width. The ceiling is at least 12 feet tall, or at least the walls are. Your room doesn't have much in it, besides a small desk, a bed, and a nightstand right next to your bed. You opened a drawer and then smiled as your opened book 4 of a series you read when you were younger and still in North America. You just happened to also remember about a YouTuber you used to watch, a smile as you start repeating a version of a story but in an abridged version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there I was, standing back to back with a man who calls himself Jesus!\" You began. \"A bottle of beer in my right hand, the album 'Swan Songs' by Hollywood Undead in my left. Ready to make the most craziest party bloom from my own finger tips! We were running low on beer and were on the last pack, so I yelled to Jesus from across the orphanage. I yelled, 'Jesus! We need more beer!' Never have I seen a Mexican run to the store to buy 20 packs of beer at once and run into a orphanage carrying all 20 packs in less than one minute! But we partied like we have never end before, and eventually the cops showed up and arrested us all. It went down in history, as the 'Party of the Undead Swans'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that was a nice story,\" Mina said from your doorway. You almost turned to her and said \"thank you\" when you realized she was naked. If this was a normal thing and not for your Quirk, maybe you would have turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, you saw that her breasts were large even though you've already seen them. Despite them being large, you couldn't help but noticed her nipples were also pink, affected by her Quirk no doubt. You were honestly mesmerized by how she kinda glowed thanks to her pink body and your room's light. It was otherworldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ready to begin?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound like we're about to have sex, though really we're not,\" you couldn't help but blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right,\" Mina agreed. You didn't expect that response. \"But if you want we could.\" You didn't know if she was joking or teasing you, but you also couldn't help but notice she licked her lips in a sexual way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you teasing me?\" You asked, slightly concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina pondered on that for a few seconds before walking up to you, and also wrapped her arms under your arms and grabbed your shoulders. \"Honestly, I was. But... I think I might've been serious,\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, talk about a fast relationship,\" you mumbled, though she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So you do want me to be your girlfriend,\" Mina said, making you blush while looking away. \"Okay, let's see how I feel after my small adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as she let go of you. Then you placed a hand on her shoulder and willed her to shrink to at least a tenth of her size. (The official height of Mina Ashido is 5'3, so a tenth of her size would be roughly 5.3 inches.) Mina then started shrinking rapidly, and she seemed giddy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, this feels amazing!\" She says while she shrinks. \"It's like the world's growing and I'm the one unaffected. Heh heh heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds, she stopped shrinking. \"Wow, I must be really small now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's your height if you were normal sized?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 5'3. Why?\" Mina asked. \"Also, why do I sound just as loud and also hear like I'm normal sized?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, it's so I can estimate that you are 5.3 inches as you are a tenth of your size. Second, don't ask me. I've never been tiny before by using my Quirk. I barely used it,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I'm tiny then!\" Mina exclaimed after you were done talking. \"Do you think I can jump higher now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. But let's not test that since you would probably break a bone or two and I do not want to have to explain why you broke a bone or two,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" Mina said in a pouting tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply smirk and grab Mina. She's shocked by this and then you place her on your desk, where you do any written homework assignments, or even computer homework. She sighs as she probably assumed you were going to do something other than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now you have some <span class=\"cblue\">high ground</span>,\" you said to Mina. \"But, now you mentioned something about <span class=\"chotpink\">expansion</span>. So... <span class=\"cyellow\">how should we proceed with your tiny expansion?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

'And I'm curious about a few things.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think about this and anticipated either her wanting her breasts to expand, or her ass. You smile, and wondered how to proceed with this. On one hand, you could make them whatever size you want since Mina can't really do anything to you. But on the other hand, you are nice and considerate of others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ultimately decide to let Mina decide how big she expands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll do it,\" you said to Mina as you put your hand on the table, in a crawling sort-of position. Or the tips of your fingers were touching the table. You then moved you hand towards Mina in a spider fashion, and you grabbed her before she could even move. \"Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina then faked being scared. \"Oh no, what will you ever so happen to do to me? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\" There was no denying that you somewhat bought it, but you then realized she's messing with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually bought that for a second,\" you admitted to Mina, also noting how soft she felt in your hand despite her still having human skin, just pink do to her Quirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in shock and then she smiled mischievously. \"Did you really?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" You were now wondering what sort of scheme Mina might be planning. Not that it could affect you much since she's tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then wiggled around in your hand, and you were curious as to what she was trying to do. Then she managed to get her arms free from your grasp on her entire body, which shocked you. \"Was that something you learned in Hero Training?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I just taught myself it,\" Mina answered. She then started to push on your hand and before you knew it, she was out of your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... Are you using me for Hero Training?\" You questioned, cause so far it looks like that's the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Mina said in a innocent and guilty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, I'm being used by a tiny Hero-In-Training,\" you mumbled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt something climbing your arm, and you saw that Mina was trying to climb it. You then just let her climb up your arm until she made it up to your shoulder. She then attempted to walk across your shoulder towards your head. You watched her as she attempted it, and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to make up for not being at school somehow,\" Mina explained, answering your unasked question. You were about to nod but stopped yourself as that could make Mina lose balance and she could fall off your shoulder and potentially die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should get you back on the table,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but I want to do something real quick,\" Mina said as she walked closer to your head. You honestly wondered what it is she wanted to do. You were given you answer as you felt her grab your cheeks for support and kissed you on your lips, despite her size. You were surprised that she kissed you again. Maybe she wasn't lying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can place me on the table now,\" Mina said. You then carefully and slowly moved your other arm and grabbed Mina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then placed her on the table and said, \"I think now the expansions shall now commence.\" You were answered with an excited nod from Mina and you began the expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed two fingers on Mina's breasts, though one for each, and willed them to expand. You placed two fingers on her ass and then will her ass to expand. Mina smiled as her breasts and ass grew in size. She then let them grow and she noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'His... His fingers are in my nipples!' Mina thought. She then instinctively let out a moan as her nipples were suddenly feeling sensitive. Very sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her moan and you smiled with pleasure. This, turned, you, on! You licked your lips and your smile widened. Then you regained control of yourself and you stopped expanding Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... *pant*, *pant*...Did you hear my moan?\" Mina asked, panting in exhaustion though she didn't do anything exhausting. Though now that she thought about it, trying to stay standing was a really hard with her overgrown assets that shouldn't be logically possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And I somehow gained pleasure from hearing it and it also turned me on,\" you admit. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... had your fingers on both of my nipples...\" Mina informed. She smiled. \"You also turned me on as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sat in silence for a moment. \"Maybe... I should make you human sized again,\" you suggested as you took a look at her newly sized assets, making you realize she might as well be a hackie sack. You also realized she might be able to be a chair because of her assets being as large as they were, making your theorize that her breasts were roughly as long as your bed (which took up little room in your room) and also the width and height of your bed, the width of it as both the width of her breasts and also the height as well. You also realized the Mina had beanbag chair thighs and also a ass that could hold four duffle bags (stacked onto her ass and going up her back, for the actual size of her ass was roughly two beanbag chairs for her ass) if Mina could stand at her normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that one line Kaggy said was right,\" you jokingly realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what is that line?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it wasn't exactly him, but the line was, 'With great power, comes great big booty bitches',\" you said, remembering the time when that line was something funny your school would watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the line, 'With great power, comes great responsibility',\" Mina realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one with big booty bitches was a abridged version,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Makes sense,\" Mina said. \"And I think I'll take you up on that offer of being normal height again. Kinda want to see how big my assets would be if I were normal height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to make Mina her normal size when you heard your front doorbell ring. This confused you, as nobody has ever rung your doorbell. \"I'll be right back,\" you said to Mina, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to the front door and opened it to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...a box?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around to try and find anyone, see of it's just a prank. You don't remember ordering anything, but you then also realize that your family could have got you whatever was inside the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the box wearily, and proceed back into your room. But before you do that, you lock the front door after you close it. You know it wouldn't be enough, but it wouldn't be good if someone barged in while you were expanding Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to your room and look at Mina who was currently rubbing, poking, and also squeezing her breasts. She must have felt really weird now thanks to your Quirk, but she had moaned early and still joked around. Clearly, she also took some pleasure in the expansions, and also liked them. Love would be too strong of a word, but you assumed she liked the expansions you've given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down in your chair and you smile at Mina. She smiled back at you, though a confused expression was also on her face. You then held up the box for her to see, as it was under the table and out of her view. Her eyebrows rose in a questioning manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did you receive that from?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me. I don't have any good relationships outside of my family, and even then I'm usually the one they tend to attack. Well, the one my siblings attack,\" you answered, also remembering when you got shot in your balls by a Nerf gun that shot bullets up to 25 meters max(?). You weren't exactly sure, but it was a rough estimate. \"Well, it's time to open it and find out what's inside!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to reach for the box, you heard Mina say, \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the small female, and paused all movement. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I open the box with you at normal height?\" Mina asked. \"I also want a reduction on my breasts and ass size, but to the point where their still bigger than average size and bigger than my default size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt you head to one side while in thought about what she want's. You tilt your head to the side again as you know you have nothing to lose or gain from it. You then decide, fuck it. If she wants to be normal size, then let her. She's been calling most of these shots anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then returned Mina to normal height, and your assumptions were right. Her breasts were the size of your bed, with the width of the bed being both her breasts' width and height, and her ass and thighs were capable of being beanbag chairs. You then realized that her ass and thighs could probably fit a beanbag chair inside her skin, but that was something for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well damn, I'm huge!\" Mina exclaimed as she reached her normal height. \"I might as well be your own chair!\" She then blushed and looked off to the side. \"I don't mind that though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be a topic for later, as you realize that you might be developing feelings for Mina and vise versa. You then asked, avoiding having to talk about what she just said, \"How big do you want your breasts and ass to be? You still have your order on file.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina smiled as her blush faded, and she looked back at you. \"Hmm... well let's first start shrinking my breasts until they are... hmm... roughly this size.\" She then put her hands to a point that you knew was larger than her default breast size, but also much smaller than how they were now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrunk her breasts and Mina smiled. 'If I could make a reasonable guess, I'm about double Yaomomo's breasts size, and maybe also an extra half of her size. Damn it feels good knowing I'm huge,' Mina thought. \"Okay, then make make my beanbag ass roughly half it's size. I should be able to hopefully walk around and stand with it that size,\" Mina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated and said, \"Well, you also should probably put into consideration that if I do make your ass that size, you might not have any clothes to fit into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I anticipated something weird like this happening!\" Mina exclaimed. \"I bought clothes double my size for if I faced a villain with some form of mass manipulation and it was permanent unless he or she reversed the affects. And that is roughly double my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you bought clothes double your size, in case you fought a mass altering villain?\" You questioned. \"Okay, that's somewhat useful then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrunk her ass to roughly half of it's size and Mina streched. \"Man, it feels good to be normal height again,\" Mina said as she stretched. Mina then stopped after a bit and looked at you in the face. \"You know, I'm sure you have a good enough control over your Quirk now. That's way different from when you met me and you could barely control it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You blushed as you remembered that. It hasn't really been two hours yet, and you two already seemed like you've known each other for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be right back. Got to put on some clothes,\" Mina said as she walked to the bathroom where her stuff was located so she could put something on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Mina walked back in. You were very interested in what she watches on her own, as she had a T-shirt that clearly had a supervillain on it who you recalled being named Venom, thanks to watching some English Superhero/Supervillain movies. She wore grey shorts that covered her knees, and also she put on white socks. This was an interesting set to wear, but you've expanded her and also act like you've known her for a long time, and instead of 2 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how do I look?\" Mina asked while also bending over and showing her breasts that were showing from the top of the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great!\" You complimented. \"Nice to know you know the Supervillain/Anti-Hero Venom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! He's one of my favorite characters from the Marvel series thanks to him being an alien and also for how cool he is,\" Mina said. \"At one point when I was younger, I wanted to actually have Venom with me. You know, since he could choose somebody as a host and work with them. I wanted to be his host for a while, but realized he doesn't exist. Though I bet there is somebody with a Quirk that acts just like Venom's superpowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" you said. But then you turned to the box. It was cardboard and had no address or anything. Like somebody just put the box on your doorstep and also ran after ringing your doorbell. You knew that this was called, Ding Dong Ditch. You didn't like it since people thought it was a game, and you never want to do it. \"Well, time to open the box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then opened it from one of it's sides and you and Mina saw that the box contained...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...a decapitated head of a girl with pretty green hair that was long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admired her hair for a moment but then realized it was a decapitated head. You instantly jumped back from your chair and it hit the floor with a loud <b><i>thud</i></b>. Mina also was startled by the head and extra startled by the sudden thud of the chair and instantly hugged you out of fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually somewhat calmed you down, as you felt her breasts through the top of her shirt, from which they were showing, touching your arm. You looked at her breasts, and saw that they were undead showing and touching your arm. You blushed, but also was fine with it. You got to basically see her naked, so this was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the two of you peered over the box and still the head was there. Mina then seemed to recognize the person's head. \"Wait, is that Setsuna Tokage's head?\" Mina questioned, realizing who the head belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsuna Tokage?\" You didn't know who this was, so this interested you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm doing a analysis and from the look of things, she is using her quirk,\" Mina assested. \"So, that's why there is no blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized she was right. \"How did you know? Is that just how her Quirk works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The latter of course,\" Mina answered. \"Though we should probably try and wake her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost didn't want to, but you decided it was best if she knew her location and where she was. So you pulled out your phone and pulled up a YouTube video that had goat screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HWAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\" Yelled Da Kurlzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a goat scream,\" Mina noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's just a man named Da Kurlzz screaming. The comments of this video had joked about this being a goat video, so you're not wrong,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAH!\" The head of Setsuna Tokage yelled as she started to hover. \"Where am I?! Where is Monoma?! Why am I-wait, is that you Mina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! We found you,\" Mina said while giving her a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna bowed with just her head. \"Thank you Mina, and...\" Oh right, she didn't know you're name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mike Walters,\" you introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you too Walters,\" Setsuna finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Mike. I prefer it that way,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, though I should probably go find the rest of my body,\" Tokage admitted. \"See ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the three of you heard a knock on a door, and Tokage was confused and then realization kicked in. \"Oh, it looks like my body is already here. Someone mind getting the door for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it since this is my house,\" you said, and Tokage followed you. You opened the door and saw a headless female body, which walked into your house. Setsuna's head then floated above the body and reconnected the neck-up to the rest of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, this feels better. Thanks again,\" Setsuna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked behind Setsuna and saw Mina with one finger to her lips, which you know meant 'be silent/don't say a word'. You then turned back to Setsuna as she explained how she got into her predicament with the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so the Monoma said, 'Can I see if I can copy your Quirk?' What I didn't realize was that he was holding a knife, so he swung at my neck and I just detached it from there. Then I was suddenly trapped in this box and then here I am.\" Setsuna finished, already more than halfway finished when you started to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mina yelled from directly behind Setsuna, who didn't know Mina was behind her, \"SURPRISE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna jumped back instantly and decapitated her head again. She realized she was scared by Mina and she growled as she reconnected her head to her body again. \"Please don't do that again Mina! That scared me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you allow Mike here to use his Quirk on you and also expand with me by him, then I will,\" Mina said, a plan in her mind that you didn't know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expand?\" Setsuna was confused. \"So Mike can expand us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He already has to me, and it felt good, regardless of how weird it felt when he did it,\" Mina admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" Setsuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I tell you, then you commit to this,\" Mina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, fine,\" Setsuna said. \"I'll allow Mike to expand me. And I guess whatever he wants to, as long as it's not perverted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not, cause I've done it while naked. And it felt good!\" Mina said. Setsuna's eyes widened in shock. \"Seriously, your clothes would rip or fall off since you allowed him to mess with you. Welcome to the club sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna then said, \"Well, it can't be that bad.\" She looked at you. \"So, what do you want to do to me? I'll do whatever you want since Mina's so sure about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk, and said...</span></div></div>",

Your ass is stinging up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing your self pity aside, you focus on the burst of spiked red hair, accompanied with a sharp-toothed smile and a small scar near the top of a sparkling eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, I know him! Or, well I've seen him. He's the one who matched and beat that steel kid from U.A... Tetsushima? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I'll ask before making an absolute fool of myself. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hero Course student pipes up, bringing you out of your thoughts, with, \"Hey, dude, sorry about that! I should've been watchin' where I was walking. Hella unmanly for me to zone out like that, heh.\" The grin he bears is tainted with a mixture of sheepishness, yet he still stays bright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, he's still waiting. You should probably say something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, don't worry about it! I'd say it's completely my fault, but I feel like you wouldn't accept that; s-so let's just settle on 'we both could've been a bit more careful.\", you stutter back to life. His face parts even further as his smile beams with the power of a thousand suns. Despite the deep-set sadness that weighed you down since the quirk you were supposed to have never came in, you find your lips qurking up in return. His enthusiasm is terribly contagious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing a glance over his body, you take in his appearance. He doesn't seem to have changed all that much since you last saw him on TV, fighting in the Sports Festival. With bright red hair- <i>probably gelled, maybe dyed as well?</i>-, he has a friendly set to his face, yet you can see he was standing in a certain stance, firm and ready to defend. His outfit in no way drapes over his body; the strong muscles adorning his body having have taken upon the role of filling the space under out. U.A. had been training him well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nU.A., training, heroes... oh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah, you go to U.A., right?\" You already knew this, but felt a bit awkward at the thought of segwaying into a conversation so bluntly. Was that normal? Man, you've been stuck inside for far too long. The question, you realize too late, may seem a bit suspicous, a deep curl of regret settling in your stomach, watching him shift his foot back to slide more into his stance. Despite the mild show of aggression, maybe he didn't realize he did that, his joyful expression stays. Another small lick of anger at the villains, who'd made him react like that, flares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, hell yeah, plus ultra!\", a fist pumps into the air, as if to hype up an already hyped-up school. \"Is there something ya need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well- I was invited to check out the Culture Festival by a friend, but I can't- I- Yeah, no, I have no idea where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! No worries, I got lost on my first time coming there, too.\" Any previous suspicion already having been forgotten, he follows it up with, \"If you want, I can take ya there!\" <i>Oh, thank you, whichever merciful diety out there that decided to help a tortured soul out. Why is this place so big I want to cry. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as any horribly lost pedestrian would, and accept the help with speed. After letting a chuckle, the energetic boy realizes- \"Oh my gosh, I didn't even give you my name- Kirishima Eijirou, that's the name! Red Riot, that's my hero game!\" That was adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my name is...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you noticed before, she has short hair with asymmetric bangs but her hair is not black as you thought but a dark shade of purple. Her eyes are triangular onyx, with thick, lower eye lashes. By guessing, you think she is 154 cm tall(5'1\"). She is wearing the standard U.A. student uniform, with a green skirt and shin high black socks in brown shoes. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/9ZSXfK\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/9ZSXfK</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears caught your attention. Plug-like earlobes. They must be a part of her quirk. \u201cNice ears.\u201d You silently whisper to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple hair girl had heard you. She softly blushes at the compliment. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they part of your quirk?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they are. My quirk mostly deals with sound. I can use my earphone jacks to catch sounds, giving me the ability to hear across even extremely thick walls.\u201d She said. She twirls her finger around her lobe as she talks. She is feeling a bit unsure about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing! You would be so useful in Hero operations.\u201d You could only wish you were born with such an amazing Quirk as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple hair girl smiled. \u201cYeah, I would.\u201d With that quirk, she would be amazing in infiltration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize something. \u201cAre you are a student of U.A.?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple hair looks at you with confusion and suspicion on her face. \u201cI am. Why do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suspicion of you makes you a little nervous. \u201cW-well, I\u2019m on my way to U.A. for the Culture Festival. I\u2019m a bit lost and I forgot my phone at home. Come you show me the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student thought for a moment then she looks back at you. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. Sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! You might actually get there now. \u201cThank you so much! I... uh, sorry, I didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Kyoka Jiro, a hero in training.\u201d She said blushing a little, seeming a little proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello <span class=\"cindigo\">Jiro</span>. <span class=\"clred\">My</span> <span class=\"cindigo\">name</span> <span class=\"clred\">is</span>...\u201d</span></div></div>",

You're still surprised that you were able to gain height from your Quirk, and you started to appreciate your Quirk a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro pulled out her phone and held it out in front of you. \"I... suppose I'll help you experiment with your Quirk. I might bring someone from my class to also help you understand. Put in your number and give me your phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised she's willing to help you and you take her phone. \"Thank you... for helping me.\" You quickly out in your number, and Jiro put in her number on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, after schools done for today, I'll see if that person will come and then we'll help you with your Quirk issues,\" Jiro says as she takes her phone from you, and you take your phone from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You were about to leave and you remember that you're supposed to being going to the UA Cultural Festival to hang out with your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and you still see Jiro. You quickly ran up to her and she turns around. \"Um... I'm actually going to UA right now to hang out with my friend. Um... Do you think you could take me to UA so I could get to the Cultural Festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro smirks and rolls her eyes. \"Sure. Come on Reyes.\" She tilts her head in a direction while still looking at you and you smile and follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the festival and you look at Jiro and said, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Now I got to go. My class needs me,\" she replies as she walks off to her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then immediately scout out your friend, but then you hear a voice that quickly silences the voices of all the Pro-Heroes and Civilians in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening UA High!\" The voice said on what was a loud speaker. You follow the sound and saw what you think we're two villains. \"I, am the most gentle of men, Gentle! And now you are all victims of my might!\" The villain yelled. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/egQaVLHu9qURvWp59\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/egQaVLHu9qURvW...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly scared but you still stare at him. This is supposed to be a good day, and then a villain comes to mess it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, like always, were reluctant to use <i>it</i>, but you realize that you have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Seven Deadly Sins wannabe!\" You shout at Gentle for he reminds you of a Seven Deadly Sins character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns and is confused. \"What do you want, you filthy bystander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flare an aura of black around you, making the wind repelled from you a starting a small, but not exactly formed, tornado. \"I would suggest running, cause messing with UA is a mistake you're going to regret!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Gentle said as he put his pointer finger and thumb on his chin and rubbed it. \"If you think I'm scared of an aura like that, you are sadly mistaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, this only has just begun!\" You shout as you feel power coursing through your veins, and your black aura rising above you and covering you, making everyone on the outside unable to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch... If you think covering yourself in that aura will have an effect, you are sadly mistak-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then elbowed Gentle in his stomach, instantly startling and surprising him. You then knee him in his stomach, then his biceps, and then delivered a soaring kick to his chin (you heard a crack so you probably broke his jaw), and you spun in the air so your back faced Gentle. \"You were saying?\" You said as you looked at Gentle cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... are those markings on your face boy? How do you have so much power?!\" Gentle questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a second quirk,\" you answered, shocking everyone present. Civilains, Heroes, and Villains alike. \"A second quirk so powerful, I never use it unless the situation is dire or somebody thinks it's funny to prey on the people who can't defend themselves. While my first quirk is harmless, this one I'm using, <b>Hell's Wrath</b>, is capable of blowing up the continent of Japan should it go beserk. At least, that's the estimate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! That's impossible!\" Gentle shouted. \"Not even All Might, the strongest on this planet, can destroy Japan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha,\" a voice laughed from right behind Gentle. You smile as you see your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough Jack,\" you said as you see your friend Jack Death (he's not a killer though, just has an unfortunate last name) behind Gentle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had long hair that spiked up into the air, but none going down the sides or even being in the way of his eyesight. You remember how he was a Dragon Ball Z fan and smile as you remember how his hair style is based of Gogeta's. He wore a white over-shirt with a black shirt underneath, black jeans, and a rand of shoes you don't remember but they are blue. He had black eyes, and a perfect martial artist body structure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my mom needed me to run an errand for her,\" Jack explained. He assumed a fighting stance. \"It's time to put this villain down, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said as you assumed your own fighting stance. \"Let us heroes show you how it's done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're heroes with licenses?\" Gentle realized. \"Tch. This is going to make this a lot harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a long cord shot out from behind you and hit Gentle in his face, startling him. You turn around and see...</span></div></div>",

That's gonna make some back pain stay for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush at Gentle, making sure to grab his neck to stop him from doing anything funny or dangerous (you don't know what his Quirk is, and since you're a Hero in training at a hero school called Vulcan (a non-canon hero school for those who are wondering), it's the only logical thing to do). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle sees you coming, and as you try to grab at him, you are pushed back by an unknown force. You fly back and nearly hit a food stall. You're surprised at what happened and quickly recover and look at Gentle. Gentle was out of the small crater Jack made for him, and Gentle looked pissed. He stared at you with rage, and then he looked at Jack with even more rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going to make this... 'fun', and not hurt any civilians, but it looks like I'm going to have to ruin my reputation just this once.\" You immediately realize he's a villain for show and not for violence or destruction. And he never gets serious ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you pissed him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle then jumped into the air and his Quirk accelerates him towards you after than the average human eye. Sadly, you're basically a quarter-demon and you dodge it easily. Gentle bounces off the stall like it was rubber and then lunges at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jack kicks him into the ground again with a kick to his face that Gentle never saw coming. A male teacher that was with Jiro throws a cloth at him and binds Gentle. His hairs raises as his eyes turn bloodshot red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry! Dismantle him! Knock him out!\" The teacher, who you remember is known as Shota Aizawa or the hero Eraserhead, orders to you, Jack, and Jiro's class and teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro sends one of her Earphone cords at Gentle in an attempt to blast supersonic sound waves into his ear and disable him quickly. Gentle struggles and the earphone hits Gentle and he screams in pain as he is disabled and stopped. He falls unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've won the shortly lived fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping make sure Gentle is truly unconscious by hitting the back of his neck with enough force to knock him unconscious for 3 hours, helping set the stands up again so the Cultural Festival could continue, recieving praise from the teachers and other heroes on scene, and also meeting Jiro's class after you introduced yourself and Jack to them since they wanted to know who you and Jack were, you now were walking back to your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard footsteps behind you, and turn around. You thought it was Jack, but realize it was Jiro. \"Oh hey Jiro. What's up?\" You said casually. Sure, you only met her today, but you did spend the rest of the Festival with her and her classmates though you hung out with all of her classmates at random times in random combinations. You considered her a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was catching up to you, Demon Fighter,\" she said while giving you a nickname. You think about the name for a bit, but you happen to like it.

You start blushing and you're glad nobody but you two are on the streets currently since it's getting closer to nighttime. You didn't need a reminder that Jiro happens to have somewhat medium size bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right,\" you stammered.

The cannon would take a lot, but the swords needed less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's going to help us?\" You asked as Momo walked up to join you and Jiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Though I'm not sure about the whole, two Quirks thing, I'm going to at least help you since I have evidence for one,\" Momo said. \"And just call me Momo while I'm helping you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I'm Liam Reyes, and you can call me Liam,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Liam, we should go to your house so we're not interrupted at all by anyone,\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Yeah. Once I'm there nobody ever decides to try and come in. People have heard about my harmless and powerful Quirks, though people know me only for my second one. Plus Jack wouldn't try and come either once I'm there.\" You then head to your house with not only a girl who would help you willingly even though she's felt the effects of your Quirk, but she brought one of the most beautiful girls in her class! Besides that Ochaco girl, and the pink girl Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at your house after walking at least several blocks. Your house is relatively small, being 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, but you did use the largest bedroom and that's cramped with everything that you would just have in there, like your TV, gaming console (in this story, it's a Xbox One though I'm not biased for you PS4 users), your desk and computer, and also your bed. There is a closet filled with lots of different shirts that happen to be mainly white with some sort logo on them. You mainly wore jeans so that's what you would have for normal everyday clothes, besides the shorts you use for when you sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't go to the big bedroom so you don't break anything. You stop with Jiro and Momo in tow in the living room. You didn't have much here, besides a smaller TV since this room is shorter than your bedroom, a couch, and a lamp that you remember having at one of your old houses when you were a kid (good times), and also a small table that was clean and had nothing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(You can decide where the listed furniture go and what the rooms look like. I'm not great when it comes to describing a room and I'm more of a fight scene author. I though I'd try this style for a bit.)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this room is small,\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my bedroom is almost double the size,\" you informed. You push the small table to the corner of the room to give you all more space, you do the same for the TV and it's small stand. \"There, we should have more room so I can show my Quirk's abilities... well some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jiro,\" Momo said while looking at the music lover. \"You don't mind being the person Liam tests his Quirk on, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm alright with that,\" she replied. <i>'Actually, I want to expand or whatever it is Liam does with that Quirk. It feels so good!'</i> Jiro thought to herself as she remembered the feeling that was produced when Liam accidentally expanded her. It took all of her willpower to not moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Liam, show me what your Quirk does and I might be able to analyze it so you can control it better,\" Momo said. \"If it doesn't seem to work the way you want it to, then I suppose this would allow it to be alright and also not act randomly. At least I hope.\" She mumbled the last bit under her breath, and you barely heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" you said. You then stopped for a moment, right before you touched Jiro who had changed out of her school uniform and into a grey tank top (you could see a bit of her big breasts) and black leggings, and look back at Momo. \"Um... Some of the things my Quirk does is different depending on the part of the body I touch. I learn that when I used it on myself for height... so I might need to touch some of Jiro's areas so you can get an understanding. Is... is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Liam,\" Momo nodded understandingly. \"I won't label you as a pervert since that's not what this is for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You look back at Jiro who nodded. You then sigh as you start with the expansion you're most familiar with. Height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro then starts shrinking, and she eventually is the height of a kid, which (for story purposes) will be 2'4 for you're not exactly sure the exact height (or you're author is lazy and picked that height), though she still is the same slender figure she was. Your Quirk is able to shrink things, and also grow things. Why not throw in both for Momo to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick of Jiro like you would pick up your baby cousin when you went over to meet them during the small break that your school had thanks to the Kamino Ward incident. You put your hands on her sides but also under her armpits and lifted Jiro into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, sivainia, haesenueva!\" You said, remember the scene from a movie you watched in English called The Lion King. You knew that that wasn't how lions worked in the real world, but you got over it since that's a kids movie you watched when you were 6, and rewatched with your younger cousins who were that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a movie quote?\" Jiro asked. \"Also, please put me down and make me my normal height please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I will,\" you respond. You set Jiro down and place a hand on her head. You muttered, \"normal height\", hoping that would return Jiro to normal height. A few seconds later, Jiro is normal height. Another thing for you to remember later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I understand height now,\" Momo said. \"Let's move on to individual parts now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Jiro and compare her breast size to Momo's. Jiro's is half the size. With one finger on both of Jiro's breasts, you willed them to expand. Jiro let out a moan and you instantly reeled back by the suddenness of the moan. While you let go and regain your composure, Jiro's breast over gained Momo's size by a bit, and stopped at Momo's size but also bigger by 0.5 times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiro, you okay?\" You asked while you're still alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Jiro apologized. \"Your Quirk... it turns me on when you use it on my breasts. I was trying not to last time and I didn't moan, but I think I was too unprepared this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Momo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be okay?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure,\" Jiro answered. \"But let's try something else this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What do you want me to try?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do butt expansion?\" Jiro asked, hinting at the next expansion she wants you to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then did the same as before, and Jiro didn't moan this time, or try not to. Jiro's ass started expanding and you eventually got to the point where you stopped. You noticed her thighs were also affected, and they were at huge. Jiro might as well have her own bean-bag chair in each thigh, and now her breasts seemed small in comparison to her ass and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Jiro said as she saw some of her new ass. \"I'm huge. Also worth noting that I didn't have to try not to moan when you inflated my ass. It seems it's only for breast expansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo was starting to feel jealous, and also some lust for you. She wants you to be hers but she doesn't voice these new thoughts and just shakes her head. Where had those thoughts come from. Jiro was experiencing the same thing, but she tells these thoughts to wait for a right time, before taking you for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jiro can you move?\" Momo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jiro answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, please come over here. I'm going to help out now.\" Jiro then went to where Momo stood in the part of the room that connected the front door that was locked, the kitchen and dinner table, and the hallway to the other rooms and bathroom. In your bedroom is the second bathroom. Jiro then felt a little tired as her newly sized ass was a little heavy since she wasn't used to this weight. She then sat on the ground, and she realized she had a new built in chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised Momo wants to help. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I'm curious about a few things though, and I want to confirm one thing,\" Momo replied. She then asked...</span></div></div>",

Wh-where did that come from?\" You asked while an uncontrollable blush comes onto your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" Momo said. \"I love you, and I think you're interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Same here!\" Jiro said from where she was sitting. \"Your Quirk just feels too good to not wanna like it. It's somewhat addictive, but you can break out of it like a person getting off drugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" You're shocked Jiro said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only thing I can compare it to. Also I call dibs on you,\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm over here,\" Momo pointed out while putting a hand into your shoulder, almost teasing in a sortof way you find attractive. Like a diva's attitude. \"And your over there with weight you're unaccustomed to.\" Momo blinked a showed a bit of her tongue in a teasing way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I met him first!\" Jiro shouted at Momo. You're glad the walls are soundproof now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm here, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies,\" you got there attention and they both stopped arguing and looked at you. \"Obviously, you both want me for a reason I'm not sure about, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Quirk is amazing and I love it and your hot,\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You super hot and are everything I want in a man, though I've never heard of a expansion Quirk before. Also, you have that natural pull that makes be want you,\" Momo said after Jiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do you feel that pull as well?\" Jiro asked Momo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize that because you find these two girls attractive in their own ways, Jiro because she's a musician and also her willingness to help someone she's just met, but Momo because she has a interesting Quirk and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Wait, do you think he has a third Quirk?\" Momo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not born with three Quirks!\" You said while diminishing the theories the two thought up. \"However I also will not let you just fight over me like I'm a right.\" The girls looked down at the ground, knowing that they should be ashamed of their actions. You smile though. A smile that will make both girls happy. \"So that's why I'll let you both have me, so both of you can date me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" They exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've found myself attracted to you both as well, probably some otherworldly force forcing the three of us together for pure entertainment though I'm alright with that, since I can have a girl who's a musician that's ready to help me, and also a girl who has a interesting Quirk and personality that goes off and on. You're both attractive,\" you confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are both silent for a moment. They nod and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can work with that,\" Momo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. You achieved two Girlfriends in one day, both aware that you love them, and also that you're going to be shared by them both. However, you the grab Momo's face with your hands and kiss her passionately. She's shocked a returns it immediately. You let go of her after 20 seconds and head to Jiro. You both smiled, and also kiss Jiro just as passionately as Momo and just for as long too. During that 20 seconds with Jiro, you lifted her onto her feet and grabbed her ass and squeezed. Jiro moans while still kissing you, and you smile happily. You noted that her ass felt extra soft. Since you think Jiro should be able to move, you also shrink her ass while you're kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was well needed, and I'm definitely down to share you with Yaomomo,\" Jiro said. Her ass was now half it's size than when it was basically a bean bag chair in both thighs. She can move more easily now and also she feels balanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... my turn?\" Momo questioned with a smirk. You also now realized she also wore a grey tanktop and black leggings, and her clothes hugged her skin too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's still your turn after all,\" you said. Jiro went to sit down on the couch and was now watching your session with Momo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou count off what you've done so far. Breast and ass expansion. You did height, so... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA idea formed in your head. You then shrunk Momo down so she basically had to stand on your hand to be eye level with you. You're luckily your Quirk also affects clothing, or she'd be naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have something specific you want to do with me?\" She asked, loud enough for you to hear even though she's small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but am I too loud for you?\" You asked in a normal conversational tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's like normal hearing, and no weird booming effects or anything,\" Momo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled in relief, and then tried to attempt what you were going to attempt with Momo. \"Put your arms together so they're touching as best as the can, and also with you're legs,\" you told Momo and she responded by putting her palms together and also her arm together in front of her in the best way she could. You realize this might not work exactly like you wanted to test it, but it would still work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a finger on Momo's legs and one on her stomach. You place a third on her arms and concentrate. Sure enough Momo started expanding, but she was expanding with weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo's stomach crew larger and larger, mainly made of fat so it made her look like she eats too much and doesn't work out. This eventually affected her arms and thighs, making her look overweight. You stopped at one point and smile at Momo who smiled back without any additional fat added to her gorgeous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm amazed you can do weight gain,\" Momo said. \"Interesting.\" She was now poking her now fat body and giggled when her stomach jiggled as she poked it. She then sat down as she was unable to stand much longer,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a interesting guy that has two girlfriends I love equally and happen to want to make them my sexy queens,\" you said while smiling. You set Momo on the ground and regret her so she was her normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the plus side, you got more lipids to use,\" Jiro joked. You laughed with the two girls, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you change me back now?\" Momo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said. Momo did the thing liked before but you paused. \"How am I supposed to get your legs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could make it bend towards my stomach instead of up at the ceiling,\" Momo suggested. \"Then you could use a hand for my stomach and arms, and a hand for my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking,\" you said. \"I see now why Jiro has brought you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then put two fingers on Momo's arms and one on her stomach. You put two fingers from your other hand on her thighs. Momo then lost all of her weight simultaneously. Soon she was the figure she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you,\" Momo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love both you and Jiro even more, fighting All For One and winning,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooo. We have a daredevil on our hands,\" Jiro said as she came up behind you and wrapped her arms around your neck but not to choke you. She then presses her breasts on you and you realize that you don't feel the fabric of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer naked breasts are touching your back and you're alright with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething brushed your back that felt like fabric and you realized she was still wearing her tanktop, but removed her breast from the shirt and bra through the top towards the neck area. You smile. \"You guys are amazing, and I love you both,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you more,\" Jiro and Momo said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro then let go and you assumed she put her breasts back into her tanktop. You looked at Momo and realized she didn't have any attributes from him inflating her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't think that's fair, and decide that you will make <span class=\"cmaroon\">Momo's</span>...</span></div></div>",

And also it might be a good time to actually tell the truth about your second Quirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards Momo and you don't look at Jiro at all while you do this. You then wrap your arm around her waist and she blushes. You then decide to let the beast out and you kiss her again. She kisses you just as hard as you are but you then reel back and bit hit neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo yelps in shock as you bit her and instantly you let go. She grabbed where you bit her with your canine teeth. \"Ow... what the hell?!\" Momo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I branded you,\" you said. \"I making sure no one tries to claim you. They see that mark, they will know that you've been branded. Me specifically.\" You then stare at Jiro. \"After I made it up to Momo, I'm going to brand you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't care how abrupt that was, seeing as you pierced Momo's skin instantly, but you're not one to judge. You look back at Momo who pads a mirror to examine the wound. You then smile as she seems scared that the wound closed in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Momo questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My second Quirk, <b>Hell's Wrath</b>, had more abilities to it than fighting,\" you informed. \"I'm able to take Quirks from people who are more evil than good, and I got a branding Quirk from one of them. That Quirk allows me to brand you as my girlfriend, and also allow you to use the Quirks I have, and also the branding one. I will also inform you that you only have a small amount of power with the Quirks though I have all the power of the Quirks.\" You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then put a finger on both of Momo's breasts and smiled with pleasure as Momo moaned loudly as her breasts expanded rapidly. You realized they were expanding in every direction they could go. Or basically their length, width, and height were increasing. You let them continue a bit on their own and took the time to squeeze Momo's breasts. You realized they were soft. Extra soft. Almost as soft as Jiro's beanbag ass, if not softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard Momo start panting in exhaustion and you stop the expansion Momo just went through. Now her breasts were triple their size and at least 3 feet in leghth, width, and height. You smiled, and Momo just kept on panting as she lift her breasts so she did fall to the ground with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then activated your Perfect Copy Quirk you took from a asshole who thought he could win a fight with just barrier and illusion Quirks, who also was robbing a bank. You remember Jiro telling you about Ochaco Uraraka's Quirk, <span class=\"chotpink\">Zero Gravity</span>. You copy that Quirk and use it on Momo's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Momo thanked as she stood up straight again, and also started rubbing the area you bit her at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome... and I'm sorry for branding you without warning,\" you apologized. \"I tend to think in the heat of the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Momo said. She then looked at her breasts that now tripled their size. \"These are rather huge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the goal,\" you said. \"Make you two huge and also where you love it and not burdened by it. It's more like it's somewhat your wants and personalization, and my wants and use. You both signed up for this after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I signed her up for this when she said yes,\" Jiro said. \"Also, I was coming anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Jiro and nodded. \"Yes you were. You wanted to help me and you did. But more or less for our pleasure than actually helping me control it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Jiro agreed truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo than jumped and realized she lost for weight than she expected, and actually jumped higher and ascended slower. She then realized she lost all of her weight except her clothes' weight. \"Haha, this is actually fun,\" Momo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to shrink you so you have more room?\" You asked, with Momo giving a nod. You then grabbed Momo's hand and set her on the ground and also removed the weightlessness Momo felt. You then shrunk her so she was roughly the size of your pointer finger, or 7 inches. You made her weightless and she then jumped from your hand and then went to play with her now larger surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to Jiro, who's ready for branding. She points to the same side of her neck that Momo was bit on and you approach her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt?\" Jiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do it quickly. If I slowly pierce the skin, then maybe it might not hurt as much,\" you answered as best as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it. Let's get this over with, I just want to expand,\" Jiro says as she tilts her head for you to brand her. You quickly bite her neck and remove your teeth. Jiro rubs the spot as it closes and heals. \"Well, I've been branded by my super awesome vampire boyfriend. What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expand you!\" You said giddily. You also as said that in a high picthed voice that made Jiro laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro then looked at her Momo's sized breasts. She looked at you and smiled. \"I kinda want my huge ass back, and I think a nearly equal sized bust would go great with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Permission to expand?\" You ask in a robotic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Permission granted,\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeezed Jiro's breasts and you love how soft they are. It turns you on. You then expanded Jiro's breasts and ass so they were perfectly balanced, and nearly the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro then touches her new ass and breasts, along with rubbing them and squeezing them. \"Damn, they feel so real and soft! It's amazing Liam,\" Jiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you more Jiro,\" you said teasingly as you kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo then came into their line of sight and also smiled. \"You're clearly the best boyfriend a woman could ask for,\" Momo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab Tiny Momo and smiled. You look at Jiro, and said, \"I'm going to now do something fun with you both. Jiro, you will be telling me how to inflate/expand Momo here, while she's tiny. And I think I might shrink us so we all can be the same size and have more room for you girls to expand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down!\" Tiny Momo said. \"But inflate me while I'm tiny first, then shrink yourselves and I'll choose how to expand Jiro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I'm down,\" Jiro said. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"And since we're beginning with Yaomomo, let's start with inflating...\"</span></span></div></div>",

But I\u2019m not. My family was originally from Britain but we\u2019ve been living here for generations now. The last name has been passed down by all the boys in my family.\u201d Clover said, tugging on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini Clover is 5\u20192 with light blue, long, wavy hair and white streaks in her mane. Currently, she dressing a little nice but a little plain today in a lemon yellow empire dress and yellow, 8.5 size sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a mutation as well but that will be mention later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro smile. \u201cI can tell you care a lot about your family.\u201d Jiro bend her knees and picked up a bag that was resting next to her. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We are going to be late if we stay here any longer.\u201d Jiro started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover started trailing behind her. \u201cMy family... yeah, I do care about them. They are very kind to me. I... I wish I could do more for them.\u201d Clover got a little sad remembering her own problems. Jiro noticed and remain silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro and Clover walk up to a pedestrian bridge and start climbing up the steps. Clover could hear jingling coming from bag. \u201cWhat do you have in the bag?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- My instruments.\u201d Jiro said. Her hand hugs closer to the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, are you a musician?\u201d Clover said excitedly. She loves music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro laugh a little at Clover\u2019s misunderstanding. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m really an amateur. My parents are the real musicians. The music they make is amazing. My parents, I\u2019m sure, would have preferred if I also became a musician but I chose the path of a hero.\u201d Jiro said, reminiscing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, was your parents against that?\u201d Clover wonder. Jiro and her walk down the stairs at the opposite end of the bridge, getting across the street and closer to U.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro smile, blushing softly thinking of her parents. \u201cNo, they were very supportive. I was very nervous when I approached them. But they said \u2018You can do whatever it is you love.\u2019 They gave me the advice to push forward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover likes hearing that Jiro had such wonderful parents. But she felt sad again, wondering about her own parents. Maybe if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJir\u014d stops and turns to Clover. Jiro\u2019s eyes lit up as she thought of something. \u201cHow soon do you need to get to the Cultural Festive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover took a moment to think about it. \u201cNot anytime soon, I guess?\u201d Clover realize she didn\u2019t make a time on when to meet with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro casually step closer to Clover. \u201cI want take a minute to show you something before we get there. Can I?\u201d Jiro said straight at Clover, in an odd seriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cindigo\">Should</span> <span class=\"clred\">Clover</span> <span class=\"cindigo\">listen</span> to <span class=\"clred\">Jiro</span>?</div></span></div></div>",

Clover\u2019s friend can wait a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro smile and then gets a little shy. \u201cT-thanks for agreeing.\u201d Her grip tightens a little on the bag\u2019s strap. \u201cBut I can\u2019t show you here. Can we go somewhere private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds... suspicious. Probably the best idea is to say no. But Clover is intrigued. \u201cSure. Lead the way.\u201d Jiro smile like she was saying thank you and started walking again with Clover following right behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover and Jiro walked a couple blocks silently. Clover felt a little awkward. She tries to think of anything to say but nothing comes to mind. Jiro seem a little nervous under that cool demeanor. Whatever she has in there must be pretty important to her. But then, why show it to someone you just met? Clover wonders as she follows Jiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Clover\u2019s eyes gaze over Jiro. Clover has a little bit of interest in girls, the same way she has with boys. It\u2019s not polite to stare but Clover couldn\u2019t help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro doesn\u2019t have a note worthy chest. Pretty meh, though, Clover has no problem with small chest girls. They have their perks. But what caught Clover\u2019s eyes was Jiro\u2019s rump. Clover is seeing it for the first time and caught her by surprise. Jiro\u2019s ass is thicc. Her thighs rubs together as she walks, making little sounds and her ass jiggles with every step she takes. Jiro\u2019s butt is two inches out from her straight back. It is a very big butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover found her hand almost grabbing Jiro\u2019s rump before realizing what she was doing and stopped. She shook her head, trying to ignore these new desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walk around a corner and Clover finds herself at Tatooin Station. She comes here a lot but there are no trains that would take them to U.A. \u201cHey, aren\u2019t we going the opposite direction from U.A.?\u201d Clover asked as they walk under a bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro turn and look at Clover over her shoulder. Her earlobes danced and lightly slap her cheek. \u201cNo, we are not. We are actually closer to U.A. here then we were before. This is a longer route.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I... guess?\u2019 Clover thought. It doesn\u2019t help that Clover has no idea where the school is. In this age of the internet? Yeah, Clover made a mistake. She should have check before leaving the house. And she didn\u2019t take her phone in her dash. Honestly, she didn\u2019t believe she needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro walked into the train station. They must have arrived at busy time because there is a lot of people walking around. A little girl rode her dad\u2019s shoulders, kicking her legs out. A guard waves at people entering the station. A couple buys some tickets and wait for the train. Which is where Jiro seems to be heading to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover felt nervous again. Why are they here? Concern, she grabbed Jiro\u2019s shoulder, having her stop. \u201cWait, we aren\u2019t taking a train, are we?\u201d They would need a train to leave the city but that would take them very far from U.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro is confused but then looked at Clover like she is silly. \u201cNo, Clover. We are using the public restroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRestroom?\u201d Clover wondered. Jiro continue walking. The girls squeeze through the crowd, making their way to the farther side of the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah. I found this restroom a couple months ago. It\u2019s pretty far away but almost no one comes here.\u201d Jiro says, arriving at the girl\u2019s bathroom. Clover looked around. Wow, it is certainly deserted around this restroom. Strange, since there were a lot of people in the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro opens the door. The bathroom is not big, containing four stalls. The mirrors are well kept, the floor are very clean for a public restroom, and the green stall had a bit of fragrance coming from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nice bathroom took Clover by surprise. \u201cJiro, what kind of bathroom is this? It\u2019s too good for a public restroom in a train station.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiro didn\u2019t turn around. She dropped her bag on the ground and bend over to unzip it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure myself. But it\u2019s another reason why I keep coming back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover peek at Jiro\u2019s peach rump. Her butt sticks out towards Clover, moving slightly side to side as Jiro searches through her bag. Ooohhhhhh... Clover is so happy she is bisexual right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Jiro found something. \u201cI got it.\u201d Jiro pulled her <span class=\"cindigo\">hand</span> <span class=\"clred\">out</span> <span class=\"cindigo\">and</span> <span class=\"clred\">she</span>...</span></div></div>",

It was a deeper gash than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling a little scared, you continue to move, as you look at all the faces in the crowd. No one seems suspicious. But you can\u2019t shake this feeling of uneasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMphhffff!!\u201d You bite your tongue in surprise. There is a sharp pain from the back of your neck. You reach up a hand to check, only to find blood.You\u2019re bleeding from your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared, you run through the crowd. As fast as you try to run, you can\u2019t shake the feeling that someone is chasing after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn a corner and head into an alleyway. You turn around and prepare to fight.

Maybe you lost them. You check your leg. Someone definitely cut you. The cut is deep enough for your leg to keep bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, now you can go to the Culture Festival.

Would you like to come with me to the station?\u201d The Policewoman said, showing a very serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is happening so sudden. You aren\u2019t sure what to do. But it\u2019s clear by this woman\u2019s aura that she is not to be mess with. \u201cI, uh, ok. But I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Policewoman stopped you. \u201cI understand. But for now, would you please put your hands behind your back?\u201d She said, taking out a pair of handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other option, you did as she ask and turn around. She grabs your wirsts and handcuffs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer, you are making a big mistake. I was just heading to the Culture Festival. When we get to the station, you\u2019ll see I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d You try for one last plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-officer?\u201d You look behind your back. To your horror, the Policewoman\u2019s face was melting off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goo, it\u2019s like clay, but more liquid, dropping off the woman\u2019s body. The Policewoman\u2019s face is slowly replace by a young woman\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a petite girl with blonde hair, which is in a messy styled buns on both sides of her head.

She looks older than the girls in your school but younger than your mom. Kinda like a big sister. Her knees bend a little in her blue, casual jeans, possibly to lower herself so she may better look at you. \u201cHey kid, are you alright?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there, embarrassed. Blushing shyly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m ok.\u201d You responded. So you were in a hurry. No need to make a fool of yourself in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed, with a noticeable annoyed expression. \u201cHere, let me help you up.\u201d She offers out her hand and you thank her, accepting her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her hand and noted how soft but firm it is. It\u2019s kinda of nice. The young woman, with a lot more force than you expected, pulls you off the ground and onto your feet. After you found your footing, she let\u2019s go of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she pulls you up, you took a brief look at this woman. Her long, blonde hair is what first got you attention but also her face. She is looking at you with relax determination. As if she has experienced a lot in her young life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down in motion with being pulled up to see her wearing casual clothing. A purple shirt with a light-ish brown jacket over it with casual jeans and high heel sandals on her feet. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/QktA4c\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/QktA4c</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts didn\u2019t escape your notice but you shouldn\u2019t stare at them while she is looking at you. \u201cT-thanks. I\u2019m sorry I bumped into you. I didn\u2019t pay attention and ran into you.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smirk. \u201cIt looked like I should apologize. If I had noticed you, I would have avoided you.\u201d The woman briefly look you over. She is smiling about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman... seems familiar. Have you seen her before? Wait, you don\u2019t have time for this. You need to head for U.A. \u201cUh, Miss?\u201d You said politely, \u201cCan you point me to where U.A. is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU.A.? Why do you want to go there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the Culture Festival is today and I\u2019ll be late as it is.\u201d You certainly can\u2019t miss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman blink and had a baffled expression. \u201cUh, kid, the U.A. Culture festival is in two weeks. An ad came out last night to begin promoting it for Friends and Family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?.... Your jaw dropped. After painstakingly coming out of the shelter of your home, only to find out it isn\u2019t even today. Oh, why did you not check the date? You pick up your phone and scroll through your emails. You click on your recent email sent from your friend and checked the date. Yep, two weeks from now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung your head. \u201cI-I see. Thank you for your time, Miss. I\u2019ll be heading off.\u201d You turn around. You might as well head home. Maybe you can play more of that Spanish rpg, Person 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman stops you by putting a hand on your shoulder. The body contact made you froze stiff. \u201cWait,\u201d She said. \u201cBefore you go, I need to ask a couple questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around. Huh? Who is this woman? And why does she look so familiar? \u201cHuh? Wait, who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman take her hand off your shoulder and address herself. \u201cMy name is Y\u016b Takeyama. I am the pro hero known as Mt. Lady. Before you go, I need your cooperation for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Huh? What is this? Mt. Lady? A real pro hero?

His height is 5\u20198, taller than the woman before him but he knows that wouldn\u2019t be the case. He is wearing a white shirt with two green lines at wrist and a green tie over it. He is wearing long, tan pants, not baggy, with green lines at the end of each pant leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt.

I\u2019m just doing my Pro Hero duties.\u201d She confidently said. Naoko sighed. This is what he gets for running into a pro hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, how can I help you?\u201d Naoko does have a little crush on Mt. Lady. Not on the level of some her fans, but enough. He finds her motives of being a hero pretty endearing and recognizes how pretty she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady looks around. \u201cDo you mind taking this somewhere private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? I don\u2019t see a problem with it. Though, I think going to a station would be too much. But why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady frowns. \u201cWell, some of my questions are a bit sensitive. I would prefer if some stranger didn\u2019t over hear us.\u201d Some people walked by. A young girl, possibly middle school, recognized Mt. Lady out of her costume and gleefully took a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko nodded. \u201cFair point.

This is just a setting to give a certain someone more open space.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko and Mt. Lady arrive at a river. The river stretches half a mile across with tall buildings standing on each side of the river, creating some sort of natural wall. A mini path was built along the bank, reaching out to a nearby bridge running across the river with blue railings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is good. This will be perfect to conduct business.\u201d Mt. Lady exclaimed after taking a look around, walking down the hill, closer to the river. She places her hands on her hips. Her fingers fidget a bit with her jeans, wrapping themselves around the straps where a belt would go. Naoko is following behind, almost slipping on the lush, green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko stops and looks around. It\u2019s midday, so very little people would be outside. Not that it should be a problem but some reason Mt. Lady is against being seen talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little earlier in the city; Naoko was confused. \u201cThe river? Isn\u2019t that a little far?\u201d He said after Mt. Lady told him where she wants to continue the conversation. Sure, he was interested in talking with a pro hero but that is a little far away. Not a lot of activity happens in that part of the city and it\u2019s out of the way from his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady scowled. \u201cIt is far but is necessary for a pro like me. I need to take every precaution. Or, are you saying you have plans for later?\u201d She smiled at that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko scratched his head, looking at his feet. \u201cWell, no, not really.\u201d She got him. There isn\u2019t any real reason to turn her down. It\u2019s just... he is getting an uneasy feeling about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up. \u201cDo we have to go now?\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady smiled gently. \u201cYes, I would prefer that. I am an active hero who can be called upon anytime, after all. But... sorry.  I don\u2019t mean to force you. You aren\u2019t really obligated to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, when she says things like that... \u201cI\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Naoko said. Mt. Lady cutely smirked, shaking his hand and they both head off for the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow by the river; Mt. Lady waited for Naoko to come meet her at the bottom of the hill. She watched as he made his way down the slope. Naoko was having more trouble then he thought and ended up slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArgh!\u201d He cried out in frustration as he landed on his butt and slid the rest of the way down. He sat there for a moment, mad that he lost his footing in front of a pro hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady just laugh and reached her hand down to help him up. Embarrassed, Naoko accepted it and she pulled him up. Wow, she has a strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your footing there. It\u2019s been raining a lot for the past couple days.\u201d She chuckle. Her laughter is also pretty cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naoko brushed off some of the grass stains off his butt. \u201cSorry abut that. I guess I got physically weaker since I stopped attending school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady\u2019s tone got slightly serious. \u201cAre you a drop out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko didn\u2019t really take note of her tone shift. \u201cNot really.  I just have been missing a lot of days. I keep my grades high, so... there\u2019s that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko really doesn\u2019t want talk anymore about...  his current lifestyle. It\u2019s not that interesting. So he change the subject. \u201cUm, you never did explain why you brought me out here, miss pro hero. What did you need to ask of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady took a moment. She dig her yellow high heels in the ground for a bit. \u201cI have a question and I want you <span class=\"ctan\">to</span> <span class=\"cplum\">answer</span> <span class=\"ctan\">it</span> <span class=\"cplum\">honestly</span>.\u201d</span></div></div>",

What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady reached behind her and pulled out a notebook. She flips through a couple pages before stopping. \u201cWe have a report of a new villain emerging. A young man, supposedly a drop out, with blond hair with a shirt and tie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko recognize those traits relate to him and feels a bit nervous. \u201cBut those is very broad. They can relate to anyone not just me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady raises an eyebrow. \u201cToday is a school day. Yet, I found you heading to U.A. and by the way you were talking, you didn\u2019t sound like you were attending the school. You didn\u2019t even know the culture festival wasn\u2019t today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko does not like how quickly the conversation is escalating. His eyes darted around the area, just in case he needs to run. However, it doesn\u2019t seem like there is anywhere to go. \u201cOk, then what am I accused of doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady rested her hand on her hips. She doesn\u2019t look like she is ready for a fight but with her being a pro and her believing she caught a villain, Naoko can\u2019t believe she isn\u2019t ready for a fight. \u201cThe suspect is accused robbing millions from very well-known company. While the company in question has been accused of shady practices, the villain had no right to steal from them. And again, I believe that villain is you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t rob anyone.\u201d Naoko pleaded. Is he going to face false arrest? Or did he actually do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady ignores his plead and continues. \u201cAnd I believe there is reason to suspect you.\u201d Mt. Lady said. \u201cEarlier, you wanted to go to the U.A.\u2019s Cultural Festival. The company in question has had dealings with U.A. While the villain stole a lot of money, the villain also still information about U.A. security and the school\u2019s finance. What better time to use that information then the Cultural Festival, when financial influencers are going to gather and attend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko, no longer seeing a way out, to run or prove his innocence right now, hung his head in defeat. \u201cOk, so, I\u2019m a villain to you then.

Naoko notices that and gets on his feet. He smiles at her, feeling the adrenaline going through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady makes a split second decision, as now would be the perfect time for Naoko to use his quirk, and tackles Naoko. Her hands firmly grips his shoulders as they tumble into the water. Naoko is surprised and lets go of the bandages, which the current quickly took away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko struggles briefly in the water but Mt. Lady has gotten a hold on his wrists and pin them to his back. She uses her strength and lift him out of the water and press him against the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha ah. Stay down, villain.\u201d Mt. Lady commanded, feeling a little out of breath. Her casual clothes are soaked. Naoko couldn\u2019t see as his face is planted to the ground but Mt. Lady wasn\u2019t wearing a bra and her pink nipples can be seen through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko thought through his options and just gave up. He tried, and failed. He honestly had little hope to get away. So much for convincing the court that he was innocent now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady searched her pocket, trying to find he bandages she was carrying. Oh right, they were taken from her during the fight. She looked around, but didn\u2019t see them anywhere. Mt. Lady search her pockets again and pulled out her phone. She will have to call for backup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone, however, is broken. It got wet when she fell into the water. Mt. Lady is a little mad.

His job at the cultural festival is going to be screwed if she gets him behind iron. Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko let out an angry sigh. Mt.

Katy is going to kick his ass when she finds out. Well, at least his favorite superhero is sitting her ass on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko, with no plan to think of, just focus on the shape of Mt. Lady\u2019s ass on his back. He close his eyes and imagine her booty. Her soft and thicc butt, melting over his back side, while still holding its firmness. Naoko had enjoyed the feeling of Mt. Lady\u2019s wet, jean ass when she slid forward on his back to put her hand on his head. In his wet pants, Naoko\u2019s dick grew hard agaisnt the grass floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko then quickly frown at the thought of this being the last contact with a girl for years if he gets behind bars. \u201cMt. Lady, please. I know of villains that are bigger game than me. You know my name and possibly where I live. If you let me go, I\u2019ll tell you everything I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the Pro Hero wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cNaoko, Do you really take as some sort of fool? Of course I wouldn\u2019t take a deal like that. You should try that on a newbie if you get out of prison in the future, Naoko. Maybe you would have a better chance.\u201d Mt. Lady said, slightly annoyed. She went back to fixing her phone, trying to see if she can dry it with her sleeve. She knows if she gets up slightly, she could risk Naoko making a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko felt hopeless. Mt. Lady is a pro hero and physical stronger than his untrained body. He wishes he has a quirk so bad right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, like magic, Naoko\u2019s body started glowing. It all happen within a second and Mt.

Lady doesn\u2019t notice till her phone starts working again and she attempts to make a call but her thumb can\u2019t reach the buttons. She is startled. She tries to keep the phone tight in her hands but she keeps getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the...?\u201d She says, in perplexed. But Mt. Lady quickly realize what\u2019s going on. She\u2019s felt this way before. She\u2019s shrinking! Her tight jeans no longer squeeze her thighs and her bra is getting loose. Naoko or someone close by is shrinking her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko, laying face first in the dirt, took note of Mt. Lady\u2019s depleting pressure. As he felt her large thighs \u201cremove\u201d themselves from his sides, Naoko took his chance, moving his knees forward to lift his own rear and shook her off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady felt Naoko moving and took action to try stop him, but it did nothing, as her shrinking is reducing her weight. She feel forward, throw off Naoko\u2019s back. Mt. Lady\u2019s phone flew out of her hand and land above the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko rolled to the side, anticipating a counterattack. Mt. Lady, however, is trying to regain her balance. Her shoes had fallen off her feet and her arms are shrinking beneath her sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is bad. Naoko must have used his quirk on me. I got to get to my phone. I had just got it fixed. I need to call for back up!</i>, Mt. Lady thought. She understands the clear danger she is in. She struggles to climb the bank, which didn\u2019t seem so big a moment ago, and tries to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko looked up. He see Mt. Lady trying to get away but also noticed something odd. She\u2019s... getting smaller. But it doesn\u2019t seem it\u2019s her doing. Mt. Lady had left her shoes behind. Whatever. She\u2019ll be easier to deal with her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko stood up and walked over, picking up her shoes and followed her. He watches Mt. Lady having difficulties in her increasing baggy clothes, enjoying her struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady started to get frantic. Her pants could no longer stay on and her jeans and panties slid off her legs. \u201cNo! Wait... I...\u201d She frantically pleaded, to anyone who would listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady tries to calm herself and activate her quirk. However, the quirk that has been with her since she was a child failed. B-but why? Why can\u2019t she grow? What kind of quirk was used on her? Mt. Lady hears the ground crunch behind her. Naoko, that villain, is getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPants-less, Mt. Lady starts running. Her brown jacket is getting in the way. Not heavy, as she would think, but it\u2019s getting increasingly hard to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady threw off her brown jacket and made her way to her phone. Her purple shirt she had that was right at her belly button just a minute ago in now at her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko noticed what Mt. Lady was doing and ran. Too bad for Mt. Lady, now that her legs are too small, she could not run across the grass fast enough. Naoko grabbed her and pounced her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Get off!\u201d Mt. Lady struggle against Naoko\u2019s grip. Surprisingly, her little punches deliver the same force as if she was still regular size. But due to Naoko\u2019s desperation and Mt. Lady confused (Her not being able to active her quirk is throwing her off mentally), Naoko\u2019s push her small head in her shirt and wrap the shirt around Mt. Lady, like it was a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko caught his breath and smiled. He caught the Pro Hero. He lifted Mt. Lady\u2019s purple shirt off the ground and watch as he saw little punches coming from inside the cloth. Those little punches got smaller and smaller till he could only see small prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well well. Seems I caught myself a wild, tiny hero.\u201d Naoko boasted. With his free hand, he picked up the phone and put it in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaoko, stop! Think of what you are doing. If anything happens to me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Will people even know? I know you found me by chance. It\u2019s the only way people ever find me. You knew that, so you tried dealing with me as quickly and as quietly as possible. Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement in the shirt stopped. It seem Naoko was right. \u201cHey, no need to feel bad. You had succeeded and you caught me. I have no idea how you shrunk to a... convenience size, but I\u2019ve never missed an opportunity in my villain career.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple shirt movement rapidly at those words but to no avail. Naoko can\u2019t help but smile at the Pro hero\u2019s panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he thinks about it, Mt. Lady is naked and helpless before him. She is his crush, after all, so there are plenty of things he had always wanted to try out. Naoko\u2019s cock grows hard at the thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he look at the bruise on his free hand. Mt. Lady, even though she is so small, still had the strength of her normal self. This shrinking is weird. She might become a problem if Naoko doesn\u2019t get rid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">What</span> <span class=\"cplum\">does</span> <span class=\"ctan\">he</span> <span class=\"cplum\">do</span>?</span></div></div>",

For all intents and purposes, I act like I don't even have a quirk. I mostly keep my more... <i>villainous</i> acts relegated to cyber-crime. It's a lot easier and it's far less likely that you'll run afoul of a pro-hero like yourself.\" Naoko continued, Mt Lady struggled in his grip. \"That's how I stole that money, and as you can see... it's only sheer dumb luck that you literally bumped into me. Just your bad luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I could just break free for a moment, his quirk must have a maximum range or something... I'll try and distract him...</i> She thought. \"Why? Your quirk seems pretty powerful. A lot of heroes would have trouble with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all about picking your battles.\" Naoko said. \"My quirk needs physical contact to trigger you see, so someone like Endeavour or Kamui Woods would have no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean, but you could have a real talent as a hero you know? A quirk like yours would be great for restraining criminals.\" Mt Lady said, wincing as Naoko's grip seemed to tighten slightly. <i>Just keep him talking, maybe he'll slip up and mention a weakness.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just doesn't interest me. The whole reason I avoid using my quirk is that I detest confrontations like this. Even right now my heart is beating out of control.\" Naoko said, his monotone disagreeing with his words. \"I got extremely lucky today, who'd have thought my quirk would cancel yours out. I can only assume it was a matter of being quicker on the draw. If you'd tried to grow first, I probably wouldn't have been able to affect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it!</i> Mt Lady kicked herself internally. <i>Just because you didn't wanna show off some skin, nice going Y\u016b. If I get out of this Kamui's never gonna let me hear the end of it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko brought up his other hand and rubbed Mt Lady's breasts together. He carressed her ass and rubbed a finger against her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?!\" Mt Lady shouted, struggling more than ever to break free of Naoko's grip. \"Goddamn pervert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just enjoying your beauty...\" Naoko lifted Mt Lady up and licked her nude form, coating her saliva. \"One last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean by that?\" Mt Lady said, turning pale as a familiar sensation began to creep through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my name, my face, my methods and my quirk. I can't just let you go now.\" Naoko's eyes glowed with a dark determination as he used his quirk to shrink Mt Lady further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">No</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">no</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">no</font>\" Mt Lady squeaked as she shrank smaller and smaller in Naoko's hand.

After a moment of pressure he stopped. For a moment he regarded the body of Mt Lady before flicking her away. He covered some nearby rocks in Mt Lady's discarded clothing and chucked them into the river, for the moment he forgot about her phone still in his pocket. Afterwards, Naoko breathed out and regained his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, if I don't hurry back I'm gonna miss the festival.\" Naoko said, completely returned to his normal self as he ran up the river bank. The only trace of his crime, the shrunken body of Mt Lady hidden somewhere in the mud.</span></div></div>",

She dropped her waterlogged phone and gripped her thighs with her hands as they kept pace, thickening as much as her rear. Naoko grunted in surprise as he felt her cheeks spread further across his back, oozing deliciously across his body. They stopped swelling just as her jeans creaked in protest, her crack now visible as her cheeks bulged over the waistband of her incredibly tight jeans. Yu sat heavily on her captured charge, panting heavily with her eyes closed as she tried to process what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What the heck? Did I...make her grow? It felt like I did...'</i> Naoko thought, his dick throbbing hard inside his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy clenched his hands into fists as he concentrated to bring back the feeling from earlier. As he found it his body glowed again and he focused all his thoughts on the expansive rear of the Pro Hero sitting on him. He grinned as he felt her shudder on top of him and squeal in surprise as her butt started swelling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naoko...s-stop...<i>urgh</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady grunted as she felt her butt battle her jeans as the stubborn denim refused to give way. Ample butt-flesh bulged and oozed up over the waistband of her jeans while her thighs fought the seams down her legs, soft snaps of fabric audible as the threads started to give way. The boy beneath groaned with pleasure as he felt her grow heavier and sexier, pushing him a little further into the soft, grassy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already...in enough...trouble...as it is!\" Yu managed to gasp between heavy gulps of air. Her hands were still clutching her bloating thighs, her whole body trembling with sweat pouring down her bare skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professional hero was incredibly aroused despite herself, the sensation of her swelling butt lighting a fire between her legs. It was like a thousand hands were gently but firmly massaging every part of her buttocks and thighs, and as she grew the sensations only intensified. Part of her was glad her jeans were already wet as she was sure there'd be a noticeable stain over her crotch by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Aaaaaaarrgh</i>,\" Mt. Lady threw her head back and loosed a loud moan as her soaked jeans finally gave way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seam of her pants split open from the waistband all the way down to her groin with a rough bark of surrender, her butt cheeks flowing out over Naoko's back (like her top she wasn't wearing any underwear). The seams along her thighs split apart at the same time, the threads snapping and popping to let her luscious upper legs pour out of their confines. As her increasing mass was released she had the unusual sensation of her field of vision rising higher in one rapid spurt as the bulk of her ass pushed her up. She bit her lip at the realisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu had the widest hips and biggest butt for anyone her size by a large margin, though as she grunted and flexed her glutes to tear her jeans further she found it wasn't all fat. Her muscles had grown just as much, keeping her legs and buttocks supple, firm and <i>strong</i>. She felt like her thighs could pop coconuts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mass covered Naoko from his butt to his head by now and the boy was only sinking further into the ground. As Yu came down from her high she realised she had stopped growing (a small part of her noting her disappointment at the fact) and Naoko had been flailing against her, desperate for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, Naoko!\" She cried out as she heaved her new bulk off of him, finding it easier than she expected, just as his flailing went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped the boy onto his back, noting his raging erection with a shake of her head, and desperately checked his vitals. She could feel a strong pulse and his chest had heaved as soon as she had relieved the pressure on him. Naoko was just out cold, a wide, happy smile across his face. Mt. Lady sighed and sat back on her feet, shivering with delight as she felt her massive cheeks flow over her feet and cover a large portion of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen <span class=\"ctan\">Naoko</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">woke</span> <span class=\"ctan\">up</span>, <span class=\"cgrape\">he</span>... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pushing himself up from the sofa and stared around the apartment or was it a office? Around him he saw pictures and posters of the heroine Mt. Lady. Some nick-nacks and memorabilia of actions. There were frames of her with everyone ranging from All-Might to Endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake.\" The familiar voice of Yu called out. Naoko flipped himself on the sofa and gaped at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey the heroine MT.Lady was standing in the doorway and almost taking up the entire space.

Aren\u2019t you a Pro hero?\u201d Naoko carefully said in way that won\u2019t confirm anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady\u2019s nervous anger subsided. \u201cI\u2019m in huge debt. Due to my quirk, I destroy the city much more than I save it. Broken buildings, flatten cars, new hole in the street. My Hero office is in the red. If I don\u2019t do something to turn it around, I will lose everything i\u2019ve worked so hard to build.\u201d She said, briefly meeting Naoko\u2019s eyes only to look down in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko scratched his wrist. True, that throughout Mt. Lady\u2019s career, she has been responsible for many property damages. It\u2019s been reported she does not make enough to break even for those costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... \u201cSo, if I was this supposed villain, why would I give you any money?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you give me the money, I would anything you want. I would even help your heist at U.A. in two weeks or anything else you need of me.\u201d Mt. Lady said, reluctantly. She said it like... it was rehearsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After</i>? This... seems incredibly suspicious. Asking to be paid first? Leading the conversation to U.A., even if that was what Naoko was planning to do anyway? <i>... arrghh</i> Naoko felt stupid for almost falling for it. This is a Pro hero he is talking to. A professional. She may have figured out he was a villain but she is looking for proof. And the money would be great evidence against hi .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... this is still an opportunity. If she is this keen on taking Naoko down, he could use this situation to his advantage and use her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I would accept this deal, as if I was a villain,\u201d Mt. Lady slightly relaxed. \u201cBut only after you do what I ask of you.\u201d Naoko said. Honestly, he likes the idea better to take control for his would-be-captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-after?\u201d Mt. Lady tensed up a bit. Bingo. It seems she was trying to set a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, after. See, I don\u2019t exactly trust you. How would I know you won\u2019t run off after I gave you my imaginary money?\u201d He is careful not to let her know he is onto her trap. \u201cIt much better for me to give you something after you give me something. After all, you need it way more than I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady\u2019s face is in distraught. For a moment, then she quickly hides it away. \u201cWell... I suppose...\u201d It seems the wind was taken out of her. But she went into deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko feels triumphant but he knows better not let her think of a way out. He has gotten this far. He might as well go all the way and try to bring her under his control. \u201cWell, i\u2019m waiting. Do you want my nonexistent money or not?\u201d Naoko said with noticeable impatience and glares her down for extra measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! ... fine. I\u2019ll do what ever you want for... the money.\u201d My. Lady seems to have choke that last bit at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko is pleased. At first, I thought he was going to jail. Now he has the Pro hero he\u2019s been having a crush on in his pocket. He can feel himself feeling a little excited by the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I accept. You are hired. And I have the perfect job you if you <span class=\"ctan\">want</span> <span class=\"cplum\">your</span> <span class=\"ctan\">precious</span> <span class=\"cplum\">money</span>.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Lady do, but for the things he has planned, having a Pro hero on the inside would open a lot of opportunities, not just for his heists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching his wrists again, he said, \u201cWell, how about you do a little... information get gathering for me on your fellow Pro heroes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady frowned. \u201cYou mean you want to me to spy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpy? No no, I want a little information gathering. I\u2019m a huge fan of the Pro heroes, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady grew quiet. \u201cBut... No, I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019ll do anything else, but I can\u2019t spy on them and report to...\u201d She stopped talking but Naoko knew the direction she was going with that sentence. Can\u2019t report on her fellow heroes to a villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying the villain persona up, Naoko shook his head in dissatisfaction. \u201cSigh, again using the word \u2018Spy\u2019?\u201d Naoko turned around and headed away from the river. \u201cI thought you want the money so bad you\u2019d make a deal with a villain. I guess you were blowing smoke after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko only got atop the hill before Mt. Lady caught up behind him. \u201cWait!\u201d She said in a louder tone, more desperate. \u201cI said I can do anything else you want. ...I can even...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady took the top of her shirt and pulled it down, revealing more of her cleavage to him. This made Naoko took a moment of pause. She IS the Pro Hero he likes the most and those breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naoko shook his head, keeping himself focus. If he plays this right, he\u2019ll have another chance at those breasts. He has to keep that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGather information on the Pro heroes I ask for or see me walking away now.\u201d Naoko said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy. Lady opens her mouth to further protest but nothing comes out. She close her mouth and has a worried expression. Minutes past before she speaks. \u201cF-fine. I\u2019ll give you the information you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Naoko smiles in triumphant. \u201cWell then, we have a deal. I\u2019ll give a set amount of money every time you give me what I want to know and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want all the money I\u2019m asking for by the end of this month.\u201d Mt. Lady butts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko hesitates. He is surprised by Mt. Lady\u2019s sudden demand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry? I\u2019m discussing how I\u2019d be paying you for each Pro Hero you give information on-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need all the money I\u2019m asking for by the end of the month.\u201d Mt. Lady said, cutting Naoko off. She smiles at him. \u201cRemember? I have bills I need to pay. This \u201cset\u201d money you are suggesting might not be enough for me by the time I need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmh, Mt. Lady still has that heroic, fighting spirit. This will not be easy. Luckily, the month just started. Naoko still has time but it appears he has a time limit till this suspicious Pro Hero receives her money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. At the end of this month, you\u2019ll receive all the money you are requesting. But only if you deliver on your side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMt. Lady bit her lip slightly. \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that stand off, the both of them discussed ways to contact each other and the amount Mt. Lady wants from Naoko. Naoko was not happy, as this amount was not pocket change and would definitely be seen as evidence if he were to hand it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they conversed, Mt. Lady didn\u2019t seem pleased. Perhaps it was guilt for having to agree to selling out her coworkers. Naoko is also not entirely happy with this new deal, having felt like he had signed himself up to get arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything finished planning, they both parted ways. Naoko watched Mt. Lady walk away till she disappeared behind some buildings, leaving the river behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, this will be interesting.\u2019 Naoko thought to himself. He thought back to her cleavage and honestly thought he missed an opportunity. Or, maybe he actually saved himself, as he would have given her the money there and then instead of having this month long time limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if he wants her boobs or, better thought, her colleague boobs on top of that, he should figure out how to use the information Mt. Lady will give him to his advantage. Maybe he can find out a way not to get arrested if that\u2019s what Mt. Lady has planned for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoko yawn and decided to head back home. It is mid day but these new developments are exhausting.Tomorrow is a <span class=\"ctan\">new</span> <span class=\"cplum\">day</span> <span class=\"ctan\">of</span> <span class=\"cplum\">possibilities</span>.</span></div></div>",

I saw you running into the crowd and almost knocked down a pedestrian. You could\u2019ve hurt him.\u201d The lady scolded you as people walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and saw who you are talking to. It\u2019s an older woman, early 30\u2019s, if you had to guess. She has short, brown hair with red lines under her eyes with a height of 5ft 6. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, you also notice she is wearing a very bazaar costume. Some pink, long headgear, red boots with pink fur at the shins and weird cat paws on her hands. Really strange, you can\u2019t seem to focus away from those weird, yet cute, gloves. The rest of her outfit, excluding the collar around her neck and the cat tail, somehow reminds you of an American, maroon, marching band uniform. Specifically, the straps around her breasts. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/edqjdP\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/edqjdP</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown as you listen to the lady\u2019s grievance, which had some reason in it.

I apologize. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d You said, bowing to the lady.

I\u2019m sorry to put you on the spot. I was watching an accident waiting to happen and it\u2019s my duty to prevent them. Please be careful and keep in mind of the people around you.\u201d She said, with her being apologetic this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up again, puzzled. \u201cDuty? Are you a hero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady smiled. \u201cYes! I\u2019m the hero, Mandalay, of the Wild Wild Pussycats!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandalay called her hero name out and took a weird pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, not being too knowledgeable about heroes, blanked on that. \u201cY-yeah, Wild Wild Pussy...\u201d Your mind went somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandalay let go of her pose. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not with my group at the moment and took the opportunity to go on patrol, which now I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d Her tail swished. \u201cBy the way, what is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine?

You try to stand up but your knees gave out. The young woman reached out her arm and catches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries! You just brighten up my day. The way you spun to the ground after hitting into me was hilarious!\u201d The young woman continue to laugh out loud like she was enjoying a big joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood on your feet and looked at the woman. She is a young woman, possibly in her late 20\u2019s. If you were to guess, she has a height of 166 cm (5'5\") and an average build. She wears an orange bandana around her head on her long, little wavy but mostly straight green hair. She is wearing a sleeveless, black tank top over her torso. On her hands are yellow, metallic gloves, with rings around the fingers. Below her waist, she is wearing vertically striped, green and orange pants which resembles part of a clown's attire, which length reaches midway to her thighs. Around her waist are smiles buttons, completing her \u201cI\u2019m a clown\u201d outfit. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/cyCJjn\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/cyCJjn</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter noticing all that, you ask. \u201cAre you a Pro Hero?\u201d Fair question,  because that would be one elaborate, casual outfit otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman continues to smile, not missing a beat. \u201cI am, little one! I am the Pro Hero, Miss Joke!\u201d The young woman proudly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, a Pro Hero. You\u2019ve heard about Miss Joke before. There were news about her becoming a teacher. Wait, a teacher? U.A.! \u201cMiss Joke, you are a teacher now, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke laugh. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher, alright. I got a PhD in \u2018Crossing the road!\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-was that a joke? \u201cCould you tell me how to get to the U.A. Culture Festival?\u201d You asked as politely as what better way to learn where the school is than from a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke quiet down her laughing. \u201cHa ha, sorry, little one. I\u2019m a teacher at Ketsubutsu Academy Highschool. I may know where U.A. is but I don\u2019t know if U.A. has a Culture Festival going on right now. At least Eraser never told me anything.\u201d To that, she laugh at her own inside joke. It\u2019s sort of pleasant to hear her joyful laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, are still certain that the Culture Festival is happening today. \u201cThat is fine. I\u2019m sure the Culture Festival is happening today but I\u2019m a little lost right now. Could you point me in the right direction?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke thought about it for a moment. Then a big smile appeared across her face. \u201cI\u2019ll do you one better. I\u2019ll join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat surprise you. \u201cThat would be helpful. But I don\u2019t mean to interrupt whatever it is you are doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke shrug. \u201cI was heading off towards a comedy club. I\u2019m figuring I should let the other guys have a chance to get some attention. Besides, I think the Culture Festival will be a lot of fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn\u2019t know anything like that but you are grateful and humble that a Pro hero is helping you out. \u201cThank you, Miss Joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke laugh. \u201cYou are rather a submissive one, aren\u2019t you, little one?\u201d She starts walking and you follow her. \u201cBy the way, what is your name?\u201d She asked, looking behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Oh</span>, <span class=\"cbgreen\">My</span> <span class=\"corange\">name</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">is</span>...</span></div></div>",

Miss Joke laugh like she is hearing a inside joke. She turned her torso slightly and petted his head as if he was a toddler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're so short! And I like short people. They can be so... bold.\", she said, hinting at something before turning away from Dox and facing forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is true, his eyes are leveled under her bust. Of course, he is walking behind her, so he can\u2019t be looking at her chest at the moment to confirm that. But, Dox found himself looking at something else. Something big and bouncy, showing itself through Miss Joke\u2019s pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you're enjoying the view you've got.\", Ms Joke said as she wiggles her hips. She had turned around and saw him eyeing her ass. She found it amusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke may be wearing puffed-out clown pants, but Dox knows when a butt is jiggling; he has a knack for knowing. When she wiggled her hips, Dox could feel an erection forming in his pants. He is hypnotized, just wanting to stare more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a cute little pervert. You like my butt, huh, little one?\", Ms Joke teased. She seems to be getting excited by the attention. Dox\u2019s head nodded rapidly of its own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he is little and he doesn't care how little he is, as long as that butt and the human it belongs to are bigger.

He blinks rapidly before loosing consciousness and blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 minutes later, he awoke in an alleyway; Ms Joke was looking at him.

It was just oddly loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-who?\u201d, Dox whispered. He conscious is slowly coming back. Shame too, because he had an awesome dream of being a ninja with magic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox opened his eyes, blinking away the blurred out world as he sat up. His weight bounced a little up and down as he moved. Uh, that is not right. Immediately, his mind is alerted that something is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox felt around, investigating his surroundings. He pushed his hand down on the ground, only for his hand to sink in and bounce back when he retreats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox quickly realized the ground was way too soft to be a sidewalk. What can Dox recall? Well, he was running towards U.A., he bumped into a lady who claim she is a teacher named Ms Joke, and had a nice booty. A really nice booty. Dox was ogling its perfection, when he heard her say something about glowing; then blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Ms Joke; where are you!?\", Dox shouted. He looked around. He seems to be in an alleyway, below some stairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look up, you silly little noodle!\", came the voice again. Finally recognizing the voice as Ms. Joke\u2019s, he look up to see a massive chest(!) with Ms. Joke peeking over her breasts to look at you. \"Is my lap warm enough for you?\u201d Ms. Joke ask, chuckling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-ms. Joke... where am I? What-\u201c, Dox tried standing up on her baggy, clown thighs, only to slip and fall forward against her stomach and between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't move too much. You're right against my crotch.\", Ms. Joke said, smiling like she isn\u2019t bothered in the slightest. Dox try standing up again, but his foot sank down in her lap, rubbing against her giant pussy through the fabric. Ms. Joke bites her lower lip in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\", Dox asked in confusion, pretending to not know where his foot just touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used your quirk. As a pro hero, I should have you arrested.\", Ms. Joke chuckle, shifting her butt around so she could spread her legs open just a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm quirkless.\", Dox said. How could he have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have the toe-joint?\", Ms. Joke asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the doctor never found anything like that. I have never been able to use any kind of quirk my whole life.\u201d Dox said. And now... he guess he has. But it\u2019s confusing Dox more because he has done some online research. Late bloomers almost never happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw your body glowing. Your quirk has just manifested; and its a fun quirk.\u201d Ms. Joke\u2019s eyes lit up. Dox could feel wetness coming from his foot and his heart sank and fluttered at the same time. \u201cYou and me are about to see how much fun we can have\", Ms. Joke said in a flirty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the festival!\", Dox quickly reminded back, having the feeling of what is coming. A part of him wants to be loyal to his friend. But another part of him can\u2019t shake the image of her butt out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starts in 45 minutes, naked little one. I checked my phone.\", Ms. Joke said, smiling as excitement is flashing her eyes. Her hands start traveling over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock, she ignores him and <span class=\"corange\">Ms. Joke</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">took</span> <span class=\"corange\">off</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">her</span>...</span></div></div>",

He easily got scoop up out of Miss Joke\u2019s lap by her yellow, leather glove. Miss Joke lifts him up in the air, right at her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox squirm in Miss Joke\u2019s hand. His legs kick rapidly out of her hand and Dox tries pulling on his shoulders to free his arms. Well, his legs more like fluttered, as her hand pin down his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Joke, let me out! This isn\u2019t funny. And where did you put my clothes?\u201d Dox pleaded. Dox knew he was naked this whole time but he felt like he didn\u2019t need to bring it up if Miss Joke couldn\u2019t see him. But now her hand has bond him together tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke laugh. She brings her hand up and Dox is inches away from her face. \u201cHahahahahahaha!!! Your- Ha! your face is so cute right now! It\u2019s like there is a mixture of anger and embarrassment.\u201d Miss Joke said, laughing at his struggling. She had completely ignored his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox got madder but also, his heart sank, as he realize Miss Joke isn\u2019t listening to him. \u201cMiss Joke, as a Pro Hero, you should ashame of yourself. You are taking advantage of a helpless citizen to satisfy yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke\u2019s laughter died down but an amused smirk replaced it. \u201cLittle one, even Pro Heroes need a break every once and awhile. And I\u2019m not taking advantage of you. I\u2019m using an unorthodox method to figure out the limits of your brand new quirk. As for who needs satisfying...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke smiles as she lowers her pinky finger. Dox blush as his cock, which he has kept hidden till now, springs and pokes out between her ring finger and her pinky finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmmm...\u201d was all Dox could say in response. His dick is very hard and free, with a giant woman staring at it. Hot and bother doesn\u2019t even begin to describe the situation. But... he can\u2019t say he isn\u2019t enjoying this. She is willingly staring right at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke roar with laughter and amusement at Dox\u2019s reaction. \u201cHa ha!! Lol! There is no need to be embarrass.\u201d Her voice calms down again. Her green hair softly lay against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMad, Dox looks away from her. He is not going to put up with this. He stays limp in her hand and silently waits for her to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notice Dox pouting, looking anywhere but her. \u201cAh! Sorry!\u201d Miss Joke quickly apologies. \u201cI got too carried away. My bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox, looking at a brick wall, sighs. Well, she is known to be the Smile Hero. He suppose she isn\u2019t trying to be mean, just keeping to mood light. Perhaps that\u2019s what all the flirting was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox turns back to Miss Joke and shivers when he sees the strong lust in her eyes. Her finger slowly starts to rub his body in a playful manner. Her thumb moves across his body, tapping lightly on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my bad, you know, little one. I am sorry for making fun of you. Let me make it up to you.\u201d Her voice lowered, no longer that loud, happy tone she usually has. It\u2019s more... sexual, with a little flame of passion behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-make it up to me?\u201d Dox stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke smile. \u201cYeah. Earlier, as we were walking, you were staring intensely at my butt. How about I let you see it, up close and personal? <b>Bare</b>.\u201d Her voice jumped a little at the end, bringing more attention to the bare part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox\u2019s cock jumped in between Miss Joke\u2019s fingers. \u201cI... I... I...\u201d Dox couldn\u2019t find any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke smile, taking that as a yes. Her left hand quickly reach for her clown pants waistband and tugged on it excitedly. But she realize she needs both hands to take off her pants.

He hasn\u2019t shown to be cooperating well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she hold him in her mouth? No, that might not be a good idea. Miss Joke has a gag reflex. Dox has a smaller diameter than one of her balloons she use in Balloon Modeling, with is 2 inches in diameter. She easy swallowed one that was 60 inches in length in a drunk bet. She could swallow Dox up if she wasn\u2019t careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she\u2019ll have to set him on the ground and take a chance. But how does she convince him to not do anything... stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke turn to Dox. \u201cLittle one, lets make a deal.\u201d Her green eyes focus on his tiny face. <i>Let\u2019s see... deal deal deal, what could I use as a deal?</i>, Miss Joke thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox is still concern over his hard dick, trying to not keep eye contact with this pretty, yet highly perverted older woman. \u201cD-deal? What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh. Here\u2019s the thing. I need to set you down for just a moment. Now, when I do that, I don\u2019t want you to be running off, little one. Even if you do run, I can quickly catch you. Then I can charge you for resisting a Pro Hero.\u201d Miss Joke said, in a level tone and a knowing smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Dox for he couldn\u2019t see, Miss Joke\u2019s left hand had moved between her legs and her index finger is rubbing her Vulva, or rather, the slit of her pussy through her clown pants. A damp spot is forming there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp. Dox does not like hearing the sound of that. \u201cS-so, if I were to not run away, what would be my reward as part of the deal?\u201d This quickly turning into something he did not imagine would happening to him when he ran out his front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke chuckle. \u201cOh, I am already planning give you something many men dream to have as a reward. Ha ha ha!\u201d Miss Joke laughs at her own innuendo. Her finger rubs her pussy faster and lets out a moan. Her hot breath washes over Dox\u2019s little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d While Dox has a feeling on what Miss Joke wants from him, he isn\u2019t really sure. Perhaps Miss Joke is an exhibitionist and likes showing her butt to people. No judging, as if he was at normal height and doesn\u2019t have a friend waiting for him, he would welcome it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did her breath smell so good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but, I have a colleague who can transform her height. She\u2019s a bit younger than me by four years but an excellent Hero. I can introduce you to her and she can help you get back to normal height.\u201d <i>Yes, that could work. The little one would be very concern about his new quirk. Having someone to give him guidance would be just what he needs</i>, Miss Joke thought, her thoughts are growing hazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke is reaching her limit. Little guys are her fetish and she is just holding one in her hand. She needs his consent and to be cooperating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Y-yeah, that does sound like the best option for me right now. Now that I know I have a quirk, it\u2019s probably best for someone to teach me how to use it. I had skipped the kindergarten quirk evaluation back then<br>\r\nbecause I thought I was quirkless. But... I still feel uneasy.</i> Dox thought this to himself as Miss Joke tries to keep silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-ok. It\u2019s a deal. I won\u2019t run away.\u201d Dox said. Like his mom says, it\u2019s better to get things over and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke smiles. Finally! \u201cA-alright, little one. Let\u2019s get things started!\u201d Miss Joke removes her left hand and gets up off her butt and onto her feet. She ducks her head to avoid the cement staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox looks down and sees that Miss Joke was sitting on his clothes since he got knocked out! \u201cMiss Joke! You were sitting on my clothes this whole time!?\u201d Her butt left an impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTee hee. I\u2019m sorry. I clean up the ground a bit but I still rather sit on your clothes as a cushion. Not that I mind getting my butt dirty.\u201d Miss Joke laugh. Dox, too, find her innuendos a little funny. Funny, but he doesn\u2019t know how honest she is being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke turn around and set Dox on his clothes. His clothes are really warm! Well, yeah, Miss Joke was sitting on them but she couldn\u2019t have been sitting on them for too long. Maybe a half an hour. So how did his clothes get so warm in a short amount of time? Is her butt a warmer? And there is a reeking smell coming from one area. Coming from the center of her imprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dox inspect his clothes, Miss Joke quickly turn back around, facing away from Dox. She pinch her legs together and place a thumb inside of her clown pants on each side of her waist. \u201c\ud83c\udfb6Oh little one\ud83c\udfb5! Ready or not, here I come!\u201d Miss Joke sang, as she drops down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox snap his head up and watch as Miss Joke squats over him. Her huge, baggy, clown butt eclipse the sky and the ceiling. Dox quickly dives, letting out a scream of terror, trying not to get crushed! He lays down his back, waiting to see what Miss Joke does next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke doesn\u2019t sit on Dox. Instead, she is still on her feet, squatting over him. Miss Joke feels tingly now. She is finding it thrilling to terrorize this little one. But she knows he must likes it. So, why not make it better for him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her thumbs in her waistband, Miss Joke grabs a hold on her clown pants. She slowly, in her very teasing, and playful way, slide her clown pants down, off her pale, white butt cheeks. She can only imagine Dox\u2019s reaction to her butt. <i>He must be loving this!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Dox is loving this. Miss Joke is revealing her clown butt to Dox, in a very teasing manner. He stared up at the white, creamy butt as Miss Joke slip off her bottoms, showing herself to Dox in a sexy manner. Dox saw Miss Joke\u2019s anus come into view and instantly notice it\u2019s moving, staying puckered, but opening slightly as Miss Joke periodically opens her butt cheeks for Dox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Miss Joke\u2019s clown pants slip off over Miss Joke\u2019s pussy. Her pussy is huge and white, with a mix of pink. Dox can even make out green hair around her pussy, but it\u2019s short, like she recently trimmed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight bounce off Miss Joke\u2019s pussy, showing her slit glistening. The shine makes Dox very aware Miss Joke is horny. Not realizing what he was doing, overwhelm by the giant ass hovering over him, Dox reach up his left hand and briefly touch Miss Joke\u2019s slit. Miss Joke howled and Dox retreated his hand, fearing he angered Miss Joke by touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke bit her bottom lip and stop talking her clown pants off, stopping right at her knees. She balanced herself on her right hand, supporting her as her left hand went for the area Dox touch on her pussy, rubbing it lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke had enough her own teasing. She was just playing at first but her pussy is too hot to ignore. She needs some release. \u201cMy apologies, little one. But... let\u2019s go a lot further.\u201d She says in a shaky voice. \u201cHow would you like to get to know my butt... intimately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox\u2019s cock jumps to the idea but he tries to control himself. \u201cBut the festival...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkip it! There will always be another!\u201d Miss Joke\u2019s voice is sounding more impatient and savage. She is clearly losing herself to her own horny-ness. Her yellow, leather glove index finger has broken into her pussy and she is lightly masterbating over Dox and her butt rocks over him, going across his body and up and down, each time getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dox\u2019s heart drop as he considers what Miss Joke is saying. Such an act could hurt him in this tiny form. <span class=\"corange\">What</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">should</span> <span class=\"corange\">he</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">do</span>?</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s no way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke didn\u2019t hesitate when she heard Dox\u2019s respond. She raised her butt up and got off her feet so she could laid her legs on the ground. They laid themselves on each side on Dox\u2019s tiny form, blocking off any escape from the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t planning to do that. Dox thinks Miss Joke is probably just going to have him lick her anus or something and that\u2019ll be the end of it. He looks back and his heart drops as a wall of the giantess\u2019s boots. They are right up against him, folded inward to prevent him from backing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... ok. No need for that. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Dox said half heartedly. His voice was too low for Miss Joke to hear. He wasn\u2019t oblivious that Miss Joke hasn\u2019t even told him what he supposed to do and it\u2019s making him nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke got up and, with a finger still in her pussy, she slowly sat her butt right on Dox and her feet. Dox pushed against the Pro Hero\u2019s butt cheeks, even though that did little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to voice his complaint but Miss Joke spoke first. \u201cNow, little one~, if you could be so kind, how you like to play plumber and clean out my butthole? It\u2019d be awesome if you could <i>flush me~</i>.\u201d Miss Joke ask in a happy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Dox\u2019s brain had trouble registering what Miss Joke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke didn\u2019t wait for Dox to respond. With both her hands, she grab each of her cheeks and spread them apart. Dox, in surprise, had his arms give away and his face hit her open butthole. Her powerful stench filled his nose and Dox internally screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox panic and tried to back out but he is stopped by Miss Joke\u2019s left index finger. She moans softly as she feels Dox\u2019s head slightly in her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, little one. We had a deal. If you need so help, here... you... go...\u201d Miss Joke said as she pushes Dox further in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox\u2019s head gets voliently pushed through Miss Joke\u2019s tight sphincter. Her anus is like a hungry mouth, opening up and taking a mouthful of his body. His arms are pin to the side, though he bends his elbows agaisnt her, as her finger now pushes against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Joke... Stop! I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d He cried out but his words can not reach outside of her flesh. Miss Joke\u2019s finger retreats out her butthole and continue to push on his own butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke, meanwhile, is in utter bliss. Compared to the terrified Dox. With her free right hand, she continues to masterbate, inserting three fingers in. This feeling of dominance. She has never felt this sexually driven before. She can feel Dox wiggle and squirm in her anus as she pushes him further in. She moans loudly as her finger pushes Dox\u2019s little legs in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke\u2019s sphincter coils and around Dox\u2019s ankles as Dox\u2019s bare feet has one last last of fresh air. \u201cPlease no...\u201d Dox whimper in total darkness. Miss Joke pushes one last time and her anus closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!\u201d Miss Joke closes her mouth in a scream. She tilted her head back and laid on the floor, on Dox\u2019s clothes. With Dox\u2019s 5 inch long body all the way tucked in her ass, Miss Joke spread her legs and lifted her lower body up in the air, further clamping her butt cheeks together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss a Joke is closing in on her orgasm. She bounce her pussy in the air as her right hand digs into her vagina. Her left hand, done with its duty, travel up Miss Joke\u2019s body and grabs her left breast under her top. She bites her lip as she can feel it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she feels a slight kick from Dox\u2019s useless struggle. That did it and Miss Joke lets everything out. She opens her mouth and yells as she climax in the deserted alleyway. Her right glove retracts from her pussy and Miss Joke squirted all over the alley wall in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke lays her head on the clothes as her elevated pussy goes to town on the poor wall, squirting cum all over.  Her legs twitch a bit before collapsing on the floor. She lays there, unmoving, enjoying the aftermath of her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat... was... amazing, little one.\u201d Miss Joke said, after a little while. Dox hasn\u2019t moved since after Miss Joke stopped cumming. Which she is very thankful. His increased frightened struggle while she was cumming only had heighten her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDox had slipped further up the rape clown\u2019s butt during her orgasm. Gravity had pulled him closer to her intestines. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t stop struggling. He reached a point where she could no longer feel his hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her high goes down, Miss Joke pushes herself off the ground and sat up. She remised how good that just felt.

He is being treated lower than human and he\u2019s unable to help himself, trapped in this hell by the result of his new quirk. And this pro hero, Miss Joke. She must be a villain. No hero would ever do this. Would they? (Check other interactive chapters to see if they did.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke frown. With him lodge in there, it does feel like she needs to poop. But she has to hold it in, if she wants to have more fun with him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her hand from her stomach, Miss Joke reached for her panties. She lean back, while still sitting. In goes her right leg and in goes her left leg through the other pantie hole. After she playfully pulled her underwear to her knees, she lean back further pulled her panties back over her butt, sealing her asshole tight behind the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahaha! Little one, can you hear me?\u201d Miss Joke called out to her lower body. She didn\u2019t hear anything but she suddenly felt a little pain in her intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! I hope you are nice and cozy in there, because you are spending the entire day with me. Well, not with me, but so much as in me! Hahahaha!\u201d Miss Joke laugh out loud to her own bad humor. Dox wheeze at the smell and the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke grab her clown pants and this time, she stood up after her clown short went around her ankles. Dox\u2019s body shift in the dark, moist cavern, with his body point down, thanks to gravity, to Miss Joke\u2019s \u201cexit\u201d. But his head got caught by Miss Joke\u2019s intestine\u2019s grip on his head. He wants to scream but he didn\u2019t want to waste to good air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Joke stood in the middle of the alleyway, tightening her shorts back on her waist. After that was done, she paused for a moment of clarity, remembering how great that orgasm while knowing what she is doing now is kidnapping. \u201cHaha... well, if anyone found out about this, i\u2019ll lose my hero license for sure.\u201d She felt a little sad but soon turn happy, slapping her butt with a loud smack, sending ripples on her cushion ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle one, when I get you back to my place, you\u2019ll never be able to live without my butt.\u201d She said, in the most villain tone she had yet to say. With that, Miss Joke continues out her day, with her little 5 inch butt snack in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Miss <span class=\"corange\">Joke\u2019s</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">perspective</span> <span class=\"corange\">for</span> <span class=\"cbgreen\">now</span>...)</span></div></div>",

The hot milf explained that where the both of you meant was far away from U.A. She only in the area at the time because she was running an errand and her husband dropped her off before he head to work. It just surprised you that you was so very lost to begin with and thank Mitsuki again for the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really isn\u2019t my trouble.\u201d Mitsuki replied humbly. \u201cI was needing to take a walk anyway. My son, Bakugo, is always on my case that I\u2019m letting myself go and my fists don\u2019t carry the same impact as the used to.\u201d She turned around and held a fist in the air smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, wondering if ms. Bakugo is the type of mother that punches her kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki began quiet, probably in deep thought. Her hand goes to thigh, pinching them. She was able to pinching a bit of fatness from her thick thighs. Perhaps she was feeling concern about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, now made aware how thick her thighs are on top of a big butt. You place your hands in your pocket, trying to hide the boner forming in your tight jeans. It\u2019d be embarrassing if Mitsuki saw you like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more of walking, the heat is starting to get to you. Your armpits are getting sweaty and your white T-shirt is feeling pretty drenched. You think you need a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, ms. Bakugo, can we get out of the heat for a bit? I need a break. It\u2019s too hot.\u201d You said complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki turned around. \u201cSure, I think I need a rest too..\u201d She looked around for anything chilly. \u201cLet\u2019s cool off at that parking lot.\u201d She pointed at a underground parking lot across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I think it\u2019s a good shortcut. Otherwise, we would have to cross the street much further up the road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo complain from you. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d You actually sprinted ahead of her, feeling like you\u2019d die if you spend a moment more on the sidewalk. Mitsuki followed closely behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, there were lots of cars but relatively no people. Still, you don\u2019t want to come off as suspicious to anyone while you cooled off. Looking around, you found a spot no one would be able to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank god.\u201d Unable to hold it in, you took off your sweaty, wet shirt, feeling the cold air touch your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hey there.\u201d Mitsuki teased (or was it a flirt?) when she saw your torso. You upper body is toned and a bit muscular. You were pretty active in middle school till you became a N.E.E.T.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and turned away. \u201cS-sorry. It was just so unbelievably hot outside and I was sweaty too much. I just need some time to cool off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Mitsuki said, followed by a couple seconds of silence. You felt a little embarrassed standing shirtless next such a hot woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the short silence, Mitsuki spoke again, \u201cYou know, I am pretty sweaty too. I should cool off as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... What? You are surprised.

So you turned around and just as you were about to ask her what she meant, she started lifting her shirt up. You quickly turn your head to stare at the wall ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I should've warned you first. My quirk makes me secrete a glycerin-like sweat which makes me need to cool off more often. At least it moisturizes my skin, so it makes me look much younger than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you feel like you have cooled down enough, so you decide to put your shirt back on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you cutting the show short so soon?\" Mitsuki asked as you hear her walk closer to you. She stops beside you and sit on the large pipes that were mounted on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I feel much better now.\" You say as you turn to the other side, thinking you might be hit if you looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a hand touch your back. \"You know, I don't mind if you look.\" Mitsuki whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if that's a good idea. Besides, don't you think we should be going?\" You ask with a slight voice crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear an audible sigh coming from the shirtless woman behind you. \"I guess you are right. Just give me a sec.\" You feel her remove her hand and you start to relax, not realizing that you were tensed up the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you felt two hands grab your forehead, followed by your surroundings being blurred. You stop, with the softest feeling surrounding your face. You look at what is causing this warm softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" You hear the feminine voice above you ask. You turn your attention above you and see Mitsuki smirking. \"I can't remember the last time I got to do this with Katsuki. It feels so nostalgic.\" Mitsuki closes her eyes and brings you closer into her chest. \"Take as much of it in as you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grip behind your head starts to slowly loosen. Once it has completely gone, you slowly stand back and look at her. She places her hand on her hip and smiles at you. \"So kiddo, how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at her and notice that she took her bra off. \"Do you mind ... if I ... fondle <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">your</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">breasts</font> ...\" your voice turned into a mumble at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta speak up kid.\" Mitsuki tells you while crossing her arms. Which honestly didn't help much. You blush and look at the ground, trying to muster up the courage to ask her. You take a deep breath, \"Can I touch them?\" You ask. Mitsuki looks at you for a second and smiles again. She stretches her arms outwards, \"Come on in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly start to approach her lifting your hands up to her chest level. You stop right in front of her, hesitating. \"What's the hold up?\" She asks with a bit of seduction in her tone. You gulp, and then cup her breasts. You are surprised by how soft they were and squished them, looking at how your fingers sink into her skin. You hear a slight moan come from Mitsuki, \"Are you a virgin?\" You stop with what you were doing and look up at her in surprise. \"I take that as a yes\" she says, with a mischievous grin on her face. \"Who said you can stop?\" You start rolling her right breast around, and pinching her left nipple.\"Mmm, keep going.\" She moans and puts her index finger on her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start feeling a bit strange. It was like your stomach was upset but at the same time it wasn't. You decide to close your eyes for a bit. But something was wrong, you couldn't feel anything in your hands. When you open your eyes again something was off.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not like the writer took it off the wiki or anything, \ud83d\ude06). On her head, she has pink locks with some unique looking protective goggles on them. Her yellow eyes has cross-hairs for pupils and her face is sporting a great big smile. She is wearing fingerless gloves and... is that the U.A. gym uniform from the Sports Festival? Hard to tell from all those harnesses surrounding her body.

My baby can be controlled using your brain! Neural link! Watch!\u201d The girl stood still and her gadget started moving on its own. Ok, that\u2019s a little cool. She is keeping her arms and fingers still as the metal limbs whirl around. And she seemed pretty proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the metal limbs whirl too much and smoke was starting to come out. \u201cH-hey! Y-your baby is catching on fire!\u201d You said as you can see flames starting to appear at the joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is?\u201d The girl looked. \u201cIt is!\u201d The girl quickly click a button and the limbs disconnected.

Did she forget?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka collected the pieces of the machine. Oh! It\u2019s cold to the touch. It cooled down a lot faster than Meka thought it would. Huh, sounds like plot convenience. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do with those pieces but it wouldn\u2019t be right to leave them out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesutobeb\u012b Meka is a 16 year old boy from Shiketsu high. Well, no he isn\u2019t. He would if he could control his Expansion Quirk better. But all it does is lead him to trouble. Meka is 5\u20197ft tall, with white hair in a ponytail. He has a lead figure with some impressive biceps he got from being active in sports from his old school. You can\u2019t tell because he keeps them covered in a light green long sleeve shirt. He also wears long, light brown pants that reach all the way to his darker green shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka collected the last of the \u201cjunk\u201d. It wasn\u2019t really heavy but it was slightly discomforting and prevented him from seeing well. He started walking and carefully check down alleyways to drop this junk off in some dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take long for him to get cranky. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I find any dumpsters around? Shouldn\u2019t there be? Seems like an issue the city needs to fix\u201d Meka gripe as he carried the metal machine. Well he doesn\u2019t have to but that strange girl shouldn\u2019t have ran off, leaving garbage behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka search a few more alleyways before giving up. \u201cI\u2019m running out of time. Uh... I guess i\u2019ll give this back to her. I recognize that gym uniform from U.A. Since I was heading there myself, it should be easier to get this off to her directly.\u201d He said confidently. With that decided, Meka headed off to U.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later~ Meka arrived at the school gates. He heard a student being waved in but he hears no one else. <i>Good. No line.</i> Meka thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka walked in front of the counter. \u201cExcuse me, where can I find a girl name Mei Hatsume?\u201d Meka asked. Thanks to the junk he is carrying, he can\u2019t see the teacher, nor, can the teacher see his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher looks up. \u201cHatsume?\u201d Then spots the junk in Meka\u2019s hands. \u201cAh. She left that lying around in public, did she? Go on ahead.\u201d The teacher gave the approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr... I can\u2019t open the door.\u201d Meka pleaded under the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher pressed a button and the gate swung open for Meka. Meka gave a thank you and walked passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Meka is on U.A. grounds, he should enjoy the festival.

They nervously told him where she would be, a workshop, and helpfully open the door for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka looked around as he walked. The school is very lively. There are students walking everywhere, stands build all over outside, each room he walks by has some kind of event. It truly is a big festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka smiled. After he drops off this crap he is holding, he can call his friend and they can spend the day walking around the festival. It might actually be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka reaches the door. It\u2019s a big door, with metal plating. <i>Why would they...</i> Meka decides it would be better to end that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka\u2019s ponytail went over his face, annoyingly enough, and he shook his head to get it off. His ponytail always getting in front of his face. Annoyed now, and with his hands occupied, Meka kicked the door. \u201cHatsume! It\u2019s me, Meka. That guy you met an hour ago. Open up. I got your... invention with me.\u201d He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few female students, a blue, short hair tomboy who is way taller than him, and a medium size, green hair girl walked passed, whispering about Meka. They glance over and look worryingly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Meka mad and embarrass. No one came to open the door either. Meka set down the broken invention and grab the door handle. Only hesitating for a moment, briefly imagining the door just blowing up right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door is unlock, to Meka\u2019s surprise. He open the door and held it open with his foot as he picked up the machine. He should just toss the broken pieces in there one by one but he really wants to see Hatsume and give her a piece of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the room, the door close behind him. Meka briefly glance around the room. There is a lot of junk around. Piles of them. And the decor... seems more like a lab from fiction than a workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka looks over at the closest pile and drops off the junk he had been carrying for the past hour. He stretches his arms. Wow, they are sore. Guess there really is a price from being too helpful against your better judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka glance around quickly. No Hatsume. Well, whatever. He\u2019s here at the festival now. He can forget about that rude girl and have some fun with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka turn around to leave only to meet someone right at his face. \u201cAaahhhhh!!!\u201d Meka cried out, surprised by the sudden invasion of personal space. He backs up quickly. It\u2019s that girl, Hatsume! Where did she...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pink hair girl advanced. With a big grin, and dress in her workshop clothes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/pDPh7F\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/pDPh7F</a>), Hatsume began talking. She doesn\u2019t seem to notice Meka\u2019s shock. \u201cHello, we meet again! I have a been expecting you! My name is Mei Hatsume. Call me Mei. I received word that you\u2019ll be coming!

His anger didn\u2019t go away but he is well aware if Meka put more weight on him, he would get stab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei look down at Meka, looming over him wearing her big smile. \u201cHehehe, there it is! The moment a feisty meal begs for me to give them mercy! It is like seasoning. Too bad yours was quick but that\u2019s what I get for sending in a request from them 3 hours ago.\u201d Mei said in her booming voice. Meka can\u2019t understand no one has walked in yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease... get off of me. I don\u2019t what you are talking about, you crazy bitch. Food? I don\u2019t know what that means but if you get off of me right now, I promise not to kill you.\u201d Meka said, keeping his voice evenly. <i>Much.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei kept smiling down at Meka. Before Meka could say anything more, Mei\u2019s belly growl. It was loud! Meka stop looking at Mei and down to her stomach. It\u2019s really chubby. Meka didn\u2019t think Mei was a chubby girl because her face and arms are still skinny. But that belly... It wasn\u2019t even chubby on the sides, only pushing outward towards his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei laugh. \u201cHa Ha! The time for foreplay is over! This Mad Scientist needs to eat her lunch before the Culture Festival is over! So many sponsors to impress. Now, brain food, thanks for the meal!\u201d She said. She seems to be talking to herself, but that boast was like if it was for Meka <span class=\"chotpink\">to</span> <span class=\"clblue\">understand</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">his</span> <span class=\"clblue\">situation</span>.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mei scoots back till her butt is on Meka\u2019s lap. Usually, this is the part where a guy gets hot and bothered despite himself. In another situation, his dick would get hard underneath Mei\u2019s ass. But Meka is scared and mad, with sharp metal edges poking him, with a crazy girl putting her weight on him while the metal edges are drawing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForeplay? No. Just get off.\u201d Meka begged. He fears the crazy girl might start jumping on him. He is going to wish she did that instead in a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei lean forward and grab his head. Her fingers played a little with his white hair. \u201cThanks for the meal.\u201d She says, ignoring his begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei kiss Meka\u2019s nose and open her mouth wide as she possibly could. Her lips landed on top of his head and she slowly push down. Her lips made a ring halfway down his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fu-\u201c Meka can feel something wet covering his head and Mei\u2019s tongue is sliding across his hair. However, Meka\u2019s vision is obscure by Mei\u2019s cleavage. Her boobs are huge. Ok, his dick did get a little hard. But his vision is cut shortly by Mei\u2019s lips covering his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what the hell are you doing?!\u201d Meka cried out. He reached his hands out to grab Mei but he couldn\u2019t see her own hands grab his wrists with surprising strength(from being at a Hero school)and pin him to his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, haha, this is very funny, but take off these blindfol-\u201c Meka got caught off when Mei\u2019s mouth passed over his lips. Mei got Meka\u2019s head fully into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei lick Meka\u2019s face. Men and Women taste so different to her. Women have a salty and sweet flavor with tasty, soft, chewy meat while men have salty and spicy flavor with tender, tough meat. She loves them both! Men are food for her workshop and women are for when she is forced on break so she could relax. Scarfing down a female classmate from the General Education department is guilty treat of her\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei swallows and Meka finds himself entering her throat. Mei licks his neck to his disgust. It was a quick lick, since she goes on getting Meka\u2019s shoulders in her mouth. She struggles to hold his arms together as Meka is making things difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka frantically struggle in Mei\u2019s grip. He can\u2019t believe the crazy bitch is actually eating him. He is going to literally kill her when he gets her off of him. But that\u2019s going to be difficult. Moving his legs only reminds him of where he is sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka feels discomfort and pain suddenly as Mei accidentally dislocated his arms. Meka yell out in agony but Mei couldn\u2019t hear anything. Only that it just became easier to stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with Meka\u2019s torso sliding in her mouth, Mei stepped off his body and climb down off her babies (the pile of intentions). She held Meka in the air and moved him away from her babies and set his legs over on the center table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach started getting a rounder shape as Meka\u2019s head enters her tummy. You couldn\u2019t see the outline of his face because of Mei\u2019s already chubby belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Meka\u2019s shirt cover his chest, Mei still found herself enjoy the tenderness of his body. \u2018Mhm! What a wonderful meal. Midnight sure knows where to find the best food in the school.\u2019 Mei thought in gratitude as she reach her Food\u2019s waist. She paused, looking at his tight butt. Oh, how tasty that meat will be when her teeth chews on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands let go of the Food\u2019s body and she feels around his waist till she found the belt buckle. After unstrapping and unzipping his pants, Mei grab the waistband of his pants and slid them off. She got a bad reaction as she pulled them off. Her Food got lively again, frantically kicking his legs in the air. Good thing her babies are supporting her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really can\u2019t stand the wrapping on her food and she wished she wasn\u2019t so hungry to forget to take the wrapping off the torso. The Food\u2019s body fell further in Mei\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Mhm?\u2019 Mei is taken by surprise as she felt something hit her chin. Her teeth is right at her food\u2019s butt. Curious, she felt around her chin. Something long and thicc is blocking her progress. Mei hasn\u2019t had much experience with male food before. There was always \u2018wrapping\u2019 when she ate from the feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei wrap her hand around the thicc \u2018limb?\u2019. She stretch her mouth wider as she push the long thing into her mouth. Her food seems to relax a bit when she did that. The \u2018limb\u2019 grew harder on her tongue but Mei paid it no mind for now. She\u2019ll ask Midnight later. Mei tilt her head up and grab her Food\u2019s legs to drag them down to her belly, feeling \u2018balls?\u2019 sliding down her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka found his body curling in this bizarre prison. What is this crazy girl\u2019s quirk?! Is he actually going to be eaten?! Her throat muscles do feel nice on his cock... don\u2019t get distracted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp! A student. A teacher! Anyone, save me!\u201d Meka cried out as his cock joined him in Mei\u2019s stomach. He can\u2019t kick anymore. His legs are tight together by Mei\u2019s throat and he can feel Mei\u2019s teeth scrapping his knees. There was no reply, only the sound of Mei swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei is almost done with her meal. Now for the part of the meal she was waiting for. Her Food\u2019s feet. She grab his shoes and slip them off along with his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei loves the salty taste of her meal\u2019s feet. Food\u2019s feet are a delicacy for Mei, more than any other part of the meal. Some times she holds her meal\u2019s legs in her throat and licks the meal\u2019s feet in her closed mouth as she works on her babies. She can\u2019t do that often because Midnight told her to never let Power Loader-sensei or anyone outside the General Education aware of her meals. She can never let her sensei see her undigested meal in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei hummed in delight as she sat her butt against the table and let her huge belly hang out. Her blushed face showed as she lightly bites on the soft toes and her tongue ran between them. Mei\u2019s throat threaten to swallow her meal the rest of the way, but Mei did her best to ignore it, choosing to savor all the taste of her Food\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! What are you doing to my feet!?\u201d Meka yelled up at Mei, feeling a little humiliated. But again, he was ignored. Probably because at this point with her food in her stomach, she\u2019s no longer recognize humans as people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka couldn\u2019t take anymore. Enraged, he thrash his arms out violently. He hope it would give the crazy bitch discomfort, even though it would not get him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei was not shaken by Meka\u2019s movements due to her babies on her feet. But Mei did develop some hiccups. \u201cHic!\u201d In surprise, she suddenly swallowed Meka\u2019s feet. Mei felt a little dejected as she feels her meal\u2019s toes slid off her tongue and into the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka\u2019s lower body slid down Mei\u2019s throat, reuniting with Meka. \u201cSon of bitch! Stop! Let me out!\u201d Meka scream at the top of his lungs but again, no response. Meka adjusted himself into the fetal position as his legs made his space increasing more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei bore a huge smile on her face. Here she is, standing in her favorite lab with an oversized belly hanging out in front of her. Mei curl her toes in delight as she enjoyed the sensation of being full. Her stomach made some gurgling noise as her stomach walls tighten around her Food. Mei open her mouth, \u201cBurp!\u201d, as the air escaped her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden knock on the door. Mei quickly turn her head in that direction. There was more knocking, followed by a softer knock. Curious, Mei got her butt off the table and, having to completely forgetting her noticeably huge stomach that was not at all evenly proportioned to the rest of her body, she ran to the lab door and open it to find a student before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, blue hair tomboy appeared to be standing in front of Mei. It was the same girl Meka passed by in the hall moments before. \u201cI-I\u2019m ready... to... be food now.\u201d The shy General Education department girl said, shyly looking down at her feet. She didn\u2019t even look at Mei to notice her human-size stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oblivious Mei had no clue she is the meal Midnight sent. \u201cThanks, but I am not in the mood for seconds today. Bye!\u201d Mei said with a smile and closed the door just as Meka punched her belly to get attention. She turn around back to her lab in rapid movement, thrusting her stomach around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka couldn\u2019t hear anything words from within Mei\u2019s stomach, only mumbling. Perhaps that was due to the fat accumulating from Mei\u2019s other \u2018meals\u2019. He felt a quick rush of hope when he heard someone, only for it to be crush by the sound of the door closing. Mei\u2019s swinging him around only added to his anger. However, as Mei is letting out little burps as she walks around her lab, Meka is having trouble breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei is feeling inspired. The toughness of her meal gave an idea to add more \u2018excitement\u2019 for her future meals. Mei couldn\u2019t wait! She moved rapidly around the room, excited to create her new baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeka is losing consciousness. He doesn\u2019t even have a good grip on what\u2019s real anymore. <span class=\"chotpink\">Is</span> <span class=\"clblue\">this</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">the</span> <span class=\"clblue\">end</span>? </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s pretty crowded too, as passersby walk around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly stand on your own feet, realizing you had just pushed someone down. \u201cI am so sorry. Let me help you up.\u201d You quickly reached out your hand, offering to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at your hand and accepted it, grabbing it and letting you pull her up off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a better look at this girl. She has dark, shoulder-length hair in a bob-shaped cut. She has an athletic build underneath her school uniform, uniform which seems familiar but you couldn\u2019t quite place it. Well, you actually couldn\u2019t tell what her build is, only guessing she has an athletic build from how tone her arms are. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/ucFFW1\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/ucFFW1</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black hair girl stares slightly at you with her dark blue eyes. \u201cR-right. I do apologize for running into you like that. It was crowded and I wasn\u2019t paying attention to where I was going...\u201d Your voice gets quiet as the girl doesn\u2019t change her neutral expression as you say your excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there for a few minutes in silence. This seems... awkward. Is she mad? Why does she keep staring at you without saying a word?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...... I didn\u2019t mean to trouble you but I better get going. I need to get to U.A. as soon as possible for the Culture Festival.\u201d Well, she is not saying anything and she doesn\u2019t seem upset. Maybe it\u2019s best to leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou politely wave, as you couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do, and tried to walk past her. Surprisingly, the strange girl grabs your arm, stopping you from leaving. Uh oh, she is mad. You turn to her and her neutral expression doesn\u2019t change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I am very sorry for running into you, but I do need to get going. I have a friend waiting for me.\u201d Wait, is she going to hand you over to the police? That won\u2019t be fair but it would also make you miss the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl reached into her skirt and pulled out an I.D., showing it to you. You look over the I.D. and it reads, \u201cYui Kodai, Class 1B. U.A. Highschool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are an U.A. student?\u201d Kodai nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! So that\u2019s why the uniform looks familiar. She is an U.A. student. Mentioning the Culture Festival must have attracted her attention. Wait, maybe she knows the way to U.A. since you are a bit lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but can you help me find the way to U.A.? I\u2019m a bit lost.\u201d There was a momentary pause before Kodai nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel relieved. Wandering the city till you find the school wasn\u2019t a well thought plan to begin with. \u201cThank you!

He was wearing black combat boots, blue jeans that were a little long, a belt with fist-shaped buckle, a long red t-shirt, and a leather jacket; topped off with brown messy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, shall we go, Kodai?\", Mitsuko asked. Kodai nodded, and took his hand and started walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKodai, Kodai. It doesn\u2019t sound right on the tongue. Mitsuko would love to address Kodai by her given name, Yui. Her family name seems a bit off on his tongue but it would be weird to address a stranger by their given name. He would have to be close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuko\u2019s name talk got cut off and he instead started blushing heavily, as her hand felt very nice. \"Not much of a talker, are you?\", he asked her. Kodai has not said a word since they met and she continues to stay silent as they walk through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d, Kodai just shrugged, and continues to hold his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hand is soft.\", Mitsuko told her. Kodai stopped walking, and he could see her face turning red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\", He asked. Have they arrived at U.A. or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't get complimented that often\", She said. Her voice was barely audible but Mitsuko could still hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, she speaks!\", Mitsuko said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKodai frown, blushing embarrassment, and went silent. She tugged on his hand and they continued walking. She didn\u2019t seem to take the compliment well. Maybe... she thinks she doesn\u2019t deserve it. But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry about that. I was teasing.\u201d, Mitsoku apologized. Kodai kept walking, heading further and further away from people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsoku isn\u2019t liking this awakened silence. He feels like he should say something. \u201cI\u2019m surprise. You and the U.A.\u2019s hero students are all amazing. As long as you are working to make a difference, you should be proud of yourself.\u201d Mitsoku said. If he had a quirk, he would also be striving to be a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKodai stops walking. He hears a faint mumbling coming from her. They had stopped in a less crowded area and there are fewer shops that Mitsoku recognize here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kodai firmly grabs a hold of his hand and pulls him away from the street. She dragged him into an alleyway; and forcing Mitsoku against a wall, and gazed fiercely into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you just did?\", She asked in a neutral tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\", Mitsoku wasn\u2019t really sure what prompted this reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made me feel better about what I've done so far, more than anyone else has; even me. Thank you!\", Kodai said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she threw her arms over him and forced her lips on Mitsoku, having him react in surprise by her sudden. He is completely confused right but return her embraced in a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have a proper introduction. My name is Yui Kodai of class 1B. My quirk is Size; I can change my size. And you?\", she asked. She seems to be a lot more talkative then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marino Mitsuko, I have no quirk. But what was...\", <i>that kiss</i>, Mitsoku was about ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't? So you have the problem with the toe joint?\", She asked. Her neutral expression seem slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just haven't had my quirk show up. Late bloomer, you know.\", Mitsoku said, joking poorly to lighten the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill concern about Mitsoku being quirkless, she asked, \"Did you get an evaluation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my parents said to wait for something to happen; then get the evaluation. At the time, I was ok with it but now I really don\u2019t know why didn\u2019t do an evaluation.\", Mitsoku said. <i>Wait, why are we talking about whether I have my quirk or not? What about that kiss?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how it should be.\u201d Kodai said. She is standing against Mitsoku, her body pressing against his. Her neutral face doesn\u2019t match what she is saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... How about you come with me? There should be an evaluation clinic near the train station.\", She said. She is being very insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the festival...\", Mitsoku said. He still wants to join his friend and talk about this kiss he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. The festival starts in an hour and the clinic is 10 minutes by walking, faster if we jog. Lets go!\", Kodai grabbed his hand and dragged him along, <span class=\"cnavy\">pulling</span> <span class=\"cgrey\">a</span> <span class=\"cnavy\">confused</span> <span class=\"cgrey\">Mitsoku</span>.</span></div></div>",

The girl standing over you is simply <i>stunning</i>. Her hair was a waterfall of the prettiest periwinkle, reaching all the way down to her knees. Her fair skin positively seeped with life and energy, with not a single blemish to found anywhere. Her face was the perfect mix of cute and attractive, made even more alluring by the enchanting pools of her eyes. Down from there, your eyes caught sight of a plump pair of breasts that threatened to burst free from her uniform at any moment. Wow. Could they be the biggest you've ever... No, wait... Does Mt. Lady count or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were snapped from your trance by a finger jabbing into your forehead. \u201cHey, hey!\u201d The girl said again. Now she was kneeling down right in front of you. She seemed utterly oblivious to the way her bent legs lifted up her skirt, letting you catch just the faintest glimpse of baby blue panties. \u201cI said: \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurning the reddest red, you throw her eyes to the ground. \u201cY-Yeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d You say, and push yourself to your feet. The girl rises with you, coming to stand about half a foot shorter than you. Her sparkling eyes drilling into you was starting to make you nervous. \u201cS-Sorry about bumping to you like that. I was lost and wasn\u2019t paying attention to where-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine!\u201d The girl interrupts with a dismissive wave, before pressing a finger into her cheek. \u201cAre you heading to the Cultural Festival?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, you nod. A gigantic smile springs to life on the girl\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame! Well, actually, I came from there, but I\u2019m going back now!\u201d She sprang forward, almost making you step back as her face stopped only a few inches away from yours. \u201cI can take you there! Name\u2019s Nejire Hado! What\u2019s yours, what\u2019s your?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you would find the girl\u2019s seemingly endless curiosity intimidating if she wasn\u2019t so adorable and charming. You swallow down the nervous lump in your <span class=\"cviolet\">throat</span>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">W-Well</span>, <span class=\"cviolet\">Hado-chan</span>, <span class=\"clteal\">I'm</span>\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You scrapped your chin a little too. What happen? First, you were running through the crowd like an idiot and then you had almost ran into someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you thought you were running into someone. But it almost seemed like you passed through them when you fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor real tho, are you ok?\u201d A voice came from behind you again. It sounds... like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and are surprised by the appearance of a hot girl, crouching a little with interest expression. \u201cY-yeah. I\u2019m ok.\u201d You said. You brush off your knees and rub your chin before looking up at the hot girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl is 161cm tall (guessing) with an hourglass figure. She has fawn hair, a type of blond hair, and dark brown eyes. She has a weird looking hat with an S on her head and a collar around her neck. She wears a black... body suit(?) with a zipper going from her breasts to her pelvis. Wow, that bodysuit is tight... <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://foxglove.paheal.net/_images/e63bc95f5fd3259843a5eb13db2714f7/2727484%20-%20Camie_Utsushimi%20My_Hero_Academia.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">https://foxglove.paheal.net/_images/e63b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That zipper... it ends right where her pussy is. I wonder...\u2019 You began thinking but your mind quickly trails off. You aren\u2019t even aware that you are just staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t even notice how long you\u2019ve been sitting there till she spoke up. \u201cUm, look fam. You are cute AF, but you have been sitting and staring at me like a Stan. Are you sure you are ok? Or...\u201d The girl said using slang. Her left hand traveled down her body as she was talking, keeping a steady eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling embarrassed, you quietly got on your feet. \u201cOh, sorry. I... I was thinking of something.\u201d You said in your defense. What is that bodysuit for? Why is she wearing it? Who is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled in the cutest way. \u201cAre you thirsty?\u201d Her right hand is grabbing her hat, like if she is saying hello. It was only slightly but her mood and interest in you shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really getting it, you replied \u201cUm, yeah. I guess I am. But...\u201d The Culture Festival...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head. \u201cNah fam. No buts here. I have special permish today and I could some Bae\u2019s and BB\u2019s to get mad lit! I can cure your thirst and mine real quick, bro!\u201d She said some real weird things and grab your hand. With excitement that you do not know where it came from, she pulled you through crowd in a great hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are left confused. W-what just happen? What about going to U.A. to meet your friend? Some random girl just... you are not sure what happen. You could try pulling away but the girl is shaking her hips as she walks in a way that... um, what were you thinking again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, wait. Who are you? What\u2019s your name?\u201d You asked, as the both of you walked through the crowd. You were able to momentarily break the hypnotic spell her butt was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl slightly turn her head towards you. \u201cM name is Camie. Just your average highschooler. What\u2019s yours, BB?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBB? <span class=\"cyellow\">Oh</span>, My <span class=\"cyellow\">name</span> is...\u201d</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Finally! A quirk of your own! Perhaps you have what it takes to be a Hero! Or, feeling a little angry at the world, perhaps you should be a villain. Do what you want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I\u2019m betting you would do that anyway. Let\u2019s be honest, you came here for the girls and the boys to be in... 18+ situations, you naughty pervert. Though, I\u2019m personally here for the girls. Oops! Welp, I gave away my preference. Well... Go forth! Carve your destiny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, I had the gender ambiguous in the first page. You can decide what the gender is for the main character when continuing on with the story. I did this so the protagonist doesn\u2019t have to be stuck as a boy right from the get go. But the quirk has to stay the same. Body manipulation. Pretty OP, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, I do have rules for you. Just so we can keep a... \u201cdirection\u201d for this interactive story. Fair is fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1.</b> The setting of the story must take place in the world of Hero Aca. It would get too confusing if the characters are transporting to some island in One Piece. Not that I have anything against One Piece nor is there really a need to put this rule down but I just have to put it out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2.</b> Sex is allowed. F/F, F/M and M/M are all allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3.</b> Gore is not allowed. Death is. Confusing but I have an out there example that, ugh, I saw on the internet that I\u2019ll tell in a sec. Death is allowed and characters bleeding out, getting bullet holes through the chest, or detailed digestion in a stomach, breast, or penis, is fine. What is <b>not fine</b> is fucking a severed head. Yeah, it exists out there. So, I\u2019m taking a firm stance on that. But that is an example of what I wouldn\u2019t allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>4.</b> <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Now, the question is what can the boys do? Well, the girls can have anything be done to them. The boys not so much but I will allow the boys to shrink (of course) and vore. After all, they are the ones who can do the cock vores. I get giddy at the thought of Uraraka curled up like a ball in Bakugou\u2019s belly. Not that I ship them... ok, maybe 5% I do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Boys can be shrunk, vore, and have sex. Girls can do anything.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctober 2018 me no longer agrees with April 2018 me. Boys can have anything done to or by them like the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5.</b> Try to have at least two paragraphs for an entry. Two sentences for making more choices. I\u2019ll look over your work to see if I can correct any mistakes, like spelling errors. If you mess something up and like to change a bit of it, email me. I\u2019ll try my best notice anything and fix it. Or delete if it\u2019s really bad. Though, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll come to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6.</b> At this point, you are probably asking is this just for porn. No, it doesn\u2019t have to be. You can make a legitimate story. In fact, I encourage it! It is the reason I allow death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>7.</b> Eri and characters like her... I\u2019ll be watching to see if anyone goes too far. That being said, I don\u2019t mind her handling tiny people and being naughty. Or same-size voring people or getting vored herself. It\u2019s the normal sex part that I\u2019m iffy about. It is the Internet and it\u2019s just fiction... I haven\u2019t made my mind up on that. I guess it\u2019ll come down to the way it happens. Please email me your thoughts about this if you have any ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Expansion Quirk</u> <br>\r\nThis quirk allows the user to expand or shrink any body part of themselves or anyone they touch. <br>\r\nThe user expands the chosen body or body part, by taking in air molecules and transforming them into the need atomic matter to fill the gap that are made when they stretch out the space between particles. <br>\r\nThe user can shrink himself to up to a 100th of their current size by condensing particles within their body, this allows them to move quicker but also be able to punch as if they were their original size. The user can also shrink others just by touching them and expand their bodies or body part as long as they are within.<br>\r\n(<b>These details were thought up, and written by, Slime-J. A fellow writer on Writing.com.</b>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Note:</u><br>\r\nSince the series is still going, there will be more names coming later on. So we need the <i>more option</i> open for more characters coming in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs.. that all? I hope so. I don\u2019t want to impose too many rules that could restrict  creativity. If something more needs to be addressed, I\u2019ll edit this page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, why are you still here? <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/confused.png\" alt=\"*Confused*\" title=\"Confused\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Go on.

The My Hero Academia: Expansion Quirk has reached to 2,000 views! Thank you for your curiosity. I hope you continue to enjoy this interactive! It is currently at 33 entires, all had been made by me, and will continue to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust/15/2018<br>\r\nHooray! My Hero Academia: Expansion Quirk has reach to 7,072 views! Again, thank you very much for your curiosity. I have far more content now than I did three months ago. 66 entires. Most of them I made but I did have two others make some chapters too. Which I very much enjoyed having. I wonder what future chapters will hold.</td>",
