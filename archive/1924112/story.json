You sat on the couch desperately trying to reposition yourself when your dad noticed the tent in your pants, \"Going camping son\" he said jokingly.  You just about passed about from the embarrassment when your dad asked you if you'd like to join him for a quick shower, you sat for what felt like ages before you finally managed to say yes as calmly as you could.  As you and your father walked towards the bathroom your father peeled his clothes along the way in about 5 seconds he was stark naked, and man oh man was it a sight to behold.  You'd never really seen your father completely naked before, sure you'd gone swimming and seen his bare ass here and there, but this was something else entirely he was simply the most beautiful sight you'd ever witnessed.  Your dad was a good 4 inches taller then you and though he'd been falling out of a regular work out routine lately the man looked like he could bench press a car for Pete's sake.  Then there was his penis, his gorgeous, monstrous, perfect penis, sure you'd seen outlines in his briefs before but the real deal made the former eye candy outlines look minuscule.  Now that it was out for the world to see you could tell this man's manhood had never been challenged and probably never would be.  This penis was an impossible 8 inches long and your dad was only the faintest bit erect.  When you finally reached the bathroom you were so weak in the knees it felt like you'd been walking for miles.  As you stripped for the shower your dad started to seductively say \"You know Mark I've been thinking you and I should get to know each others bodies a lot better.\"  After hearing this you literally fell over, was he serious did your smoking hot dad have a crush on you.  Your dad's next move rendered your last thought moot as he reached out and touched your throbbing boner, right then and there you lost it and came on yourself and your dad.  Then your dad dabbed some of your cum up in his hands, laughed a little, and said \"while I guess it's a good thing we're about to get in the shower.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

By god you felt more like calling an ambulance since he'd obviously hit his head. A shakey \"Uh huh\" was all you managed to reply with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Huff* That's what I thought\" he said sounding awfully downtrodden \"I guess I can just prove it to you\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um whatever it takes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember you asked for it\" you dad said as he took a deep breath and began to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw next nearly made the eyes fall out of your head your dad in all of his naked glory was beginning to grow, you didn't know what to say (not that you'd be able to anyway) as you watched his body expand now growing at a much faster rate.  As his head hit the 10 ft high ceiling he crouched down to pick you up and shelter you as he boosted the potency of the growth preparing to burst out of your family house just as he was once more about to hit the ceiling he stood up in a manner as theatrical as possible completely destroying the home and still growing as he stepped out of the rumble.  \"So do you believe me now?\" he asked you with you literally in the palm of his had. The only response you could muster was a few nods \"Well that's what I'd figured, but now I think I should finish my performance\" he said concentrating and speeding up his growth once more growing at a far faster rate then before becoming so large so fast that in an instant just his foot was larger then what was formerly your home.  He then began walking out of the neighborhood towards the city pulverizing it in the process just by walking, as he entered the city the residents began panicking with a few brave souls trying to stop your father to no avail as he was so large the tallest buildings in town only reached his waist.  Once he reached the center of the city he once more got the look of intense concentration on his face as he prepared for the grand finale, the second his eyes opened once more he began to grow so fast and with such force that he was destroying everything without any movement at all, and just one of the abs on his godly body was far larger then the biggest buildings.  Just when you thought he was done with the show, the cloud line reaching only the tip of his dangling cock and the city only a tenth of the height of his foot, he grabbed his cock and began forcefully pumping it as he crashed down on his back destroying countless other cities while he continued to feverishly masturbate beginning to once again grow this time proportionally with each pump destroying everything with no effort as he panted and expanded while wildly pumping his cock.  When he finally began to orgasm his growth became exponentially with every passing second of the most intense orgasm to ever occur by the time he was done the only reason you could see anything at all was because he changed things so you could see from his vantage point as well as your own as the palm in which you resided was well over the size of a single state his body having annihilated almost all of North America and South America.  \"Now that that's out of the way\" he telepathically said to you \"I think it's time... </span></div></div>",

What are dad and Eric gonna think when they get back? Scratch that I <i>know</i> what Eric will think.\" you internally grimaced at the realization that your brother would probably be an equally big and equally naked idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who cares what they think, they're not supposed to be back until tomorrow anyway right?\" Bud pointed out before he started walking towards the door \"Besides all this excitement makes a guy thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact it was true that no one was home your brain was momentarily launched into panic mode as Bud began to turn the doorknob, your panic was immediately quelled though by the sight of Bud's tail lightly wagging above what was very possibly the biggest firmest bubble butt you'd ever seen. It wasn't until he turned the corner that you were freed from the daze and time seemed to move again \"Jesus Mark get a grip.\" you said to yourself before going to follow Bud to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Bud was clunkily fumbling about looking for a glass until you pointed him to the correct cupboard. After which he got his drink and you both took a seat at the dining table where Bud began to lap at his glass until you again gave him a bit of direction on how to more effectively drink. On his first attempt though Bud managed to spill nearly half of the glass down himself, drenching his massive firm pecs and sending the water trickling down his compact 8-pack, in a mistake that neither of you regretted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to once more rise from your stupor you asked Bud \"So how did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Bud replied unhelpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you have to have <i>some</i> idea though, what did you do today?\" you probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary really,\" he started \"I knocked over the Johnson's trash, I went for a walk out back, and then I came back here-OH also when I was on my walk there were to really shiny looking mushrooms that smelled kinda good so I tried one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dickhead! I always guaranteed Mr. Johnson that it wasn't you.\" to which Bud just shrugged and you continued \"But these mushroom, what did they look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you think that's it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, probably though. What color were they?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, they were gray, that helps a little right?\" Bud said setting down his empty glass triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well it's a start at least,\" you said \"think you could show me where they're at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing\" Bud said making his way to the backdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute! You can't just go out they're naked!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well according to you people will freak out if they see me anyway.\" Bud pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having an answer you caved in and said \"Fine, but at least, I don't know, crouch so no one accidentally spots a 7 foot tall dog man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine you baby.\" Bud said rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you both set out on a brief walk, no more than 5 minutes, before you came across some bizarre pink mushrooms. You made a point to gather them up as quickly as possible and deposited them in a baggy, before the two of you rushed back to the house to hide the \"stash.\" After making sure the mushrooms were safely hidden away you and Bud went to recline in the living room where Bud, apparently fed up with all the pretense of being a \"person\" for all of 20 minutes...</span></div></div>",

This prompted you to give a confused expression as you asked, \"What's up, Bud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much really. Just still can't believe I turned into this just by eating a mushroom.\" The anthro dog replied, before you saw him lift up one of his arms and flex it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so you saw the muscle swell in size which caused you to blush. Sadly this did not go unnoticed by the heavily muscled German Shepherd. Because before you knew it you saw him turn on the couch slightly and then lift up his arms over his head while he flexed and pushed out his huge pecs. Seeing this though only caused your blush to darken in color to which you quickly looked away and off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then attempted to get your emotions in check when you asked him, \"Bud, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you heard the anthro canine let out a chuckle and then felt his arms wrap around you and pull you up against his rock hard abs and huge pecs as he responded back with, \"What? I'm not doing anything that I know you don't like. So I don't see a problem with me flexing while you watched.\" You then felt his hot breath up against one of your ears while he added in a hushed voice, \"But if you want to feel me up, you don't have to ask me at all to do so, Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment made you let out a gasp of surprise since you honestly wasn't expecting your now anthro dog to act like this. However, you let out a sigh of relief when you heard the phone ring. And so you moved away from Bud, who did not protest in any way as you moved away form him and grabbed the phone. But before you picked it up and answered the call you saw the German Shepherd wink at you from the corner of your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you shook your head to the side before you put the phone to your ear and let out, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you had done this you heard the voice of your neighbor, who from the sounds of it had left their house with earlier today on a weekend vacation to some kind of family reunion. However, it seems they had forgotten to ask you if you could stay over at their place to watch their Doberman, Trevor for them while they were gone. But even though it was short notice you told them that it was no problem and that you still had the spare key they had made you from the other times you had watched their dog for them. And after you had ended the call you weren't that surprised when Bud asked if he could come with you over to the neighbors house since he and Trevor had played with each other quite often back when he was a normal dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first though you weren't sure if that was a good idea. But then again at least that way your dad and brother wouldn't find out about him right now. Or if they did you at least hoped it'd be easier to explain the situation to them. And so the two of you made your way over to their house once you had packed a bag with all of your things in it. However, once you had unlocked the door and stepped inside both you and Bud found yourself stopping in tracks when you not only saw that Trevor had turned into an anthro just like Bud had. But the anthro Doberman appeared to be.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing, dumbfounded by the sight before you, the most you could manage was to look over to Bud and hope he had some better understanding, but to your dismay he was in just as much shock as you were staring at the figure Trevor had apparently become. You both stared breathlessly as Trevor slowly lifted a towel to his dripping black furred arms and slowly, purposefully, flexed his mountainous peaks, determined to play up the process for his newly acquired audience. Next he moved the towel to his heaving brown furred pectorals and again began making a show of it, slowly wiping each of the massive muscles whilst playfully bouncing them, before carefully, wiping down each individual ab of his tan 8-pack with a lingering hand. Loving the attention he was garnering Trevor then set his heaving body down on one of the living room's twin sofas and casually discarded his towel, moving to finish this au naturale. Lowering his head Trevor began to lick his enormous tree trunk legs, his tongue deftly gliding over the outer black and inner brown of his thighs. Thinking yourselves in the clear you and Bud seated yourselves on the adjacent sofa, clearly in need of breath, but once you reclined Trevor, with a knowing smile, resumed drying himself openly and proudly running his tongue along a massive phallus that reached nearly to his knee. The both of you, nearly at your wits end, were spared however as Trevor removed his tongue from the tan furred shaft and bulbous pink-red head having decided this enough, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you boys over?\" Trevor asked in a deep gravelly voice before standing and casting a massive shadow above you, the combination of which you were certain would have buckled you had you not been seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining the whole debacle and finding that Trevor had made much the same rounds as Bud you explained that Dave, Trevor's owner, had departed to a family reunion for the weekend and would need you to watch the house for him. This information had caused the briefest carnal glint in both dogs' eyes that both concerned, and deep down, thrilled you. Finishing with the conversation, Bud stood and looked somewhat a mixture of crestfallen and exhilarated upon the realization that he was around eye level with Trevor's nipples, putting him around nine feet tall. With that Bud declared he was going to take a jump in the pool himself, for a while after you and Trevor made idle chit-chat until you heard some sounds coming from the pool that could only be described as, orgasmic. You could barely express your exasperation hard enough at least the fence was high enough so that no one could look in, but my god. To your surprise Trevor seemed rather nonplussed before casually admitting that he'd been in and around the pool earlier for much the same reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening you were mentally spent after a day filled with two wild sex crazed animals posing, flirting, and just doing whatever lewd or kinky thing crossed there minds when and where they felt like it, admittedly it wasn't all <i>that</i> bad having your own private peep show, Bud had made sure you knew just how perfect his ass was by \"dropping\" things all day and you'd suspected Trevor had \"accidentally\" tripped you causing you to fall on top of him. Exhausted, though somewhat pleasantly, you definitely were not feeling at all up to cooking something so you pulled your trusty phone out and ordered some pizzas, hoping that when the delivery person showed up the guys would make themselves scarce. Half an hour later your worst fears came true as the doorbell rang and Bud, indignantly, refused to leave the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why I should have to hide.\" Bud huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because people will <b>Freak. Out.</b> if they see you and Trevor.\" you tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you didn't!\" Bud argued as the doorbell rang again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" you shouted \"Are you dumb? I passed the fuck out when I saw you! Besides I actually care about you guys, but other people will want to do all kinds of tests on you! Or worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor, clearly having had had enough of this, walked over to Bud who, in his limitless pridefulness, prepared to resist the much larger dog. What Trevor did however stunned you, and clearly Bud, as he planted a long fevered kiss on him, placing him in a stupor, before leading him to a room in the back. \"I got him,\" Trevor said \"just give a shout when the coast is clear.\" and with a wink Trevor and Bud vanished behind closed doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful for Trevor's more mature demeanor you opened the door, and a few minutes later, after paying the man and a slightly awkward hand off, you let Bud and Trevor know the coast was clear. Another few minutes passed and you were about to shout out again before being utterly silenced by a roar of pleasure \"Jesus Christ...\" you said to yourself, but before your mind could dwell any further another guttural roar of pleasure rang out through the whole house, this one dwarfing the first by comparison as it all but rattled the windows. \"Why do they have to be like this?\" you asked no on in particular before Trevor exited their room and walked into the kitchen still wearing, to your utter shock, the cumshot on his chest like a badge of honor. \"What do-\" you started to ask before Bud emerged in a similar state, but worse, as Trevor's seed adorned his face, chest, and stomach all offset by Bud's cocky knowing smirk, clearly pleased with the conclusion he'd rought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you both...\" you mumbled as they both went to pull out a seat. \"No no no!\" you said stopping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" they both asked in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go clean <i>that</i> off.\" you told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But <i>foooooood</i>.\" Bud whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care,\" you said bluntly \"Go wash off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if it gets cold...\" Bud said attempting a puppy face beneath the caking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll just have to heat it up.\" you said matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No point arguing further let's go was wash up.\" Trevor said wrapping his arm around Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked at their departing backs you saw Trevor all but take a handful of Bud's ass. \"God I hate them...\" you mumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't.\" they replied in unison, causing you to blush red realizing that <i>of course</i> they'd know just how bothered you were and knowing they must be finding the whole situation riotous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Bud and Trevor had cleaned themselves you all sat and ate your fill, and long after you'd finished you sat in awe of just <i>how much</i> that was for them. When the pair finally finished you found your eyelids growing heavy before you looked out the window and saw just how pitch black it'd become, and all of this crazy days events hit you like a truck. \"Damn, I'm tired.\" you said with a yawn before grabbing your bag and heading to the master bedroom, flanked on either said by a giant anthropomorphic canine as if it were the most normal thing in the world. \"Uh, guys?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we always slept in the same room before.\" Trevor practically cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides what if something happens? We'll be right with you if anything goes wrong.\" Bud said, protective as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly thought about the proposed sandwich and eventually caved, \"Fine, but don't be...I dunno...weird.\" you said halfheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.\" Trevor feigned offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scouts honor.\" Bud said, making some definitely non-scout gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting your bag down and taking a moment to be thankful Dave had such a massive bed you shucked your jeans and crawled into bed, followed directly by Bud and Trevor clambering in next to you. Even in spite of the bed's massive size with the three of you you were all pressed together, but as your brain quietly shut down you allowed yourself to enjoy the warm hardbodies pressing into you as you drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Moving to, well, <i>move</i> you were instead gently stopped by one of Trevor's massive hands, before he gingerly kissed the top of your head. \"Good morning my love.\" Trevor said, his deep bass resonating in his chest and through your body \"Why spoil such a beautiful morning?\" Remaining still for a while longer enjoying the soothing warmth of Trevor, and the heft of his genitals between your legs, you were on the verge of liquefying to no more than a puddle in Trevor's hands until you saw that your bag was gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolting upright, to Trevor's disapproval, you got out of the bed and made for the door with Trevor in tow. \"That idiot!\" you said storming down the hall \"That utter colossal idiot! That big dumb...\" you trailed of as you saw Bud \"...sexy fucking idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before you was Bud, now positively looming over both you and Trevor at 14 feet tall, his head brushing against the ceiling and ears pressed flat, his frame utterly packed with muscles, and a unreal boner that proudly stood straight up, reaching just beneath his pecs. \"Good morning <i>boys</i>.\" Bud said, voice cockily dripping with sexual overtones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You MORON!!!\" you yelled angrily throwing a pillow at him. Bud just stared at you for a moment, wracked with confusion, looking less like a pillar of sexual energy instead resembling something closer to a scolded,14 foot tall, puppy. \"You had <i>NO</i> idea what was going to happen after eating another one of those Mushrooms!\" you continued, on the verge of tears \"What if you were hurt, huh? We haven't got the faintest idea why or how these things work! You could have...you could have...\" you trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how much he'd scared you Bud was instantly hit with a pang of guilt \"I'm sorry Mark...\" he said softly crouching down to embrace you, \"I didn't mean to scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning the hug, you discovered you could no longer reach around him your arms now only made it to Bud's sides. For several minutes you quietly held each other until you felt something large and hot making it's way up your torso. Frankly you couldn't blame him as you were having similar, though less noticeable, feelings with a tent beginning to form in your boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were going to submit to carnal pleasure a floorboard creaked loudly as Trevor moved to take a seated position, causing the both of you to snap out of your mutual haze. \"Aw dammit, I'm sorry boys,\" Trevor apologized, taking a seat on one of the sofa, hard as a rock, \"I truly am, as you can see. You two were so cute getting so caught up in each other.\" he said stroking himself for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing so hard you could almost swear you were on fire, a bit disappointed by the interruption, you asked \"So...um...Bud where did you leave my bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...it's over on the counter.\" he replied somewhat listlessly, clearly sharing in your disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your bag you retreated back to the bedroom to get dressed. After slipping on a new shirt your eyes became fixed on your baggy of bizarre life changing little mushrooms, whilst the muffled voices of Bud and Trevor leaked into the room \"Crazy how something so little caused all of this...\" you said for no one but yourself before returning to the living room. What awaited you was yet another mind halting sight amongst the litany of those from the previous day as you saw Bud and Trevor comparing. For a time you just watched, Trevor would flex, Bud would respond by performing the same flex tenfold, and you would derive a bit of pleasure from his cocky smirk until there comparisons led to the inevitable conclusion of Bud grabbing both his own penis as well as Trevor's and had a literal cock measuring contest. To no one's surprise Bud's was far larger, but Trevor clearly didn't mind being usurped as he remained rock hard and planted a kiss on the top row of Bud's 8 pack. This confused Bud for only a moment before he bent down a layed an enormous kiss on Trevor, clearly whatever ego these two had was no match for their libido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another step into the room and clearing your throat both dogs turned to face you and, to your pleasure, were both proudly pointed skyward. Whatever you were about to say left your mind entirely as you stared lamely, trying desperately to re-wet your lips you proposed, almost automatically, that you should all try and enjoy the pool today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinky...\" Bud said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming flustered you protested saying \"No wait, I just, I mean, I haven't even able to take a dip myself yet.\" Yeah, they should believe that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we can smell how excited you are?\" Trevor asked in his gravely bass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" you internally swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well either way I think it sounds fun,\" Bud said making his way to the backyard \"but it'd be more fun if you would <i>join the party</i> so to speak.\" gesturing to his and Trevor's distinct lack of swimwear.</span></div></div>",

Picking up your bag and beginning to head to the bathroom you were treated to the sight of Bud ducking and shimmying to clear the doorway, forced into a position that was somehow both comical and arousing, his plump well muscled ass jutting out along side his ever present boner that, with a mighty <b>*THWACK*</b>, slapped against the door's frame. Startled by the sudden sound you turned to Trevor, who'd very clearly been enjoying the display as well, and when your eyes met he smiled and made a grabbing gesture with his hands towards your mutual eye-candy that could only be described as, \"<i>awooga</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly as you entered the bathroom you began to disrobe and place your belongings in the bag. Seeing yourself in the mirror you were assaulted by wave after wave of questions and self-criticisms, but the one that rang the loudest was \"What could those two possibly see in such an agent of averageness?\" Having to steel yourself a second time you wrapped a towel around your waist. As you made your way to the backyard you you saw Bud was already in the pool and Trevor had deigned to relax on a, currently rather upset, recliner. Stepping out on to the patio you began to feel your mood lightening just happy to have the company, until Bud, in his infinite wisdom, let out a tactless catcall. Stopping on the spot you turned to go back in the house, but before you could Bud hopped out of the water and grabbed your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't go...\" Bud said, in an unexpectedly remorseful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to turn you started to say \"Not everyone ca-\" but were stopped when instead of looking Bud in the eye you wound up looking him in the dick \"...oh right\" you thought before taking a breath, looking up, and continuing \"Not everyone can be so...so...self-assured...\" you trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, unfortunately, not everyone can be as kind and as thoughtful as you.\" Bud said teary eyed, kneeling to hug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful embrace lasted only a minute before another pair of arms enveloped you \"He's right you know, kid?\" Trevor said \"Any number of people would of probably flipped their lids over all this, but you? You saw us for what we are and even worried over us on top off it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed before Bud let himself up from the hug \"Well that enough of that.\" he said with a sniffle \"Let's have some fun!\" he beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right!\" you said, time beginning to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dogs promptly jumped in the pool, creating remarkable splashes. You followed behind, reaching the edge of the pool and stopping, stealing one more moment to take a deep breath, you dropped your towel and jumped in. Over the course of the next two hours the three of you practically frolicked without a care in the world. Several rounds of Marco Polo were easily won against Bud and as they were far too large to effectively move with immediately alerting you, but <i>somehow</i> you doubted whether they considered you touching them as much of a loss, and frankly you didn't mind it either. After a while the both of them were beginning to slip into their more <i>lewd</i> habits, Trevor was making a grab for Bud's behind whenever the opportunity and Bud, ever the king of tact and poise, was beginning to pantomime blowjobs with anything and everything he could get his hands on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud was now lazily floating in the pool, proudly taking up as much space as he did while displaying himself for anyone to see, and see you did as you got caught up in watching the massive ham. While your attention was diverted though you suddenly felt Trevor's massive body lifting you up out of the water on his massive shoulders. \"Surprise!\" he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to be outdone though Bud stopped reclining and, to his shock, performed much the same move on Trevor \"There's a real surprise!\" Bud said cockily holding both you and Trevor aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" you said almost toppling back as your perch was raised. For a moment you just enjoyed the feeling, but soon realized you and half of Trevor were now above the fence \"Fuck, fuck, fuck Bud put us down!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not even heavy,\" Bud said cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the issue!\" you shouted down the totem poll \"Me and Trevor are above the fence <i>and I'm fucking naked</i>\" you seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine.\" Bud said letting the two of you drop back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hit the water you became once more aware of a disconnect between your body and mind. While your mind was very much panicked your body had clearly found the whole thing thrilling as you became aware of your stiffening boner. Clearly not alone in the realization though, Bud came cutting through the water like a shark after blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding yourself rising out of the water again you realized you were now being cradled by Bud like his tiny new bride, \"You know Mark, me and Trevor would be <i>more</i> than happy to help you with that.\" he said \"Right old man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Trevor chimed in while wiping wayward water from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...I...\" you started. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could answer Bud your phone began ringing \"Um...I really should answer that...\" you said up to Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really have to Mark?\" Bud asked with a pout, his ears drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but yeah.\" you said as Bud carried you to the side of the pool and set you down. \"Damn!\" you internally remarked, even when you were on dry land and he was standing in the pool he was <i>still</i> a few inches taller than you. Going to fetch your phone you couldn't help but quiver, you wanted to believe it was due to the cold air and your prolonged state of undress, but deep down you new damn well it was neither cold or an ordinary quiver, were you really that much of a size queen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnswering the call you were greeted with your father Chris's voice telling you he and your brother Eric would be home in about twenty minutes. \"Well shit...\" you said after hanging up. Making your way back to the patio you began to explain the situation to Bud and Trevor, but were interrupted when you noticed that both of their gazes had homed in on your crotch with a laser like precision. Becoming flustered at this you quickly grabbed your towel, wrapping it around your waist, and began again \"So Trevor me and Bud need to head back home,\" you explained \"I texted Dave and he said he'd by home soon as well. I didn't really know how to tell him about...all of this, sorry for leaving you in the lurch a bit, but me and Bud have to deal with this at home as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I completely understand.\" Trevor said \"I'm sure I'll be able to explain the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well...um...just some advice, but it may help if you put something on beforehand.\" you offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor looked sagely for a moment, as if he had just discovered fire, before he admitted \"Yes, that may be for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering your things and bidding your farewells you and Bud made your way home, taking care to go unseen, preparing to try and explain the inexplicable. Unfortunately there really wasn't anything big enough for Bud to really wear so you had to make do with convincing Bud to, begrudgingly, wear a series of towels like a skirt to at least conceal himself. Instructing Bud to sit and wait in the living room while you tried to head off your father and brother and prepare them as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that could have gone better.\" you said to Bud with a sigh, somewhat worn down after the grueling explanation. Your father and brother having both turned in early to try and make sense of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it went all that bad,\" Bud said \"Eric seemed to like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Eric likes having a huge naked person around the house? I can't hardly believe it!\" you feigned. \"Dad for one clearly wasn't thrilled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he'll get used to it.\" Bud said, standing to stretch after sitting on the couch for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your right...\" you said, just then there was a knock at the backdoor. Telling Bud to once more remain out of sight while you figured out who it was, you made your way to the back of the house. Slowly opening the door you found Trevor standing alone in the dusk, crammed tightly into a pair of sweatpants, holding a piece of paper, and appearing disturbingly downtrodden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I come in?\" Trevor asked, in a raspy voice, face clearly stained with recent tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of-Of course!\" you stammered gesturing him in, deeply concerned over Trevor's current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the devil himself had planned it, Eric chose this particular moment to poke his head out from his room and jabbed \"Let me guess, this is your other <i>boyfriend</i>?\" You severely doubted your brother had actually meant anything more than to poke fun with his remark, but regardless this was absolutely <i>not</i> the time for this shit and you made damn sure he knew it by shooting him the \"bone-chilling-est\" gaze you could muster. \"Fine...whatever,\" he said ducking back into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you lead Trevor into the living room Bud began to greet him saying \"Long time no...\" but was silenced by his friend's all but broken demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting Trevor down you asked what had happened to which he only responded by handing you the note. Quickly taking in the small message that had made such a massive impact you were shocked to find that Dave had flat out rejected Trevor and left him behind. Apparently he was willing to let Trevor stay in the house, but whatever solace that brought him was dwarfed by having lost the most important person in his world. After passing the note to Bud the three of you just sat in silence for a moment unsure what to say, if there even was anything to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken though when you said \"Well I don't care what anyone says, you're staying here tonight. I absolutely will not let you be alone tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Thank you,\"</font> Trevor said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...umm...Bud you could probably bunk with Eric or something.\" you offered, realizing you'd just misplaced him for the night.Surprisingly Bud was more than willing to be a good sport when the chips were down and simply nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you showed Trevor to your bedroom Bud made his way down to Eric's door and cooed \"<i>Hey roomie!</i>\" and in a flash Bud was all but pulled in to your brother's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closing behind him you caught the briefest glimpse of Bud's bare ass and wagging tail as you feared you may have just created the very thing you feared yesterday. \"Whatever, that's not important now. What is important is that I comfort Trevor!\" you told yourself. Entering your own room you found Trevor was already cocooned amongst the sheets, uncharacteristic of the self-assured <i>daddy</i> you'd just spent the weekend with. Closing the door behind you and putting out the lights you climbed in to bed as well and were immediately scooped up by Trevor as he embraced you in a hug with zero intention of letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully the night seemed to pass without any further incident, there had been the odd sniffle from above your head throughout the night but that was only natural. As you and Trevor awoke you could at least feel some worth emanating from him again. \"That was as good a start as any,\" you thought, but as if you'd jinxed something with that single thought Trevor abruptly got out of bed. \"What's the rush?\" you asked confused and concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you M.ark, but I have wasted enough of your time,\" he said making his way out of your bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even respond he'd already shut the door and entered the hall. Springing into action you gave chase, but when you opened the door you saw he was already retreating out the backdoor, headed back home. \"Damn it,\" you swore in futility, \"If only I'd...\" but there lay the big issue, you didn't know what to do. Getting dressed you decided you and Bud could at least go and keep Trevor company, it wasn't much but it was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing down to Eric's room you began knocking on the door, only to be meant with faint murmurs. Knocking again this time Eric opened the door just a crack, wearing only Bud's towel, and said \"Jesus Mark where's the fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Bud have something to do,\" you said trying desperately not to look at <i>anything</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll tell him. Now buzz off for a minute,\" Eric said shortly, slamming the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed before your brother emerged clad only in his boxers and jauntily walked off towards the bathroom whistling some unknown tune. A few minutes more and Bud came out rubbing his ass and said \"Jesus Mark your brothers a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>T. M. I.</b>\" you said sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, I forgot you're a big ole baby,\" he teased \"It's just after all <i>that</i> he's totally unfazed and I, more than twice his size, feel like I've been through the wringer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bud, what the fuck did I just say,\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok <i>sorry</i>, so what's the big rush?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor,\" you said, becoming more solemn \"He just rushed out of here this morning and I think we should go check on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Bud said instantly becoming more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way next door you and Bud found Trevor sitting, alone, in the dark, and slumped. Briefly he brightened at the arrival of his friends, but an invisible weight came crashing down on him all over again. Not sure what to do you finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

Once this happened you then found yourself blushing when you saw nothing but the heavily muscled dog's huge pecs in your line of sight. However, you were determined to try and help make the anthro dog forget about his pain as you looked up at him and suggested, \"Hey Big Daddy, could you do me a favor and lower your head a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Mark.\" The buff Doberman softly replied, while you saw a small smile form on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found your blush darken in color when you saw Trevor lower his head down to you to which you leaned upward until both of your lips met in a soft kiss. Or at least that's what you had planned at least. But it seemed the anthro canine had other ideas as he deepened the kiss after a few seconds had passed and pulled you as close to his huge body as what was physically possible. This caused your eyes to widen in surprise at first as it felt like he wanted to keep you in his huge arms and never let you go. But you quickly recovered along with mentally sighing in relief as it seemed like doing this was exactly what he needed to feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the kiss between the two of you was quickly broken when you......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your embrace was short lived as before long you and Trevor became acutely aware of some particularly fussy whimpering. Breaking the kiss you and Trevor looked to the massive German Shepard occupying the other couch and were instantly <i>very</i> aware of what Bud wanted as he gazed back at the two of you, eyes full of lust and member openly erect. \"You know,\" Trevor started, voice regaining it's past bravado, \"daddy's got more than enough for both his boys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning bright red you were enveloped in a heat that you swore threatened to burn the house down, but before your conscious mind could protest, always fighting the unending battle against all things immoral (and fun), Bud pounced on the both of you. As you lost the entirety of your breath, sandwiched between two godly canines, Bud began where you left of with Trevor. Kissing deeply for a moment before a brief pause, desperate for air, \"No <i>boys</i> around here,\" Bud said breathily \"or <i>pups</i> for the matter <i>old man</i>.\" before returning to making out, apparently forgetting you were also beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this <i>old man</i> still has more than enough tricks for the likes of you,\" Trevor retorted when they next paused to breathe. Before resuming the however Trevor heard the muffled cries of someone, blissfully, being crushed. \"Oh my God, Mark!\" he said as both dogs stood and freed you from your idyllic prison. \"Are you alright?\" he asked, bending to sit on his knees to better inspect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than alright,\" you said between gasps of air. \"Not everyone is so lucky to be crushed by such beautiful companions,\" you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know, the kid is just as bad as he is,\" Trevor said playfully pointing back at Bud. The tension in the room had none the more dissipated from the attempts of humor as the three of you were now, each as hard as the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if attempting to cut through the tension with a rock Bud said \"So...like...we still gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" Trevor cooed, and, still sitting on his knees, wagged his barely contained rear at Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad move old man,\" Bud said, once more pouncing after his prey, behind Trevor now he deftly inserted two claws in to either side of the waistband of his victims sweatpants. With a final agonized tearing sound the pants fluttered to the floor as Bud took hold of Trevor's black and brown furred behind, his cropped tail wagging furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a labored groan from Trevor, Bud inserted himself, nearly to the hilt, in to the much smaller. Brain long since fried you weren't sure what to think as you began to walk away, thinking they required privacy. Before you could leave however Trevor grabbed you and said \"Nngh...where do you think...ugh...your going...mmpf?\" As the pain began giving way to pleasure Trevor began speaking more clearly, words now only interspersed by pleasured moans \"Daddy said he had enough for both of you...mmm...and he meant every word of it,\" and with a blinding flash Trevor pulled your pants of and wrapped his large mouth around you member. Now it was your turn to moan incoherently as the Doberman expertly pleasured your head whilst the German Shepard thrust away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Trevor only moments to bring you to climax as you loudly groaned through the best orgasm of your life. Not missing a single drop Trevor gave you a sluttly look before he gleefully swallowed down every once of your load \"Daddy's a thirsty boy you know Mark,\" he said while teasing your still sensitive dick, \"Feel free to give me more anyti-ngh\" and with that you realized Bud had clearly struck gold as Trevor began cumming. Shot after shot sprayed against the floor for what felt like a minute until Trevor finally ceased, panting and overcome by the pleasure, leaving Bud to finish. When you looked up to him you saw his face contorting as hips began bucking with a wild speed until, the most carnal roar, he came inside Trevor. Shot after shot and roar after roar rang out as Bud continually thrust for an amount of time the made Trevor's climax seem brief until he finally pulled out, but when Trevor allowed himself to relax Bud loosed one final, massive, shot against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you, now panting with exhaustion, collapsed in a heap on the living room floor. For several minutes all any of you could manage was simply to breathe until you finally managed to ask \"Feel any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely...\" Bud said cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you dickhead...\" you managed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, definitely...\" Trevor said, before bending to kiss the top of your head then turning to kiss Bud's nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving asked your question you could feel your self drifting to sleep, now completely spent. Feeling you go limp in his arms Trevor simply smiled before he and Bud took you to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke you felt...pleasantly drained, before remembering what had taken place earlier in the day \"...oh yeah.\" You then realized you were only wearing your shirt \"Figures <i>those</i> two wouldn't think to grab my pants...\" you said to yourself.

The reason this was because it would seem that Trevor was cooking. And not only, but he was only wearing an apron over the front of his body. This gave you a view of his huge and wide back along with his two large and muscled buttcheeks while his short tail swayed form side to side as the huge Doberman hummed quietly hummed a tune to himself. However, you quickly looked away and looked back for your clothes. To which you found them and quickly put them back on only see Bud standing off a few feet away from you while he flexed his huge arms, pecs, and abs in front of a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to blush even more and right when you turned away from the huge German Shepherd you thought for sure that you saw him wink over at you. Although you figured you were just seeing things as you walked over to Trevor and asked, \"Hey Trevor, do you need some help setting up the table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had uttered these words though you saw the huge Doberman turn slightly to face you before he leaned down and kissed you on the right side of your face when he replied, \"That's sweet of you, Mark. But let Big Daddy handle everything. So please go sit at the table since the food is almost done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you did just that. To which upon doing so you knew for sure that Bud had looked over one of his huge shoulders and back at you. You then saw him wink at you again before he bent over a bit and lifted up his huge tail thus giving you a good view yet again of his larger backside. Although within a few minutes you heard Trevor clear his throat when he told Bud, \"Okay pup, enough flirting since it's time to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiinnneee...\" Bud slightly pouted, before he also went over to the table. But unlike you and Trevor who were sitting in the chairs, the German Shepherd just sat down on the floor. To which then the three of you enjoyed the food that Trevor had made.

Monday had gone extremely well with Trevor cooking an...interesting...meal, at least he'd enjoyed making it, not to mention the more <i>extracurricular</i> pursuits in the living room. Tuesday had been quite similar to Monday in as much as you were surrounded by two nude hornballs again and Trevor had apparently decided he was now going to play the chef...at least he was practicing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWednesday was when the ties had to begun to unravel somewhat. Arriving back at Trevor's, having gone out on a shopping run to restock the shelves, you returned to find Bud frantically running around the house like a 14 foot toddler playing keep away with Trevor's apron, much to the Doberman's disapproval. \"Hey, HEY! Knock it of you yelled,\" at the pair as they both slowed to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bud stopped to look to you Trevor snatched his apron back and angrily muttered \"Fucking idiot\" under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor!\" you snapped, something was clearly wrong for the normally mature one to be behaving in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you call him a dickhead all the time,\" Trevor retorted like a petulant teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud's ears and tail had long since began to droop as his heart felt like it was being kicked, \"...I'm sorry...I didn't know you were so mad...\" Bud sheepishly confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well-\" the Doberman started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well nothing,\" you interrupted \"Bud may have messed up, but I hardly think your tone is justified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Trevor said, storming of to a spare room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked to Bud, who still looked as if someone had just harpooned a puppy, and told him \"Don't worry I'm sure he's just got a lot on his mind.\" Jesus Christ, a few days ago your live was normal and now you were trying to manage with two giant dogs that were still just kids-err puppies at heart. \"...what the hell even is this shit?\" you pondered flopping on to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, when Trevor finally reemerged, he apologized for his shortness and explained he still had a lot on his mind. Naturally you and Bud understood, Bud knowing how hurt he'd be if you'd left him and you remembering the fear of rejection when you'd first came out. Mercifully, Trevor wasn't in the mood to cook, and frankly neither were you so the three of you simply ordered out and watched a movie together, but throughout the whole evening Trevor seemed distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday had been even worse as the Doberman seemed to only be missing a cartoon rain cloud as he moped around the house in another pair of, what would otherwise be comically undersized, sweatpants. Now Friday was here and the three of you had just finished lunch when Trevor moved to go be alone for a while. Bud had, in a bid of desperation, began awkwardly hurling pick-up-line after pick-up-line, but Trevor wasn't interested in a single one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do Mark?\" Bud asked with a sigh, saddened to see his friend so despondent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure,\" you admitted \"I think he just needs more time. After all it's not like there's some crazy miracle drug for this sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Bud's ears perked straight up, moreso resembling horns than ears, \"...good idea,\" he muttered walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you just stared at his broad back as he departed, tail wagging with a vengeance, \"I didn't...\" then realization hit you like a ton of bricks \"No, no, no,\" you said giving chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud however had made it to your room first and fished out the familiar baggy from your things \"Gotcha!\" he declared as he removed one of the little miracle spores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, fruitlessly, clambering over the German Shepard on a mission, you attempted to snatch the little mushroom from his hands \"Come on Bud the is a bad idea!\" you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedlessly forging on Bud came to the guest room Trevor was in and yelled out \"Hey Trevor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan Trevor rolled over and began to address his uninvited guest when a large paw jammed something into his mouth. Now hacking Trevor demanded with a sputter \"What the hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Bud grinned.</span></div></div>",

But while they happens you take a hold of one of his growing furry hands when you told him, \"Come on Trevor, let's get you out of the house, before you accidentally destroy the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" The slowly growing Doberman let out, as he followed right behind you after Bud had moved out of the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so once you had gotten to the backdoor you weren't super worried about Trevor getting out since he appeared to be the size as Bud was which was that of 14 feet in height. However, upon making it outside, you let out another gasp as you saw that the anthro Doberman hadn't stopped growing at that size. And in fact it looked like he was getting even bigger then what Bud had been at. This was made very clear as he grew up to the height of 18 feet. But beyond that all of his muscles seemed to have been growing as well since his eight pack looked like all of the abs could cut stone. Along with that the black and tan furred pecs of the Doberman looked massive as they pushed in and out with his breathing. His arms looked huge and yet you knew that Trevor wasn't even flexing them at the moment. And once you had moved your gaze to his legs you saw that his legs looked huge as well and even his feet had somehow ended up in the pool due to the increased size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you slowly moved to the now giant anthro canine's front. You did this in a attempt to ask Trevor if he was okay. However, right when you were going to do this you found yourself blushing a deep shade of red when you saw how large the Doberman's ball and currently soft member had gotten as the tan furred sack sat on the ground slightly. However, it never touched it to the increased size of the dog's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut pushing those mental images to the side you looked up at the Doberman's face while you asked, \"Trevor, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the now 18 foot anthro Doberman look down at you before he replied, \"Yeah, don't worry Mark, I'm okay.

Bud was constantly trying to sneak by and get a piece of Trevor forcing you to stay vigilant for hours, however around dusk your problems seemed to double when Trevor's will and good sense began to wane as, what seemed like every five minutes, you had to remind him to take his hand off of his dick. When the sun finally, mercifully, fell you yourself were begin to wear as you noticed Trevor, now laying down, possessed a boner that was, when bolstered by the height and girth of his rear and waist, was as tall as yourself. Hell that thing was probably around half your height on it's own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark now providing some much needed cover, you gestured for the both of the dogs to follow you to your yard. \"Let's go,\" you said softly \"and Trevor don't forget to try and tread lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Mark,\" he said with a nod, trying, carefully, to adjust to his new stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you made your way around to the back window, your father's window, and you lightly wrapped on the wind, \"Dad? Daaad?! CHRIS!\" you finally yelled as loud as you dared to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mumble and some shuffling your dad came to the window, clad only in boxers and a ratty old shirt, clearly having been asleep moments ago. \"What the hell are you doing back here?\" your dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's kind of a long story...but...uh...Trevor come here,\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking as much care as he could Trevor, impressively, glided over to the window and, a bit nervously, said \"Um...hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see Trevor doesn't really fit in his house anymore, and I don't really know what we should do,\" you explained, admittedly fishing for your father, a harbormaster, to proffer a warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I don't...I don't really know what to say...\" Chris trailed off unhelpfully, a tent beginning to form in his boxers as he stared at the colossal Doberman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to ignore your father's <i>interest</i> you tried again, more boldly saying \"If we just had somewhere to go...like I don't know...a giant apartment...or a warehouse...or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally taking the bait your dad, snapping out of his trance a bit, said \"Well there's that old warehouse we don't use anymore...I guess you could stay there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow really?!\" you feigned, almost heaving at your terrible acting skills, \"Thanks so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the three of you began your trek to the pier Chris stopped you and said \"...I'm...I'm not really good at this sort of thing...but just...just be careful alright? <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I love you...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit at what, for your dad, was a total heartfelt moment \"R-right, thanks. I love you to,\" you responded in farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a mad dash to the warehouse, dodging from shadow to shadow, the three of you reached the your destination. Approaching a large rusted shutter you grabbed hold and tried to pry it open, but couldn't budge the entrance and inch. Next Bud and Trevor each grabbed hold and surprisingly, much to the benefit of your pride, the door continued to give resistance as they slowly pulled the old shutter open. Entering the space you turned an old knob and for a few minutes the lights hummed before illuminating the large room. Finding a large collection of tarps and sheets you deposited your things and fashioned a makeshift bed. Collapsing in a heap you said \"Jesus that was stressful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again,\" Trevor said sitting down, \"after all that I haven't had time to *<b>ahem</b>* <i>enjoy myself</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back up you noticed Trevor was harder than diamonds, great, when your gaze shifted to Bud you saw he was in much the same state, of course he was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mark, it's been a <i>long</i> and <i>hard</i> day,\" Bud prodded, \"Let's have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking stock of yourself for what felt like the first time in ages you found you...</span></div></div>",

After clumsily fumbling with the defiant trousers for a moment you finally pulled them and your underwear off, and with a triumphant throw tossed them aside \"Go to hell! The both of you!\" you vengefully cursed the garments. Amid your trials you had briefly forgotten you were very still much in plain sight of Bud and Trevor. Looking to the pair of them you realized you'd very much lost the initiative when you saw Trevor and Bud had very much already \"assumed the position,\" Trevor was knelt on the floor before Bud who was, ever the pinnacle of subtlety, laid back on the ground with his legs on Trevor's shoulders and his ass raised. You soon became aware of the fact that, despite their positions, the two had very much just witnessed your little outburst when you noticed both were grinning at you with tails wagging. \"If either one of you says a single word about all of that you both die,\" you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiine, just <i>hurry up</i>,\" Bud whined, more than ready for the coming encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, so...uh were do you want me?\" you asked lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right back here,\" Trevor said giving his plump ass a shake, \"best seat in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Bud interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, <i>biggest</i> seat in the house,\" Trevor amended \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much,\" Bud said with a smile, geez he was proud of ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you said ambling around Trevor's huge legs and nervously mounting an enormous pair of cheeks, each half your size, \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hours ago,\" Bud replied and with that he loosed a prolonged moan as Trevor began inserting his thick length into the German Shepard. Taking that as the starting shot you moved to make the same motion on the colossal Doberman before you, the large black and brown cheeks gleefully at your mercy. You'd begun penetrating the behemoth and were, perhaps unrealistically, disappointed not to elicit the same reaction. Daring to go further you plunged in as deep as you dared and were met with the whole of Trevor's body being enveloped in a satisfied quiver, jackpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fifteen or so minutes were spent in a haze of lust, moaning, and grinding as Trevor rhythmically pounded away at his fellow canine whilst Bud managed to moan like someone who receiving the most pleasurable torture of his life and you simply did your damnedest to stay involved, more than once needing to fight the urge to release, as you experienced an exhilarating thrill thrusting wholly into Trevor as he thrust. The dam eventually burst starting with the Doberman as with a swift motion and an audible pop, Bud's hole now freed from it's suffering, he roared like never before and unleashed a torrent of seed upon the smaller dog's stomach and chest. Seconds after the Shepard moaned loudly while spraying shot after shot onto himself to join in Trevor's coating. Hearing the carnal sounds of completion you finally caved yourself and pulled out the prodigious ass before you and began dotting it with your climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you simply breathed for a time before you said \"Everyone feel a bit less pent up now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" the pair of dogs nodded, still trying simply to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving, more or less, regained your composure you clambered over Trevor's legs and moved to \"survey the wreckage.\" \"That color suits you,\" you told Bud admiring the thick coating he'd received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...ha...forget what I said about Eric...phew...apparently you're the real monster,\" Bud panted \"He may be a tall drink of water...heh...but you just made his recovery time look slow as shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a weird pleasure in the weird complement you next stood in front of Trevor and eyed just how low his low-hangers hung \"You sure daddies all out?\" you asked, buoyed by some confidence you never knew you'd had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...Definitely...\" Trevor barely managed before collapsing on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can attest...\" Bud said before letting his head fall back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClambering atop Trevor know, still nude as the day you were born, you began to nestle your head into his chest then said \"If you don't mind I might sleep here tonight,\" laying across his torso with a pectoral pillow, \"tarps are so last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be by guest,\" Trevor said finally regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mark! What about me?!\" Bud asked, bouncing his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing personal,\" you assured him, \"you're just a bit...ah...<i>wet</i>.\" To which Bud stuck his tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Mark, after all that and seeing how much of a closet perv you can be it's no wonder Bud's so <i>forward</i>,\" Trevor joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" Bud said plainly, before laying down with and snuggling next to Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fuck you,\" you said playfully slapping his pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to break it to you kids, but you both already have,\" he cooed, before kissing Bud on the cheek and you on the head, \"Goodnight Mark, goodnight Bud,\" and with that the three of you drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning your eyes gradually fluttered open followed by your ears by greeted to the sound of Trevor still calmly snoring beneath you, the only one out of place was Bud who...</span></div></div>",

Your heart melted slightly hearing such a pure suggestion from the big horn dog, \"Then we can jerk it to take care of these bad boys,\" he said, wagging his hips and \"swinging his sword\" like the giant doofus he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know for a second I thought you were being romantic...\" you chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could be more romantic than two hotties getting off?\" Bud asked, completely bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you said \"Whatever, let's go.\" Taking care to quietly open the shutter just enough to slip out you and Bud swung around the back of the warehouse and sat down on the pier's edge, momentarily soaking in the burgeoning sunrise. \"Do you think we'll be saaaaaahh,\" you were interrupted as Bud's powerful paw gently enveloped your freestanding member. \"Phew, wait a sec Bud,\" you told him, to his chagrin, \"Do you think we'll be safe out here? Like, what if someone see's us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude we're <i>behind</i> the warehouse. Unless someone's got x-ray eyes they're not gonna see us.\" Bud reassured \"Now can we?\" he asked making a crude jerking gesture with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you affirmed, resisting the urge to roll your eyes, when abruptly Bud leaned over and engulfed the whole of your exposed member in is eager maw. Caught somewhat off guard you were unable to do more than tremble with pleasure and shamelessly moan, which only served as further encouragement, as the enormous canine's tongue flitted and danced around you head and shaft. After what had seemed simultaneously an eternity and an instant you could hear yourself practically scream as you climaxed into Bud's greedy mouth as he hungrily swallowed every last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and licking his chops as you tried to regain your composure Bud surmised \"Alright then time for this bad boy,\" grabbing hold his attention starved length as it eagerly dripped with pre. The instant you'd found your breath Bud's paws hooked beneath your armpits as he lifted you atop himself before laying down. Finding yourself now in a position where sat along the Shepard's groin and lower abdominal you lowered your behind so that your cheeks straddled Bud's length as his pulsating meat throbbed against your back. With one hand on his member and the other on his \"master\" Bud began a steady stream of moaning as you leaned forward to lay upon his torso, hands grabbing for every inch of masculine bulk they could find. With one hand now stroking the canine's abs and the other massaging his right pectoral you felt Bud's pumping begin to uptick in speed as he pulled himself enough to recreate the initial straddling moment and sandwich his cock as furiously worked it against his palm and your back. Finding an ever blossoming confidence with each encounter you enveloped his left nipple with your mouth and, much to his pleasure, all but made out with it before in another burst of sordid inspiration dared to bite pushing the canine over the edge. Bud's howl was so loud and so long you would have been stunned no one came to inspect the disturbance if you weren't mentally occupied with the continuous volleys of seed that painted your back in what felt like enough to literally choke five horses, let alone one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time you just lay on your sexpot of a pillow, but before long the cum that now marked you had begun to go from \"sexy new look\" to \"cold uncomfortable mess\" so you arose and dove into the water. Moments later you emerged sputtering like a moron, having forgotten it was very much salt water, and Bud helped you back up on to the pier. \"You really are some kind of monster,\" Bud said, standing and gesturing to the hard member that jutted from your loins despite the earlier release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad dog!\" you said playfully before spanking the tremendous ass that now stood in front of you as you both made your way back to the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know bad dogs <i>like</i> that sort of thing...\" Bud teased before receiving a slap on his other cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief trip back gave you a moments reflection to ponder if your really were the family freak. After all you'd always assumed it was your brother, but by Bud's account you outpaced even him. Plus he was just horny where as you now, despite being pure (and unfortunately virginal) a little over a week ago, found yourself living in a lusty stupor with both your's and your, former, neighbor's dogs, anthropomorphized as they may be. Well if freakishness was what it took to surround yourself with drop dead gorgeous hunks than freakishness it would have to be. You were drawn out of the contemplation though as your mind decided to give prudence to focusing on the two bouncing spheres that plodded along juicily before you with a bushy tail contentedly wagging, damn he really did have a nice ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping back in and sliding the shutter closed you and Bud found Trevor still snoring away, though now with a \"little problem\" of his own as his erection stood tall and proud.

Or for the two huge anthro dogs, if they even got hungry anymore that is. And so you got dressed, even with the slightly ruined jeans. This made you a little worried of what people might say or the looks you'd get while shopping for food. However, thankfully your shirt was long enough to where you didn't have to worry about anyone seeing the ruined front part of your jeans. Plus you did bring a belt, so that would help the issue as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so once you had gotten dried off and dressed you put your wallet into your pocket and started to head towards the open door to the warehouse. But before walking outside you looked over at Bud and told him, \"I have to go get food. So I'll be back in about an hour or so. So please don't do anything reckless while I'm out, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to your surprise you saw the huge German Shepherd waved a dismissive hand at you when he replied, \"Don't worry, I won't do anything wrong, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, sure.\" You muttered, to which you then left the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed until you made your way back to the warehouse after buying enough food that would last you at least a few days. Besides you knew if you needed more you could always go back to your house and get more money or something. However, once you had entered the warehouse and set the bags down by your things you saw that your bag that had the mushrooms in it was missing. This caused you to turn around and see on the end of the room both anthro dogs who were now awake. But one of them was clearly bigger now. And upon a closer look you saw that the anthro canine who had eaten a mushroom to grow was in fact......</span></div></div>",

At a loss for words you began walking toward the 36 foot tall Doberman, his body heaving with more than a trace of addition muscle and his cock, in contrast with his stern look, pulsing with pleasure not only from the mushroom's aphrodisiac effect, but what appeared to be additional length on top of the growth. Neither of the dogs had noticed your return as you approached them, clearing your throat before attempting to sound as \"in control\" as possible, despite being around as tall as Trevor's shins, \"Ahem! So...uh...Trevor, you enjoying yourself?\" you asked, attempting to don your best \"disappointed father\" look despite both dogs being, at least biologically, more mature than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mark, your back,\" Trevor beamed down at you, your return momentarily casting aside whatever was previously irking him. \"Maybe you should ask numb nuts here what happened,\" he proposed placing a massive paw atop Bud's head to hamper the German Shepard's escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what he's talking about,\" Bud said indignantly, though not so fussed to keep from letting on that he not only knew exactly what had happened, but was directly responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Buuudd</i>,\" both you and Trevor pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...You were gone so long...and he wouldn't wake up...so I...well...\" he said sheepishly before nodding to Trevor's hulking form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? That's why you thought it'd be fine to slip Trevor another one of those mushrooms and jeopardize the safe haven we literally <i>just</i> got?\" you said grilling the German Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was <i>sooooo boooorrrrrreeeddd</i>!\" he griped, clearly his boundless energy more than hampered his better judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You were bored? That's why you did <i>this</i>?!\" Trevor asked accusingly, not so much mad as annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like you hate it!\" Bud retorted \"You're totally boned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well the mushrooms would do that even if I didn't like it,\" Trevor snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? You just said you like it! Now let's take care of \"lil' Trevor,\" Bud said making a move for the thick 10 feet of daddy dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, nah, nah, if you're gonna keep doing this without my permission you don't get to reap the rewards,\" Trevor said, easily pushing aside the smaller canine. \"And as far as you're concerned his name is \"<i>big</i>Trevor,\" he corrected. For thirty or so seconds the room was silent until Trevor looked down at you and, with hand on the back of his head and a slight look of embarrassment in spite of being in full control, asked \"So...Mark, would you help me deal with this old thing,\" while holding his enormous cock and waving it around in a gesture you were helpless to refuse. \"I know it's way too big for you and I probably wouldn't feel you around back anymore, but I'm sure we can think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" Bud interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, but I believe I said you're not invited,\" Trevor stated matter-of-fact, and with a sulk Bud turned to find a corner to go fume in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Actually I think I have an idea...</font>,\" you said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Trevor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...umm...I...think that...you're big enough now...that...I...could maybe...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">fit...in...your...</font>,\" you trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Mark? Just come out and say it,\" Trevor encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to stick his dick in your dick!\" Bud shouted from his corner, causing you to turn bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Mark...\" Trevor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-sorry! It's crazy! And It'd be to tight! And, and, and,\" you babbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down there champ,\" Trevor said as he knelt down before you, \"I never actually said no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...you would...\" you fished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, after all daddy is a big boy,\" Trevor eagerly beamed, \"Just be warned that when daddies had his fill you're gonna get hit by the brunt of his love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm okay with that,\" you admitted as you started to peel your shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then show your daddy what a little freak you can be,\" the Doberman teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I can just as easily not,\" you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry, daddy is just excited,\" and with a loud thump his dick slammed into the floor, eagerly awaiting the stimulation.</span></div></div>",

And by the look of the huge member you saw laying in front of you made you go hard yourself as you also saw his huge balls underneath the huge black colored member. And even though you knew what you wanted to do with your big doberman daddy, you had something else in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you carefully climbed up the huge anthro canine's right thigh and then leaned up against his lower abdomen. Upon doing this though you saw Trevor look down at you with a confused look on his face as he asked, \"Mark, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I figured we'd have a bit of foreplay before getting to our fun.\" You answered back, with a big smile on your face. You then rugged one of the abs as best as you could before you added, \"So if you could, could you please lay down for me, big daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to your surprise you heard Trevor let out a light chuckle before he softly responded back with, \"Of course, anything for my favorite boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after this was said you saw and heard the huge doberman lay down onto to his back. And once he had done this you slowly made your way up the giant anthro dog's large abs until you were below his two huge pecs. And upon doing this you found yourself reaching out and rubbing the bottom part of the right pec before you noticed his large nipple. This caused you to get an idea into your head as you pushed yourself up onto your tiptoes and started to lick the large pink nipple. And upon doing this you heard the heavily muscled doberman moan in pleasure. Along with this you heard and saw the anthro dog's huge arms move down and then take a hold of his huge member before he started to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he did this you removed your lips from his nipple and told him,\"Oh big daddy, I love how big your muscles are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had uttered hose words you saw Trevor bounce each of his pecs as he commented, \"I know I do. But all of this muscles is for you, Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so during this time the two of you spent the rest of the time together complementing each other while you rubbed the doberman's huge muscles before you found yourself in the canine's huge mouth to which you found yourself being both licked and sucked by the giant of a doberman daddy while he rubbed his huge member. And right after a few more licks form Trevor you let out a loud yell as you released your load into his mouth to which he gladly sucked and swallowed within an instant. Right after he had done this you felt Trevor's lips hold you in place before he released his own load all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while you were gently placed in-between the two massive pecs of the anthro doberman once both of you had calmed down from both of your climaxes.

It's weird enough trying to maintain control when these dogs are giant sized the last thing you need is to try and do it hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud then walked back around the corner, pinching the baggy he'd swiped for your backpack between his fingers, his erection having payed no heed to his apparent disposition as it still throbbed angrily, complimented by a pair of low hanging balls that were nearly audibly churning with need. His \"scolded puppy\" appearance though soon fell away when he notice that you had a forming semi \"If I knew you wanted them that badly I'd have got them sooner,\" Bud teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you said flatly, as his large powerful fingers dropped the bag into your waiting hand. \"Now both of you turn away I've got to find a new place for these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand the pup, but why do I have to?\" Trevor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry this is gonna be top secret,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" Trevor said rolling his eyes, before turning on his side to face away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come ooonnn,\" Bud complained, \"Do I have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> absolutely have to,\" you emphasized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine <i>mom</i>,\" he said turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you couldn't help but return to staring at Bud's behind, and you suspected he knew as much if his wagging tail was anything to go on. However once you regained your composure you found a sufficiently dark corner that you could tuck the bag in, stealthily hidden behind some leftover detritus. \"All right you can turn around,\" you said after returning to the center of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor lazily rolled back over, but when Bud turned around you saw a fat drop of his...eagerness fall to the floor before you and he proposed \"Okay Mark, now that that's all through can we deal with all this freaking horny side effect stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>literally</i> did that to yourself numb nuts,\" Trevor pointed out, \"Why should Mark help you out if you're making the problems yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe Mark is nicer than you yah old fart,\" Bud retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Mark would like to speak for himself,\" you chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but I can tell that you want to...you little monster,\" Bud said pointing out that in the exchange your dick had gone and gotten itself hard of it's own volition, again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

Clearing your throat to regain his attention you asked tiredly, \"So, you think we can do this, maybe ya know, tonight? It's been a helluva a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!

Overhead you heard the fainest murmurs from the German Shepard before you caught a glimpse of his large claws come down to scratch his nuts, again wonderful, this in your mind proved he clearly had less than <i>no</i> idea of your predicament.

When you came back you were holding a box of comically large playing cards you'd bought when you'd went shopping, figuring that despite the fact for you they would be extremely unwieldy to use, each being nearly as wide as you, for Bud and Trevor they'd, at the time, be just a hair too big, frankly now after all Bud's handiwork they'd probably be <i>just</i> big enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playing cards?\" Trevor said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to shock you Mark, but considering until last week we were ordinary dogs we don't really know any games,\" Bud chastised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine I'll show you a few before I go,\" you assured them, before doing just that teaching them a few basic games like war, go fish, and old maid, and heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fifteen minute walk you were back at ground zero as you unlocked the front door to your dad's house. \"Hey dad, you still home?\" you called out despite knowing the answer from his truck still being here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, that you?\" your dad responded, still sounding a bit drowsy as you realized you may have just woken him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dad, I just needed a few things and figured I'd drop in,\"  you lied, well half lied, you did intend to grab another change of clothes, but mostly you just wanted to assure your dad that all was well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chris first emerged from his room he projected, to your surprise, a strangely beaten look, however you soon realized that was probably your fault as most parents probably weren't prepared to have their children randomly leave one night out of the blue. Thankfully after you chatted for a while you successfully convinced your father that you were happy, tactfully omitting all the <i>extracurricular activities</i> that took place, with your new \"roommates,\" as he referred to them, and he seemed to brighten up, finding contentment in knowing his son was happy. For another twenty minutes your father caught you up on the goings on in his life as you both just shot the shit for a while, however once you realized the time you decided it'd probably be for the best to head out and relieve Bud and Trevor from their suffering. Saying your farewells and even receiving a hug from your, otherwise emotionally cryptic, father you found that...</span></div></div>",

And when you looked over to the right side of the warehouse you saw the large deck of cards neatly stacked in a pile. But once you started to walk into the warehouse you saw both of the huge anthro dog's ears twitch and then saw them turn to look at you with happy and relieved now expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as they walked up to you the giant Doberman was the first to greet you when he said, \"Hey Mark, glad that you're back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because playing cards was boring!\" Bud whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to let out a heavy sigh before you looked up at them and replied, \"Yea, I'm sorry about taking so long. But I think I've got an idea that both of you will like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what might that be?\" Your anthro daddy asked, with curiosity clear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking the three us could leave this warehouse and go camping out in the woods.\" You explained, as you lifted up the bags. You then added, \"Which is why it took me so long since I was busy getting everything that we'd need. Well what I'd need at least since you guys are way too big to fit inside a tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh! Camping sounds interesting!\" Bud responded, with excitement clear in his voice. You then saw one of his huge paws come down and then get in front of you when he went on with, \"So get on my hand and let's get going already Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, to your surprise, you saw Trevor gently took all of the bags away from you and then place them into Bud's waiting paw. You then found yourself being picked up as well before you found inside the giant Doberman's huge paw like hand. Along with this you saw your bag of clothes and the bag of mushrooms in the giant canine's hand. However, when you looked up at Trevor's face he put a finger up to his lips, obviously he didn't want Bud to find out that he found where you had hidden it. You then saw him look over at the huge but still smaller German Shepherd when he said, \"Sorry, Bud. But you'll be hanging onto Mark's bags. I'll be carrying Mark so that he doesn't get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not fair!\" Bud whined, with his ears down on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seemed Trevor's mind was made up as he replied, \"Nope Daddy doesn't want to hear it, pup. So let's get going, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Bud let out, as the three of you left the warehouse and headed into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about thirty minutes or so until the three of you came into a clearing in the forest. The two giant sized dogs then set you and all of your things down to which you then got to work setting up your own personal little campsite. This took you about another twenty minutes or so until he let out a sigh of relief and smiled at how you had everything set up. However, right after you had done this you heard a noise coming by a nearby tree where your things had been placed. And when you turned around you saw.....</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, this being the dead of summer, none of you could make out a single thing through the exceptionally thick brush, as the sound drew nearer...and more quiet? The phenomenon was truly confounding as the crashing was clearly becoming more defined, but simultaneously less intense until it out and out stopped. Moments after the commotion ceased though a grizzly bear, in much the same state as Bud and Trevor, came walking through the underbrush. He was moderately muscular and sported a youthful face you guessed would be maybe 16, definitely no more than 17, if he were human. Though when he drew closer two things stood out, his unmistakable \"male-ness\" as a soft dick that dangled to his knees in front of two nuts that could be mistaken for a pair of bowling balls, and the fact he was strikingly short, no doubt he'd still be able to rip you apart like damp tissue paper, but he was noticeably shorter than yourself at what you guessed was 5'6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup,\" he said in a voice that, while not cracking, confirmed your suspicions about what his age would have been as he nonchalantly walked up to you and the two giants without a trace of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi...\" you replied unsure just what to think, as were Bud and Trevor. \"Was, was all that noise...you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah yeah, but it's no biggie,\" he said, all but brushing aside the question. \"Who are you guys?\" he asked while looking the three of you over, eyes particularly lingering over Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Trevor,\" the doberman said plainly, unsure what to make of this new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bud,\" he answered, eyeing the bear just as much as he'd been ogled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Mark,\" you chimed in, \"We were setting up our camp when we heard you. But if you don't mind me asking how were you causing all that noise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a giant like them a little while ago,\" he said nonchalantly gesturing to the canines, \"well actually I was <i>way</i> bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...were?\" you wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah,\" he said moving to sit on a log, \"Can't they do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" both Bud and Trevor answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, I remember eating a ton of these blue little mushrooms then I was huge, like I would have been able to carry both of you in one hand,\" he explained, gesturing to both dogs, \"Then I just suddenly realized I could change my size so I tried it out and it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair,\" Bud pouted, \"That would've been <i>sooooo</i> fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Bud, no use crying over spilt milk,\" you said, easily imagining the chaos someone so imprisoned by their whims would cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could still have plenty of fun,\" the bear said standing and beginning to grow. His wiry muscles inflating as his height rapidly rose until he matched Bud's size. \"Truth be told I think you're hot as hell,\" he said, inviting his hands to glide along Bud's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Could you two hold off for a second? I mean we don't even know what to call you,\" you interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care, you decide,\" the bear said before nibbling at Bud's ear and eliciting a moan from the German Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Ted?\" you proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me,\" Ted replied, \"By the way, Trevor, if you want me to help you hook up with Mark a little better while me and Bud get better acquainted I'd be happy to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean...\" Trevor stammered, embarrassed at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean you could...grow me to?\" you asked, cautiously hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. But I get the feeling that I can change the size of anyone whose had one of these crazy mushrooms before,\" Ted explained, \"and my last premonition was right on the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You wanna shrink him?\" Bud asked, ears drooping, \"But he's so hot when he's all big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could change him right back you know,\" Ted said in an attempt to console Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's actually important what I think,\" Trevor chimed in, \"I say go for it. Then I'll be able to...uh...better help Mark set everything up,\" the daddy said tripping over himself uncharacteristically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you kids have fun,\" Ted said before putting his hands on the doberman, causing him to shrink until he was his original 9 feet tall. \"Now, me and you have some fun to get to,\" the bear said as you and Trevor watched what could possibly be the two horniest beings alive, a pair of dog and bear, wander off to do whatever kinky things entered their horny heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they walked off you suddenly felt something lightly hit the back of your head. \"Ted, really? Is that the best you could do?\" the doberman teased after a playful swat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I think it fits him,\" you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's neither here nor there,\" Trevor said grabbing your hand, \"Now that we're closer in size, I think your daddy needs to finally get a slice of that behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly,\" you said shucking clothes until you were just as nude as each other. \"Now show me what daddy can do,\" you provoked as you both entered the tent.</span></div></div>",

And it also helped that Trevor only kept the kiss locked for a few seconds before breaking it. You then found yourself letting out a gasp of surprise when you felt his huge tongue run along with right side of your neck.After doing this you felt him kiss it a few times before he moved down your chest and to stared to do the same for that body of your as well. You even felt yourself groaning out in pleasure when he gently and carefully pinched and rubbed your two nipples until they were both hard. However, when when his hands slid down your stomach and sides you felt yourself letting out a giggle as it tickled you a little. Although this seemed to be the response that Trevor wanted as a big smile formed on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you felt one of his huge hands gently stroke your member and then take a hold of your balls you groaned out in pleasure even more. You then were about to say something, but before you could you saw Trevor easily engulf your entire member into his huge muzzle like mouth. You caused you to moan out even more along with a gasp of surprise when you felt the anthro doberman's other hand reach underneath you and tease your hole with one of his fingers. Although this along with Trevor's continuous sucking of your member and constant rubbing and playing of both your balls and backside was too much for you as you yelled out in pleasure and shot your load into his mouth to which you heard him milk you dry and then swallow it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to lay on the ground panting in the afterglow as you felt him remove his hands and muzzle from your body.

It didn't take a rocket scientist to deduce the cause, but as the shaking increased in intensity you and Trevor decided it'd be best to be back outside the tent where you could more easily react. When the flaps did fall back as you marched out you were immediately greeted with one of Bud's gigantic paws plowing through more and more of the trees, uprooting them with ease as he continually grew. The sight was nothing short of breathtaking as Bud lay on his stomach, at <i>least</i> a solid hundred feet tall, continually leveled the area while Ted, roughly the size of the German Shepard's butt, was thrusting for all he was worth and with a tool that was now twice as big as the bear himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching with mouths agape you and the doberman simply enjoyed the show as Bud loudly moaned with the pleasure of his beloved ass being destroyed be someone so much smaller, though to the both of you he was still be a giant. Despite having came only moments earlier you could feel your groin stirring with eagerness as your blood boiled, it was time to face facts, you really were an unrelenting size queen. It didn't take long for Ted to begin bucking and his colossal member began spraying seed relentlessly into Bud's hole until he finally pulled out, but not through yet he began to shoot constant ropes of cum upon his back as well before his erection shrank to something more proportionally in line with himself. Bud, not to be outdone, rolled on to his back with a tremendous thud after grabbing his new admirer, then placed the bear on his own throbbing penis. What ensued was Ted grappling, hugging, and, kissing an erection his own size until, with a deafening howl, the German Shepard erupted. Shot after shot was loosed from the giant coating himself, Ted, and several of the remaining trees in a fresh white paint of his jizz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an unabashedly servile moan your knees buckled as simply watch this unfold had caused you to come to climax for a second time in only a matter of minutes. \"Whoa...damn...\" you said between breaths, laying back and feeling the grass against your bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor then sat next to you in the grass with sigh, \"Well that was unfortunate,\" the doberman pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Trevor?\" you asked while rolling to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was made apparent though before Trevor even spoke his mind \"It's just not fair we had to be interrupted,\" he pouted, sporting a still throbbing penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, that's not really a problem,\" you started to move to get back up, but Trevor sat you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mark, even if you aren't spent I don't want you hurting yourself or something,\" Trevor explained, \"Besides they kinda killed the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist, but to each his own,\" you said before curling up and laying your head in Trevor's lap as Bud and Ted finally began to snap out of their afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was spent just finding fun things to do like hiking and swimming until sunset came, you'd even deigned to stay just as nude as the animals for the day, after all on the off chance someone found you your nudity would be the last thing on their mind. Ted had shrank back to his 5 foot 6 inch self, but Bud had vehemently protested against being shrunk to anything less 80 feet tall and Ted was all to happy to oblige. Now with the orange hues becoming gradually darker as night encroached you'd all settled around a campfire and began telling, or rather attempting to tell, ghost stories as you roasted marshmallows. Bud, seated with his legs encircling the whole of your campsite, told a <i>terrifying</i> story about how \"this one time their was this guy who wanted to get layed, but he never did ooooo.\" Unsurprisingly this only scared Ted, but you could almost swear you'd heard the faintest snort from Trevor. When it came to your turn you drew a blank until you realized that, having been animals, none of these guys would know the first think about cliches so you decided to let loose. To your pride it was three masked men, two hooked hands, a call coming from inside an abandoned orphanage, and one butler later when you'd successfully managed to scare each of them, at least to some degree. Deciding this was enough though you were all getting ready to retire for the night, Bud and Ted were going to sleep under the stars, the canine being the bear's enormous mattress, while you and Trevor returned to the tent.</span></div></div>",

The real reason was because after giving to some thought last night you knew that considering what powers Ted had the four of you could easily go back and live in Trevor's house like how you and the two anthro dogs had done when this all started. Besides if they wanted to the four of you could always come out here again or go away from the city and have the anthro bear grow himself and the two anthro dogs in truly massive giants of anthro beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so after your huge Doberman daddy woke up you got dressed and then began to pack up to which he gladly helped you do so. Once everything had been packed up you looked up and saw that Ted had grown to the same size as Bud was and the two were currently making out. This caused you to shake your head from the side to side with a smile on your face as you called out to them, \"Hey, can you two lovebirds stop making out for a minute and shrink back down to your original sizes for a bit. I have an idea that I want to tell all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had said this you saw the two break the kissing session as Bud looked down at you and whined, \"Fiinnee.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which the both of them shrunk down and then all three anthros stood around you as Trevor asked, \"Okay Mark, what did you want to tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since we have Ted here you guys can pretty be at any sizes that you want. So I was thinking the four of us could live in Trevor's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a house you say? Sounds interesting.\" Ted confessed, with curiosity clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's not a bad idea at all actually.\" Trevor added, as you saw a small smile form on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.... But when I want either one of us to get huge then we're heading out here okay?\" Bud asked, now with big puppy eyed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright it's a deal Bud.\" You told him, to which you were quickly wrapped up on the German Shepherd's huge arms and held up against his huge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't last long though as Trevor walked up to him and chuckled before he said, \"Alright pup, you'd best let my boy go before you accidentally hurt him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this you were quickly let go by the huge dog to which he apologized to you. After that was said and done the four of you made your way back to Trevor's house after Ted had grown the Doberman up to about sixty feet. And due to his increased size it didn't take you that much time to get back to the neighborhood. Although once you were close enough you made sure your Doberman daddy was shrunk down to a more normal size as to not cause any panic from anyone. And so it would be easier to get back to the house. To which that happened within ten minutes of carefully walking in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then unlocked the front door and put all of the camping stuff away.

All you really managed to fashion was something vaguely resembling beef stroganoff over a bed of pasta and covered in some, admittedly, lack luster sauce, but your companions were hardly as critical of the dish as you were as Bud and Trevor happily scarfed down the meal and Ted, a literal carnivore through and through, inhaled his portion before trying and failing to bum some of Bud's meat off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it grew late, everyone tired from both a long weekend and a bit of lethargy, the four of you turned in for bed, you and Trevor in the master bedroom and the boys in the guest room. \"Oh God \"the boys,\" you thought as you got ready for bed, \"I sound like an old woman.\" Stepping out of the bathroom and back into the bedroom you saw that Trevor was laying atop the sheets and eyeing you like a piece of candy, as his penis helpfully let you know in what direction the sky was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mark I was thinking,\" the doberman cooed, \"we <i>still</i> haven't had a chance to get good and intimate, just the two of us, and I was hoping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank a little at the realization that you were about to deny Trevor yet again, but you just <i>did not</i> have the energy. \"Uh...I'm sorry to do this to you...but I'm really tired...like <i>really</i> tired. The only reason I'm not asleep right now is because I'm still standing up...I'm sorry Trev...\" you apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry,\" the doberman said as he sat up, \"It's been a long day and I'm a big boy, I can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis understanding and acceptance made your heart melt and wish you could give him what he wanted right here and now, \"Thank you,\" you said with a warm smile, \"<i>daddy</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, please stop,\" Trevor joked, but you could sense was also semi-serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but soon, I promise,\" you said climbing into bed, and with that Trevor brushed aside loose strands of your hair and kissed you on the forehead goodnight. The last thought to cross your mind before promptly falling asleep, held tight in the doberman's powerful arms, was how lame you must have sounded \"Not tonight honey I'm tired, let's just watch Carson and go to bed,\" time to break out the extra thick bifocals and knitting needles I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning you awoke with a distinct lack of nine foot tall dog wrapped around you, so after relieving yourself you ventured out into the rest of the house, still wiping sleep from your eyes. What you found was Trevor sitting in an armchair, crammed comically into a tiny, on him, pink bathrobe he'd found, reading a newspaper, and sporting some morning wood that clearly refused to go anywhere, completely exposed as the robe he'd somehow fit himself into could neither be closed around his brawn and only managed to drape down to his torso before bunching up in a useless pile of cloth. \"Uh...good morning Trev,\" you said somewhat clumsily, a bit lost for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" he chipperly smiled back at you, \"Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" you answered, \"Uh hey, when you grabbed that paper no one...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Mark, it was dark still when I grabbed the paper, no one saw me,\" he assured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well good, it'd be bad enough if people knew what happened to you guys, but it'd be down right weird if someone saw you with...uh...<i>that</i> as well...ha...\" you nervously chuckled, pointing your thumb at the roughly foot and a half pillar of doberman meat. \"So, you want some coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har har, and yes that'd be nice,\" Trevor answered returning to his paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were fishing for mugs the door to the other bedroom opened and Ted walked out yawning and idly scratching his gigantic nuts. \"'Sup,\" he greeted you plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey Ted,\" you nervously replied, not quite used to now also living with a bear that had the genitals of someone at least quadruple his size, \"You wanna try some coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game,\" the short guy said taking a seat at the breakfast nook and occasionally watching you, but mostly just yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you were bringing Trevor and Ted their beverages before sitting with Ted and asking \"So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit harsh, but it's not to bad I guess,\" he said looking into his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lots of people find it a bit overwhelming at first,\" you replied, \"By the way is Bud still sleeping in your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed laughed a little at this before saying \"Well yes and no. He's still asleep, but he's not in the bed,\" he then tugged at his collar of dense fur and revealed that there was a tiny naked German Shepard snoring away in his fuzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god he's gonna be so <i>pissed</i> when he wakes up,\" you chuckled at the bear's antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's he gonna do,\" Ted smiled \"Besides he was too cute to leave alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little while longer Bud slept as you and Ted just sat on the floor, having moved to the living room, eager to surprise the minuscule canine. The both of you were looming over Bud's tiny form, eyes practically bulging out of your heads as you both got your eyeballs, that would now be gigantic to the canine, as close to the floor he now lay on as possible. Predictably when Bud did wake up and saw he was about the size of your iris he nearly crapped himself in surprise. After you and Ted spent about fifteen minutes rolling around the floor cackling at Bud's displeasure the bear finally returned him to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You assholes!\" Bud fumed before stomping off outside to sit by the pool, and inadvertently only prompting you and Ted to start laughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the joke finally got old Ted got up saying, \"Well I better go see if the big baby is alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember if he won't stop pouting all you have to do is start talking about his butt,\" you laughed, eager to squeeze every drop you could from the prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know it,\" the bear said with a play wink as he stuck his tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up yourself, you found it reassuring how well you were getting along with the new addition to your group, and you couldn't help but feel happy for the future when you saw that Trevor had been secretly smiling away behind his newspaper and giant, still fuming, boner. Heading back to your room to get dressed a though crossed your mind as you pulled on your shirt \"What if Trevor's erection wasn't morning wood, what if he'd been boned ever since last... OH GOD What if he's been pent up since the other day! Fuck, when me and Trevor do get a minute alone I'm gonna die...but it's not a bad way to die. Ok, shut up Mark,\" you told yourself before leaving the room.</span></div></div>",

He was chasing Ted who would now barely pass above your knee, and yet still, you notice with an inward groan, has you beat in size between his legs. As much as you enjoyed the company of your new bear friend, his unexplained ways to change their sizes was a little unnerving. Of course, Bud wouldn't purposefully do anything to damage you or the house, you hope, but remembering the sight of his growing paws tearing up trees in the forest like they were leaves of grass in a meadow you do start to wonder, what would happen if Ted grew him that big in the backyard... Or what if Bud found a way to control sizes too, he's not been the most responsible dog so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CANNONBALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're taken out of your thoughts as a wave of pool water splashes against you, drenching your clothes entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" You shout turning towards the pool, finding Bud looking at you sheepishly, on his knees on the bottom of the pool and his head is still at least a couple of inches higher than yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I guess I don't know my own size!\" Bud chuckled clearly already in a better mood and leaned in towards you, his wet fur accentuated his incredible physique and he knew it only too well as he could sense your frustration turn to arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach slowly, reaching a hand out to touch his pecs Bud let out a loud yelp as his entire body suddenly jerked upwards a couple of feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing face to \"face\" with his chest didn't last long as he moved up again in another sharp jolt. He didn't seem to get much bigger, just moving further and further upwards. Soon you were staring straight at a sheath the size of a kitchen paper roll firmly nested in the crevice of two lightly fuzzy balls the size of honeydew melons, they, in turn, were being held aloft by the head of Ted who had decided to come out of the pool as well, in a dramatic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear let out a low moan as his body stretched up and out, growing bigger and bigger in front of you. Even seated Ted now looked down at you, carrying Bud on his shoulders like a puppy. The bear wasn't nearly as muscular as either of the canines but he was more than a little imposing as he finally stopped his own ascent at roughly 30 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt you little lovebirds, but since someone decided to give up the chase, I got a little bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed's lower body had displaced so much water that it overflowed from the pool edges, concealing the bear's no-doubt oversized assets in wavy refraction. It felt so tempting to just dive in there... No, you had to be stronger than this. They had to know you were in charge. \"Ted! I told you guys to not get too big around the house!\" You whisper-yelled at Ted to not draw attention to the huge German Shepard hoisted fully above the tall fence surrounding the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not Mark? I'm not breaking anything and everyone really seems to like it\" Ted winked and looked down at your straining erection. \"Why don't you just have some fun with us?\"</span></div></div>",

Knock it off!\" you cried out as your drenched shirt went past your head, \"I can fucking do it myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that were true I wouldn't need to do this,\" Bud teased, pulling down your pants and boxers in one fell swoop, exposing your erection for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, for a couple of guys who claim to want to fool around, you're doing a marvelous job of changing my mind,\" you huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be that way,\" Bud cooed before kneeling down and gently blowing in your ear, eliciting all kinds of involuntary quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, I've got an awesome surprise for you,\" Ted added, even though you could guess what the <i>surprise</i> was. Predictably his <i>surprise</i> then began cresting through the water's surface and continually rose, like the unwieldy monster it was. By the time the <i>little</i> display was over the bear's cock loomed both preposterously wide and enormously tall, as thick as Bud and a head taller then its owner. \"I think it'd be fun if you boys got acquainted, or in Bud's case better acquainted,\" Ted said confidently, his penis dribbling a constant flow of pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you can read my mind you kinky weirdo,\" Bud eagerly said before approaching the massive organ, and dragging your dumbfounded self along with him, \"C'mon Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands were attracted like magnets to the overgrown schlong as you and Bud simultaneously made impact with the beastly creature, your nude bodies pressing against a cock powerful enough to force the two of you back. Ted moaned deeply, the pleasure of two men no bigger then the erection they worshiped filling him with nigh indescribable pleasure as your bodies were drowned in the bear's overwhelming musk. It wasn't long before the Ted's own paws joined in the pumping creating a blind flurry of limbs, flesh, and fur that was drawing ever closer to it's inevitable conclusion as not a one of you could keep the tongue in your mouth any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith harmonious cries you and Bud succumbed together upon Ted's throbbing, aching, member, you merely dotting his colossal pride with your seed as Bud unleashed far more potent shots. The creme de la creme came shortly after though when the enormous bear loosed a deafening roar that, to your chagrin, could undoubtedly be heard throughout the entire neighborhood. As he roared his mountain of meat erupted with a barrage of cream that utterly painted the side of the house with his abundant sperm along with drenching both you and Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aftermath of the escapades was something to behold as the shingles dripped heavily with the bears jism while he shrank back down and climbed out of the pool. \"Well that was fun,\" Ted said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, real fun...\" you said trying to shake your arm clean, pleasure somewhat forgotten in the face of your discomfort as you made your way back inside to shower. \"Look will you two at least clean this up a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, fine,\" Bud said as he waved you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoy yourself?\" Trevor asked when you passed him, voice dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" was all you bothered to spare him as you storm of to the shower, naked as a jaybird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne sufficient scrubbing later, and yet another change of clothes, you were back out in the living room. Thankfully the guys were cleaning as you'd asked, but they seemed to also be playing with the hose and acting like idiotic over the top wet t-shirt models for some inexplicable reason. Well you weren't about to try and dissect the lunacy of two giant weirdo hornballs anyway as you...</span></div></div>",

Opening the door, with a knock to make your presence known, you called out \"Guys, I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like a charging bull your father came stampeding out of his room, clearly eager to see you after yet another stretch of radio silence. Your brother was clearly less enraptured by your presence as he followed your dad, trying to maintain an air of disinterest despite the fact he was clearly coming to see you, brothers sometimes. \"Mark! How the hell are you?!\" your father asked in yet another uncharacteristic fit of compassion as he hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoggy was probably the wrong answer so you just smiled and said good before turning to Eric and saying \"Good to see you too bro,\" which he predictably responded to by casually flipping you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while the three of you just caught up, pleasantly talking about anything from work and the weather to some of your groups antics, with some <i>censorship</i>, and how much of a colorful character Ted was. Once more your dad surprised you with a level of understanding you hadn't expected when you came irrevocably to close to spilling the beans on what you'd done with Bud and Ted this morning and he just took it in stride, Eric however nearly sprouted horns. In retaliation you decided to tell him in front of your father that you were sure Bud would be happy to see him again, for more than a couple reason, spilling some of his own beans for him, and appropriately the red from his metaphorical horns went straight into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sufficient amount of teasing you assured the both of them you'd be able to spend much more time around home now, but decided it'd be best to leave out the part where Ted could freely manipulate their sizes as the reason. Grabbing a few things from your old room before heading you decided to venture a question. \"Do you guys...uh...What would you think about me bring them all over for dinner tonight? O-or we could do it over at Trevor's,\" you quickly amended, \"I'm sure we have room if that works out better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne awkward pause that seemed to make eternity look like around a minute and a half later your dad called out,\" Well I-I'm pretty busy, but we'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you fucked it up now Mark,\" you couldn't help but think as you wished farewells, \"Of course it's gonna freak them out! It's not everyday you just go <i>Hey dad wanna have dinner with me and my three boyfriends? One of which would biologically be older than you, and the other two would probably just start making out during the meal. Wait, why are you running?</i>\" Were they your boyfriends? Whatever, it was complicated all the same because if this did happen you now needed to get yourself and the others prepared on top of everything. \"At least we have a pool, maybe I can drown myself if this turns out to be a colossal shit show,\" you pondered.</span></div></div>",

And even though it took some time to convince Bud to put said clothes the German Shepherd eventually did so, but only after the anthro bear had pointed out to him how the clothes would show certain \"assists\" that the big dog had.

Once this happened you heard both Bud and Trevor let out yelps of surprise. Although this wasn't a concern to you as you looked into the place you had hidden the bag and saw a lone gray furred rat now lazily laying next to the bag that had the remaining mushrooms in it. This caused you to let out a gasp of your own, which in turn caused the rat to look up at you a squeak in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this happened you saw the changes had already started to take a hold of the small creature as it's limbs and body stared to change until they were more human in shape. And before you knew it the now anthro rat had taken up the entire space of the box the bag had been in. And even this did not last long as you found yourself backing up as the rat burst out of the box and continued to grow until the back of his head and a small part of his shoulders hit the ceiling of the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis noise caused both Bud and Trevor to come over to you with concerned and protective expression on their faces as Bud asked, \"Mark, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get hurt?\" Trevor added on, as you looked up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you guys I'm okay.\" You reassured the two anthro dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right before you could answer the two all three of you heard the giant and heavily muscled anthro rat let out a few moans and groans of confusion and slight pain as you saw him move one of his hands and rubbed the back of his head while he commented in a deep voice, \"Ow, that hurt...\" You then saw him look around in even more confusion when he continued with, \"Hey a wait minute, how come I can talk now? And how did I get like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the confused giant anthro rodent caused you to feel bad for the guy since he was obviously unaware of what just had happened to him.

Mercifully Bud and Trevor calmed down slightly, though still visibly apprehensive, giving you an opportunity to speak to the rat. \"Hey big guy,\" you said trying to speak soothingly, \"It's ok, they won't hurt you, would you like me to help you understand all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes please,\" the rat said in a booming voice that somehow could still do little to hide his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but first I can't just keep calling you big guy, do you mind if I give you a name?\" you asked \" How about Zach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok, but, please, tell me what happened,\" Zach, the newly christened behemoth, requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright first things first,\" you started, explaining the bizarre mushrooms and the situation they'd brought about. Informing Zach that the reason everything was now so dramatically different for him was that, all by chance, when he was an ordinary rat he'd eaten the aforementioned fungi and this was what had happened. \"And basically because you ate what was left of them you got...well...big,\" you said trying not to let the sight before you distract you from your mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, because I happened to find some food, they wanna hurt me?\" Zach asked, pointing to the still leery canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, they're just overprotective,\" you explained, trying to again convey that they should \"chill the fuck out\" to no avail, \"they're also apparently a bit stupid. But I promise you'll be safe Zach. By the way I forgot to mention, but my name is Mark, he's Bud, and he's Trevor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, it's good to meet you,\" Zach said, beginning to puncture the veil of his shyness. Suddenly though the rat's face was quickly returned to a look of panic. \"U-uh...M-mark,\" he stammered, \"I think you guys should get out *ngh* it's gonna happen again.\" Promptly after the warming you saw Zach's massive body begin expanding again as the roof groaned with displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blur you were scooped up by Trevor as the three of you escaped outside with an urgency that had, to your frustration, not allow you to get dress and left you entirely nude. Standing fully exposed with two giants in there own right they could do nothing more than feel small as Zach's head burst through the warehouse, followed be a pecs so thick and wide they defied reason, then an 8-pack that was somehow becoming a 10-pack, and finally a thick and dangling testament to masculinity that dangled to his knees and rested against testicles so large they forced apart the two offsetting legs that could, quite literally, dwarf trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of, and through, the warehouse you saw Zach's face had again returned to a panicked state, having the shred of stability he'd just found forcibly ripped away. You then realized Trevor, and by extension yourself, had began to move again as Trevor begaan running \"Trevor! Zach's not gonna hurt us you don't have to run,\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mark, but at the rate he's growing we have to get away,\" Trevor explained, running past terrified dock workers without a thought as they would soon see just what the real threat was anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, Mark,\" Bud chimed in, keeping pace behind Trevor, \"Look that rat is already growing again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Zach not \"that rat,\" you chastised before looking back and seeing he had already quadrupled in size. \"But I'll admit, maybe we should wait until this is over,\" you conceded as the colossus wandered into the city. The sight to most was one of unspeakable terror, but you couldn't help but feel a shiver up your spine as Zach godly gray body continually rose. Buildings that were previously at his waist were now finding themselves at his ankles as you reached the outskirts of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then that with a deafening impact and enormous tremor Zach laid back, body covering over half the city with ease You saw his fear had been melted away, replaced with that same hunky look that Bud and Trevor had always gotten, the look of someone desperate for <i>as much</i> sexual release <i>as soon</i> as possible. The rat then began pumping a cock so enormous that both dogs combined couldn't hope to measure up to it. Soft moans of pleasure to Zach ringing out as deafening blasts to all others as he rolled over and against countless structures while he masturbated. Then with a true roar that forced the three of you to shield your ears the monolith of rat began erupting, raining unknowable hundreds of gallons on himself and the city below. His demeanor not changing in the slightest nor his erection dying in the least Zach then sat up and engulfed his own member, providing it limitless pleasure with his own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help yourself you came then and there, not needing the slightest stimulation, driven only by the powerful visage unfolding in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Mark?\" Trevor asked shortly when he realized you'd just spooged into his palm that still held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me, that shit's hot,\" you said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I mean really,\" Trevor protested turning to Bud, hoping the German Shepard would back him up. To the Doberman's dismay he saw Bud had instead began to play with himself \"Really Bud?\" Trevor asked, not sure why he was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Mark said, that shit's hot,\" Bud said plainly, \"Besides don't act like you're not enjoying the show, you're hard as fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I have enough self control to not jack off every time the wind blows,\" Trevor retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were all interrupted though as the sound of Zach's fervored slurping and sputtering became an, though this time muffled, cry of orgasm as the godly rat began bucking before he blew an unspeakably large load down his own throat, shot after shot increasing Zach's look of pleasure as his eyes rolled back with satisfaction. After what had to have been minutes he released his member, finally emptied, from his mouth and began panting heavily as he lay back with a smile on his face and his gut slightly bulging, unfettered by all the chaos that buzzed far beneath his notice.</span></div></div>",

I hope I didn't end up hurting them or something when I grew again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made you worry as it obvious that he couldn't see you guys. Which meant that both Bud and Trevor were small compared to him. And if that was the case that must of meant that you'd be really tiny compared to him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...Neither of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor whatever reason you failed to recognize the third anthropomorphic dog kneeling in-between Bud and Trevor training its blue eyes on you. Besides the fact that he was nearly twice the size of Trevor at somewhere around thirty-something feet, you noticed the breed of the new addition was that of a border collie. The sheepdog sported an athletic build that made him look more skinny in comparison to the other two dogs. His muscles, while not as impressive as the others, were still visible underneath his fluffy white and black fur and they flexed a little bit as he nervously shifted upon seeing you. His paw-like hands were pushed to the ground in front of him and from the embarrassed, if excited expression he wore you assumed that he was most likely trying to hide a raging erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor was standing next to the new dog and only offered a shrug when you looked to him. Bud, on the other hand was clinging to the sheepdogs side while sporting a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bud, I told you not to do anything,\" you sighed. \"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new friend! I went out to get some fresh air and this cutie came right up to me looking for something to eat. Being the good samaritan I am, I decided to take him in and get him fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him not to do it,\" Trevor interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud leaned further against the giant sheepdog and looked around the his large torso to stick a tongue out at Trevor. \"Didn't stop me, either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, it's done,\" you dismissed. \"But just how many mushrooms did you feed him? He's massive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\" Bud excitedly whooped. \"He's definitely a grower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat big after eating just one? For a moment you were skeptical but Trevor gave a gentle nod to confirm Bud's story. Perhaps the effects of the mushroom differentiated from person to person and this newcomer's body happened to be extremely receptive to it? The sheepdog merely offered a meek smile and a shrug as you took in the fact you were hiding <i>three</i> giant dogs now. It was becoming quite the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I named him Ace,\" Bud proudly said before heavily patting the sheepdog's side. \"Say hello, Ace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce leaned forward and talked in a timid tone that was very unfitting of his size. \"H-hello! Nice to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave you a quick wave that confirmed your earlier suspicions about the boner he was hiding and he quickly moved his hand back when he realized you could see it. Judging from the pitch of his voice he must be younger than Bud, probably somewhere between 17 and 18. You weren't really sure. What you <i>were</i> sure about was that this canine was much more shy compared to the other two dogs and was clearly embarrassed about his obvious arousal. The uncertain smile that kept creeping back onto his face revealed that he might be liking the strange situation he found himself in, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I was just a stray dog like fifteen minutes ago. I approached Bud and he gave me something to eat and now I'm like this,\" Ace said. \"I can talk, stand on two legs and I'm really, really big. It's all so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Crazy?\" you added, almost glad that this new addition wasn't so unfazed about his transformation like the others were. Hopefully it will make him more cautious and encourage him put more effort into staying hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ace nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Mark, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, Trevor got me up to speed about everything that's happened so far,\" Ace explained before he adopted a cute bashful expression. \"And Bud told me about the stuff you three get up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud chuckled. \"You should'a seen him, he was practically drooling as I told him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's been sporting that ever since,\" Trevor said, motioning towards Ace's obscured erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud leaned in closer and tried to push the arms out of the way to get at it but the sheepdog's larger arms refused to budge. \"Either way, I'm intent on helping my new friend out. You're free to come and get yourself better acquainted, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the new 30 foot dog-person was definitely attractive, you've only met him a few minutes ago so you were feeling hesitant. You thought about just letting them have at it while you watched and take the time to hide the mushrooms. Not only did you not want Bud to feed them to any more animals, you were slightly nervous about the consequences if Ace ended up eating more. Only one of them was enough to make him this big and you were certain that adding more of it into his system would produce some unpredictable results when it came to how large he would grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a part of you, namely the organ that was slowly forming a tent in your pants, was trying hard to convince you to forget that fact and just join in. Deliberating for a second, the thought of participating in a foursome with all these giant dudes crossed your mind as you watched Ace give into Bud's advances and reveal himself. Many other wild options were swirling about your head and eventually you came to a decision...</span></div></div>",

Approaching the trio you silently began undressing while watching Bud, despite be less than half Ace's size, instruct the young border collie to lay on the floor, all the while kissing and nibbling everything he could get at. You'd fully stripped at this point and reached Trevor who was staring, just as enamored as you were with the sight, until he noticed you and in an instant new exactly what was on your mind as both his and your boners throbbed with anticipation. It took only seconds for Bud and Ace to notice their encroaching audience and as both there tails began wagging furiously Bud said in his best come hither voice, \"Why don't the two of you join us? There's more than enough of this guy to go around, right Ace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Ace chimed in with a nervous eagerness, his lust written just as plainly on his face as it was his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Ace where do you want us?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...I dunno, what do you guys think,\" he asked back, clearly not comfortable with holding the reins despite being the largest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I-\" you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dibs on his dick,\" Bud interrupted, scooting his way to the collie's groin, eager to see what he could do with such a massive tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...right, well I don't think I'm really big enough for you so what do you think about Trevor handling that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that work for you pup?\" Trevor asked as well, to which Ace simply nodded as the doberman positioned himself and the collie draped his massive legs over his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that leaves me,\" you said before clambering up to his large face. \"You good with this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm,\" Ace nodded fervently, eyeing your erection like it held the secrets of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that none of you were really sure who started first, but the warehouse was soon filled with moans, primarily from Ace, as you'd all begun teasing the big border collie. In barely anytime at all though Bud decided he'd had enough of foreplay and decided to impale himself on Ace's enormous cock, with a spine quivering roar of pain and pleasure the German Shepard had successfully taken in the member of someone twice his size, and to hilt no less. Things sped up quickly after that, you took the liberty of beginning to thrust into Ace's eager muzzle as his tongue did it's best to pleasure you whilst also panting with the pleasure of Bud fucking himself on his meat. The whole experience had become all the more thrilling when Trevor joined in, pounding mercilessly as the large ass and managing to make his presence felt to both you and Bud via nothing more than the sheer power of his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...aha...ah...guys...I'm gonna-\" Ace panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh, Not yet!\" Bud grunted as he worked the collie's shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..p-plleease...\" he begged, but Bud told him not to and somehow he managed to hold back his climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part sweat had began beading at your head as you did your best to face fuck the giant. For a moment you wondered just how much control Bud had of this stray dog and you supposed it would make sense after he'd fed him. You couldn't dwell for long though as you were the first to climax, with a gasping huff you blew one, then two, then three, and finally four loads into and on to Ace's mouth as he grinned at you with a line of it trickling down his lip. Once he'd heard your grunting Trevor himself began bucking faster and faster until he was the next to orgasm, unleashing a torrent of seed into the collie's hole with a ferocious roar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left only Bud and Ace, who'd desperately wanted release for a while already, the German Shepard's ass though was working over the border collie's cock with an increasing speed. Both you and Trevor could tell that in no time the both of them would blow as you each watched the show in your respective afterglow. The moment though was taking a surprising long time to come though as Ace had again began pleading for release while Bud denied it, however as soon as Bud's face began to contort you knew the moment had come \"Now!\" Bud freed Ace from his burden and with a howl the both of the began shooting copious amounts of seed for what must have been minutes, countless ropes were shot out on to the border collie as a nigh endless flood was pumped into the German Shepard until it began overflowing from his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bud happily collapsed forward atop Ace, and into his cum, you and Trevor had seated your next to and leaned against the big dog.

Or if we do \"play\" with each other we should try to be quiet so we don't wake up our boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, fine, have it your way old man.\" Bud muttered, while he crossed his huge arms in front of his massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had said you saw the giant Doberman look down at you with a smile on his face before he told you, \"There Mark, now you can go to sleep.\" You then saw him lean downward until his head was inches away form you. You then left him pucker up his lips and press them up against you thus giving you a huge, but gentle kiss. This only lasted for a few seconds though as he pulled away from you and added on in a hushed tone, \"So have a good night, kiddo. And when both Bud and I go to bed then rest assured that I'll make sure that you're nice and warm when you wake up tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared for a few minutes as you honestly weren't expecting Trevor to kiss you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you and Bud were attempting to console Trevor, back at home Eric had just finished taking a shower and was returning to his room. After dropping his towel and admiring the beauty of his well chiseled physique in his full length mirror Eric began to slip on his favorite old pair of athletic shorts. With a smile Eric allowed the elastic to snap tightly against his firm behind, he always did love how these shorts accentuated his features, the nylon tightly hugging his backside while in the front the crotch left virtually nothing to the imagination. Briefly pausing to once more check himself out Eric exited the bedroom and was hit with a sudden rush of epiphany. Last night Bud had said something about some freaky ass mushrooms how they'd made him super horny, but chiefly they'd made him so hot...so <i>powerful</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring to search for such an alluring prize himself Eric went to his brother's door. Waiting for a moment and not hearing anyone he decided to knock, again nothing, turning the knob he found the room deserted, perfect. Beginning to frantically search the room, unsure if and when Mark would return, Eric combed through drawer after drawer. Growing increasingly frustrated he found nothing out of the ordinary in his dresser, literal nothing in his night stand, and all his closet hid were some lousy shirts and dusty childhood toys \"DAMN IT!\" Eric yelled kicking a bag on the floor...the bag! As fast as he could manage Eric picked up the backpack Mark had used over the weekend and sat on the bed, wherever Mark had gone, probably back next door, he'd forgotten his stuff. Clawing through the odd change of clothes and battered book Eric finally arrived at his goal, a little baggie full of tiny strange mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time Eric popped one in his mouth, several minutes passed and still nothing. Standing back up, disappointed, Eric was ready to storm off however before he could take a single step he was overcome by a fiery itch. Again seated, he began to scratch when he discovered the source of the itch, he was growing lots of tiny hairs, <i>fast</i>. Heart now aflutter Eric realized this was it, it was working, laying down he watched as thick brown fur sprouted all along his body save for hands and feet which grew an even thicker black fur and his pectorals, torso, and groin, now revealed as he wished to view the changes in full, which grew a softer white fur. The itch now passed he again dared to breathe, before he was hit with a wave of...euphoric nausea? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was now filled with the sounds of bones cracking and skin stretching as Eric's body began to expand. At first it was painful, but had quickly became pleasant as his frame consumed more and more of the bed. With his weight ever increasing Eric leaned back and closed his eyes, enraptured with the sensations, but his eyes were soon jolted open as he felt a sensation beyond any orgasm as his hard dick began practically <i>reeling</i> out more and more, his fuzzy white pride climbing higher and higher. The revelry was interrupted though when, at both the base of his spine and top of his head, an agonizing pain ran through him as bone began to protrude from skin. Above his buttocks formed a small brown topped tail with a fluffy white bottom that stood straight up, and with a splitting pain atop his head an impressive rack of fuzzy antlers emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Eric realized his brawny legs now hung over the end of the bed before he reached up and felt his new antlers, \"One, two, three...\" he counted, discovering ten in all. Spotting his discarded shorts know strewn on the floor he picked them up in his long impressive arms and casually tossed the far to small garment to the trash can \"No use for those anymore,\" he beamed. Making a move to stand he was hit with a wave of vertigo before crashing back to the bed \"Whew...I know I got taller, but damn,\" he said making a second, successful attempt. However when he stood straight the tips of his antlers banged the ceiling \"Well that's gonna be fucking annoying,\" he swore before making his way back to his room to view himself in his \"full length\" mirror. \"Incredible, in-fucking-credible,\" Eric said, posing for himself. \"If only the antlers and tail didn't hurt so much, I would have loved to play with you big fella,\" he told his dick, which now hung, soft, 3/4 of the way down his thigh. Wagging his hips a bit and just watching his pendulous dick and wrecking ball nuts sway he was already beginning to get aroused \"Man Bud wasn't kidding when he said those things make you horny,\" Eric mused \"but then again I do look amazing,\" he said, in love with his new hulking 12 foot stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Trevor's, you and Bud were sitting with the downcast Doberman, each with an arm wrapped around him when...</span></div></div>",

However, you couldn't do that, and honestly if you could you'd try and suggest to the two heavily muscled anthros to wear some kind of clothing, even if it was a very tight speedo. However, the only one who knew might be able to wear one was Trevor, since you doubt even the largest size of that type of swimwear would fit Bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the German Shepherd, you found yourself looking over at him as he bent down to get into the backyard. This gave you a prefect view of his very large and muscled backside before you quickly turned your head the other way and went upstairs to change into your bathing suit. However, unknown to you was the large grin that was on Bud's face as he wanted you to his backside since he was hoping doing that would help you choose him to be with over Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough not to the now bigger German Shepherd's surprise he saw the Doberman snort in his direction as he remarked, \"Don't get full of yourself just because you ate one of those mushrooms. Besides we both know you only did that because you didn't like the fact that I was bigger then you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this though only caused Bud to stand up at his now 14 foot height once he was outside along with the Doberman. And as the two slightly glared at each other the younger anthro dog placed his hands on his hips and puffed out his massive chest when he responded back with, \"Hey, no need to feel threatened, old man. Besides I'm sure Mark will come to a decision sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your name once you had walked downstairs and out into the back you weren't that surprised when you saw the two huge canines in the pool. And once you had gotten close to the edge of it you saw a large furry hand offered out ot you in a attempt to help you into the pool. This prompted you to blush as you saw that the anthro dog who was offering you their hand was in fact.....</span></div></div>",
