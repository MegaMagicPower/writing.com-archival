One morning, on a routine patrol, they encountered an antique store being robbed. Judy had Officer Wilde radio for back-up while she snuck up on the criminals. The large rhino criminals didn't even hear her as she moved through the cluttered shop. Then her paw lightly touched an old artifact...</span></div></div>",

After they'd taken a statement from the shopkeeper, arrested the punks, and were on their way downtown, Judy noticed something. Occasionally, as she drove, her eyes would flick over to her partner. This time, she caught him more than once looking at her, giving her body a once over. She blushed; there was something predatory, hungry in the look. Not violent though. One of her paws left the steering wheel and rested over her pocket, and she silently wished...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly she stops however, or rather he stops. Not only was the voice feeling different but the body felt.. heavier? And there was something further down that was pointing out. A loud yelp escapes her, or rather his mouth as he reaches to touch the pointy thing, only to then moan at feeling the sensitive shaft brush against the cover at the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peels away the cover only to find a throbbing foxcock between her legs, which was already dripping with pre. He was just about to touch it out of curiousity when a familiar female otter comes in and that's when Judy realises that Nick had been staying at a hotel in town, and apparently been committing adultery with Mrs Otterton! Judy is even more in shock when the otter curls up on the bed with a sweet smile at the dumbfounded Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Otterton gently cups those vulpine balls before she leans in to kiss the fox. Judy wants to protest. Judy wants to pull away. This was all wrong! Think about poor Emmitt! But the body said otherwise as Judy felt himself wrap his arms around the otter's waist and kissing back, rubbing tongues together with hers before she pulls back. \"I see my sly fox has been getting ready for me.\" She says in her maternal, sultry voice as she moves down on Judy, cupping those balls as she kisses along his torso before ending up wrapping her muzzle around the knotted shaft. A loud moan escapes the fox as Judy feels himself place a paw on top of Mrs. Otterton's head as she expertly begins to bob along that shaft, going up and down at a steady pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy tries her best to pull away, but this newfound pleasure was overriding her senses. She had to get away and find Nick, who by now had her body. The pleasure eventually got too much as Judy lets out a vulpine growl as he gives the otter what she wants. A delightful foxy protein shake. Judy lays there, panting in the aftermath, watching as Mrs Otterton winks to him, while getting dressed. \"I'll see you next time you foxy stud. And good morning.\" She says with her soft voice before he gets dressed and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Judy is left there in Nick's body, unaware what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Anti-prey graffiti to catalogue, several perps who insulted her size and species, and to cap it all off near the end of the day she was almost killed by a wolf fleeing a scene. She\u2019d been weaponless, but even with all her combat training, Judy had slipped, and if it hadn\u2019t been for Nick stepping in at the last minute, she probably would have been gravely injured, at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the specific reason why she was in the living room, looking out a window into the starry sky, while Nick was in their shared bedroom, alone. Her relationship with Nick Wilde has been going really well, or at least Judy thought so. But after Nick had needed to run in to save her, he\u2019d been furious with her the second they\u2019d gone home. \u2018What were you thinking! Going after someone four times your size without back-up? You can\u2019t do everything yourself, Hopps!\u2019 Those had been the words he\u2019d thrown in her face, before stomping off to be by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything that day had reminded her, again and again and again, how much being a prey animal, specifically a very small prey animal at that, gave her such a huge disadvantage. In her job, and just in life. She\u2019d spent her entire life training to overcome those weaknesses, but sometimes she still didn\u2019t feel like she was enough. A shooting star flew through the night sky, and Judy couldn\u2019t help making a childish wish. \u201cI wish...I was born the kind of animal who doesn\u2019t have days like today.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He stopped and leaned against a building, trying to look casual. Then a lion in a business suit, definitely out of place in an area this seedy, passed him.

Every muscle in her body was stretching painfully, and she thought she must be hallucinating as she watched her perspective change, as if she was getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not hallucinating. Nick watched from the bed as Judy grew. In seconds she looked like she was just as tall as he was, and then she grew past that. As she grew taller her body filled out. Her small breasts expanded out into a larger size. Her butt, always muscley and flat, bulged out into a large soft, shapely ass. Her entire build was changing; where before she had tight athletic muscles was now covered by layers of fat. Judy's stomach expanded out too, until it hung slightly over her waist. By this point she had finally stopped growing, ending up nearly six feet tall, but her changes didn't stop. Her ears shrank, her fur became shorter until it was nearly invisible, and her muzzle extended out into a much larger snout. As the large change occurred, her tan skin turning a dark blue, it hit Nick finally what had happened: Judy had become a hippo! He looked down at her, nervous at how she was going to react, as her eyes opened and the pain stopped.</span></div></div>",

She looked down at herself, and saw her massive hippo body, her shredded clothes on the floor. \"I'm... a hippo?\" she muttered, her voice coming out a little deeper than she was used to. Judy tried to process what had happened: was this what that drug had done? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to get a handle on everything, so she focused on her surroundings, trying to block out her new sensory information. She was more than six times her previous size, her entire apartment seemed very small now. Her eyes met Nick's, and that's when it clicked: <b>he</b> was small now, too. In their relationship, he had always been the smarter one. The older one. The <b>larger</b> one. But that wasn't true anymore. Judy looked down at herself again, thinking. She was so much more...voluptuous like this. She's never been ashamed of her lithe, athletic build before, but there had still been times when Judy had wished she had the same busty, sexy shape that so many other mammals did. And now...she kinda did. She reached a large hand down and touched her stomach, feeling it sink in a little. Was this a problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. The answer came almost immediately. <b>No</b>. She was soft, strong, sexy. There was nothing wrong with that. Judy noted absently that sure, she would probably want to turn back into a rabbit sometime, preferably sooner. But there was nothing wrong with being like this for a little while. Nothing wrong at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept staring down at her boyfriend, smiling as she savored how much taller she was then him. As she did, she caught sight of the tent in his pants. It used to seem so large to her, but now it was barely visible from her full height. She opened her mouth, her voice coming out low and husky, and she said,</span></div></div>",

No witty comeback, no snarky joke. That was a first. Judy liked it. \"Clothes off, Nick.\" In a flash his clothes were thrown across the room, his erect pink cock bare to the air. Slowly and sensually, she walked over to the bed and climbed onto it, raising herself above Nick. She oriented herself so that her immense gray ass hovered in the air right over Nick's head, bending herself so that Judy's mouth was just above his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Judy extended her long, wide tongue and ran it down Nick's cock. As a rabbit that cock had been enormous, so big that she wasn't really able to give him blowjobs, just able to lick it. Nick said he hadn't minded, but Judy had felt bad anyway. Now? Now she was so much larger than him that her tongue enveloped his cock, covering it completely. One thing hadn't changed: that musky taste. Nick shuddered beneath her in pleasure, then grabbed her ass with both hands and leaned in, stuck his tongue into her pussy. Judy paused, savoring the feeling as his tongue flitted around and licked her. She moaned, a husky, throaty moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be one-upped, Judy leaned in closer and took his entire cock in her maw, playing with the tiny thing with her tongue. Nick gasped in pleasure, but she could tell from how his paws gripped her ass harder that he wasn't going to take that lying down. He lifted his head up and stuck his entire muzzle into her pussy, still licking her insides for all her could. Judy didn't say anything. She took his cock out of her mouth and leaned back, pressing Nick onto the bed, her ass crushed his face into her pussy. Nick had won this round, though personally Judy had to consider herself the winner. Here she was: enormous, proud of herself, feeling completely pleasured as she sat on her boyfriend's face while he at her out as best as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy felt herself getting close, and pushed herself down further on Nick. He just grabbed onto her tighter, went in deeper, and redoubled his efforts. That was it. Judy's mind completely blanked as she came, moaning uncontrollably. When she recovered, she moved away from Nick and lay sprawled out on the bed, her large legs open to him. \"I think my little fox deserves a reward for that,\" she purred. Faster than she had expected, Nick had closed the distance and thrust his cock into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt very different from before. Where before his cock was almost too big to fit into her pussy, now there was plenty of room. But as he thrusted faster and faster, his paws reaching up and groping her everywhere: her breasts, her ass, her stomach, Judy realized that the extra space meant more angle for him to enter, more exact spots for him to hit. A little sooner than she had wanted, she heard him mutter, \"I'm...I'm...\" and felt his cock twitch inside her, filling her pussy with his spunk. \"...coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lay together in the afterglow, both of them sweaty, Judy extremely pleased with her new body, when she said...</span></div></div>",

First, she had him size her new body, so he could get her some new clothes. Nothing either owned would fit her anymore, after all. Once she had some practical jeans and a large button-up shirt to wear (plus a bra that fit her new enormous boobs), the two went into the police station to sort everything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Judy didn't think Chief Bogo would believe the story, it sounded wild even telling it. Before, as a bunny, looking up at his stern face, she probably would have been scared. But now, she stood just as tall as he did, and for some reason no fear appeared in her heart. Instead, she felt confident, in a new way that had never come to her before. In the end, Nick's eyewitness account, plus several scattered reports of mammals claiming to have changed species, convinced Bogo, so Judy got a new uniform and was assigned to continue investigating this mysterious drug ring, in the hopes it could lead to answers to turn her back. She didn't tell Bogo that at least some part of her wondered if turning back would even be a good idea.</span></div></div>",

In the meantime, Hopps, you're getting partnered with Hornsburl.\" Both cops made noises of unhappiness about this, but Bogo raised a palm to quiet them. \"It's just until the case is over. Now, get out of my office and get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out together, Nick chattering away about how ridiculous this was after leaving Bogo's earshot, but Judy was lost in her own thoughts. She vaguely knew Hornsburl, a big, tough rhino guy who worked in Narcotics. He'd never had much to say to her before, but he'd also been so intimidatingly large there had never been anything Judy had wanted to say to him. Nick and Judy reached the point where they'd need to part ways for the separate parts of the building, and Judy leaned down to kiss the top of his head, something he had before often had to do to him, leaving Nick running off with a blush on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she found Hornsburl, he was in the break room, making himself some coffee. Unlike what she'd had at home, the mug he was using was large enough to make drinking it worthwhile. Feeling nervous looking at the muscular rhino for the first time since becoming a hippo, Judy coughed and grabbed a mug, while Hornsburl looked on silently. \"So, I guess you heard what happened. Bunny cop's not a bunny right now. I hope we work well together.\" Judy offered a large, pudgy hand, which he took and shook without comment. After they both had the prerequisite coffee, Hornsburl finally started talking, telling her the plan for cracking this drug ring.</span></div></div>",

Not only is that odd, considering the district, but the eyewitness also claimed he was missing an eye.

All the other times she'd done her pre-stake-out shopping, she'd been a bunny. But hippos needed a lot more food, and her new taste buds meant a different preference in foods. In the end, she just decided to buy whatever sounded right to her larger gut, and stopped to leave a Nick with details about where she would be and why. That done, she met up with her temporary partner again, several blocks from their stake-out location.

Suddenly, she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off him. Hornsburl had never been anything special to Judy before, but now there was something...different about him. Maybe it was that weird pent-up feeling, or her change in species, but she suddenly couldn\u2019t help looking at his bulk, his musculature, and think about how <i>powerful</i> that would feel in the bedroom. Nick had been cute, sure, but this looked like a man who could give her a real pounding, something to make the bed, or the car, shake. But, Judy remembered, she was dating Nick!

Almost immediately the pain disappeared, and she drove towards home in silence...until she felt something weird. All over her body, a slow growing warmth built up. At first she decided to just ignore it, thinking it was just a weird side effect. But it didn't stop. Not able to take any more, she pulled over into a nearby parking lot and entered a department store, heading to their lady's bathroom. Judy was the only mammal there, which she was happy about. As she looked in the mirror, she saw that she'd been sweating profusely, her fur matted with the moisture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when something weird started to happen. Judy's were locked on her reflection's, but from the corners of her eyes she watched as her perspective changed, the bathroom seeming to shrink around her. Looking down, she saw her body stretching up towards the tiled ceiling. The heat was becoming blinding, and she had to shut her eyes from the pressure of it. Dimly, through the heat, she could feel herself growing larger, her head changing shape, her lithe body bulking up with muscle. The only part of her that wasn't expanding, as far as she could tell, was her breasts. In fact, she couldn't feel them at all anymore. That's when the heat grew to be so much, she lost all sensations in her body. After nearly five minutes of shifting, changing, and transforming, Judy felt the heat fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy opened her eyes, and was stunned by what she saw in the mirror. Reflected back at her was a bull, at least six feet tall, with broad shoulders and muscular arms. The bull had a flat chest with a washboard stomach, and a large cock between it's legs and a set of full testicles under them. The bull was naked, a pile of ripped and shredding clothing at it's feet. That's when Judy realized: that was her. She was the bull!</span></div></div>",

She saw the cow's eyes focus on something lower on Judy's body, and she looked down herself to see that her new cock was erect. Seeing it, Judy could feel it's warmth, and the need for touching and more that it was sending to her brain. How long had it been like that? The cow was blushing more feverishly than before, and took a step back to lock the bathroom door. \"Well, stud, I guess you've cornered me. How could I say no?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Judy stood there, in stunned silence. For the most part, she was thinking about how insane this was. One minute she's her normal self, driving home after a doctor's examination, the next she's been transformed into a bull and being propositioned for sex! But another part of her, evidently the part of her that controlled her eyes, was watching the cow. Judy's eyes ran over the cow's tight shirt, and as she took off her pants, on her udder. Out of nowhere, Judy felt her new cock pulse with desire. She'd never felt anything like it; it was becoming difficult for her to <b>not</b> grab herself down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow took off her shirt, leaving her large white breasts clasped only in a bra that revealed quite a lot of cleavage. Judy shook for a second as her cock again flared with need. Apparently that wave of desire could be seen on her face, because the cow smiled sexily and said, \"Ooh, enjoying my strip show?\" Judy didn't nod or shake her head, she was too busy looking at her. Taking that as a sign of encouragement, the cow lowered her hands past her udder to her black panties, and slowly, deliberately, lowered them to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Judy a moment to realize it, but she was walking closer to the cow, her eyes focused on her pussy. It felt like she was on autopilot as her hands reached around the cow and unhooked her bra, letting it fall to the floor next to the bra. Smiling, the cow sat on a nearby counter, her legs splayed, giving Judy a good view of her pussy lips. Judy didn't know why she was doing this, why she didn't just leave. But she didn't. Instead, with an odd grin, she walked closer, grabbed her cock, savored the feeling of her large hand on her new equipment, then positioned it just outside the cow's pussy...and thrusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, Officer Hopps couldn't bring herself to care about being transformed, or about how weird she was acting. Judy had had sex multiple times before, but that didn't feel anything like this. Before, she had felt pleasure everywhere, in her pussy, her breasts, everywhere. Now all that pleasure and more was focused in her cock, and it was intoxicating. She found her hands gripping the cow's hips as she thrusted in and out of her, and the feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy didn't remember much of what happened next. It was a haze of pleasure, carnal and delicious. The only thing he could remember later about that time was his first male orgasm. It was quick, intense, and satisfying. His memory picked up again only once the cow (he had never gotten her name) had left, leaving Judy alone with her phone number, a heart drawn next to it.</span></div></div>",

After all, what would he tell them? \"Hello, I'm a police officer. I was just a bunny girl, but I took some medication and it turned me into a bull. Help would be great.\" No, what Judy needed was someone he could talk to about this that would be able to trust him, to believe what he was telling, so Judy could have someone on his side. So, he dialed Nick's number, and waited for him to pick up. \"Nick, it's Judy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, and with dread filling his heart Judy realized his voice was much deeper now, sounding nothing like it usually did. \"Are you sure? Because if so, Carrot, you must have come down with one hell of a cold.\" Behind the humor, Judy could hear real suspicion and fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got back from the pharmacy, with the pain medication for my arm. It did something weird to my voice, and I need help. Can you meet me at the Burrows Mall, in the men's room? I can't answer questions now, just trust me, please.\" Then, he hung up. It hadn't been a lie, exactly, but it was a dodging of the real issue plaguing Judy's body. With nothing left to do but wait, Judy looked in the bathroom mirror and saw the tall, studly bull looking back. Before, there had been a separation, but now Judy could feel like that was his body. In fact, he realized, he actually thought of himself more as a man, a bull, than a woman. And some part of him couldn't help but be impressed by the rugged good looks he saw reflected in the mirror. But those thoughts were interrupted as Nick entered the room to see Judy, posing in the mirror, nude.</span></div></div>",

Throwing on his best charming face, he asked, \"Hey, sorry about just walking in while you're doing...whatever you're doing, but my friend said they were going to meet me here. I know! Sounds weird! But it seems it was just a dumb prank, so I'm just gonna go now.\" But before Nick could turn and walk away, Judy closed the distance and reached out with a brawny hand to grab his shoulder and stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Judy was this close, it hit him just how much smaller, how much weaker, the fox was compared to his large, bullish body. \"Nick, it wasn't a prank. I'm Judy.\" That certainly caught his attention, but they knew each other well enough that Judy was able to convince him that this was the case with enough sordid details of their time together. Once he was convinced, Judy told him, \"So, as you can see, all my clothes were destroyed, so I'll need some new ones.\" Luckily for Judy, Nick was good at sizing by eye, and left the bathroom with a promise on his lips to come back with something Judy could walk around in without being arrested for indecent exposure.</span></div></div>",

Happy to be able to hide his junk, Judy put them on, and from there started with the other clothes, jeans and a button-up shirt.

You\u2019re had to deal with a lot of crazy in a short amount of time.\u2019 Carrots!\u201d Nick dramatically put a hand to his chest, looking offended. \u201cDo you think so little of me?

And as she kicked the door down, a liquid spilled over her...<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Euh, what is this?\"</i> She said to herself as she tried to wipe it off, only for her to start getting wamer. Her body starts to grow bigger and stronger as her uniform is starting to strain against her growing form. Blinking in confusion, she grunts at the pain of the restraining fabrics as she continues to grow. Although, unbeknownst to her, her fur started to take on a more golden tan colour along with her chest receeding to form firm pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes eventually succumb to her growth as they burst off of her just in time for Judy's ears to shrink and get more rounded in shape along with a thick, chocolate brown mane forming around her head and growing down over her now more masculine chest. A sudden tingle runs down her spine as her tiny tail begins to grow outwards and get longer and more flexible for each passing second while a thick, chocolate brown tuft grows out at the tip as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be long before the warmth was concentrated around her genital area. Looking down in shock, she sees her clitoris grow and swell as it pulses with life, it getting longer and thicker, making her let out a rather deep moan as she reaches a curious paw down to rub along it, making her moan out once more. Judy's small paws begin to swell and get thicker as she strokes her forming penis, and soon enough, her soft fuzzy paws had become powerful leonine paws equipped with retractable claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the more she strokes off, the faster her changes occur as her new length reaches up to 10 inches in length while underneath, a pair of low-hanging orange-sized nuts flop down along with her feet reshaping and growing sharp claws as well. It wasn't long before Judy let out an ear deafening roar as she orgasms hard, spraying her, now his leonine seed over the floor and wall infront of him. Judy is left panting as he ponders what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Those soft, yet powerful paws run over his body carefully to feel up every inch off of it unable to help but letting out a deep rumbling purr before chuckling to himself. \"So this is what being a kitty is like?\" He quickly snaps back to reality however. \"Fuck, I need to find Nick!\" He exclaims as he runs out from the lab only to at that very moment bump right into the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the fox however, Judy still had some of the stuff that had transformed him, on him and it splashes over to Nick along with some of his semen. As they both fall to their butts, the male lion looks into the fox's eyes. \"Nick! I'm so glad to see you! We need to get out of here quickly!\" The fox just blinks in sheer confusion at the stud of a lion in front of him. He was just about to question the lion when he sees Judy's tattered uniform on the floor. \"Judy? Tha..that's really you isn't it?\" The vulpine says as he moves closer to the other male, curiously running a paw through the mane \"Wow, it's so fluffy!\" He exclaims in a soft voice, the stroking of the mane causing Judy to helplessly purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when suddenly a warmth hits Nick and he ends up letting out a sudden growl as he clutches his stomach. It begins with his fur turning a sandy brown colour while his body begins to grow taller and bigger. Judy can't help but look at his friend both with intrigue and with lust, especially as the lion sees the fox's features soften with his hips getting wider along with his vulpine rump getting thicker and more juicy by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud 'riiip' is heard as Nick's uniform gets too small, the fabrics tearing from the pressure of the growth and that's when Nick sees it, his proud member was no more, in place of his 'beloved' sheath and sack was the female counterpart. A dripping, needy vagina. If it wasn't for the fact whatever was changing him had made him mellow about it, he'd probably panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick hears a sudden lustful growl and looks towards the source. He could see a thick member come out from Judy's sheath which causes Nick to suddenly gulp. The male lion approaches the changing fox, his powerful paws grabbing at the fox's chest as it swells, getting bigger and softer as it develops into a pair of moderately sized breasts. The nipples puff up and get thicker while Nick who looks less masculine and vulpine and more feminine and leonine by the second feels a sudden warmth emit from his, or now her vagina. That's when Nick realizes that she was getting into heat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy begins to firmly press his body against Nick's as her ears get more rounded, her muzzle shorter and broader along with her claws becoming a lot sharper as well as retractable much like a feline's set of paws. Finally her tail thins out, getting longer and more flexible with a thick tuft at the very tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new lioness liked the way the big lion was looking at her, she knew what he wanted and she wanted it too. She tilts her head to let Judy bite down on her neck in an action to claim her as his and before she even knew it, he thrust his member inside of that virgin snatch which causes Nick to roar out in pleasure. Judy does seem to have the decency however to let the lioness get used to his shaft before the male lion begins to firmly thrust, pumping his shaft in and out of the lioness in a soft, steady pace. The pace picking up as he goes. It wasn't long before an echo of bestial roars could be heard throughout the lab as they both came in unison. Nick coating Judy's member with her feminine juices while Judy pumps Nick full of her virile cum. Both of them slumping down panting in the glow of the aftermath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they come to, panic fills them both. What were they going to tell Bogo? Speaking of the devil, he enters with a shocked expression on his face. Judy gulps and stammers. \"W..we can explain.\" to which Bogo crosses his arms, huffing in an annoyed tone. \"Please do.\"</span></div></div>",

You masturbate while the chemical is still on your.

Interesting, because many officers experience heat and DON'T have sex at crime scenes.

By now, they knew exactly how to get it done: bring plenty of ways to entertain themselves (usually books), lots of snack foods, and as much caffeine as was mammaly possible. In point of fact, they\u2019d gotten it down to a perfect science, and were able to be at the location, in their car, in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs amazing as that was, there were a few wrinkles in the plan. After all, Judy was now a lion roughly four times his previous height, with an entirely new biology and gender. Nick wasn\u2019t as handicapped, as her new body was only maybe twice her original height, and at least she\u2019d already been a predator in a similar species family. Still, both were getting used to a lot of new aspects of their bodies, and were still trying to awkwardly dance around the fact they\u2019d had sex with each other not long at all ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat became a bit of an impossibility seven hours into the stake-out, as it passed midnight and they switched from one day to another. Slowly, so subtly that neither noticed it was happening for quite a while, they felt warmth building up inside them. For Nick, it felt like a flushing of her entire body, her nipples getting stiff, and her pussy getting wet and needy. For Judy, his cock got hard in his jeans, becoming so sensitive that just the feeling of brushing against his underwear was bringing him to the brink of orgasm. They were in heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the heat began to take their bodies, it also began to take their minds. The subtle attraction they\u2019d been feeling for each other\u2019s bodies all day grew worse, until they both broke at the same time, leaning closer to start making out. The kissing didn\u2019t last long, however, and before long Judy was plowing Nick from behind again, the two mammals completely enraptured by their passion. When it was done, each knew inside that they wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid this again.</span></div></div>",

Feeling rather weak from the ordeal, Nick and Judy decide to head to the doctor's office to make sure nothing's wrong. Doing a regular checkup, Nick seems to be in perfect shape for a lioness at her age. Although there was one test they took that shocked them both. The doctor looks firmly into their eyes before saying the 'magic' words. \"Well, judging by your symptoms and tests. It, umm seems that you've become pregnant, Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid revelation causes the lions to drop their jaws in shock before looking at each other in disbelief. Nick stutters out. \"B..but how can that be!? I'm not female! I know this body is, but.. I'm not.\" She lets out a sad little whine when Judy suddenly pulls the lioness close to her masculine body. Oddly enough, Judy wasn't appauled by it, but rather excited. Never in a million years could Judy imagine that she, or rather he would be a father to a litter of lioncubs.</span></div></div>",

Her shop was something of a specialist dealer selling all kinds of classic items plus many that some would call mystical. Today was a slow evening and she was just getting ready to close when she heard the bell from the door. She looked up from her magazine to see a fox in a green Hawaiian shirt and khaki pants walking in. This was Nick Wilde.<br>\r\n\"Hello, welcome to my store?\" Yua said. \"Is there something I could help you with?\"<br>\r\nThe fox gulped.  He had been thinking about coming here for weeks before he worked up the courage. <br>\r\n\"Um, yes,\" Nick said. \"I hear you offer items that can help people, um, change.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, somewhat,\" Yua said. \"What king of \"change\" are you looking for?\"<br>\r\nNick's nervousness continued. He'd heard of this place and believed it was likely the only place that could give him what he was looking for, however unlikely it sounded. <br>\r\n\"Well, I want to, err, change my species,\" Nick said. \"Not permanently, just maybe for a night or two.\" <br>\r\n\"Huh, that's an odd request,\" Yua replied.<br>\r\nShe picking up on the fox's tentative attitude. She smiled, this was going to be fun.<br>\r\n\"But it is something I may be able to help you with,\" Yua said. \"What are you looking to become? Something tougher like a wolf or a tiger? Something less conspicuous like a ram or a mouse? Something with more endurance like a horse?\"<br>\r\n\"I want to be a bunny,\" Nick replied.<br>\r\n\"A rabbit?\" Yua asked inquisitively. \"An unusual choice, especially for a fox. You trying to multiply or something?\"<br>\r\n\"My girlfriend is a rabbit,\" Nick replied. \"I know we get funny looks whenever we are out in public and there are always some things I can't do for her or that we must plan to accommodate because of my species. If just for one night I want to give her a special night out without any of the interspecies stigma.\"<br>\r\n\"Your reasoning is sound,\" Yua said. \"I was thinking you wanted to do it as part of a disguise or a scam.\"<br>\r\nNick rolled his eyes, old stereotypes die hard. His attention turned back to the task at hand.<br>\r\n\"Can you do it?\" Nick asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe I can,\" Yua responded. \"I may have an item here under my desk that may be able to help you.\"<br>\r\nYua reached down under the table.

Even inebriated, that caught Nick's attention. He turned around, nocturnal eyes piercing through the dark of the night, and he saw a fellow fox with black fur come up to him, his eyes bright and his pockets full. \"Ya lookin for anything, friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle not to break out into laughter at this. Nick was an officer for the ZPD. He should probably bust this guy right now. Though, he thought, maybe he should check out what he's packing first. \"What do you have, my friend?\" Nick asked, purposely making himself sound drunker than he actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black fox smiled. \"Do you got a lady friend?\" Nick nodded. \"Good. Well, I just got my hands on some of this...\" from one of his many pockets the fox pulled out a perfume spray bottle, filled with some clear liquid. \"Just got it from a friend of mine, who says his friend got a box of this stuff off a truck. Smell's real good, sure your vixen will love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to correct the fox, Nick looked the bottle over and smiled. \"How much?\" The fox raised five fingers. That was a deal. Nick handed him a five, took the bottle, and went on his way home. Before he had quite reached it, however, Nick realized he hadn't actually tested out the perfume. How did he know it would smell good? And so Nick raised it up to his face and let out a small spray. It took all of his willpower not to gag. This stuff smelled terrible. Nick threw the bottle into an alleyway, frowning. What a waste of money.</span></div></div>",

You can do this through magic, science, whatever! There are a few rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Please post with good spelling/grammar. Offending posts will be removed.<br>\r\n2) Keep Feral stuff in the appropriate side area, which I will create early on. Feral stuff outside that will be removed.<br>\r\n3) TG is welcome! AR, AP, WG, GTS, Shrinking, and Hermapthrodites are all allowed as well, though AR is not allowed to go beyond legal age.<br>\r\n4) Age play, fecal, inflation, inanimate, urine, and unbirthing are not allowed. Sorry, you guys, but there are interactives for that.<br>\r\n5) Really good posts that the creator likes will earn the poster 500GP or more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
