Gardurple was a rather selfish goblin, more so than others. He's very easy to bribe, which is why Sneezles, your rival, bribed him with some gold to keep you out. There's always been a feud between you two, particularly on who is the most attractive. She's quite skinny, and you're very curvy. This quarrel has been going on for months and now, it seems that this is the final straw.<br>\r\n\"When I get in there, I'll...I'll\" You didn't get much farther, as he and Sneezles laugh behind the barred door. You turn around in despair, you'll now need to survive on your own. You travel several miles from your former lair and it's now getting to be dusk. As you walk up a hill, you can see a carriage at the bottom. You dash into a nearby bush and peer at the cart. From what you could see, it looks like some sort of potion vendor. You sneak out of the bush and get a closer peek. Getting closer reveals that the cart is a traveling business shop called \"Paddie's Potions.\" You maneuver to the back and see a door to the inside of the carriage, locked of course. Fortunately though, you have experience with locks, and you open it after five minutes. Slowly, you creep in and see that the owner is leaned back in his chair, asleep. You can see many different potions around on shelves you can't reach. Though, there are some you can reach. They're all labeled and corked loosely. You look around, and decide to take the potion labeled.....</font></span></span></div></div>",

It has a nice strawberry flavour, nice bonus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you felt anything within your body, you were suddenly pulled into a chokehold by the owner of the store, if you were just a tiny bit more careful you would've heard him stopping snoring, but alas, the excitement was too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darned goblins, always trying to steal my goods!\" You heard him blurt in anger as you unsuccessfully tried to free yourself from his hold. Paddie wasn't strong by any means, but you were smaller and weaker.<br>\r\nWell, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile busy trying to wrestle with the owner, you didn't felt a lingering tingling in your whole body. By seconds, as growth started, you felt that you actually managed to slowly starting to overcome the angry owner in this struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 4th feet you were able to breath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 5th feet, you managed to break the hold completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 6th feet, your tatters that you proudly called clothes before snapped off you, and you managed to pin shocked owner down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd only then you noticed, that you were now just a tiny bit, but taller than this human. Joy overcame you, as you started to giggle uncontrollably.<br>\r\nYou knew that you had power to deal with those idiots back in your den! Get your revenge, take the den for yourself. You felt all giddy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, you needed to deal with the owner. Or perhaps take another drink, being even taller would certainly help.</span></div></div>",

With seriously thick thighs, each of his cheeks was big enough to hold you inside and his eyes were a violet color with a yellow, four point star for pupils, unbeknownst to you.<br>\r\nGrabbing a random potion that caught your eye, you silently slide down the ladder and see that it was...</span></div></div>",

You think to yourself, <i>Huh... a potion that makes you break wind like nobody's business - this is exactly what I need!</i> Flatulence is seen as attractive amongst goblinfolk, and as if your curvaceous figure wasn't already attractive enough, once you start blasting some bad gas like there's no tomorrow, you'll be irresistible. <i>That is,</i> you think to yourself, <i>if I even WANT their affection - those bozos wouldn't know true beauty if it slapped them in the face... Hmmm. I know what I must do! I must show them just how wrong they were, and assert my dominance as the ideal goblin girl!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to do that, you'll have to get yourself all fueled up first. So, there's no time like the present - you wrap your hand around the cork of the bottle, and take it out with ease. After tossing the cork aside, you proceed to gulp down the potion in one large swig, resulting in a small belch. You double-check the label, and the effects of the potion are not yet immediate, but will take place in about one hour - just enough time for you to make your way back to your den and show the others who's boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've arrived back at the Goblin Den, and you see before you the same barred door that graced your exit prior. The Den was more like a cave or underground lair, with the doorway acting as the only means to get in or out. As you arrive at the door, you feel your stomach begin to gurgle and rumble - the gas is starting to build up in your system, as a result of the potion. You even push out a few toots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Brrrrp<br>\r\nBrrrt<br>\r\nBrrrrrpppphhtt</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour butt's just warming up - you rub your belly in delight, as you feel more and more bloated with each passing second. The level of farting increases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BRRRRRPP!<br>\r\nBRRRRPPHHT!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn,</i> you think to yourself, <i>these are some fine farts! I must say, this potion worked better than I expected... now, I wonder...</i> You decide to clench your butt, trying to hold the gas in - the rumbling in your stomach begins to increase, and the bloating starts to develop into a slight swelling of the stomach. You know that by holding farts in, you can build up their force - it might just be enough to blast the door open! Butt still clenched, you walk up right in front of the door, turn to have your back face towards it, and then press your butt up against it. \"Time to let her rip!\" you exclaim, as you relax your butt and proceed to push out a large, concentrated blast of gas right into the door, resulting in a hole large enough for you to squeeze through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><i><b>BRRRRRRR-BRRRRAAAAAAPPHHHTT!!</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach is deflated, back to normal, but you still have a little gas left in your system. You quickly turn to face the hole and squeeze through, some farts getting squeezed out of you as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BRRRRAAAaaaapppp!<br>\r\nBRRRTTTT!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way down the stone steps towards the center of the den, two goblin guards make their way up towards you - undoubtedly, they heard your butt blast open the door that leads into their lair. You stop on the stairway and quickly turn to poke your butt out towards the oncoming guards, and proceed to send them tumbling down the stairs with a mighty fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><i><b>BRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPTT!!</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and proceed down the stairs, only to see your former group of goblinfolk all standing in the center of the lair dumbfounded, but also impressed. You puff out your chest and declare, \"Fellow Goblins! I have returned to give you a piece of my mind - how <i>dare</i> you kick me out of the Den?!\" One of the other goblins pipes up and says, \"A-Actually, it was the Master, Gardurple who banished you! We had nothing to do with that!\" You smirk and reply, \"Yeah, you're right! HEY, GARDURPLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you shout, you see the other goblins push Gardurple out in front of the crowd. He is visibly irritated by what his clan of goblins has done, but before he says anything to them, he turns to face you, a look of worry on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... what are you doing here?!\" He shrieks. \"I told you that you had no place in this clan!\" You've been holding in in your gas for about a minute, now, and the swelling in your stomach has become quite noticeable - while flatulence is seen as attractive to goblinfolk, your flatulence is unlike anything they have ever seen before. They're somewhat intimidated by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?  </span></div></div>",
