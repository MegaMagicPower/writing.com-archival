And with your help, Blackridge Inc. can help to lead Metropolis into the future, a future built on clean, sustainable energy for the entire city. Thank you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake Blackridge left the stage as the applause from the sea of investors showered him with applause. It was the annual Blackridge Inc. investors meeting, and Jake had just finished announcing the company\u2019s plan to expand from just being the city\u2019s tech giant to providing forms of clean, alternative energy for all of Metropolis. Jake\u2019s wife, Courtney, waited for him as he walked through the wings of the stage, greeting her husband with a kiss on the cheek while handing him his phone. \u201cGreat stuff out there, as always. CNBC is already projecting company stock to soar tomorrow morning at the opening bell.\u201d Jake smirked a little bit to himself, pleased to hear the news. With Metropolis\u2019 recent peace, he\u2019d been able to focus more and more on building the company, to the point where he\u2019d already become the 4th richest person alive, despite the fact that he was only twenty-three years of age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetropolis\u2019 villain activity had fallen drastically over the past three years, as improvements to prison infrastructure, along with improvements in crime prevention by the city\u2019s police force, had nearly lowered Metropolis\u2019 crime rate to 0%. Birdboy and Catgirl had locked up the rest of the villains, and finally, Metropolis was able to breathe clean and easy. The city was finally reaching its full potential, and it had Jake Blackridge to thank... more than most civilians knew, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Courtney walked through the back of the convention center where the meeting was being hosted, as Courtney, still his secretary after all the time, read off his appointments to him. \u201cWe have the art exhibit opening tonight at eight PM, you\u2019re having Coffee with Beth at three, and...\u201d Courtney took pause. There was something written on her virtual calendar that wasn\u2019t there this morning. \u201c... and you have a meeting with your \u201cother wife\u201d... right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jake could even blink, himself and Courtney were transported seamlessly into Jake\u2019s private office, where PuppetMistress, Jake\u2019s guardian angel, and wife in death was waiting, sitting back in his chair with her feet up on his desk. \u201cHi, hun.\u201d She offered Jake a small wave, and a small smile to go with it. Jake was used to her powers by now, so he wasn\u2019t shocked by the teleportation, even though he did see it as a bit of an inconvenience at the very moment. Him and Courtney both took two of the other seats in the office. \u201cPuppet...\u201d Jake cleared his throat a bit. \u201cThis is certainly unexpected... it\u2019s been-...\u201d \u201cThree years.\u201d PuppetMistress finished his sentence for him, and sat up straight. \u201cThree years of peace, and prosperity, where I\u2019ve just been able to sit around and get some reading done, while not having to worry about saving your skin every five minutes or so...\u201d Puppet took a deep breath, clearly concerned and worried about what she was about to share. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sad to say that it\u2019s coming to an end.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Courtney shared a look, before raising their eyebrows and leaning in closer. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about? If one of the villains had gotten out of prison, we would know about it...\u201d PuppetMistress shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m referring to the villains that can\u2019t be held in any sort of physical prison. The Immortals. Stinkromancer. Froststench. Ashley Bilefoot. Lady Akushu. Countess Vashnara. And the Deathknight, Paladria. They\u2019ve broken through the inter-dimensional prison I had sealed them in, and in the process, created a rift to another universe- one in which I did not create.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake cocked his head. \u201cI thought you made everything.\u201d Puppet smirked a bit, and reached out, wanting to stroke Jake\u2019s face, but her arms simply weren\u2019t long enough. \u201cOh, my Jake. Somehow, so bright, yet so simple at the same time. You have no idea how much I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d Courtney\u2019s glare told PuppetMistress to get on with it. PuppetMistress retracted her hand and continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... And while they were still imprisoned by me, I caught wind of what they were planning to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuppetMistress created a projection with her hand on the wall, showing five rings, each with a different colored gemstone: Yellow, Green, Red, Blue, And Black. \u201cThe rings you see here are known collectively as the Keys of the Cleansed. The five of them being separated from one another at all times acts as a sort of lock. See, back at the very beginning of the creation of this universe, things got... a little out of control...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuppetMistress\u2019 words gave Jake pause. \u201cWait... there are others like you?\u201d Puppet nodded her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was not the only entity present in its creation. There exist beings more powerful than I. There was one known as The Filthmother, a creature so disgusting, so vile, I had no choice but to lock her away. I created the five rings as a locking mechanism, a way to ensure she remained imprisoned. Now, the Immortals want to join the stones together and release her, so that she may destroy this, and all other surrounding universes, subjecting them all to her namesake filth...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney could feel a lump forming in her throat. \u201cAlright.. So... what do you want us to do about this whole thing? Jake isn\u2019t Birdboy anymore. And I\u2019m just his secretary for Christ sakes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Filthmother gets free, there\u2019s nothing that I, or anybody else can do to stop her.\u201d PuppetMistress quipped back. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need you to go and get me those rings, Jake.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake\u2019s eyebrow furrowed at that request. \u201cWait... So... you want me to prevent those five rings from being joined together... by joining the five rings together?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuppetMistress shook her head. \u201cNo, no. As long as we don\u2019t touch the actual gems to each other, they\u2019re fine. I\u2019m going to destroy them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded hesitantly, but there was still something fishy about this whole plan. \u201cAlright... continue...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe city needs Birdboy to come out of retirement. It doesn\u2019t know it, yet... but once the Immortals really start their hunt, things will get worse for this city than they ever were before...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake takes a deep breath, and he feels Courtney\u2019s hand latch onto his. It was clear all of this made her nervous as well, the idea that Jake would have to don the suit again. She had thought they\u2019d gotten away from that life. Jake swallowed his nerves and looked back up at PuppetMistress. \u201cAlright... maybe I can gather these rings up without too much trouble. Then you can destroy them, lock the Immortals away again, seal up that rift, and we all go on with our lives... so... where are the rings?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuppetMistress took a deep breath and thought long and hard about where the five rings were located. \u201cWell... Ashley was in possession of the red one... until they escaped. They used the ring to escape, and it fell into the rift once it was used, it\u2019s somewhere in that other universe...\u201d PuppetMistress scratched her chin. \u201cThe Blue One is kept in a collection, by Monica Costello, A.K.A. Nightshade...\u201d A shiver was sent up Jake\u2019s spine. The massive businesswoman who wanted nothing more than to make Jake her bitch had one of these rings, meaning that Jake would probably have to come into prolixity with her at some point to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Yellow one, the gemstone was removed, actually. I believe Brooke has used it for the centerpiece in the championship belt for that wrestling promotion she won...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake\u2019s mind harkened back to the day that he saved Metropolis from a power hungry Japanese businesswoman, and several professional wrestlers, before it all just turned out to be a test to see if Brooke could revive that near-dead promotion. If Jake recalled, he had a claim to that championship belt. It may be as easy as walking in there and asking for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe green one, rumor has it, has been being passed around on the black market as of late. Who knows what kind of shady character has it in their possession. And I\u2019m afraid the black one has been lost to time. Even I don\u2019t know where it is. But as long as it\u2019s out there, they can get their hands on it. So we need to find it and destroy it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, all of this is important, and all...\u201d Courtney had heard enough of PuppetMistress trying to drag Jake back into his superhero life. \u201cBut why can\u2019t you do this all yourself? You apparently were able to lock them away once before. Why aren\u2019t you able to do it again?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuppetMistress raised an eyebrow, and sat back, folding her arms. \u201cMaybe you weren\u2019t listening when I said there was a rip in the lining of the universe. That\u2019s where I locked them away the first time. For me to fix that rift, it\u2019s gonna take a long time, and I\u2019m gonna have to put all of my energy into it. By the time I do, they will have gotten all of the rings.\u201d Courtney rolled her eyes once again. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you go and hunt down the rings and destroy them?\u201d \u201cBecause I have to fix the rift in the universe, so we have someplace to put them before they destroy everything, you dense bitch!\u201d Both women had stood up now, and were practically screaming in each other\u2019s faces. Jake quickly stood up and got between them. \u201cGirls! Girls! Knock it off. Breathe... I\u2019ll go get the rings. I\u2019ve dealt with all of those immortal bitches before. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking his wives down, Jake thought long and hard about the task ahead of him. It had the possibility to be his most dangerous adventure yet. But this was still his city, and it was still his job to defend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake pressed a button on the desk, and one of the wall panels opened up, revealing a brand new Birdsuit. Blue and Chrome instead of the old blue and orange he once donned. PuppetMistress grinned, but Courtney was still visibly nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to save the world again, I suppose...\u201d</span></div></div>",

If anybody around them had heard what was being talked about, it would send everybody into a panic. \u201cThe Immortals are back? And they\u2019re trying to summon something called Filthmother? Fucking hell...\u201d Beth slammed her fist lightly down on the table. \u201cSo much for being done with all the hero shit...\u201d Beth sighed and leaned back. \u201cSo much for being free from all of the stink shit..\u201d Jake\u2019s lips pursed and he looked back up from his coffee. \u201cSo... does this mean that you\u2019re in?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took a moment, and a long sip of coffee, before giving Jake a hesitant nod. \u201cYeah... yeah, I\u2019m in.\u201d Jake cracked a bit of a smile. There really was no way he\u2019d be able to successfully get those rings without his old partner. \u201cGreat. I have a new catsuit prototype i\u2019ve been working on for you. Stronger armor, better gadgets, a bunch of upgrades. Should make our jobs a little easier.\u201d Beth nodded along with Jake\u2019s explanation of the suit, before raising a concern of her own. \u201cWell, that\u2019s all well and good, but we\u2019re still outnumbered to shit. Even with you, me, Courtney, and those two god friends of yours, we\u2019re gonna need more firepower to take down the Immortals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded in agreement. \u201cWay ahead of you. I went ahead and gave Sting and Dart a ring, and they said they would be down to join us. They don\u2019t wanna see anything named \u201cFilthmother\u201d around here either.\u201d Jake used another mouthful of coffee in order to stall, taking the time to figure out how he was going to word what he was about to say next. \u201cI also think we should... try to get one of the villains.\u201d Beth\u2019s face soured and her brow downshifted as she shook her head. \u201cNo. That\u2019s a horrible idea. They\u2019re just gonna get us killed... or worse.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed and bit his lip. \u201cLook, Beth... I\u2019ve been in constant contact with the prison, many of them have made leaps and bounds in the reform program. Some may even be up for parol soon. We could use their knowledge and power to level the playing field against the Immortals. Anything that gives us a better shot, we should be considering.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth crossed her arms and sighed, sitting back in her chair. \u201cYou\u2019d better be right about this... who did you have in mind anyways?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake took a moment to think about it before speaking. \u201cI was thinking we could try.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a weary sigh Jake finished putting on his suit. It almost felt wrong to wear this again after years of peace, but if what PuppetMistress was saying proved to be even partially true, the city would soon have need of its heroes again. The first thing that drew his curiosity was the rift she had mentioned. A rip into reality that led to a different universe. He could only marvel at the possibilities. Perhaps it was the location of the ring she couldn't detect. Before he left his lair, Birdboy made sure to send a message to Beth, in case she was keen to investigate all this herself. He went to where PuppetMistress had told him the rift was. When he arrived he felt a wave of uncertainty wash over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the superhero stood a strange, swirling portal. It seemed almost alive, shuddering and resonating as he stepped closer. It stood no taller than 8 feet, hovering a little off the ground. The subtle glow didn't show him anything, but there was a strange, dusty smell emanating from the gateway. Birdboy cautiously stepped closer until he was stood within touching distance. As he reached out, the mysterious energy tried to reach out to him too. Before he made contact he pulled back his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jake, do it for the city. Do it for Courtney, PuppetMistress, for Beth and everyone else.\" He whispered to himself, steeling his resolve and taking the final steps into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey through the gate was as quick as it was harrowing. His every sense was utterly distorted. He felt hot, cold, wet and dry all at the same time. His nose smelled every smell and his mouth was filled with every taste imaginable. Thankfully it only lasted a few seconds before throwing him into a surface of loose sand. The hero stood up, surveying his surroundings. He was in a narrow gorge, two towering red-brown rock walls on either side concealing the rift behind him. The fine sand was warm and the air felt dry. As he walked out from the gorge his initial suspicions were confirmed. Before him stretched a vast plain. A sea of sand with small patches of burnt grass and and hardy little bushes. The classic backdrop to so many of the westerns he'd seen growing up. The rugged landscape showed few signs of civilization, bar a post not too far from him. It stood on a road leading along the rocky hills behind him, a path splitting off and leading up into the hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gold Springs -&gt;, Gold Hills &lt;-\" It read. Beneath it was a faded pamphlet, nailed to the post. It spoke of a saloon called the Crushed Weasel, with the best drinks for miles. With a relieved smile he read that this saloon, and by extent the town, were only about a mile away, probably hidden just behind these hills. If his mission to explore this strange reality was going to offer any success, meeting up with the locals seemed like a solid start. Just to be on the safe side he left a tracking beacon by the portal. He also took a moment to memorize his surroundings, should he ever need to get back to the portal in a hurry and not have access to his tech. He couldn't be too careful. Who only knew what mysteries this world still held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short trek in the hot sun he saw the first buildings emerge from behind the hill. It looked like a town lifted straight from one of his westerns and he quickly approached. But as he drew near enough to see the first few citizens he realized something was off. More than a few of them seemed to have... odd colors. As he wandered closer he saw it wasn't just that. Their skin was covered in fur and their faces adorned with muzzles of all shapes and sizes. It dawned on him that every last person in this town was an anthro animal of some kind. As he reached the outer edge of town some of the townsfolk had spotted him too. They stared with disbelief at Birdboy, who began to feel a little awkward. He was no stranger to anthro animals, as more than a few of the supervillains he fought were part animal. But it quickly dawned on him that he might be the first human to step foot in this universe, and he was dressed up in a superhero suit to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not citizens, I'm not here to hurt anyone.\" He said with his best heroic voice, but the strange looks didn't dissipate. One of the drunks stumbling out of the saloon glared at him, then back at his bottle, wondering if this odd hairless thing was just a figment of his imagination. Birdboy began to feel increasingly uncomfortable, but in all this there was one small relief. As he heard the citizens of Gold Springs whisper to eachother about him, he could discern that they at least spoke English. Of all the issues that might present itself, at least translation wouldn't be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy there, partner.\" A voice rang out. A red fox woman stepped closer, waving her hand. She was roughly the same size as him, with a bushy tail and a fiery red hairdo. Her curious eyebrow was raised high enough to nearly pop off her face and her hand hovered over the holster of her revolver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" Jake politely replied. \"Don't worry, I don't mean anyone any harm.\" He hastily added, easing her nerves somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll say, ah ain't ever seen somethin like you walk into town. What's yer name, stranger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Birdboy.\" He stammered, knowing how crazy it must sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bird... boy? You from the circus or somethin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" He sighed wearily. He was going to get this from a lot of people here, he could already tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ya should tell me sometime along with a drink. Name's April, April Briggs. Ah'm the deputy of the sheriff in these parts. Ya might've heard of her. The name Texas Stanton ring a bell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm not from around here, but if she's with local law enforcement I might have a few questions for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, and ah bet she's got more than a few for you too.\" April laughs. \"Sheriff's office is down the street, ya can't miss it. And since yer new in town, lemme give you some quick advice. First, get yourself a weapon, 'cause walkin around unarmed is a good way to get robbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, miss April, I'm well capable of defending myself.\" He replied confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ya say so... Anyway, there's some folks ya wanna keep an eye out for around here. First's Georgia. She's a big ol' horse woman with a temper like a rabid wolverine. She's an old deputy of Texas that got kicked out, and she's still grumpy about that. Unless you're lookin to get squashed underneath her ass, steer clear of her.\" The hero sighed a little. Of all the things this place could have in common with his home town, why did it have to be evildoers that like to use their butt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next is Vivian, the mayor. Don't trust her honeyed words. Not gonna say more, 'cause she got ears everywhere.\" Birdboy noticed a couple of individuals trying to stay unnoticed as they were listening in on the two of them. He just nodded, prompting April to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly there's Roxxie Roo. She rolls into town every so often to try her luck at robbing someone. Do not get in her way. Bigger folk than you have tried and she's dragged them all off to her lair in the hills. Most o' them we never saw again. Ain't many fates more cruel than endin up as her plaything. There's also Smiling Jacks and her gang, but unless you're a cow or someone tryin to stop them from stealin cattle, you ain't gonna notice them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" He asks, trying to hide his sarcasm. For having such a supposedly famous sheriff there sure was a lot of crime going around. He began to wonder why this Texas was so popular around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that about covers it, welcome to Gold Springs, Birdboy.\" April said with a small giggle as she tried to keep a straight face when saying his name. She gives the hero a mighty smack on his back before continuing on her way. </span></div></div>",

His walk through town is met with just as many stares and whispered comments as when he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, at the end of the street was a building with the word \"SHERIFF\" in big bold letters on the front. Even a poor gambler could win this guessing game. Wanting to get off the street quick, Jake opens the door and walks in. Just inside, her sees April from before talking to a female... rat? gerbil? rodent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swear to God Texas, he was some kind of hairless ape dressed up like a bird. He looked like one of them acrobat people at the circus. Had a name like one too. 'Birdboy' he called himself.\" She says with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean April.\" The rodent replies. When April gives her a look of confusion, she points the fox's attention to the door where the hero stood. \"He came in while you were laughing about him.\" April realizes her mistake and backs off to let the two speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're this sheriff Texas I heard so much about? I gotta say, I wasn't expecting you to be some kind of rodent.\" She looks angered by the hero's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's 'weasel' to you son, you'd best remember that. But I'm sure you're not here to split hairs and neither am I. Let's just get right down to brass tacks... Birdboy, was it?\" He nods. \"So, what are you? Where are you from? And most importantly, what are you doing here in Gold Springs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Jake respond?</span></div></div>",

You must believe me.\" Jake explains, pulling a chair up to Texas' desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, right now I'm staring at some kind of hairless ape dressed up in an armored birdsuit that even circus folk would call too much. I'd say I'm in a very believing mood right now.\" She responds as she leans in to stare the hero in the eye. Jake, meanwhile, was a bit angered by her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start there. I'm not a 'hairless ape', I'm a human. If you don't want me calling you rodent, then you treat me with the same respect. Okay?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. Sorry about that pardner, but nothing like you has ever been seen 'round these parts. So where you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where the weirdness starts. I'm from a completely different dimension, one where humans are the dominant species and anthropomorphic animals like you guys are usually a result of science gone wrong.\" The sheriff shares a confused look with her deputy before turning back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Putting aside this 'multiple dimensions' business for later. What exactly are you supposed to be in this world of yours then, some kind of circus performer? What's with the outfit?\" April questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my world, I'm what's known as a super hero. I help the police put away criminals from the standard thug to super villains. The whole point of the costume is to keep the people of my world from knowing who I am so I'm not hounded by fans or targeted by my enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So you're some kind of vigilante. I can respect that I suppose. Already then, now on to the million dollar question. What are you doing here?\" Texas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strap yourselves in ladies. This is going to be a long one.\" Jake goes on to explain everything about the mission. The immortals, Puppetmistress, the rings, and finally, the Filthmother. \"So that's everything I know.\" Jake wraps up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're out to save the multiverse from this Filthmother, and to do so, you need to find these magic rings before the immortals can, and give them to Puppetmistress so she can destroy them?\" Texas recaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Apparently, when the immortals escaped, the red ring they used fell into a dimensional rift, which coincidentally leads to your world. I need your help to track it down before they do.\" After hearing this, Texas sat in silence for several minutes, processing all this, before finally speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright pardner, you've got my help. On two conditions.\" She says, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number one, I'm coming with you even after you find the ring here. From the sound of it, you could use all the help you can get, and my world is in just as much trouble as yours. So if you want my help, then you're gettin' it all the way to the final showdown with these immortals. No macho man bravado about going alone.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine to me. What's the second term?\" Jake asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to take off that mask and tell me your real name. I ain't about to go running around with some mystery man. You can put it back on right away and I'll keep calling you Birdboy in public, but if we're going to work together, then I need to know that there's a mutual trust here.

Instead he goes on the offensive, turning the interrogation onto the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be out of town before you know it. But for that I need to know where to go. Now, I was wondering if there's anyone around that's in tune with the... paranormal.\" Jake shivered a bit to use that word. But if anyone would know about a mysterious ring of power, it'd probably be some soothsayer or fortune teller. He saw the weasel's scowl worsen substantially. She had about as much disdain for that fake hocus pocus as he did, and his attitude probably didn't earn him any favors either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen here and you listen closely, little bird. I done asked you a question and until I am satisfied with your answer I'm well considering you too dangerous to let walk about. Folk around here don't take kindly to strange creatures threatening to 'neutralize' them. So unless you wanna try an' find your expert in my jail, I suggest you start telling me what I want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed with frustration. \"I do not have time to waste on introductions. You wouldn't believe me anyway. For everyone's sanity, please just point me to the nearest fortune teller so I can leave you all in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas buries her face in her hands, groaning with frustration. Was it really going to be one of these days? She didn't want this odd, hairless thing to walk about and accost the citizens of Gold Springs. But if he was speaking the truth, maybe it was good enough to just point him where he needed to go and leave it at that. She trusted the scrawny freak about as far as she could throw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she were to agree, who should she send him to? The weasel briefly mulled over her options. Gold Springs was in no short supply of con men and other tricksters trying to part the more gullible citizens from their money. Maybe some of them could deal with this annoying brat. Two sprung to mind right away. Penelope Rabbit was a hypnotist of some skill. She given the bunny a stern warning after she'd hypnotized the owner of the bank to give her a large sum of money. Thankfully Texas was there to intervene before she could get away. Unfortunately the bank director loved the whole act and insisted the bunny not be accused of anything other than being real talented. Maybe she can convince this birdbrain to leave town before he gets himself in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand there was Abrajin, the strange witchdoctor that resided just outside town. Her wagon was stuffed with strange trinkets and using her so-called 'magic powers' she claimed to be able to help with just about anything. From premonitions to cures, she had it all. Curiously she didn't seem interested in money, freely giving her boons and blessings to those who asked. Though people claimed her tricks to be working, Texas remained apprehensive. If this creature was looking for someone to find a weird trinket of his own, she might well be able to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the sheriff decide?</span></div></div>",

If he could gain access to just one of them, and give it to PuppetMistress to destroy before the Immortals could use it to summon Filthmother, it would be a huge weight off his shoulders. He\u2019d then just have to figure out how he was going to lock the Immortals back up, but he could worry about that when the world wasn\u2019t in danger of being destroyed by some sort of Eldritch Abomination. Jake decided that the blue ring would be the easiest to tackle right now. It was the only one that he knew of location of for sure. The red one was lost in some sort of parallel world, the yellow one was in some sort of championship belt, which he didn\u2019t know the location of, and the green and black ones could be anywhere. Unfortunately, for Jake, this meant he\u2019d be running into Monica Costello, A.K.A. Nightshade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade was one of the few villains in Metropolis who wasn\u2019t behind bars, and she herself was the CEO and Chairman of her own gigantic tech company, Costello Enterprises. The 6\u20198 Amazonian billionaire had her own obsession with the young Blackridge, and had created her own supersuit, to go along with her horrific brand of stench, in order to corral Birdboy, due to her suspicions that the hero and Jake were one in the same. No doubt, if Monica caught Jake anywhere near her private estate, she\u2019d have a lethal dose of her disgusting breath, and a horrific buttcrushing session waiting for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake donned the suit, and later that night, set out to the Costello Estate. It wasn\u2019t that far from Blackridge Manor, located in the upper-upper-upper scale part of the area surrounding Metropolis, where many of the Uber-rich were housed. Jake climbed the gate and quickly dove down into the hedges to survey the area. Any sort of capture would no doubt put him right into Nightshade\u2019s gigantic, filthy hands. He had to be careful about this, and he had to find a way into that mansion... </span></div></div>",

Jake thought about knocking the guard out and taking his clothes, but he\u2019d have to do it quick. There was no telling when the next guard would be around on patrol, and Jake needed to get inside of that house as soon as possible. As soon as the guard walked by the bushes, Jake grabbed him and pulled him into a sleeper hold, knocking the guard out quickly. Jake began to strip the guard, putting on his clothing. Luckily for Jake, the guard uniform came with a face concealing helmet, so that if Monica happened to catch a glimpse of him, she\u2019d have no idea it was him sneaking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake picked up the guards rifle and continued on the guards patrol pattern, slowly working his way into the house. As soon as he did, however, alarms in the house began to go off. \u201cATTENTION: DNA SENSORS ACTIVE.

I\u2019ve got some new toys to show him...\u201d Monica stepped over to a pannel on the wall, and pressed her hand onto a handprint reader. Jake watched in horror as the New Nightshade suit emerged from the wall. Her new suit resembled Power Armor more closely than anything else, and there was no telling what kind of weapons and gadgets the suit possessed.

Jake calmed his nerves a bit, and waited for the elevator to arrive at its destination. Once it did, Jake slipped out, and began to check each room, carefully for any kind of ring that might resemble the one he was looking for. He wasn\u2019t having any luck to this point, each room he entered and checked seemed to be nothing more but guest bedrooms, nothing anyone would keep anything of value in. Jake finally arrived at a large set of double doors- Monica\u2019s bedroom. It would be his best bet to find the stone, at least on this floor. Jake slipped inside and quickly began to search through drawers, jewelers boxes, and practically anything else he could find. Despite practically turning the room upside down and inside out, he found absolutely nothing that even resembled the gemstone he was looking for. Jake knew his time was limited, and he had an entire mansion to search, so he didn\u2019t bother to put the room back together as he slipped back outside of it.... and walked right into the metal chestplate of Nightshade\u2019s Armor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell look what we have here...\u201d Monica pulled the helmet off of Jake\u2019s Head, revealing the face of the billionaire vigilante who she had become obsessed with. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Jake Blackridge, sneaking about like the little rat he is...\u201d Jake quickly tried to throw a strike at the massive armored woman, but his arm was caught by one of her massive power gauntlets. Jake\u2019s face was grabbed by the other, and from an opening in the palm of the hand, a massive blast of methane was forced into Jake\u2019s face, up his nose and down his throat. The suit of Power Armor saved Nightshade\u2019s farts in order to weaponize them like so, and the blast was enough to knock Jake out cold, leaving him at the mercy of the creepy cougar... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake awoke to find that each of his limbs had been bound, and he had been stripped naked, and strung up, spread eagle, with a spotlight on him. He was in some sort of dark dungeon, placed on display, no doubt part of the sick fantasies of One Monica Costello. The clicking of heeled boots began to echo throughout the large dungeon, as his captor made her presence known to him. \u201cSneaking around my mansion... rifling through my panty drawer.. my my, Jake. It seems I\u2019m irresistible to you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake tried to respond, but he\u2019d been gagged. The horrific taste of nightshade\u2019s panties tormented his palet, held in by a piece of duct tape over his mouth. Monica giggled. \u201cAt a loss for words? How adorable. Don\u2019t worry, little one. From this day forward, the only words you\u2019ll ever have to say again are: \u201cYes, Mommy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade punctuated that sentence with a laugh that sent shivers down Jake\u2019s spine, as she closed the distance between them, ready to play with her new toy...</span></div></div>",

Given Vashnara's reclusive nature and hatred of humans, she'd probably be looking for the black gem, so there's no telling where she'd be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left Akush\u016b and these two new opponents. Given her hatred of Brooke and experience dealing with mortals and manipulating them, Akush\u016b could be going after any of the three remaining gems! Luckily, he at least had a lead on her. A certain catboy who'd recently been released on good behavior. That didn't mean it wouldn't be dangerous to see him though. Neko seemed to have this sort of innocence to him. An inability to tell when he was actually doing something harmful or illegal. Jake could never tell if it was an act or not, but Neko could still accidentally end up turning Jake into his personal kitty toy...again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Bilefoot, Stinkromancer, and these two newcomers, Jake would need someone with magic to really confirm where they were. Or someone who could track. Goth Goddess would be invaluable in sensing the whereabouts of powerful magic users, and the Packmaster's hounds could track the Immortals halfway across the world, maybe even more given the potency of their stink. The only issues there was that both candidates were tricky, manipulative, and in prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, he could just use his wealth and contacts to find the green gem on the black market.

He needed Packmaster's dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard out in the front area lazily twirled his baton around, humming a tune to himself. Things had been mostly quiet ever since Bir...B-birdboy!

I'll have them give you access to the maximum security wing and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be neccessary. I'm just here for Packmaster. Last I checked, he and his dogs weren't in there.\" After all, they just stole some stuff and knocked people out. Jake had always felt a tad guilty, given that his company had basically created Packmaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was led down the halls of the prison, which had all been fitted with stench-sealing cells, until he was brought face to face with Packmaster. The scientist glanced up at his visitor and scoffed, \"let me guess. You need my help with something? I hope you've got something to offer me in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed, he figured it'd come to this. \"Yeah. Jake Blackridge has agreed to fork over funding for you to open up your own genetic research facility. One you can run without corporate oversight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPackmaster grinned, \"funny that Mr. Blackridge cares so much about me all of a sudden. I'm sure you had to work very hard to convince him, didn't you? Especially since his company tried to kill my pets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake could hear the mix of malice and superiority in Packmaster's voice. He knew. Of course he knew, his damn fox was a telepath. \"Jake cares about the safety of the planet. Which is why he's willing to deal with a thief like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake could see Packmaster clench his fists, but he released them soon after and just laughed. \"Well, you can tell him that I'M convinced! But no doubt you're more interested in my pets. I think you'll find that they'll need to be convinced as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am, Birdboy! Epsilon and Omega miss you! Go on! Go say hi!\" Packmaster cackled and sat back down on his bed. Ugh...this was the last thing Jake needed right now. He didn't exactly have fond memories of Epsilon. Hell, he honestly wasn't entirely sure what she even looked like, given that she was invisible most of the time.

No doubt Epsilon would want something... it was what she would want that made him nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro was practically waiting for him, posted up against the back wall of her cell, eyeing Birdboy with a look that was just a little too close to bedroom eyes for his comfort. \u201cWould you look who\u2019s come crawling for me to help...\u201d Epsilon giggles and pushes off the back wall, stepping closer to the bulletproof glass that separates them. \u201cAnd just what is it you need, Mr. Superhero?\u201d Jake took a deep breath, and straightened out his back. \u201cI need people tracked... not just any people. Some of the most powerful villains in existence.\u201d Epsilon laughed and turned around, making sure to tauntingly wag her tail at him as she walked to the back of her cell again. \u201cSounds a little dangerous for my liking. You have fun though, Birdboy!\u201d Her laughter was supposed to indicate that this conversation was over, but Jake was desperate. He needed to find out where the immortals were hiding out. \u201cWait!.... please. I need your help... I\u2019ll-....\u201d Jake swallowed the last of his pride, and his nerve. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Epsilon finally turned around, with a large grin on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was waiting for, dear boy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake could already feel as if he was making a mistake, but it was too late to back out now, and he needed the help. \u201cTell you what. When you get out of here, while the Packy and the other four are out searching for the Immortals location, you and I are going to be taking a detour. Back to our lair... and back to my room. And once we get there, you\u2019re going to do everything I say, until they get back.

The Husky seemed unfazed though, and laid down on her bed. For the first time, Jake actually had the opportunity to look at the husky, and she was damn fine to look at! For an anthro dog anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsilon took note of his starting and shamelessly spread her legs! \"Like something you see, Jake? Well, if you want to have a little fun, I wouldn't mind. Buuut, we really should speak first. No doubt you've got a few questions for me, and I've got a few for you~\" Epsilon sat up on her bed and motioned for Jake to come sit down. He still wasn't too happy about getting close to the gassy canine, but he didn't quite have a choice either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsilon smiled as Jake sat down by her, \"see? Nothing naughty. At least, not yet~ Now, no doubt you've figured out that Omega managed to learn your secret identity ages ago. Needless to say, Packy was steamed when he learned who you are. You were knocked out on Omega's breath at the time, and he wanted to straight up brainwash you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rolled his eyes, \"wouldn't be the first time someone tried. Heck, it wouldn't even be the twelfth. But, I'll bite. Why didn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omega, Beta, and I convinced him not to. He wanted revenge on you for something you couldn't have known. Unfortunately, before we could actually ask if you knew what the company did to us, you'd already up and escaped! So, I ask you now...did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time, he really hadn't. \"No. I only found out after you were all incarcerated. Still, you were stealing and assaulting people! You had t-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsilon put a finger to Jake's lips. \"I know, I know. Everyone but Gamma was reluctant when we started. You know how she is though, always eager to make someone sniff her pits. And the rest of us, well, we have a very hard time saying no to Packy. Between you and me, I think he's done some experimenting on himself. Some sort of suggestion pheromones. And, I've never seen him take off his shoes...anyways, couple that with our medical problems and we fell in line easily enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake raised an eyebrow, \"medical problems? You all seemed fine when we fought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we had them figured out by the time we started robbing bigger places. Like I said, it's hard to say no to Packy. But at the start, it was bad. Blackridge inc. swooped in the instant we developed powers. They ordered our termination without waiting to see if we developed side effects. Which...we all did. My body expended too much energy when I cloaked, I could hardly stay invisible for thirty seconds before fainting. Beta couldn't handle the G-forces her speed produced, Omega would get migraines that lasted for days, Gamma ended up coughing blood after every couple barks, and Alpha was just a pain cocktail of all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake glared at the husky, \"that still doesn't justif-:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, sweetie. Just trying to give you a little perspective is all.\" By now, Jake realized that Epsilon's hand was in his pants. \"Unfortunately, Packy is still expecting me to mess with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake tried to pull away, but Epsilon already had her other arm wrapped around him! \"Relax...I'll try to make it painless as possible.\"</span></div></div>",

There was a lot of muscle in those cheeks, and they dropped down like a wrecking ball onto Jake\u2019s poor face. Jake wanted to scream or beg for her to stop, but when he opened his mouth, he was met with a particularly raunchy fart, right on his tongue. Jake quickly learned to keep his mouth shut, and stop struggling too much. Epsilon could make this as easy or has hard as she needed it to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpsilon quickly got into her rhythm, pumping out fart after fart onto the poor helpless face of Birdboy, all while he had no chance but to lay there and take each and every ounce of gas that she blew his way.

Of course, the husky wasn't having any of this. \"Hmph, guess you aren't quite as helpless as I thought.\" In response, Epsilon forced a huge combo of her rancid farts right up Jake's nose! The rotten stench completely overwhelmed Jake's senses and his limbs flopped back down on the bed. \"Theeere you go. I'm doing you a favor, sweetie. The longer you're in here with me, the less time you have to spend with the others once they've found their targets. Besides, if Packy sees you walking around the house unsupervised, you'll probably find yourself staring at a screen with a spiral on it while he fastens a brainwashing helmet to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jake completely pacified, Epsilon was free to slide the hero's pants off. She grinned as his semi-erect cock slipped out. \"My blowjobs aren't as good as having psychically enhanced sex with Omega or a super speed footjob from Beta. I'm more of a straight up sex girl. But I'm sure you'll still find mine much better than a human's.\" With that, her maw descended on his dick. Disgusted as he was at the situation...she was right! His private time with Courtney didn't even come close! Epsilon's mouth felt amazing! He was fully erect in an instant! Her sucking just felt so...perfect...his mind started to betray him as he started to wonder what the other canines were like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Epsilon found it adorable that her sucking seemed to have Jake in a bit of a stupor, but she had her orders. Thus, another blast from her ass quickly reminded Jake that he was an unwilling participant in all this! And that was pretty much the pattern for the next few minutes. Epsilon would suck him off, pause to make him suffer, then go back to sucking. Of course, against pleasure this good, Jake didn't last more than that few minutes! He lacked the strength to thrust into Epsilon's maw, but all the same he flooded it with cum! Epsilon happily gulped down every drop before finally releasing Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and I thought Packy was a quick shot! Not going to lie, Jake...that was pretty pathetic~\" Epsilon winked at him and sat back down on the bed. \"Well, my job is done, I suppose. You're free to explore the lab if you want. Just remember what I said about the brainwash thing.\"</span></div></div>",

Epsilon decided she was going to check in with the rest of her gang, and see what they found out. They were all gathered into the usual meeting room, although they were speaking in hushed tones, that is, until Epsilon got there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys...\u201d she said, a hint of curiosity in her tone as she stepped into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Did you find them?\u201d Packmaster was of course the one to speak up. \u201cYeah, we did. Unfortunately, they knew they were being tracked and led us into a trap. We\u2019re all okay though.

If they really were trying to wake up some sort of Eldritch Abomintion, And Jake was the only hope of stoping them, hanging him over to them was basically a death sentence for the entire world. Plus, Epsilon had grown rather fond of Jake. It\u2019s the reason she had asked Packmaster to make sure that he goes and sees her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, though, Epsilon had never gone against the others before, and she did owe Packmaster a life debt.

Akush\u016b was walking towards him while wearing a pair of those raised block sandal things...Jake didn't know the technical name for them, nor did he ever care to look it up. Akush\u016b probably knew the name, but she was probably just calling them sandals so he and Ashley knew what she was talking about.

I'll let you know when he's ready.\" Lust once again started to course through Jake's veins as Akush\u016b started wrapping him in her tails again. Ashley didn't need to be told twice though, she left the area without a fuss, allowing Akush\u016b to drag Jake away to her room.

Really like the swords on the wall. Might be nice enough to put them back once I use them t-yhehyAAAAAH!\" Akush\u016b's tails slipped into his armor all at once, using every available opening!

His vision clouded over in a pink haze and he just laid there moaning while Akush\u016b stripped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...even with all that bravado. A male is still a male, dear. Easy to disarm, easier to manipulate.\" With a snap of her fingers, Akush\u016b disrobed. Jake's jaw nearly dropped to the floor as he stared at the vixen who was now nude save those sandal things. \"Now, before you so rudely interrupted our game...I believe the bet was if you cum, you'll smell my Geta. They'll damage your precious mind, and you'll become obsessed with being tortured! It's my favorite place to make people end up, honestly. They hate everything about it...but they can't stop! A fitting punishment for someone like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkush\u016b rummaged around in her drawers and pulled out a sock that, with a snap of her fingers, smelled putrid enough that it almost breached Jake's lust trance! Of course...a bit of rubbing from the tails put an end to that. The Kitsune cackled and climbed on top of her prey. \"Since you were rude enough to end our game last time, I figured we'd try a more difficult version!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake gave no response...until Akush\u016b hilted Jake inside her, causing the hero to let out a bliss-fueled scream! It was like heaven! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. You didn't cum just from that? I'm honestly surprised. The number of men who've gone off from insertion alone might actually surprise you.\" Akush\u016b smirked and laid her vile sock on the hero's face. \"So...here's how this works. If you pass out before you cum, without that cheap trick, I'll spare you! If you cum first well...we've already discussed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkush\u016b started moving her hips, and Jake felt like he was going to blow already!

Jake dropped back to the mattress, breathing heavily and sweating profusely from the orgasm he\u2019d just experienced.

Akush\u016b lifted up one of her feet and pressed it against the hero's face, and Jake started sniffing before she even released the spell holding her foot odor in! \"Oh my! You really do want my stinky feet, don't you sweetheart? Well, here you go!\" With a snap of her fingers, the Kitsune's vile, ancient foot odor was brought out! Jake immediately started to choke and sputter on the vile stench! Sure, it wasn't as potent as her sandal, but the overwhelming stink of vinegary sweat was still enough to quickly overwhelm any mortal! His eyes crossed by the first whiff, and in two more, he fell unconscious. Akush\u016b looked down and flashed a toothy grin when she saw Jake's rock hard erection. Her sandals had worked flawlessly! \"Mmm...now who to give you to? I've a child that needs rearing...and enchanting with those new stench tomes...\"</span></div></div>",

The drapes had been shut, and the windows completely blacked out, in order to prevent any sunlight from getting through. This was the dwelling of Ashley Bilefoot, the foot Vampiress, Jake\u2019s previous mistress while he\u2019d been a vampire himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you were screwed from the second you tried to stop us.\u201d Bilefoot spoke, causing Jake to tilt his head up to look at her. She was standing in the corner of the dark room, undetected until she made herself known. \u201cAkushu had already brainwashed Packmaster, along with a few other of the anthros. Any of the other villains you could\u2019ve turned to for help against us were turned into my vampires before you even knew about our plan. Truly, you didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake\u2019s spine shivered once again.

Filthmother spoke to us specifically from the void she\u2019s trapped in. She wanted you, Jake. She requested you as her victim and slave by name. Really, you should be honored. It\u2019s an even greater privilege than to be selected as my original first turn...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, real honored, gee, thanks for sacrificing me to some sort of stench god...\u201d Ashley chuckled and drew closer to Jake, standing over him at his bedside now. \u201cWe don\u2019t have long now, boy... but I do have time for one last meal...\u201d </span></div></div>",

Knowing that you'll still squirm and whine, but can't resist my feet? It's a dream come true!\" Jake shivered the moment that the Vampire brought up her putrid feet. Fantasies of being smothered and drained by them flashed through his mind. Ashley just watched with glee as Jake's dick began to stiffen again. \"I heard you knocked Akush\u016b up! Good for you! A few centuries ago, men would have killed for such an honor! I hope you two have a son who's as cute as you.\" Ashley smirked and crawled onto the bed, making sure she was face to face with the hero. \"Well...as long as Filthmother doesn't stink them both to death for copulating with, and being born to, a mortal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Jake began to panic at that! He hadn't been able to explain it, but he'd started to feel...attached to the Kitsune ever since he came in her. \"Wait...she can't do that...please don't let her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Awww! Heh, looks like someone didn't realize that her sandals aren't the only enchanted thing about her! But enough about that stinky old fox! Let's move onto more important topics...like my feet.\" Ashley stomped her boot clad peds on either side of Jake's head and flashed a hungry grin that made him feel...well, uneasy was an understatement really. But at the same time, he couldn't help but feel excited at the prospect of smelling Ashley's feet again! Ashley just couldn't get enough of that look! A mix of dread and eagerness that she just adored! \"And just so you know...they've only gotten worse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ashley yanked her boots off and Jake was hit with the vile stench of her unwashed feet! His nose burned as the stench of moldy cheese and hot vinegar filled his lungs. He started to retch immediately, yet he couldn't stop himself from taking deep sniffs of the vile fog emanating off Ashley's soles. \"S...so...smelly...\" he whimpered out, causing Ashley to cackle. This was absolutely precious! The once mighty Birdboy reduced to a torture obsessed stink bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, slave! And now for my snack!\" Ashley mashed her pale, toxic soles down on Jake's face and let out a shuddering moan as his vitality started to flow into her. \"Ooohhh yes...I forgot how good you taste!\" Jake, meanwhile, could feel his strength start draining extremely quickly! No doubt because he was actively smelling the foot vampire's feet! His disgusted squirming came to an end in seconds. Yet still he sniffed. Even as he felt his life force flow out of his body! He felt...so weak. Jake briefly worried about Ashley killing him, but his new mindset took over, assuring him that this would be a great way to go out...gagging on vampire feet.</span></div></div>",

But with one in another dimension, two are omly rumors, and one is unknown completely, he had no idea where to start unless he wanted to take on Nightshade right now. He'll need help, more than just what Beth could provide. He'll need help from someone who could think like these criminals, as well as help him locate the rings. He needs a villain. He returned home to retrieve his old Birdboy costume, along the way deciding who to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to smelly immortals, the first one to come to mind was Goth Goddess. Her hypnotic powers could be a great asset in helping him grab some of the rings. Plus, the origin of her powers was such a mystery, it could end up being that she knows about them. She was currently being held in solitary confinement in the maximum security wing to reduce the chance of her hypnotizing someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... one of the rings is somewhere out on the black market, and another completely missing. If he wanted to find them, he'd need contacts and resources. Two things that Brooke Armstrong, aka \"Queen Bee\", had in spades. The young brat was recently put in after he and Beth finally scrapped together enough evidence to link her to crimes she organised. Upon her arrest, she was forced to turn over the belt that supposedly held the yellow ring. However, her riches were able tp lighten her sentence and get her a cushier stay in prison. Those riches could be of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow ring's current location worried him. If he did have to put a fight to get it, it would be wise to get someone skilled in martian arts. That's when he was reminded of... his own mother. Codenamed \"The Amazon\", she was a massive woman who was skilled in multiple forms of combat, all of which he found out from first hand experience. She was currently ruling over the inmates in the prison, and even a couple guards, so they'd have no issue getting her out. Maybe she can act like a good mother for once and help her son when he needs it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it might be better to go with someone he can trust a lot more. No matter what they bring to the table, an ally he can trust is better than one that might betray him. Skunkette was a prime candidate. She made no effort to hide her love of him, and only became a villain due to her being ridiculed. She would've been released on good behavior by now if it weren't for the volitile nature of her powers making her a safety risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother viable option was another woman who had a thing for him. His old arch-enemy Footgirl. While certainly not as trustworthy as Skunkette, she made up for it with more power at her disposal, with combat skills equal to his own. She shared in Skunkette's affection for him, but she was more controlling with it. She was actually in her final year of her reform program, so this might help all parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning home and getting his old costume, it was clear who his choice was going to be...</span></div></div>",

Without having to worry about constant attacks from the disgusting villains, the city was able to invest more in its infastructure, it\u2019s technology, and other programs for the overall wellfare of its citizens. Jake Blackridge and Beth Thompson had hung up their superhero garb, and set out to use their new free time to make the city a better place in ways that didn\u2019t involve crime fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, something went wrong. The Immortals, a conglomeration of villains older than time, and more powerful than imagination, escaped from the inter-dimensional prison they\u2019d been locked in by PuppetMistress, and now look to collect the five Keys of the Cleansed, in order to unleash the horrible Harbinger of Filth, an eldritch abomination known only as Filthmother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seems that in escaping their prison, they seem to have opened a rift into another universe... one that leads to a small, desert town, known as Gold Springs, inhabited by one Sheriff Texas Stanton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The Immortals:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ashley Bilefoot:</b> <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/13333222222212222222221\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lady Akushu:</b> <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/1333322222221222222222222221\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Countess Vashnara:</b> <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/13333222222212222222222222231\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stinkromancer:</b> <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/1551\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1934117-Smelly-super-villains/map/...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd introducing, for the first time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Queen Froststench:</b> Queen Froststench is an ancient and lonely entity, sister to the Stinkromancer. Tens of thousands of years old, this 7 foot tall goddess has resided in a great tower in Northern lands, after all this time only the surrounding villages revere her, but for good reason! She has complete power over the cold. A true goddess of entropy. She is gentle and sweet, yet rather cruel. She loves nothing more than keeping mortals at her side, in a constant frozen state where they can still serve her and never die. Her victims will spend eternity as her cockwarmer, forced to drink her breast milk and eat from her long, eternally unwashed feet! So far she has no intention of interloping in mortal affairs, but she wouldn't mind freezing the Earth into her domain either....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pladaria:</b> In the times of old where honour was defended by knights, there lived one know as \"She of the Moss\". A great and terrible knight wearing mossy green plate mail. All that would cross her path would be taken into \"her domain\", a place no one had seen...or escaped. Very little was known about her until she began assaulting and ransacking villages with her damned soldiers. It was said any who was afflicted by her curses would be a thrall to her mark, and be unable to talk to anyone, but her. The fiefdoms banded together to fight the monstrous knight, who faught without sword or mace, preferring to pick up her opponents with her gauntlets and crush them beneath her gigantic ass. Her breath, rotten as death itself, spread the curse. Another method she took was to spit in the wells of villages, contaminating any who drunk her saliva. For the worst of her enemies she reserved her slime, from either swampy ass or feet. They afflicted an additional effect, they would become unable to pass out! Eventually her corruption was cornered and banished beneath the earth to a distant land...America...she was buried alive, but despite dieing, her curse persisted and preserved her. When she reaches the fresh air she shall awaken...and continue her conquest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill our heroes will able to stop the Immortals?

While all characters established in both stories are okay to make an apperence here, it is asked that if you wish to create new, orginial characters, you do so in the orginal stories themselves, rather than in this story here. Other rules are pretty simple, use good spelling and grammar as always, no additions under 1000 characters, and please, god, DO NOT start a \u201cWell, how about this thing\u201d chain. You know what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019re reading an interactive, and suddenly, you come across 12 chapters in a row that are asking if something happens, with the choices being \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d, with only the \u201cNo\u201d path filled out, and it just leads to another yes or no question. Any chapters like that in this story will be deleted. Repeat offenders will be banned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, just have fun! And I encourage you to check out the original SSV, along with SquashedFlat\u2019s \u201cAdventures of Texas\u201d! The links to both stories are below.
