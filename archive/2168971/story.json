She had eyes like her son's but was wearing glasses and was wearing a white T-shirt and grey sweatpants. Her appearance could be described as \"dumpy\", very short but quite heavy. She also had pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's father Francis was present too, standing up and looking down at Kyle. His hair was curly like his son's, but it was dark brown, and he had small blue eyes.<br>\r\nFrancis was wearing a blue shirt and green shorts, and he was thin like his son and of average height. His skin was fair, but pinker than his wife and son's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was the only child of Francis and Shannon, and they loved him dearly.<br>\r\nHe reached out his hand and grabbed the armrest.<br>\r\n\"That's it, Kyle!\" said Francis.<br>\r\nThen, Kyle began walking along awkwardly, holding onto the side of the couch.<br>\r\nWhen he reached the end, he fell over backwards.<br>\r\n\"You'll get the hang of it sometime,\" said Shannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hi! So, I was inspired to write this story because I was browsing the website and I saw that there was a story about potty training. I thought that it was kind of funny how there was a whole story just about kids learning a basic skill and I thought, \"It's not like there's any stories about kids learning other basic skills\" and then I thought, \"Hey, I could write one!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Some unrelated things can happen to keep the story interesting, but the main focus should be on the kids learning basic skills.<br>\r\n2.) No time skips that last a year or more.<br>\r\n3.) A bit of toilet humour is fine, as long as it doesn't go overboard.<br>\r\n4.) No nausea/throwing up/etc or sleep deprivation. I just don't like those topics. Also, nobody should get sick. Minor injuries are fine but no serious injuries. Disabilities are fine as long as they've always been present (e.g. introducing a character who's blind is find but it's less fine to have a character <i>go</i> blind.)<br>\r\n5.) No racism/sexism/homophobia/etc unless it's an antagonist who believes those things or a kid learning about how stereotyping is wrong. This includes things like \"dolls are for girls\" and stuff like that.<br>\r\n6.) Romance between adults or kids playing at things like getting married is fine, but no explicit sexual stuff. Pregnancy is OK as long as it's an adult. Nudity is fine as long as it's in a *non-sexual* context. And absolutely *no* incest, pedophilia, adultery or bestiality.<br>\r\n7.) No serious topics like divorce, substance abuse, death, psychological problems, etc.<br>\r\n8.) If a character disappears or transforms, they have to go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun.</td>",
