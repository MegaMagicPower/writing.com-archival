The Savannah has been completely barren of prey, they have moved on the find better grasslands and better water sources. the only animals that still remained in this barren land is a pride of lions that live within a cave near a water hole. the pride slept soundly in the darkness of the cave when a small form stirred and woke from his slumber, its was one of the older cubs of the pride named kwasi. the cub yawned and padded outside, all the clouds were a dark Grey and the sky blending into them and the cub sighed and his little belly gurgled loudly as he padded over to the water hole and crouched down to take a drink from the murky water of the pool, lapping it up eagerly. with his thirst quenched he padded back to the cave and then kwasi lays down on near the back of the cave near to his brother and sister and then whimpers and holds his still pretty empty stomach which gurgled and groaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought suddenly popped into kwasi's mind when he looked to to his brother and sister as they laid there, sleeping soundly. Kwasi shivered as the thought flew through his head a few times. What if he ate his sister or brother or even both of them? He repeated the thought over and over in his mind, making his stomach growl loudly and hungrily. The hunger was too great to ignore and the older cub soon decided to eat his own brother or sister but which one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did look a bit tasty to Kwasi, now that his stomach tightened with hunger, yearning to be filled. Letting go of his grip on his empty tummy, he stood up, licking off the excess spit on his lips that already dribbled down his chin. Kwasi decided that he would eat her alive, merely because his stomach could not wait much longer. The sinewy, young lion cub crept towards his younger sister, knowing that once he was close enough and careful enough, he could devour her while she was still sleeping, and send her to his stomach without going through the pain of his prey's struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having made a sound so far, Kwasi stopped when he was less than two inches away from Shetani and peered around from the corners of his eyes, without moving his head. Shuuya was a few feet away, but still dangerously close. His parents were much further away from his current position and didn't pose any potential threat if he made a small noise; they wouldn't be able to hear him in their sleep. Once having surveyed his surroundings, Kwasi decided to make his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he bent down and stretched his jaws to their fullest extent, wrapping them around Shetani's soft, small head. He saw her nose, eyes and ears go into his own mouth, and winced as he felt her head reach the back of his throat. In order to keep her from waking up Kwasi refused to lick at his sister's flavor, yet her tempting flesh made it hard for him to stop drooling. With another careful movement, Kwasi let his Shetani's head slide into the middle of his throat, creating a huge bulge on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving done this, Kwasi noticed that the hardest part was not yet over. Her bony haunches were just outside his mouth, with his drool beginning to run down her fur. Using his forepaws, Kwasi decided to hoist the rest of her body up as he leaned backwards, so he could get her deeper inside him. As he did so, he gave a huge swallow, letting his sleeping sister's torso gently slide into his chest, creating a huge amount of pressure within Kwasi. At this point Shetani's middle was filling up Kwasi's slavering mouth, and she fit quite snugly. In fact, Kwasi was starting to feel how tight and warm Shetani's body was beginning to feel inside him. He could even feel her head nestled deep inside his ribcage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the feeling was not going to last very long, because his stomach emitted a deep rumble, and he tensed up. Kwasi knew for sure that it was loud enough to wake someone up, or was it..?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for Shetani, she was halfway to her older brother's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKwasi figured that he would have to finish his meal quickly before anyone was bound to wake up. A second and more violent swallow enlarged the tight, fleshy bulge in Kwasi's gullet. The muscular ripples of his peristalsis continued to thrust her deeper and deeper into him until only her hind legs and tail stuck out of Kwasi's jaws. He felt her head and forepaws slip into his stomach while the rest of her body was still held prisoner to his tight, fleshy throat. Kwasi lowered his paws and tried to find his balance as he tried to force the rest of his sister's body into his stomach. He gulped hungrily again, pushing Shetani downwards and slowly letting her shoulders and back enter his belly, creating a fleshy lump in his stomach no bigger than a fourth of Kwasi's size. Kwasi knew that his meal was coming to an end, so he forced her hind legs and tail into his mouth and gave one last swallow, pushing the rest of Shetani into his bloated, tight stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Kwasi's stomach was quite full, but the size of his sister still didn't show a grotesquely huge bulge on his visage. His stomach grew so tight that it forced his sister's body to curl up in an extremely tight ball. The slime, acrid digestive odors and sticky spit that stuck to her body only added to the fact that she was apt to awaken at any given moment, but she would be rendered immobile because of the tight confines of her fleshy prison.  From a distance you could not tell that Kwasi had eaten something alive and whole, much less his younger sister. But you would be able to tell that he had certainly put on some pounds; the size of the lump in his stomach was over than a third of the size of his whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKwasi, now realizing that he had finished Shetani off without getting caught, was able to soak in his meal, yet there was only one problem. He felt a small jolt inside him as soon as he sensed Shetani was completely trapped in his stomach. Could it be that she'd woken up? He stiffened as he stood up on all fours. He felt another small squirm in his stomach. He gave a malicious grin and a whispered chuckle. Oh, she was there all right, but she wouldn't be alive for much longer. As her struggles intensified, so did the churning of digestive juices inside Kwasi. He stared at his sister's twitching form from outside his stomach.  He liked the feeling, and he enjoyed it so much he thought he had enough room for another inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, did he or did he not?</span></div></div>",

Kwasi began to salivate and creep towards his remaining sibling.  Kwasi's stomach was already far too tight and full to the brim, causing Kwasi to feel a little sleepy. However, his gluttonous intents went out of control and soon led him to continue stuffing his gullet with live prey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKwasi's jaws opened wide, ready to accept his brother into his salivating mouth. Like he did to his sister, Kwasi would devour Shuuya head first. The touch of his brother's warm flesh within his mouth caused Kwasi to eat him up faster than Shetani.  First came Shuuya's head, moving gently down to the start of Kwasi's throat. His forepaws were pressed tightly against the sticky confines of Kwasi's jaws, and then his haunches were thrust deep inside his older brother's chest due to a quick, powerful swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKwasi felt as if he would burst from the pressure and soreness in the middle of swallowing his prey. Shetani was still twitching in his stomach, but they soon subsided as Kwasi gulped more of his brother down into his gullet, where his head entered Kwasi's already over-stuffed stomach. To Shetani's horror, Shuuya was pressing against her and caused her to lose what air she had already. She was starting to feel faint and finally she passed out  when Kwasi swallowed and allowed Shuuya's haunches to squeeze into the stretching stomach. Kwasi's stomach, becoming extremely tight, continued to grow from the live flesh that was filling it. A few more brisk gulps and Shuuya was completely encased within Kwasi's stomach. Shuuya soon came to his senses when the pungent stink of his brother's gut wafted his way. However, just like Shetani, he passed out because Kwasi's stomach became an air-tight prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally feeling full, Kwasi laid down and tried hard not to belch, lest his parents awake too soon. He would make up a story to tell them in the morning when they discovered he had gained weight and that his siblings disappeared, and so he went to sleep then and there, with a stomach much larger than half the size of his whole body, and filled with the raw flesh of his own kin.</span></div></div>",
