The house was HUGE; it had to be the largest he had ever seen. It was over 300 feet long and 300 feet tall, with all three floors of the house looking like three good-sized stadiums stacked on top of each other in their scope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much reluctance, the man knocked on the very, very tall front door, the doorknob of the house itself well over 40 feet above his head. He saw a smaller cut of a door for someone of his size on the far right corner of the door, but everything else seemed to be massive in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the man remembered the note from his recently deceased uncle that told him that he inherited a \"large house\" quite a distance from his home. He was told to first check it out to see if he wanted to live there. He was told in his will that 4 supposedly beautiful women ran the house almost entirely on their own, and that they were \"unbelievable\". Could this be the house his uncle had left for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA closer look at the directions he was given during the will's reading indicated that it was, indeed, the same house he was supposed to be at in the current moment. How lucky to have broken down here! The man waited almost a full minute before he got a response from anyone if they were home, seeing the opening from the tinier door that he could fit through. It was one of the four supposedly beautiful maids who ran the house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Mr. Robert Thornbear!\" the woman said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who opened the door for Robert just then was...</span></div></div>",

Her attire consisted of a pretty, long, dark green dress with a while apron and frills, as well as a big, white ribbon on the back of the uniform. On her feet was a pair of short, brown boots that kind of clashed with her green attire, but Robert didn\u2019t really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am indeed Robert Thornbear\u201d, he said with a high level of confidence as he showed the maid in front of the house his I.D., pulling it out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Welcome then, Bobby!\u201d the now-convinced woman said as she hugged Robert in a tight embrace. \u201cWe\u2019re so glad you\u2019re here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, silly. There are four maids here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd which maid would YOU be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Ria Hawkins, and I\u2019m an energetic, friendly 20 year old woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Robert. I\u2019m a not so energetic 20 year old man who apparently inherited a house that would fit a stadium full of people in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all yours!\u201d Ria told Robert as she pulled on his arms until he was in the house, the giant door closing quickly behind him. \u201cAnd so am I!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-wait a moment, we just met..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust kidding!\u201d Ria teased the man in front of her. \u201cHey! Do you like video games?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little bit. I haven\u2019t played any in a while..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you want to play video games with me, Bobby?\u201d Ria asked with hopeful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I guess so. Though I\u2019m quite hungry from my trip..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem! I\u2019m no ordinary maid; I have magical abilities!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was befuddled by Ria\u2019s \u201cmagical abilities\u201d comment. Magic wasn\u2019t real (and if it was, people certainly wouldn\u2019t come out in the open to admit it), and if Ria didn\u2019t mean it in that way, she might have meant in a more suggestive manner. Robert was having second thoughts about entering through that door..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d Ria asked Robert as the two walked through the house together. The walls were tall and brown from all sides, and they were numerous staircases everywhere; some were normal sized, some were big, and some were really small. He also noticed a foray of various artwork before him, some paintings and sculptures measuring up to 50 feet in size! It came to no surprise to Ria that Robert kept making several pauses as he walked around in the glorious house and its many wonderful sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour uncle sure loved collecting weird crap!\u201d Ria said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s crap..\u201d, Robert defended his dead uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to listen to me. It\u2019s just my opinion\u201d, noted Ria as they were only feet away from the kitchen at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the kitchen was glorious! The dining table looked bigger than any gym he\u2019s ever been in, and the kitchen itself looked like something from a 5-star French restaurant. Never before had Robert had seen so many kitchen utensils in one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain I ask you; what\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d Ria asked with anxious anticipation, holding out nothing but her hands in front of a gigantic table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like cheeseburgers and fries, personally\u201d, he replied, watching the young maid smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then! Time to prove to you that my magic isn\u2019t just puff and smoke!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Robert, one thing Ria didn\u2019t tell him was that her spells had a high chance of backlash. A VERY high chance. Though maybe Ria would catch a break for once and everything would work.</span></div></div>",

This was soon followed by the ketchup and mustard floating around and squirting his pants almost entirely with the two aforementioned condiments. But that wasn't all; even water and soda ran down his head from above. At the end Robert was a mess, more so than he probably ever had been in his life. He was about to yell at Ria for her clumsiness until he saw the maid cry into her dress. While she initially found it funny, more and more she realized what a klutz she was, and her self-esteem fell like a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm horrible, aren't I?!\" the maid yelled (albiet muffled from her head being in her clothes). \"I can't do anything right! I bet you wonder how I even answered the door correctly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ria, stop! I'm not mad! Everyone makes mistakes!\" Robert yelled as he walked over to the upset woman, slipping up on a patty on the ground and falling on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You ARE mad! Look at you! If someone did that to me, I'd be mad too!\" Ria continued to cry, her face as red as the ketchup smeared on Robert's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-Ria..\", a short of breath Robert said, taking over his stain-covered pants as he walked closer to the maid. \"I told you; I'm not mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Stop it! you're only trying to make me feel better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ria could continue her pessimistic beating of herself up, she was hugged by Robert. Unable to respond any other way, Ria too wrapped her arms around the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ria, I'm glad you offered to make me food. That much is enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, I'm still sorry!\" Ria apologized once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries\", he told her as he kissed her on the cheek, causing her to lighten up. \"Now why don't we make some food together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a maid. You're not supposed to help ME; I'm supposed to help YOU!\" Ria reminded her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't think of you as a maid; I think of you as a bright, kind woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. What do you say, Ria? You would to help me cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Thank you, Bobby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, Ria!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With their combined help, Robert and Ria were able to make french fries and burgers, happily munching on them after taking a good part of a half-hour to finish making them (the fries, not the burgers). Ria was especially impressed, as the other maids didn't care for burgers much; this was her burger in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really good, Bobby!\" Ria commented between bites of her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You helped too, you know\", Robert noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the eating of the burgers came the eating of the fries. Typically the house had a fryer not unlike the way McDonald's or a pizzeria would make fries, but it was temporarily broken. Instead, Robert and Ria had to cook the fries in an oven. They still tasted good, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, Ria stretched her arms and stood up in front of Robert, smiling brightly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Bobby, want to go for a walk?\" she slowly asked, looking a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. It's a nice night\", he commented, pointing to the beautiful full moon in the sky that he could see from the kitchen windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Though I should remind you about the full moon and its powers on us maids..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just forget it. I'll go change into something more casual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert thought that Ria was hiding something, but he didn't mind too much; he was going on a walk with a beautiful girl. That much alone got him pumped.  It was while he waited, though, that he noticed another one of the maids in the house. She seemed to have quickly sprinted into the kitchen, possibly trying to be quiet. It didn't work, though, because Robert saw sight of her as she made her way under a clothed table. He pulled up the covers to see who it was. It was..</span></div></div>",

Before that, she restored Ria's age back to normal. The brunette gave out a weak, pathetic laugh at her earlier appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I have a long way to go\", Ria meekly chuckled. Robert held her right hand then, making her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll become a great maid one day\", he replied, walking off to the garden outside. \"I haven't seen the garden yet.

Robert swore he saw someone, though he figured it was just his imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, though, Ria came back down around this time. The pretty brunette had her tail done in two twin downward pigtails, with cute little heart ear rings on her ears. She was wearing a plain pink shirt with a red fleece jacket on top, as well as pair of black, sexy jeans that went well with her black-and-white sneakers. It was only then did Robert get to notice the fairly nice curves Ria had; she had to at least be a D-cup, and her legs were skinny and almost like that of a model's. He wondered if all the maids in the house kept their bodies in this kind of shape as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready!\" she chriped as she rushed down the stairs and stopped only inches in front of Robert's face. \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm as ready as I'll ever be\", replied Robert as the two adults stepped outside and onto the patio in the garden in the house's backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the patio Ria looked at the beautiful night sky above them, sighing happily as she unintentionally grabbed hold of Robert's hand with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" she said when she noticed her grabbing hold of Robert's arm. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, Ria\", he told her as he then placed <i>his</i> hand on top of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know any better, Bobby, I'd say you were coming on to me\", teased Ria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were silent for a little afterwards, enjoying their view of the night sky above.

Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-O-Of course not! Don't be silly, B-Bobby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ria, you're hiding something. I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gulp!* You're right. I AM hiding something from you. You see, Bobby, during the full moon, our powers are at their peak, and even a newbie like myself can temporarily gain vast amounts of magic during the time it's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound so bad..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except I have no control of my body at the time. The other maids and I, for some reason, end up giving in to our urges, often becoming bigger, scarier, and even a little sex-crazed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you could grow to 20 feet tall and try to have sex with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, Bobby. I'm not quite sure what I'd do..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two paused once again during their conversation, with Ria not noticing that shortly after she stopped talking, she looked a little bit at the moon!

I\u2019m turning into a cat, or maybe even a cat girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia\u2019s worrying wasn\u2019t helping by the growth of her hair, which became fuller, more twisted, and changed to a dirtier shade of brown. It was over 15 feet long now. Her ears slowly started to transform as well, changing slowly into car ears as they grew to several times their current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-My ears!! My hair! They\u2019re gigantic, meow!\u201d Ria whined, her feet being the next thing to change. They slowly changed form until they looked slightly like a cat\u2019s, with claws replacing her toe nails. Her sandals were ripped to shreds as her feet grew in size to match her recently grown ears, hair, and hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh! My sandals! They were so nice, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia\u2019s next transformation involved her butt, where she felt something slowly cut out of it; it was a cat tail! At first it was only a few feet long, but then it ballooned in size until it was over 20 feet long! Her butt grew to several times its size as well to accompany her new tail, knocking poor Ria on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRia\u2026!\u201d a panicked Robert said as he looked on at his changing friend/maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia\u2019s legs and arms then grew quickly to accompany the rest of her growing stature. This was followed by the growth of her torso, which also ballooned in size until it matched the rest of her growing frame. Her cat fangs grew even bigger as her head expanded in size as well, completing her transformation into a 25 foot tall cat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobby, I\u2019m scared, meow!\u201d Ria told her friend, hugging him like a plush doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRia, it\u2019s okay! You seem to still have control of your body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Bobby!

She quickly put Robert on the ground and, snapping her fingers, turned him into a gigantic mouse. Although his height remained unchanged, he lost the ability to talk, coming out only as a series of squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSqueak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robert knew he couldn't run away forever from the giantess cat-girl Ria, so he decided to take his chances and force her head on. If he learned anything from cartoons, a mouse's small size more than makes up for his speed and strength. So when Ria had him literally against one of the walls of the house, Robert scurried seconds before the giant cat-girl could eat him, her front fangs now stuck in the ground he once stood on. He then proceeded to climb up the giant cat girl's back and ran up to the top of her head. From there he reached the branch of a nearby tree and climbed up it, bombarding Ria with any and all things he could think of to throw at her noggin. Unfortunately that wasn't working, as the nuts and other fruits he was throwing at her weren't slowing her down. In fact, Ria was growing even bigger, tripling her earlier size in a manner of seconds!! Now he really <i>was</i> mouse-sized in comparison to her, and quickly she scooped him up and swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't quite the end for Robert, though. As luck had it, he managed to grab hold of Ria's uvula before being swallowed completely. He grabbed on to it for dear life as he starting biting on it. This caused quite a bit of pain to Ria's mouth, who then felt mouse claws on her tongue as well. Unable to bear the pain, Ria spat out Robert, leaving him covered in cat girl drool in the garden below that he was spit out to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you're clever, aren't ya?! Well guess this, mouse; I have claws!\" Ria threatened Robert as she patted him around like a toy, slowly covering him in bruises rather quickly. After only 2 minutes he was barely able to stand up any more. Also around that time came the feeling of one of Ria's paws pressing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say good-bye to this world, mouse boy!\" Ria said to Robert, her gigantic paw cutting off the ability to breathe. Within moments he would be dead, unless he was saved by a miracle..</span></div></div>",

Not only was she scared by her being 75 feet tall, but she saw a bruised and beaten up Robert below her. Ria ran over to the boy quickly and picked him up, feeling his stomach to see if he still had a pulse. He did, but it was a slow one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert!!!!\" the girl cried, using her healing abilities to help the poor man as much she could. She then placed him inside the house and locked the door to prevent herself from coming in when the moon showed itself again. Althouh Robert was able to move again, he quickly retreated upstairs to his bedroom to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must hate me now!!\" Ria continued to cry. \"First I splatter him with food, and then I nearly kill him! Oh God what is wrong with me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full moon soon showed itself once again, and with it came back Ria's mentality of the cat girl she was earlier. However, instead of being hungry for Robert, she was angry at the moon, and yelled at it for hours for what it caused her to do to Robert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was morning, Robert slowly came out of hiding and went downstairs, where he saw an incredibly depressed Ria waiting for him. At first he stayed away from her as far away as he could, but then he realized that the poor woman was crying. A lot. In fact, she was crying as she made him his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert still remembered what happened last night, though. And if what happened last night was going to happen every time a full moon came out, he would rather soon leave than stay in this house. He hadn't even seen what the other three maids were like during the full moon, and he didn't want to stay to find out. On the other hand Ria literally had no control of her body; once she snapped out of it when the full moon was covered in clouds, she didn't attack him again for the rest of the night. Perhaps she finally regained control of her body during the full moon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert thought long and hard about whether to stay at the mansion and accept Ria's apology or leave and head home.</span></div></div>",

She then ran off, loudly crying as she did so. That's when the other three maids showed up just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a short girl with black hair and blue eyes, wore a dark blue Victorian maid outfit and black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother was a young woman his own age, taller than the first maid. She had long, red hair in twin braids and brown eyes, and wore a black French maid outfit with black shoes to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last was the oldest and the tallest. She had bright, blue eyes and long, blonde hair. She wore a bright orange shirt and skirt with dark red ribbons on the back, with orange high heels to go with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...we're really, really sorry about last night\", the smallest maid apologized. \"My name is Erika, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have told you\", another upset maid, the red-head a year younger than him, explained. \"I'm Ellen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's anything we can do to make it up to you, just say the word, Master Robert\", the oldest maid finished. \"I am Michelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She..didn't mean to do this, right?\" Robert asked, looking quite nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't mean to do what she did!\" Erika replied, shaking her head up and down. \"It's something she can't control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Robert, she's scared. I've seen her do this before, and even my magic can barely restrain her\", Ellen noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please understand, Master Robert\", Michelle pleaded, bowing down to him. \"She's going through a hard time right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert paused as he thought of what to do. The other maids paused and worried for a moment what his decision would be. Erika was in Michelle's arms, looking ready to cry. Ellen frowned but kept composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll go talk to her\", Robert decided, watching the maids' faces light up. \"But you three stay here. This is something I want to talk to her alone about.\"</span></div></div>",

This included the library, the game room, the study hall, and the maids' individual rooms. Then there was his giant master bedroom, which was 30 feet long in all sides, a perfect square room, almost three times the size of the other maids' rooms. Then Ria showed Robert the basement, which contained a giant-screen TV, several video game systems, a pool table, and even a air hockey table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your uncle sure loved to play a lot down here\", Ria noted to Robert, still holding his arm. \"Remember? He used to bring you here yearly to his basement, Bobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert paused as he tried to remember the times he was here in his uncle's house. Ria confirmed this by noting one of the billiard balls that had his name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember now, but I don't remember any maids when I did come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was when Aria still worked here. She's 25 or so now, and she was, for a while, the only maid in this house. That is, until that day when she..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia then grabbed hold of Robert again and showed him the back of the basement, where there were several washers and driers, neatly lined up in a surprisingly clean room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is where we will wash and dry your clothes, as well as ours, Bobby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia waited for Robert's response, which was him tilting his head in several directions, looking at all the things around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of your new abode, Bobby? One giant house and four beautiful women to share it with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia laughed as she took off her maid uniform and put it in a nearby basket for later washing. She had another set of clothes underneath: a short, black dress. She also walked into the game room again and got back on her black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that we're done, let's go get lunch!\" Ria cheered, lifting one arm in the air, her hand in a fist. \"I know of a great place around here that makes hoagies and cheesesteaks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Ria. I'm quite hungry myself\", Robert nodded in agreement. It might have been a little early for lunch, but the idea of cheesesteak sounded good to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia winked at Robert as she grabbed his arm once more, heading up the stairs and out the door as she showed him her car a good distance from the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my car!\" Ria explained. It was a small, red car with four seats and fairly beaten up tires. \"It's a little old, but it gets the job done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia then opened the right car door for Robert as he got in, closing it when he sat down. She then ran around to the left side and got in, buckling her seat belt and putting her key into the car's ignition to start it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" Ria said as she winked at Robert again, pulling out of her parking spot and out onto the road.</span></div></div>",

Why did you decide to work as a maid in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one. Well, after high school I wasn't exactly getting the best of receptions from the colleges I applied to. In short, I failed to get into any of them. However, I saw an ad in the paper about two years ago that promised a high-paying job working part time as a maid for an elderly man. At the time there was only one other woman working there - Michelle - and she had her hands full quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that I was told in advance is that I would have to take a physical test on my person before I began. I agreed to it, and as you can see, the 'test' was me being injected with a form of blood that would grant me slightly magical abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby, there exist in this world a few gifted people with the ability to use magic. A lot of these people are often frowned upon in their communities, and some are even disowned by their family. Erika is the one of the latter examples. She was rejected by her own mother when she found out she had magic running within her blood. Ellen lost her boyfriend when she revealed to him that she had magical abilities, too. I don't know what happened to Michelle, but every time I try to talk to her about it, she turns away or changes the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia had a slight running of tears down her eyes, using her shirt sleeve to wipe them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my own mom told me that if I took the test, that I might as well live with the 'creepy pervert', because I wasn't allowed back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uncle <i>wasn't</i> a bad person, though, Bobby: he treated me like his own daughter. Eventually I grew to love the time I spent there with him. Six months later I also met Ellen, and I grew to befriend her, too. Then Erika came right after your uncle's passing and her mother shunning her, so we let her in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby, it might me very happy that you decided to stay after the trouble I put you through...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia was crying again, but this time she had a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby, I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia pulled over to the side of the road as she kissed Robert in full embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I want to be your lover, not just a maid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was confused as to what was going on. All of a sudden a woman had his arms all around him after crying just moments ago. Ria waited like a dog for a treat for a response from Robert. What did he respond with?</span></div></div>",

The two continued to have sex well until the night, and when they finally fell asleep, they were both back to their original size once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Robert and Ria were lying on top of each other, almost completely naked aside from a bra for Ria and underpants for Robert.

Does that mean I might be pregnant??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia continued to freak out about what happened last night, putting back on the pieces of her maid uniform scattered across the patio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Bobby, I hope I didn't do anything I regretted last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. That was my first time. At least we can both say we're not virgins anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia blushed red at the idea of having sex with her master on her first day on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I...I enjoyed it, too!

Welcome, Robert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert trailed off from the young woman in front of him as he scoped out the sheer size of the house; it was huge!

Some were much bigger than him, and others were much smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite a place you have here\", commented Robert, watching Erika run up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is.

It may sound childish, but I always wondered what it would be like to wield power from my finger tips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not as fun as you'd think\", Erika sighed. \"I mainly use my powers for taking care of the garden and straightening up the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still..! Hey! Show me one of your magical abilities!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Robert, I don't think that's a good idea.

Not really, but..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only been an apprentice maid since I was 16. I'm not used to anything but beginner spells yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, Erika. You can show me one of those instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I can do that!\" chirped Erika as she led Robert to the garden behind the house. She sat down on a nearby wooden bench, with Robert sitting right beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all the other maids in this house as kind and beautiful as you?\" Robert teased the girl, causing her to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-stop it!

The only maid who wasn't doing all this was Erika, who looked too scared to do anything than simply fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I'm not fun, Robert\", the sad maid sighed. \"But I don't want to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Erika. You don't have to alway play everything straight, you know! Part of life <i>is</i> having fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right\", Erika nodded, flying straight up into the air for a few hundred feet, then diving back down as if she was a living roller coaster. She then spun around in circles in the air, not unlike that of a Tilt-A-Whirl ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that made me feel dizzy\", a slightly nauseated Robert told Erika. \"But at the same time it was fun! Thanks, Erika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\", Erika replied, a big smile on her face. She continued to do more flips and circles in the air, nearly euphoric with joy. She hadn't had this fun in a long, long time.</span></div></div>",

She would cast them with a spell to stop them, but they were moving around too much for her to focus on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her warning didn't go completely ignored, because soon enough Erika too found out what Michelle was talking about when she felt rain drops falling on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, it's starting to rain!\" she told him, snapping her fingers as she dressed him up in a raincoat. \"We better go down now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree\", replied Robert as Erika lowered herself further down to the ground. Before she could, though, she was stopped by the sound of thunder. She instantly froze when she saw it strike in the distance, causing her to panic and shrink..literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, I'm scared!!\" the worried maid cried as she shrunk in size, returning to her regular size in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika, grow back!!\" Robert screamed as the two held on for dear life as they plummeted to the ground. The both of them felt dizzy as they spun around as they fell..until they were rescued by Ellen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have to be more careful!\" the redhead maid told them as she placed them both on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are Ria and Michelle?\" Erika asked, looking nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still up there. They think something else is causing these thunderstorm than just nature\", Ellen informed Robert and Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed she was right; it seemed like there was another maid with magic powers controlling the lightning, one who wasn't too kind at not getting a cut of Robert's uncle's riches. Her name was Aria, and she was a former employee of his before being fired for her mean-spirited nature and constant talking back to others. She was about 25 years old, had long, purple hair, blue eyes, and a well full figure. Despite her outer beauty, though, she had little to no inner beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia and Michelle were attempting to talk some sense into Aria as she kept trying to strike them with lightning bolts, but their lightning barriers, as well as their suits made of rubber, saved them from getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aria, stop!\" Michelle attempted to reason with the annoyed, 100 foot tall maid. \"You don't work here anymore! Go away or we'll call the police!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't own the skies! I can do whatever I damn please, even if it means frying your worthless master!\" Aria chuckled as she continued to fling bolts at the two maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's no worthless! He's kind and sensible, unlike you\", Ria defended Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a break! I was with that old man long before you stepped into his house! Oh wait, I'm sorry! You had to be INJECTED with magical abilities just to work at the damn place, didn't you? And yet you still got to work for that geezer? He must've had preeeety low priorities if he hired <b>you</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking for a death wish, bitch?!\" Ria fumed as she grew to 100 feet as well, grappling with the purple-haired maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could same the same to you\", Aria replied as she smacked around Ria, grabbed her by the air, and threw her to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIA!!!\" Michelle yelled as she dove down to rescue her friend, with Aria simply chuckling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I guess I had my fun today!\" the evil maid chuckled as she flew away, the skies clearing up shortly after her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- In Ria's home, an hour later -</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia was badly injured from the fall, and Michelle, Erika, and Ellen placed her in her bedroom soon after they landed. Both of the maid's arms were broken, and her left leg was broken too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be weeks before she walks again\", Erika cried as Robert hugged the upset maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it. If you have magic powers, why can't you just fix her injuries?\" Robert wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not gods, Robert\", Ellen explained. \"We do have limits to our powers. We can't heal broken bones, revive dead people or animals, or bring objects to life, among other limitations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I did something back there, none of this would have happened\", Michelle then cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, knock it off you guys!\" Ria yelled, struggling in her bed to stand up. \"It's just a few broken bones! You act like I'm dying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...\", Erika sniffed, trying to finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with the waterworks! Just give me a couple of crutches and I'll be fine! So how's about dinner, Bobby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're sure you're okay, Ria, I decided I wanted to eat at the dinner table - all five of us - and eat something we each like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\" said Michelle. \"I'm really hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get the table ready!\" said Erika as she ran downstairs to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby, despite what happened today, I had fun! I'm glad I met you!\" Ria noted to the boy as she blew a kiss in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had fun, too!\" Michelle added as she hugged and kissed Robert, with Ellen soon joining in.</span></div></div>",

I'm afraid we're still like this until I get something in my belly\", the tiny maid explained to Robert, patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that shouldn't be too hard. We're in a garden, right? I'll just grab some fruits for you to eat and we're be on our way. Simple, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong. It's not simple\", corrected Erika. \"This garden is booby trapped to protect bugs from getting near the food. Only the other maids and I can grab hold of the fruits and vegetables safely. If anyone else touches it, a sleeping gad toxin will be released. If the threat is big enough, bug poison will also be sprayed. And at our heights...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", sighed Robert. \"Well then I'll help YOU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?! But I can't even use magic right now!

Now what about you?\" Erika asks as Robert had a ponder look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really don't have anything big planned. I just work at some stores, nothing big.

The two continue to work until they were done. It was night now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man that was fun,\" Robert said as Erika nods with smile. It was nice to have Robert be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika!

Her legs were long and thin, her breasts were a modest D cup, her red hair was in a pair of pretty twin braids, and she dressed in a sexy black French maid outfit that revealed quite a bit of cleavage. The second woman had long, brunette-colored hair and green eyes. Her attire consisted of a pretty, long, dark green dress with a while apron and frills, as well as a big, white ribbon on the back of the uniform. On her feet were a pair of short, brown boots. The third and final one was dressed in a bright orange uniform with dark red ribbons on the back, and she also wore orange high heels on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the two of you were small all of this time?\" the blonde asks Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Michelle.

However, they remained on their own toes in case she tries something funny with either them or Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, where are you?!\" Tiamat asks, pouting. \"You finally let me in and you run away? What are you, 5?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiamat sighs as she places her jacket on the rack located near the front door, exploring the huge mansion's living room as she waits for him. She sits down on a couch and sighs, resisting the urge to touch the remote control on the table beside her to watch T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hi\", a small voice rang, confusing Tiamat. She looks around and sees nothing. She then felt a poking at her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Tia!\" the voice said again, now visible to her. It was a 6 inch tall, naked Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaah!\" Tiamat shrieks, nearly falling off the couch. As she lies down on it, she is greeted by four, naked women on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude!

Why are those MAIDS tiny and naked?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a long story\", the sheepish Robert tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see\", Tiamat says as she blinks, hearing about how Robert met Erika, they shrunk, and then how she made the other maids shrink. \"So you and those four maids there are stuck tiny for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I screwed up bad\", Erika sighs, the other maids comforting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I used to babysit Robert when I was little, so I know my way around chores quite well. So if I could help in any way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a maid!\" Michelle happily yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!?\" Tiamat gasps. \"A maid?! Like, with the frilly dress, the suggestive stares, the..cleaning and washing and such?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd do it ourselves, but we're so small. We can only do the most basic of chores. Even that door was hard to open for us\", Ellen notes. \"And I'm the strongest maid here and I say this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Tiamat grimaces. \"I'm not THAT good to look over a huge place like this by myself for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll teach you!\" Michelle smiles as she winks. \"And you can hang out with Master Robert all you want with no questions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...!!\" the other maids moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, all of you!\" Michelle sharply replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiamat picks up Robert and looks at him face to face, now with a smile.

Sure, it wasn't a very classy thing to suggest, but getting a luscious kiss from a pretty maid had him feeling a little bit like a bad boy.

Red's a classic color for this kind of thing, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the red paint can out of midair and shaking it vigorosly, he strode over confidently to an undecorated space on one of the walls while Ellen looked on, a little nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had barely pointed the can forward and flexed his pointer finger when a piercing cry rang out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, BUSTER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...

Within seconds she was taller than Robert himself, and soon enough the two found themselves on the floor, the couch no longer enough to support her size. Ellen quickly snapped her fingers, turning the floor itself into a gigantic bed, long enough for a woman of 30 feet or so in size! By this point Ellen was 8 feet tall, smiling and begging for more as the sex continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunaely, Robert had begun to found difficulty in making Ellen cum, her vagina now big enough to put his fist through. He felt, needless to say, inadequate. The giantess maid knew this and instead started to snuggle with him, like a child would with a security item such as a blanket. Ellen then gave the man big kisses from her beautiful, gigantic lips, her tongue growing ever bigger in his mouth. Robert was enjoying every minute of this, watching as Ellen grew to nearly 12 feet tall now. And she was only getting sexier; her hair got longer and prettier, her lips became softer and more delicate, her chest got bigger but not overly big, and her body...it was incredible. She was sexy from head to toe, and even her voice aroused him after a while, whispering such things to him as, \"Master, take me now!\" It was definitely the best day of Robert's life.

Not completely mind you (her clothes got tighter around her body, showing off her butt and chest a little more), but before long the once 5'8\" maid was now 58'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Master Robert?\" said Michelle as she picked up the \"tiny\" man from below.

Since Robert was 70 inches tall normally, and he shrunk to a little less than a tenth his normal size, that made him about a little less than 7 inches tall now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of panicking at her mishap, though, Michelle simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like the view?\" she asked Robert as she placed the boy right up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, now I'm more dizzy than ever\", he commented in a squeaky voice, which caused Michelle to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be tired from your long journey anyway, so perhaps my carrying you would be beneificial?

The shoes then slowly lifted themselves off the ground until they were at least 10 feet into the air. The bottom of both shoes was padded with a comfortable cushion for both fliers' behinds, followed by a miniature steering wheel and a protective wall of glass above both Michelle and Robert's heads. A little video monitor was inserted into both shoes as well, which Michelle tried out by asking Robert;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Master Robert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pretty weird, but I think I like it\", he replied as she scooted over closer to Michelle's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other maids don't like doing this kind of thing, so I'm glad I got to do it with you, Master Robert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me 'Robert'\", he said to Michelle. \"I'm younger than you, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, Robert\", Michelle replied. \"Where do you want to go first?\"</span></div></div>",

I'm good with magic, but not <i>that</i> good\", Michelle sheepishly told her master. \"I don't want you to get hurt, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.

Its floor consisted of dark blue tiles, the tables a pretty shady of gray, stainless steel, and the various kitchen accessories white and black to match. Except for four pairs of oven mitts, it seems - one pair for each maid. Michelle's were, obviously, yellow. Soon after the two settled their shoes on the carpet right outside the kitchen - Michelle seemed to look upset when Robert nearly landed on the newly cleaned table with his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's your mansion, but please be more respectful\", she sighed. As the two landed outside the kitchen, Robert emerged from his shoe, greeted near instantly by his pretty maid's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Robert!\" she greeted. \"Enjoy the flight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have a choice now - stay tiny and explore, or grow big and observe first-hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being tiny.

Yes, there was the always unpleasant surprise of having one's car break down, but there was also the luckier surprise of having it break down in front of one of the largest, most lavish houses he'd ever so much as dreamed about... And it was all his! This thing had to be worth more than the GDP of a small country!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, he'd have one more grand surprise coming his way. Following the voice he heard from the inside, he approached the smaller doorway as the door slowly opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Only to let loose an unexpected blast of multicolored confetti that hit him right in his face, followed by a loud fanfare of horns and drums that blared away as he vigorously brushed away the material. Once he was finally able to get a clear view, he was further disoriented by the sight of four women in maid outfits lined up in a row in front of him, each with their right arms raised. In one smooth motion, from left to right, each woman took a deep bow, one right after the other, and offered a cheery greeting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\"<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\"<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\"<br>\r\n\"Wassup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIa!\" The woman furthest left cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The one on the furthest right answered defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ruined our routine on purpose, didn't you?\" The one next to her said with irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forgive a girl for trying to stand out from the crowd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Anyway, welcome to your new mansion, Master Thronbear!\" The youngest looking one, who had yet to speak independently, said cheerfully to Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a beat, Robert just stood in the doorway, a look of confusion mixed with slight agitation on his face. He took a brief glimpse around the room (which seemed unnaturally spacious to him, even though he knew little about how big mansion foyers were supposed to be) before blurting out the most appropriate response to what he just witnessed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... The... Hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... excuse me?\" The youngest woman asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, what's with all this confetti, and... where'd that fanfare come from? Come to think of it, I don't see any big band around here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you... don't know?\" The maid furthest on the left, who looked to be oldest, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know what?\" he spat. He was trying hard not to sound venomous, but this was all starting to become too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... no, it appears you don't. Oh dear, this is no good... Maid huddle!\" The oldest one cried, causing the other three to bunch up against her in a group that moved hurriedly into another room. \"Please don't go away!\" she pleaded as they left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the maids had scurried into another room, the youngest locked the door behind her and joined the other three in a close knit huddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he mentioned our powers when he left that message in his will! How could he be so careless?\" Ria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ria, really! Show some respect for our dear, departed former master!\" The oldest maid urged, \"And think carefully for a minute: his will was read aloud in front of the rest of his family. Do you really think it would have been wise to let anyone else besides Master Robert know about our powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I guess not... Wait a minute, why didn't we think about this before we planned out that whole routine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carelessness.\" The red haired maid sighed as she shook her head, \"We weren't thinking, it seems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we weren't.\" The eldest maid stated firmly, \"But that's not what matters most now. We've already aroused Master Robert's suspicions. I don't think he'll jump to conclusions yet, but he'll definitely ask us some questions, and it might be tricky to keep playing dumb if he grills us too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" The youngest maid moaned, \"I hope we haven't scared him off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so, too,\" the eldest maid answered, \"And we have to be careful not to do just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it would be easier to just tell him upfront about our powers.\" The red haired maid wondered aloud, \"If he doubts us, we just give him a demonstration. Anyway, I don't think it's a good idea to keep secrets from your boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?!\" Ria hissed, \"That'll scare him off for sure! He'll be convinced that we're gonna try to turn him into a frog to steal the mansion from him or something crazy like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd probably find out eventually. He looks like the sharp sort to me.\" The youngest maid chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia sighed, \"Well, sounds like we've got two votes for telling him, one for keeping it a secret...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told, I could probably be swayed. I suppose I'll go with whatever Michelle wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, Erika?\" Ria commented, \"Well, ball's in your court, Mishy. Tell him or don't tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Michelle exhaled as she considered her opinion. Once again, as the eldest maid of the house, she was left to do the heavy lifting when it came to decision making. This time, though, she'd have to think very carefully, as their livelihoods depended on the right outcome. The wrong choice might push Robert away, and a maid who worked in an abandoned mansion, no matter how big and opulent it was, wasn't a very valuable maid at all.  </span></div></div>",

I'll start to talk to him, if I can all expect you to be quiet to begin with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia seemed a little annoyed but seeing the other two nod, rolled her eyes and shrugged. \"All right, just don't blame me if it goes all to pot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't.\" Mishy glarred at the younger maid. \"Because we're doing things my way, and I can be certain that things won't do pear shaped that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unlocked the doors and reentered the hallway, Robert thankfully still inside looking about, as if to try and discern the nature of what had happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stood just in front of Robert and bowed politely. \"Master Robert, we've had a little talk and we want to come clean with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert seemed a little confused. \"Erm... ok.

Well...\" The elder maid glanced back to the others for a moment, a slight nerves stopping her. Ria had her arms folded in expection but Ellen's eyes seemed to tell her to tell him the truth. They didn't always see eye to eye but Michelle knew it was important to be honest. \"Right. The reason you can't find any big band or confetti is that... there was something your late Uncle and our old Master didn't tell you. It was supposed to be mentioned in the will but I suspect the reader didn't quite take it seriously.\" She took his hand firmly. \"But it is, Robert! It really is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was taken aback by his new maid taking his hand and wondered just what he was letting himself it for. \"What wasn't mentioned then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we Maids have magical powers.\" She said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little grin spread on Robert's face, causing her to frown. \"In know it sounds silly but it is true. Do I look like the kind of person to tell lies like that. I mean maybe Ellen and Ria-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Both shouted at once, but a look from Mishy shut them up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the reason I'm telling you this is that I and the others don't want you to be scared, we have no desire to harm you or cause you any trouble, the will stated that we were supposed to use our abilties to do what you would want anyway... so there's no need to be confused, ok?\" She gave him a kind polite smile and then motioned for the girls to bow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert wasn't certain what to think; did these girls really have powers? Part of him was mildly curious since he couldn't explain the initial introduction thing, so he summed up the courage to try something out. \"So... Iif you have magic, I can ask you to do anything I'd like to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMishy nodded, slightly anxiously; part of her was wondering if telling Robert that had been a good idea or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not sure what to think Robert opted to try a testing wish. \"Ok, then how about if...</span></div></div>",

Ellen was the most talkative and flirty of the four, and the two bartered in slight compliments to each other during the meal. Ria's energetic attitude tend to pop in for her to ask Robert many questions (usually through a full mouth that Michelle would have to warn her not to talk like that). Erika was shy and would only answer to what Robert would ask, and usually keep to herself. Michelle, having recovered from Ellen's sudden costume change, kindly explained the roles of each of the girls that worked in the house; Ria with laundry, Erika with Gardening, and herself in everything else. Ellen, being the most stable in her magic powers, helps train Ria and Erika to better control them, and has been considered a 'chore' for her since. It works, because while Michelle is the oldest and also second most adaptive to magic, she takes pride and responsibility in keeping the house neat, and this arrangement was probably the only thing the two sisters could agree on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do now, Robert?\" Michelle asked as the picnic and contents disappeared through magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see a bit of this place myself,\" he decided. \"Alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But master,\" Ellen said. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am the master of the mansion, I should see this place for myself while you four work, right? It wouldn't be right for me to interrupt your duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it would!\" Ria shouted. \"We're your servants, and we're here to do anything you tell us to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. Then I order you to keep yourselves busy while I explore on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four maids grudgingly accepted his request, Ellen and Ria the most disappointed. In no time, they dispersed into wisps of light and explored over the far corners the mansion, honestly surprising the newly appointed master and prompting a question in his head. <i>I wonder if I could do magic like the girls can too... that would be nice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Robert started to explore the mansion.

Ellen herself was smiling away; half-considering the activity, and the other half rather enjoying Robert's little joke. Ria on the other hand was clearly annoyed and as she walked up to Robert, he felt that maybe he'd gone too far and she was going to punch him. Oh, if only he was so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile spread over Ria's face as she lifted her hand. \"As you wish.\" She snapped her fingers as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blinding light exploded in Robert's face and he was hit with a sudden feeling of vertigo that knocked him on his ass. As the light cleared and his head along with it, Robert looked up at Ria...and up and up, about 60 feet up into Ria's giant, devilish smiling face. He no longer doubted them having powers. Ria scooped Robert up in her hand and held him close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she sounded like she was rather enjoying herself, \"How is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, not quite what i had in mind,\" Robert was terrified of the now gigantic and clearly angry maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, that's too bad.\" She spoke with a mock disappointment that chilled Robert to the bone. \"I hope you're still up for kissing. I just love leaving my lovers with 'love marks'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo clarify her meaning, Ria snapped her teeth at Robert, earning a very loud yelp from the tiny man. Luckily, it was Michelle to the rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ria!\" Michelle cried with outrage. \"Stop this now and fix him! This is no way to treat our new master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok.\" Ria chuckled a little to herself. \"I was just proving a point.\" And with that she snapped her fingers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was again blinded by light. This time when he opened his eyes he was on the floor back to normal size. The only difference was a newfound fear of maids, giants, and teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, is this enough to scare Robert away forever?</span></div></div>",

I need sometime to think it over, okay?\" He could see a little gloom in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. But until you heal completely we'll continue to care for you.

Robert could not remember hitting that tree. He just smiled at Ria as she just shrugged and left him to his lonesome. He laid back down and looked up at the ceiling. \"This wasn't right.\" Yes he was freaked out while driving, but he never once remembered being reckless enough to go off the road. It didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Robert laid there, he slowly remembered something. While turning one bend in the road, the steering wheel seemed to suddenly turn on its own in his hands. He remembered trying to realign in the wheel before everything went black. Under normal conditions Robert wouldn't think anything of it, but then he'd just learned about magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A horrible thought entered Robert's mind.

What are you doing?\" Michelle asked with some shock, it pained the woman inwardly to see the one she was charged with serving to look like that.

Michelle waved her hands and instantly a large red nightgown for men appeared on Robert. \"If your intent on walking Master at least stay warm, the days are getting colder.\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smiled and said \"Thanks.

After the unexpected welcome, he was all set to leave as soon as the maids went into the other room, but he quickly calmed down and decided to do the polite thing and wait for them to come back. Anyhow, what good would leaving do? As long as his car was broken down, he wasn't going anywhere. Besides, a guy doesn't just walk away from four cute girls and an inherited mansion that had to be worth a fortune, does he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the maids re-entered the foyer, Michelle immediately extended a hand in apology;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Robert, I... I think we got off on the wrong foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Rob responded, returning the handshake. \"I kinda snapped a little there. I really shouldn't have.

Wow, my uncle had it really good, didn't he? That'd explain why all of you are here, but... the confetti...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me!\" Ria spoke up, raising her hand. (She had been the one who had cast the confetti blasting spell, so she wasn't really lying when she said this.) \"Sorry about that. I guess I was a little too enthusiastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's alright,\" Rob said, \"Well, I guess that just leaves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The music!\" Erika piped up. \"Uh...you see, one of the most awesome things about this place is the sound system! It's voice commanded, see, and we instructed it to play a big fanfare when you entered! It can play literally any song you can think of! Here, I'll show you...\" She turned around and looked up at the ceiling, \"Stereo! Fur Elise, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, she secretly waved her hands to conjure up the music, making sure Robert didn't see them move. To her hidden delight, the spell worked, as the ever-recognizable melody began to fill the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Robert exclaimed, visibly impressed, \"Where are the speakers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hidden away!\" Erika quickly said, explaining away the absence of speakers in the foyer. \"Doesn't clash with the decorating at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Rob walked forward and looked up at the ceiling, \"Stereo! Let's see... How about Paint It Black?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Erika squeaked quietly. She wasn't familiar with rock music at all. Luckily for her, Ellen made the save, waving her hands while Rob's back was turned, which caused the famous Rolling Stones song to begin to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, the sound quality on this thing is great!\" he said, humming along, \"OK, OK, one more... Oh, I know! Let's see if it has any heavy metal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four maids gulped at once. None of them were familiar with the genre at all, and all of them were worried that Rob's suspicions might be raised if he picked something they couldn't play. Would he buy an excuse like \"The sound system was messing up\" or \"The stereo doesn't know that song\", or was the charade about to be over? Were they overreacting, or would it really be that big of a deal if he didn't hear the song he wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stereo! Disposable Heroes, please!\"</span></div></div>",

Master Robert will eventually learn we have magic\", Michelle whispered into her friend's right ear. \"We might as well seal all the exits and come clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, <i>I</i> was the only one of us who wanted to tell him from square one! I'm all for it!\" Ellen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another reason as well; I don't want to pressure Erika and Ria\", noted Michelle. \"Their magic isn't as strong as ours, and they could end up backfiring on Robert..or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, but you three were the one who wanted this..unless you're going back\", snickered Ellen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I may have to\", confessed Michelle, looking distraught.</span></div></div>",

However, these wonderful laides are more than what they seem..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two rules;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) No killing/squishing/insertion of the main character.<br>\r\n2.) You must leave at least two different options for each chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, enjoy! Check out the individual chapters for more information on our magical maid heroines. Here's a brief description of each of them;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nHeight: 5'10\"<br>\r\nEye color: Auburn<br>\r\nHair color: Dark red<br>\r\nCasual attire: Black t-shirt, grey sweatpants<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man who doesn't like to sit still; he prefers to go head on into things than to wait for them. He has a hard time adjusting to owning a house with four women in it, but soon her befriends not as maids, but as friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nHeight: 5'4\"<br>\r\nEye color: Green<br>\r\nHair color: Brunette, long<br>\r\nMaid attire: Long, dark green dress with white apron and frills, as well as a big, white ribbon on the back. Also, a pair of short, brown boots<br>\r\nCasual attire: Short, black dress with black heels to match<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn energetic, slightly tomboyish woman. She takes care of the washing and drying of clothes in the household. Her magic abilities are the weakest of of the four maids and have a high chance of backfiring. She loves television and video games and would rather play all day than work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHeight: 5'0\"<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nHair color: Black, short<br>\r\nMaid attire: Dark blue Victorian maid outfit and black boots<br>\r\nCasual attire: Pink t-shirt, shorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shy girl who just graduated from high school. Her magic abilities are slowly developing, and they backfire less often than Ria's do. She enjoys nature and loves to be outside, where she takes care of the garden. She is quite shy around men and has never kissed one before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHeight: 5'2\"<br>\r\nEye color: Brown<br>\r\nHair color: Red in twin braids<br>\r\nMaid attire: Black French Maid outfit with black shoes to match<br>\r\nCasual attire: Sleeveless shirt and a medium-length skirt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind, generous, and a bit of a flirt, Ellen is the kind of girl who would rather stop arguments than begin them. Her magic is the strongest and most stable of the four maids, and she has the most advanced abilities in her possession as well. She sometimes butts heads with Michelle, though, especially concerning her fondness for dressing light; unlike the other maids, she has no problem with showing off her body. She also loves to flirt with men, especially Robert, who she develops a crush on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 23<br>\r\nHeight: 5'8\"<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nHair color: Long, blonde<br>\r\nMaid attire: Bright orange shirt and skirt with dark red ribbons on the back, orange high heels<br>\r\nCasual attire: Light-colored long dress<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest and most motherly of the four maids. She takes care of most of the work around the house, including vacuuming, sweeping, and making the meals. Sometimes the workload gets to her, but she can always rely on her friends to help her. Her magic is almost on the same level as Ellen's, and the two sometimes tend to argue with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiamat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 22<br>\r\nHeight: 6'5\"<br>\r\nEye color: Crystal blue<br>\r\nHair color: Long, purple<br>\r\nMaid attire: Hair in a pony tail with a black scrunchy tying it back, a shoulder-less maid outfit that shows a bit of cleavage, a purple skirt with a white apron over it, and red shoes<br>\r\nCasual attire: Yellow shirt, blue jeans, and red boots<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert's beautiful childhood friend two years his senior. In addition to being very tall, she has an amazing, model-like figure, with huge breasts as well to show off. In some paths of the story she visits Robert to check in on his mansion, as he invited her.</td>",
