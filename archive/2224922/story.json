Cleo felt a dark smile on her face just as she stomped around the immediate area, with the cities being redesigned and made for her to walk through without any issue. Every footstep she would make would cause the Earth to tremble in her presence. She can be unpleasant, as she likes to cause destruction for her own amusement, and is selfish and arrogant without end, and will not take no for an answer. However, they tolerate her, given the fact she could easily destroy them out of existence if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was spoiled in every way imaginable when she was growing up. From all the cars, clothes, rich houses, and everything, she had everything she could have wanted, and she didn\u2019t had to do anything for it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The World Goddess Assembly is an organization of giantesses, or Goddesses, who rule the Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe history of the World Goddess Assembly begins during the Middle Ages, when the men of the world raped, slaughtered, and enslaved most of the world\u2019s women. Outraged by the men\u2019s senseless and needless desire of dominance over the women, the goddesses of all pantheons rose up against the gods by choosing one maiden from every existing civilization of the Middle Ages and growing them into giants, encouraging the oppressed men, women, and children to rise up against their unjust rulers. Seven maidens were chosen for each continent, and their forceful absolvation of the Middle Ages\u2019 oppression of men has deemed them by their followers and the fearful the Goddesses of the World. Out of those Goddesses, there was just one who rose above all other Goddesses, and that was the legendary St.Joan of Arc, who rallied her soldiers and allies at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased by the efforts of their Ascended, the old goddesses used the remainder of their power to construct the Pangaea Castle, a castle as tall as Mount Everest where St. Joan of Arc and her fellow reigning goddesses resided, ruling over each continent with justice and righteousness until the end of their days. By decree of the goddesses\u2019 Ascension Law, when a Goddess reaches the end of her life, the divine providence will choose one maiden to become a Goddess of a different civilization, one maiden to become the Goddess of the continent, and one maiden to become the Goddess of the World, but it cannot distinguish good from evil. From then on, from the first reign of Joan of Arc, certain maidens have been chosen by divine providence to fill in the empty seats left vacant by the previous Goddess. Millennia passed; civilizations rose and civilizations fell. Goddesses were Ascended from ordinary maidens and Goddesses have passed to join their kind in the afterlife, in the ethereal pantheon of the ancient goddesses. Technology and laws have been created, wars have been won and lost, and at the end of World War II, the United Nations was established as was the World Goddess Assembly. Because of the rise of many nations, through the power of the ancient goddesses, Pangaea Castle was expanded to include a Divine Gathering Plaza where the Goddesses from every nation and continent mingled, and the Axis Assembly Room where all of the Goddesses gathered in one giant room around the throne where the World Goddess sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddesses sizes determine their ranks in the World Goddess Assembly and their rule over the tiny people of Earth, divided into three categories from smallest to largest: the National Goddesses, the Continental Goddesses, and the World Goddess. The National Goddesses grow to be 100 ft in height whose power rises above the nation\u2019s leaders. The ones who rule each continent above all the other National Goddesses are the Continental Goddesses who grow to be 300 ft in height.  One goddess in particular is chosen to rule over the entire world, over the Continental Goddesses, and over the National Goddesses. She is called the World Goddess. She is chosen when she reaches up to 500 ft. high, bigger than even the tallest Continental Goddess. Each of the goddesses have different personalities and they rule their nation/continent through said personalities, be it good, neutral, or bad. The political leaders of the nations act as their ambassadors who take their high orders from the higher goddesses\u2019 wishes and commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld Goddess:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Deetya Jain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: A beautiful, skinny, and tan-skinned woman with neck-length black hair. Born with central heterochromia, Deetya\u2019s eyes are bright blue with bright green halfway down the center to symbolize the blue-and-green colors of the Earth\u2019s oceans and lands. As the World Goddess, Deetya wears traditional Indian clothing befitting women of great beauty, including gold-adorned sky blue sari with a multi-colored ghagra choli, gold jewel necklace, earrings, and crown, and a pair of sandals on her manicured feet with diamond-adorned straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Despite growing up in harsh poverty, Deetya has retained a great sense of kindness and sense of righteousness. She believes in the future for not only her fellow impoverished Indian people, but for every country and nation in the world. As either a normal-sized Indian slum girl or the World Goddess who oversees the world, Deetya is the kindest soul anyone will meet, which made her the perfect candidate for her to ascend into the goddess who towers over all other goddesses.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBackstory: Growing up poor in the slums of India, Deetya was raised by her mother to become kind-hearted towards the other poor children and people in the slums. At the age of 25, Deetya was ascended into the World Goddess and became the head of the World Goddess Assembly, advocating for rights of diversity, equality, wealth, and the future of mankind. She believes in the just punishment for the more wicked people of the world and rehabilitation for those she perceives as salvable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional Info: Deetya\u2019s mother lives with her in the Pangaea Castle and is the head of the castle staff who runs the operation like a well-oiled machine. Deetya is also the first Indian woman to be Ascended to the World Goddess status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPic: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/7d/7e/157d7e4b5c3dbb63338dc3c795db4e4d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/7d/7e/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You may add in the Continental Goddesses in the next chapter if you like)</span></div></div>",
