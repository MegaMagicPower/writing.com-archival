Being a King or Queen: Playing as the ruler of a kingdom has its perks such as free reign to explore your chosen kingdom and to attend certain royal gatherings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

She was well-proportioned, and was only wearing black underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punk girl opened her eyes, and looked over at Beau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're up.\" The punk girl said. \"Didn't think our routine would completely melt your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Beau replied. \"Did we, like, do anything last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" The punk girl replied. \"You completely passed out, so I brought you home. I'm only sleepin' here 'cause it's close to the performing center.

A punk rock band from the Punk Kingdom, they had no love for the other kingdoms, and their songs mostly talked about freedom, and how restrictive the other kingdoms were. Their lead singer, Raven, was also the closest person the Punk Kingdom had to a ruler. She didn't order people around (she valued rebellion and freedom), but she at least kept them from killing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Jeanna by the way.\" The punk girl said. \"You wanna come to the concert? There are gonna be a lot of Punk Kingdom girls there, and your queen told me you like bad girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeau couldn't believe it.
