It had been sevreal weeks since the end of the Tournament of Power, Goku finaly haveing been forgiven  by ChiChi was enjoying a nice rest after another day of working at his current job. It wasn't bad working at the fields, he was allowed to use his stength to remove any stumps or rocks that where in the field, and to his wife's joy, goku was even given a promotion to help manage more of the fields.<br>\r\nIt was not that however that mattered. In the forest that Suronded the son home a figer creeped. Emerging frm the line of trees, a silent shadow gracfuly mad its way closer to the small house, not singgle step making any sound. The figuer quickly approched the door walking through it as if it was not there, before it began making its way to the back of the house. The first door to Goten room was ignoored in favor to the one after, the master bed room.<br>\r\nSlowly to not  awaken the couple within the figuer creeped twoards the bed. Goku stirred slightly, causing the figer to stop for a moment before it continued its approch Leaning closer to goku the figuer mummbled into the sayins ear, before planting  a quick kiss to his cheek. Unseen to anyone the figuer smiled before dissappering into the darkness, knowing that eventually Goku would come to them. Unbeknownst to anyone the figuer had been drawn to goku for is power as a Sayin god, and had left with him a gift to further his strenght in time, now it was mearly a matter of waiting to see what happned.</span></div></div>",

With the radar, an advanced transport capsule and a red tube bra and spandex, she sneaked out and started collecting the dragon balls. It only took half a day to find and collect them all. Upon finding the last dragon ball she summoned Shenron to make her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulla began \"Shenron I would like to be as strong as strong as my dad and have access to the legendary super saiyan transformation, and that it would be easy for me to obtain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED!\" rumbled Shenron<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then Bulla could feel an immense power well up inside her and couldn't help but explore her new found abilities immediately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nnot knowing what to expect, she allowed the power to flood her body, which then started to quickly expand. her pectoral muscles swelled, to the size of a female bodybuilders size first, then continued to expand equal to a male bodybuilders. her breasts started to grow as well. Her biceps swelled from weak model arms to size similar to a male bodybuilders as well. while these limbs were growing, her shoulders and neck began to fill out to match the size of her growing body. Bulla's growth now was focused on her core and legs as she developed a six pack then an eight pack of hard rigid muscles. her hips widened out to match the growth of her thighs and calves which was already impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now larger then any male bodybuilder and still growing. Bulla's pupils then disappeared as she could not contain her energy. her aqua hair started to stand up and glow green and spiked on end. All her muscles once again began to expand until she was about the same size as Broly. Her expansion finally levelled off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulla stood before Shenron an imposing figure at least 8 ft tall and no area on her body looked weak as she was covered in hardened muscles! her traps were massive as well as her shoulders as they were both wide and thick. Bulla's Breasts grew to a size equal to large watermelons. the rest of her body was equally impressive and massive, yet barely still contained by the red outfit she put on earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wish has been granted!\u201d the dragon god boomed, its eyes glowing a bright gold as it did.<br>\r\nChichi was suddenly overcome with different yet equally euphoric and powerful sensations from her last transformation as the dragon\u2019s power did its work. Her body filled with an energy that was alien to her. Unlike Ki , which felt akin to a  blazing fire within her, this power felt akin to an immense cloud or bubble <br>\r\nThat made everything it touches feel less \u201creal\u201d, as though the world was a mere product of her imagination. <br>\r\nMeanwhile the aspiring goddess could feel her mind expanding to levels that were completely unfathomable to mortal beings as well as most gods for that matter. So great was her cognitive ability that she could encapsulate the totality of the entire multiverse and beyond with less than an after thought <br>\r\nChichi  was nearly overwhelmed by the sheer influx of information she just experienced but was able to keep enough of her wits for one final wish.<br>\r\n\u201c For my last wish, I want the ability to raise my abilities and any aspect of my being at will as well as the ability to wield hakai!\u201d  Roared the heavenly Titaness, who sent after shocks which reverberated throughout the universe as she did. <br>\r\nPorunga with one final growl and a wave of its hand made the giantess\u2019s wish a reality.<br>\r\nChichi threw head back and screamed as seemingly endless pleasure suffused her entire being down to her very muons. At the Same time her body was engulfed in a blinding white light of such intensity it could be seen throughout the galaxy!<br>\r\nFive whole minutes passed until the light finally died down and Chichi could be found panting and  breathless from the experience.  <br>\r\nThe dragon  began to rise higher  toward the sky. \u201c All wishes have been granted,. Farewell!\u201d with that his body became a bright light before transforming into seven distinct spheres  which jettisoned away from each other at great speeds with the sky clearing shortly after. Once Chichi regained her composure she stared in awe at herself. Standing  at  120.5 kilometers tall ( 395,276 feet) She was a truly monolithic existence. She experimentally flexed her right arm ever so slightly. The bicep bulged for only the briefest of moments be it was enough to generate a shock wave powerful enough to shear clean entire mountain ranges and blast away the surrounding  forests and valleys of all flora and sediment and even water until there was nothing left except bare bedrock as far as the  eye could see.<br>\r\nChichi could only stare in stunned silence at the damage she caused by barely even twitching her arm  while still holding back  immeasurably! This continued for an uncomfortably long  time until  the Titaness burst out laughing.  She laughed an earth shaking laugh that caused  magnitude seven to eight earthquakes and tsunamis to erupt all over the planet. \u201cThis is perfect!\u201d the godlike woman said to herself. \u201c I'm so strong now I believe I can do anything !\u201d<br>\r\nShe was truly supreme now, containing  infinitely more power in a single one of her atoms than every other being in the known multiverse combined! Now that she is strongest there is, she would never have to fear anything threatening her and her loved ones ever again. The Son family Matriarch noticed that  her literal mountainous valley of cleavage, held aloft by her infinitely powerful  pectorals, actively obstructed her vision to the point where she would  normally have to completely bend over in order to see past them but this was of no concern, with her new powers  she no longer needed her eyes to see. <br>\r\nChichi looked behind herself to see she now possessed an equally profound and perfectly formed derriere framed by an also equally profound set of hips. She gave it a little shake, which produced gale force winds  and the formation of  EF5 tornadoes as a result, and giggled to herself. With all this power nothing was out of  reach! However she was at a loss for what to do first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it turns out she was wrong, almost. She saw Trunks passed out in bed while Vegeta was sitting at the stairs leading into the void of the chamber. What was even stranger is that Bulla was actually training in the void in what looked now like SSG mixed with SS3. Apparently she became aware of Bulma's wish after she made it, and decided to practice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Well hey Vegeta, I'm back from my errand.<br>\r\nV: Hello Bulma, nice of you to return. Judging by the looks of you, I think I understand why Bulla can do what she just did a few minutes ago.<br>\r\nB: What would that be?<br>\r\nV: Look at her. She's somehow found a way to fuse transformations. Her hair is long like a Super Sayian 3, but it's red just like a Super Sayian God. Her frame and muscle tone is also like that of a Super Saiyan God as well. Did you make another wish with the Dragonballs?<br>\r\nB: Guilty is charged, and I'm loving every second of it. What's with Trunks over there?<br>\r\nV: Before you came back, something came over Bulla and asked me to teach her how to fight. So I did, and she picked up everything I taught her perfectly as though she was a very seasoned warrior. After a while, she knew almost every technique I can teach her and she wanted to test her skills out on someone. Trunks decided to fight her using Super Saiyan Blue on her, but then she turned into what she is now and knocked him out in a few blows. Then she faught me and I barely beat her. What you're seeing right now is her acting out of frustration. I guess you could say your wish gave her a sense of pride that she never had before. She's obviously one of a kind aside from yourself and whoever else your second wishes affected, which makes her special since her power is unreal.<br>\r\nB: Wow, I didn't think that we would end up that strong. She's already able to beat Trunks and give you a run for you money. I'm really impressed, and kinda surprised with how well you're taking it.<br>\r\nV: Believe me, I'm not happy with nearly losing to someone who just started fighting a day ago, but I she's also my daughter so I'm glad that if anyone can beat me in battle, it's my own flesh and blood.<br>\r\nB: Speaking of fighting, would you like to teach me how to fight? I've already mastered all the transformations as you can tell *she says as she flips her long blue hair back*, but I want to learn and help if just you and Goku aren't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta turns his eyes to meet hers and thinks about it for a moment.<br>\r\nV: Ok fine. I'll teach you. I'm curious to see if you're able to learn at the same pace as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of training, Bulma managed to learn pretty much as much as Bulla did since both of them have infinite stamina. She also tried what she learned using various different combinations of forms. She eventually decided her combo would be SSB with Legendary form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do they go from here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Over the years, she got tired of just helplessly watching and hoping that they make it out alive. So she decided to take matters into her own hands. She made a serum out of the extracted DNA from powerful saiyans such as: Golu, Vegeta, Gohan, Broly, future Trunks, and so on. She extracted theirs as Dr. Gero did in order to make Cell. After possibly figuring out a balance, she thought she had made a serum that could make her stronger almost instantly. As desperate as she was, she decided to test it on herself immediately regardless of safety issues.

She was the size of a male bodybuilder and could manage to walk around in 500x normal gravity with little to no difficulty. She couldn't wait to show it to Vegeta when he comes home from training with Goku and Whis. She realized after a while that her saiyan DNA was possibly made her more powerful than the other saiyans considering how much stronger she was after every time she would push herself to the limit. Last night, she had a dream that she was in a form similar to the legendary super saiyan form and put some thought into it, \"Maybe I am able to achieve that form since I have some of Broly's DNA in me. Seems like a long shot, but maybe if I can focus on releasing that ki I might just make it happen.\" She stepped outside and began to focus for a while, and then began to transform. Growing larger and larger, she successfully changed into legendary form. She flew into the gravity chamber to test out her new power, and managed to reach 1500x normal gravity. She was still pretty much unaffected, but she wanted it to still be intact for Vegeta when he returns sooner or later. For now, she loved her new powers.</span></div></div>",

Bulma grabbed Vegeta by the arm and threw him into space. She then launched ki blasts at him, forcing him to collide with the moon, and then she transformed, to Vegeta's shock and she threw him as hard as possible without destroying the planet back at Earth. This forced Vegeta out of blue and Bulma went back to her base form as well. Vegeta was terrified at what had happened. He wasn't able to land a hit, but she defeated him effortlessly.

The old pervert was surprised by how well she had developed but was even more surprised by her request. \"You want me to train you for the Budokai!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ox princess nodded. \"It's for Goku\" she said a bit shyly \"we plan to marry soon and I want to show him we're a good match. I figure giving him  a good fight will do it.\" Roshi nodded though he doubted the naive girl was right about Goku's intentions. The boy probably didn't even know what marriage was. \"I'll do my best Chi-chi but you may have bitten off more than you can chew. Goku's far stronger than you realize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi insisted she didn't care and the training began. She progressed well, learning the kamehameha wave in the first week, but when the training was almost over, she came to him with a strange request. \"You want to learn what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to learn your Max Power transformation\" Chi-chi insisted \"my dad always said you were at your strongest with it. Goku's sure to be impressed if I show up with that kind of power.\" Roshi was aghast. \"But Chi-chi, women aren't meant to assume such a form\" he protested \"you'll become ugly and unfeminine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi placed her hands on her hips and glared. \"Goku won't care how i look and I can always power down when I'm not using it. You said you'd teach me all you could and I'm not leaving this island until you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoshi relented and showed Chi-chi what to do, dreading the result. None of the few female students he'd had over the years had asked to learn and he wasn't even sure if they could. Of course, he usually chased them away after a day or two so they might've been unable to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi did as Roshi instructed and began to grow. Within minutes, she looked like a female bodybuilder and her breasts had doubled in size. She flexed a bicep and grinned with triumph. Goku wouldn't know what hit him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still think I'm ugly and unfeminine Roshi?\" The old master didn't respond, too busy drooling over Chi-chi's enlarged breasts. A quick whack to the head ended this. \"Quit gawking you old pervert, there's work to do!\" <br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",
