The strangest parts of the orphanage was it was a pokemon and human orphanage, that and the headmaster is a zoroark named, Riku. The Zoroark, himself, is really nice, friendly, funny at times, sneaky, and a danger to anger, so much that when his step-brother the famous Groudon fears for his life. Any who...after living there for so long, I met many dear friends I consider my family, especially Yuna, a female buizel, whom I accidentally captured in a poke ball when I was 8. Yuna doesn't mind though, in fact she considers this our future marriage engagement since this happened, she loves me, and it's the greatest excuse plus I don't mind either, she's cute, kind, and all I want in a mate/girlfriend. All was great, I may have not chosen to live with my childhood friend, Hiromi and Professor Yasuo but I am happy. However, that didn't last too long or so it seemed, since our orphanage was moving! If that wasn't shocking enough, Riku came and said, \"Daisuke...I'm so grateful for everything and having you here but...I have found out info about your parents and yes...they are alive. Oh and Hiromi found her family too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So that's how <span class=\"cplum\">Yuna</span>, <span class=\"cgreen\">Dante</span>, a zoura that is the closest one to a brother I have, <span class=\"clblue\">Aqua</span>, my older sister-like anthro suicune, <span class=\"corange\">Ven</span>, a anthro vulpix who calls me his cousin, and me all started on a journey to find my family plus become a Pokemon master or the Champion while were on it. They also didn't want to leave me, since were family and nothing will ever change that, 'sides Dante wants to beat the Champ, Aqua wants to meet my family badly, Ven wants to see the world, and Yuna wants to be by my side always. First things first, see Professor Yasuo, for the rest of my equipment I'll need. Next, Hiromi and her family, just because I can. Finally, a skateboard or bike or both, since they sound cool to ride on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PROFESSOR YASUO's House</b><br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Professor Yasuo?\" I asked as I knocked on his door, with the group behind me.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"OLD MAN, YOU THERE!?\" Dante yelled knowing how much he hated being called an old man and would be there in a heart beat. Trust me, he could be on his 2nd floor but you call him 'old man', blink once, and he's already down the stairs that and even though he's peaceful, he will find ways, mainly for Dante, to regret their actions plus have you ever seen his house? Not even a speck is there, since Dante comes almost everyday.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm not old! I haven't even turned 40, you crazy-!\" He says somewhat calmly, as he opens the door to see the 5 of us at his door stop, \"Huh? When did you guys get here?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A few minutes ago. Hey is Hiromi there or is she with family?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, actually. Kirke, Auroa, Yuri, Hana, Kaori, and-- Oh wait you haven't met them yet. Uh just come in and we'll get you settled.\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks.\" [me]<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks Professor.\" [Aqua]<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hope I'm not bothering you.\" [Yuna]<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks very much.\" [Ven]<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Old man, you are the best!\" [Dante]<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course I didn't hear much after our introductions but I had a feeling as the 4 of us walked into the living room, that Dante is gonna be busy for a while. That silly fox, I wonder when will he learn, maybe after his 818th attempt? Nah, he has too much fun with Yasuo. I had hoped everything won't be too weird when I got to the room.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't my real father nor my adoptive father but he did this for my safety and to give me a place to live. I never knew my parents except that they had abandoned me on the door stop of Professor Yasuo. His name meant man of peace which fit him so well it wasn't a lie. He taught me how to catch my own pokemon, how to take care of them, enjoying the land around us, and to cook. I owe him a lot for all the things he did but now that I'm 15, I asked if he'll let me go to the strange forest near our village, he was hesitant but let me go anyway. He knew he couldn't stop me from being even a little bit curious although he could make sure I had proper equipment, which he did. I thanked him before I left on my journey to this mysterious forest.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inside the forest was beautiful and felt like it was full of life, it made me excited to visit around seeing all the tress, flowers, and wild life. It felt as if the forest itself was both calling me deeper inside, and even standing here was wonderful. An arf from behind made me jump. I turned to see a 7 foot arcanine, smiling, I freaked out like any normal girl, screamed then ran. I got pretty far enough I thought until a more different arcanine this one about 8 to 9 feet, with blackish fur stood in my way and I ended up slaming into him. All he did was use his mouth to get me up. \"You should look out where your going next time ok, Hiromi?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"H-h-how d-do you k-k-know my n-name?\" I said trembling a little bit. He just laughed.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So much like your mom...if only Auroa knew her pup was here...she'd freak out. So how was living with humans, little one?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why did-\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My choice. We wanted you to live with us but we knew it'd be better living with a human knowing your human. 'Sides the professor owed me. So I made him promise not to tell you and when he believes your old enough to be a trainer or when he thinks is a good time to bring you or let you come 'home'. Oh and I'm Kirke. So you ready Yuri?\" I turned back to see the other giant only to be met with his wet black nose.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hi baby sis. My name's Yuri. I plan on being your 1st pokemon, is that ok with you?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Umm ok.\" I took out a poke ball that Yasuo gave me and prepared to throw it.</span></div></div>",

I threw the poke ball as well I as I could using quite some force to hopefully hit Yuri.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"OW! MY PAW!!\" Yuri yelled as I saw the poke ball slam into his front left paw with enough force, it sounded bad.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry big brother.\" Was all I got to say before he went into the poke ball. I casually walked over to the ball as it laid where Yuri's hurt paw was, picking it up I had almost forgotten my 'dad' was right behind me, that was until I felt a furry thing on my shoulder. \"Oh! Um..Kir-\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Father is fine. So, what is it, Hiromi?\" He said smiling a big happy canine smile as I threw my poke ball letting out Yuri.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What...what is the rest of...um...our...family like? Plus big brother...Your actually my 2nd pokemon. Michiko is my 1st, I had forgotten that, since she always hangs out with me and the professor.\" I asked my father before telling my brother.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who's Michiko?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am.\" Michiko's soft warm, kind, angelic voice rang from behind us, out came a beautiful ninetales, which happen to be her. Her silky white fur dancing in the wind, her purple eyes which is even more beautiful in the moonlight, and her nine tails in a dance of their own behind her. She kept walking until she was a touch away from me. \"So this is your dad and brother, Hiromi? Hmm?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm Yuri. This here is our dad, Kirke.\" Yuri said as he walked over to Michiko's side. <i>Aww. Big Brother's in love~.</i> That's when the two of them went off to the side and started to talk to each other.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hiromi?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes dad?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"While those two are having their conversation, I just wanted to tell you 'bout the family. Well you know the two of us, but then there is your mother, Auroa, a female lucario, trust me I know having you sounds weird, but her father is human, next is your two little sisters, <span class=\"cmagenta\">Kaori</span> and <span class=\"cpink\">Hana</span>, are twins and riolus, and your oldest sister,<span class=\"corange\"> Kaeda</span>, is a arcanine much like us. That's just siblings and parents, you have 3 uncles and 4 aunts, <span class=\"clred\">Groudon</span>, <span class=\"cgrey\">Riku</span>, a zoroark, <span class=\"cppink\">Kenta</span>, also known as Palkia are your uncles, <span class=\"clgrey\">Miyu</span>, known as Reshiram, <span class=\"clblue\">Kasumi</span>, Groudon's wife known as Kyogre,...however, I can't remember the other two strange enough. Plus don't get me started with your cousins.\" He told me before stopping so I could process the information, \"So do you want to go 'home' now? Or should we take a longer route and I'll tell you more.\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I want to.....\"</span></div></div>",

However...I'm still mad at you two for not letting me live with you.\" I told him looking back to see my brother and my friend getting along well, they were still talking with my brother making moves on Michiko. \"I can't change what happened but I can change how I want to live my future. Oh, daddy? Isn't Uncle Riku the headmaster of the MoonForest orphanage or whatever it's called?\"<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes.

Daichi!?\" I yelled in a girly middle schooler drama-like tone, getting the attention of the pair and the shocked look of my dad, which made me quickly go from excited to extremely embarrassed. \"I--umm....Uhh..so...Daichi is gonna be able to see his family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N: Need sleep horrible case of headache and writer's block.
