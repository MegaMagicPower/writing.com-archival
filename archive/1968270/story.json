The impact hadn't done any serious physical damage, but it still hurt. Zelda ran up to him, a worried look on her face. She held out her hand, and he gratefully accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small ball of light caught their attention, as an item spawned in front of them. They looked at it. It appeared similar to a Super Mushroom, but the cap was larger than normal, and was similar to a 1-up Mushroom in coloring, but with lime green spots. Oddly, pulsing veins could be seen on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda reached a hand out, but Link stopped her. If it was dangerous, she shouldn't touch it.

But after the valiant effort of the Smash Bros, the worlds were in peace and the trophies were able to enjoy their merry lives again, which is an interesting statement when you consider every trophy fights to live and lives to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of said fights, Princess Peach squared off against Princess Zelda to decide who'd have the final piece of the cake the princesses had shared earlier. One bystander might think this to be too savage or brutal but such matches were common ammongst trophies even for the smallest of reasons, you see they really never miss an opportunity to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Peach had the physical advantage, despite her looks not really showing she could pack a real punch behind that pink dress. Zelda on the other hand was holding her ground and trying her best to keep Peach away, she knew that if a single Peach Bomb landed on her Zelda would lose for sure. The odds though were in Zelda's favor since she was fighting at home turf, the top of her castle, so she had a lot of ground to put between her and Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Zelda stop running and come learn your lesson already!\" Peach spoke on her soft girly tone, tauntiny the pther princess to action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And get blown up to space? Not likely.\" Zelda retorted, keeping a constant barrage of Dyn's Fires lit at Peach's direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was able to dodge most of Zelda's attacks with some effort but as soon as she started to gain some ground, Zelda would just float away and resume her barrage. Peach did try to throw her Vegetables at some point but Zelda could easily deflect them with Nayru's Love so the only tactic was a clean beating, which was evidently not going to happen very soon, that was until the blue sky glowed white and a spherical object started calmly hovering to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth princesses knew what this meant, this object could decide the fate of this little match as Smash Balls usually did, but both princesses couldn't stop but notice how this particular Smash Ball had an odd glow to it. While regularly they would glow with the colors of the rainbow, this one had an ominous red sheen to it, with white sparkling veins pulsating from it at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda hesitated to chase the Smash Ball, fearing this new energy could mean problems in the future, but Peach was bolder and took the leap. Dodging another fireball aimed at her, Peach struck the Smash Ball with one bounce from her explosive behind and it was gone, destroyed by the impact, its energy shimmering around Peach's dainty form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh this feels different!\" Peach exclaimed. Her eyes now a deep white as a red aura swirled around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach plase don't unleash the power! This doesn't look safe!\" Zelda yelled, her calm demeanour giving way to her worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Zelda dear, if this backfires I'm sure the others will figure out a way to counter it!\" Peach kept her high hopes, concentrating the aura around her and then unleashing the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around Peach started to heat up as the red energy started to coarse through her. From her small hands, through her chest and legs, the energy started filling Peach with an odd sensation, a good sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach started to feel the urge to break something, to destroy something, she clenched a fist and suddenly her arm started to bulge, her muscles growing at an accelerated rate. Biceps, triceps, quadriceps, her arm was bulking up with pure raw muscle, destroying her silk white glove in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr OHH!\" Peach groaned as the growth started to spread to her chest and other arm, her other glove suffering from the same fate as her back muscles started to strain her pink corset, pushing her breasts forward and straining the top of the dress to the point where the fabric started to show signs of ripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth continued as Peach felt her abs start to push against the fabric and her thighs start to tear through her white stockings. Soon her legs were bulging, her muscles were cracling and she started to show signs of size growth as well, her legs starting to show more and more under the pink skirt. Peach's dainty red heels were destroyed as her feet grew, making dents at the white fabric of the stockings as her calves tore through the remaining pieces, leaving her legs and feet completely bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at least three times her normal size, the new Peach roared in bliss, ripping the annoying extra size from her dress and leaving her in what looked like a tank top and miniskirt made from the shreds of what once was an elegant royal dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PEACH WANT TO SMASH!\" The new and improved Peach roared, punching a clean hole at the side of one of the castle towers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stared in shock at this new monstrous princess. Her girly features were mostly there but her face was now a visage of pure anger, her blue eyes now pure white and shimmering with raw power as the Giga Peach took a look at her surroundings, finding the only breathing target in the vicinity, her opponent Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an extreme speed, Giga Peach bent her legs and jumped, her powerful feet giving such a spring that she was cornering Zelda in a blink. Princess Zelda could barely take a breath before a punch from Giga Peach's massive fist covered her vision entirely, and then all she felt was the ground going away and the splitting pain on her head, chest and midriff. </span></div></div>",

However, if he beat the Gerudo, then the Leader of Team Star Wolf would be given the Triforce of Power.

ONce this happened there was a short bright light as the piece of the Triforce left Ganondorf's left hand and then from on the top of Wolf's as he then added, \"There it is done. But I doubt you'll be able to control the power that comes that piece of the Triforce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple eyed wolf's grin remained though when he remarked back with, \"Heh, I guess we'll see about that won't we? However, unlike you, I don't plan on using this power to try and take over a kingdom or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted the red haired man to sharply turn around before he mockingly told him, \"I see. So you intend to use this new power for good. How noble of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch so what if I am. What does it matter to you?\" Wolf asked, with anger clear in hsi voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf did say anything at first as he just began to walk out of the room. But before he left the room completely he warned, \"It actually does not matter to me in the least. However, just because you have new power. That does not mean that you can keep <i>her</i> safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this comment prompted the gray and white furred wolf to let out a growl of anger when he warned, \"I thought I told you that it was none of your business on why I wanted this.\" After saying this though Wolf just saw the Gerudo walk from the rest of way out of the room. And once he knew that he was gone the lupine looked down at his left hand with the Triforce of Power on it when he conitnued with, \"Besides what does he know anyway. I know that I keep her safe. And I'll prove it by keeping Princess....</span></div></div>",

The reason for this was because Princess Zelda, Robin, and the Twilight Princess Minda were currently trying to make a magic potion of some kind. What kind of potion was unclear to the mercenary as the sliver haired nobleman asked, \"So what exactly are these potted plants for, Zelda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox watched as the brunette haired woman turned her head away from the other two women as she explained, \"Oh, my apologizes for not explaining why we needed your help.\" She then turned completely around to face both of them before she added, \"You see Minda, Robin, and I want to try and make a potion that can help dying plants regain the strength to regrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get that part. But why did you need us to hold onto these pots?\" Fox questioned, while he slightly tilted his head to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that should be obvious. We couldn't risk accidentally knocking those plants over. If that happened then we couldn't test out the potion since we want to see if it can help a single isolated plant before moving on to ones that are already planted in the ground.\" Robin explained, while she looked back the green eyed fox for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted the light brown and cream furred anthro to let out a embarrassed laught before he admitted, \"Yeah, I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had said this though he heard the white haired tactician let out a gasp of surprise as she announced, \"Zelda, the potion has changed to the color that we wanted. I think it's ready to be tested now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" Zelda replied, before Fox saw her look back over at him and Corrin. Upon doing this she went on with, \"Fox, Corrin, please come over here to the table so that we may begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fox and Corrin nodded their heads before they started to walk towards the small end table that the potion was on. But while they did this the mercenary heard the red eyed prince's voice as he let out a gasp of worry and warned, \"Fox, be careful. There's a lose floorboard straight ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Corrin, I see it.\" Fox reassured the prince while he stepped over the loose floorboard and looked over his shoulder to make sure Corrin also had stepped over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this though the leader of the Star Fox Team failed to notice how close he gotten to the end table before he bumped into it closing not only himself to fail onto his backside, but the magic potion had tipped over as well. Seeing this prompted Fox to close to his eyes as he felt the liquid fall onto both him and the potted plant that was still in his grasp. When he reopened his eyes the anthro fox saw that not only had the potion slipped onto the floor in front of the table, but had gotten onto him and the plant. And upon looking down at his clothes Fox saw that the amount of potion that had gotten on him was.....</span></div></div>",

However, when the mercenary started to stand back up onto his feet his eyes widen in shock upon seeing the blue colored liquid disappear completely without a trace. Once of the anthro's ears twitched when he heard Corrin's voice as he asked, \"Fox, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think so....\" The green eyed fox replied, not quite sure what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attetion was brought over to the Princess Zelda once she had taken the potted plant form his hands and said, \"Fox, I am so sorry that our potion fell on you. And I'm afraid we have no idea what will it do to you either.\" However, Fox saw her give him a reassuring smile before she added, \"But do not worry for Robin, Minda, and I will do our best to make an antidote as soon as possible. But while we do this I must a favor of you, Prince Corrin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is it?\" The slivered nobleman wondered, once he was tanding next to the anthro fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will need you to keep an eye on Fox and let us know right away if some side effects start to show.\" Zelda explained while she placed the plant onto the small table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox saw the prince nod his head in understanding as he replied, \"You can count on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this the light brown and cream furred fox let out another sigh as he stated, \"Well, just to be safe I think I'll go take a shower to just make sure that potion didn't get into my fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes had passed until both Fox and Corrin arrived outisde of the shower area of the mansion. But before the mercenary opened the door and walked inside the red eyed young man asked with concern in his voice, \"Fox, are you sure you're alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the prince's surprise he saw the anthro fox look bsck at him with a reassuring smile on his face while he told him, \"It's nice of you to be concerned about me. But I honestly fel fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright if you say so. But if you need anything I'll be out here waiting for you.\" Corrin stated, as the mercenary nodded his head and then entered the shower area. But once he had closed the door though the prince found his mind start to wander while he asked out loud to himself, \"I wonder if that potion will have an odd effects on Fox. I sure hope that is not the case.\" Upon saying this a light blush formed on his face as he kept on going with, \"And yet for some reason my mind keeps on flashing back to a team battle that we had together. I don't know why, but for some reason when Fox grew in size because of the Super Mushroom I-I felt my heart skip a beat. The only problem is that I don't know why that is. Have I started to like Fox as more then just a friend perhaps?\" He then let out a heavy sigh before he ended his thoughts with, \"Although I guess I can worry about that situation at a later time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox let out a sigh of total relaxation once the hot water had made contact with his fur covered body. But while the anthro fox washed himself his mind began to wander as well when he muttered to himself, \"Okay Fox, just take it easy. There's most likely nothing seriously wrong with you. You'll be fine. And besides now you get a chance to actually get to know Corrin better since Zelda wants him to stick by me until this issue is resolved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had siad these words though the green eyed mercenary felt an odd tingling sensation that suddenly was running through his entire. Once this happened the leard of the Star Fox Team found himself letting out a slight moan of pleasure as he closed his eyes for a what felt like only a few minutes. But while his eyes were closed the anthro's runner like muscles start to grow and expand until they looked like that of a bodybuilder's. Not only that, but once Fox had opened his eyes his saw that his ears were closer to the showerhead which he knew was not right as he said out loud, \"What in the world?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying this though the now larger anthro fox heard the doorknob being turned before Corrin walked inside and closed the door. But after he did this Fox turned to face him while he asked, \"Fox, is everything alright? By the sound of your voice it sounded like you.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercenary's eyes soon grew large in shock just like the prince's as he realized that the young man was now eye level with his now large and well muscled......</span></div></div>",

After the awards, fox and corrin went back to their forest. Fox found a waterfall to wash himself and try to get the extra static out from his fur after corrin hit him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The battle had been going on for some time now. A free-for-all between the lady tactician Robin, the electrical pokemon Pikachu, The Blue Bomber Mega Man, and The Koopa King Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four were down to one stock a piece which meant a sudden death of sorts. The twin-tailed tactician's mind working at it's usual speed as she plotted out her course of action, like her opponents she only had one \"life\" of sorts so it meant she couldn't get careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike dodging that leaf shield tossed right at her by the shorter Mega Man not to mention the constant blaster-fire. The blue bomber knowing that Robin needed time to charge her spells thus wanted to prevent such charges from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the electric mouse took on the much bigger and stronger Bowser, the pokemon using it's natural speed to it's advantage even though Bowser wasn't as slow as he used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo things went on until a prized Smash Ball appeared on the battlefield! Robin knew if she could break it open she'd be able to summon some backup in form of her comrade Chrom and she definitely wanted to keep it away from the Koopa King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAble to keep Mega Man at bay with a well placed Elfire she ran as fast as she could possibly using a Elwind spell or two if she had to. Unfortunately for Robin, Pikachu could not keep Bowser from reaping the rewards after the pokemon had done all the work to loosen up the Smash Ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Koopa King laughing in satisfaction as he knocked away the yellow mouse, shattering the ball and bathing in it's power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Robin muttered under her breath her only shot now was to force the power out of Bowser with a fully charged Elthunder. She only hoped she could get it off in time. Thankful she had already pocketed one Robin fired but it would be too little too late as Bowser began to transformed into his gigantic feral-like Kaiju form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Koopa King growling with a monstrous roar as he reemerged as a terrifying beast that nearly took up the entire stage area! The battlefield quaking with each thunderous foot fall. Robin could only watch as he wasted little time in eliminating Pikachu. Mega Man unafraid bravely attempted to fight the monster off but he too soon fell. Knowing he only had precious time left Giga Bowser turned his demonic face over in Robin's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking on something so monstrous and demonic Robin felt a sense of deja-vu wash over her...and she had won out last time. The tactician knew however that none of her spell would put a dent in Bowser's current form so instead she had to buy time long enough for him to revert back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew how, even if it was extremely risky. Her attack spells could not hurt him but what about the unique Nosferatu spell? Normally it would lock her opponent in place as it healed her wounds but could she actually get it to work on something so massive as Giga Bowser?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a frightening roar the monstrous Koopa King made his move determined to knock out Robin in one fell swoop. Standing her ground Robin knew it was now or never, flipping open her spell book she prepared the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to tip the scales!\" She shouted her familiar battle cry as her book and hands glowed in a dark purple-like fashion.</span></div></div>",
