She protects us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has defended Okinawa from many threatens like other monsters, aliens, robots, terrorists, and much more.

The monster was a fire breathing dinosaur known as Goreasaurus and he was bad. He looked like a horned tyrannosaurus and had stomped forward and smashed several buildings with his large head. The monster would've eaten a woman with children as they tried to escape but then Soyaka shoots her robot fist and knocks the giant monster back. \"Don't even think about it Goreasaurs,\" says Soyaka as she turns into Godzilla mode and lets out a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're about to go back to extinction.\" Goreasaurus roars loudly and then he runs up and tries to bite Soyaka but Soyaka swings her tail and knocks the skin off Goreasaurus's face before biting him on the neck Goreasaurus drives his horns into Soyaka's neck but then Soyaka shoots flames from her mouth and burns Goreasaurus's back to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoreasaurus roars as his back burns up and his spine is exposed. Soyaka roars and tears away at Goreasaurus's back until the tyrant lizard is all bones.

Okinawa is much safer now with you around. All kaiju fall beneath you.\" Soyaka smiles but then the ground begins to shake violently as evil laughter fills the air, prompting Soyaka to morph into mixed dragon form and fly into the sky. \"What's going on?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think Goreasaurus was the one chosen to erase the nation?

Quantra's mecha form was a bright blue robot made entirely out of ice and tortoise shaped with cannons on her arms and back that could shoot out freezing rays. Truly Quantra was an alien to be feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see you have abandoned your mission Soyaka,\" says the alien menace. \"You were supposed to conquer this Earth!\" Soyaka steps in front of Quantra and shakes her head. \"I don't want to destroy anymore Quantra.

You can't hide forever.\" \"I didn't plan to.\" Suddenly the sky rumbles and thunder cracks as lightning strikes down on the streets and forces everyone inside. Soyaka looks up into the sky and sees a horrible sight as she flies forward. A giant black furred anthromorphic fox woman with long bluish hair and nine tails. This kitsune was obese in body shape and had to be ten times Soyumi's size, yet she was floating in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you!?\" yells Soyaka. The Kitsune girl swings four of her tails to scoop up several humans as they scream and try to run, but then the kitsune brings them to her mouth and devours them all before answering Soyaka's question. \"I am the fox queen Kuroyoko. Mistress of yokai. I was hibernating like I do for a thousand years right before waking up to feast on some lovely mortal souls. Usually I send my tails in the forms of monsters like Goreasaurus, but since I face opposition, well, it looks like I have no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka lets out a roar. \"I'll kill you you freaking fox!\" Soyaka lets out her sonic blast but it barely does anything against Kuroyoko as she lets out an evil chortle. \"I've seen your forms in action.

Soyaka shrieks and flies down and wraps her wings around the robot giantess, but only receives an electric shock that gives her great pain and blows her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soyaka is forced back into human form, she gets up to sees the robot giantess laughing in a metallic voice. \"Darkware!\" yells Soyaka. \"You're still alive.\" Darkware, the living virus holds up her mechanical hands and shows her huge claws. \"Nothing can destroy Darkware. You should know that.\" Darkware was a computer virus meant to be used as a weapon of war. But she was used to hack into a complicated network that bathed her in a strange energy that gave her malicious sentience and the ability to leave the computer world as a being of electrical energy. She could absorb anything metal or mechanical and use it to upgrade herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka thought she deleted Darkware last time they met but this was apparently not the case. Soyaka switches to robot form, turning her body into a red and silver form with long wires for hair. She turns her mechanical hands into photon bazookas and fires at Darkware, but Darkware melts herself into an electric robotic ooze and slinks up to Soyaka. Soyaka keeps firing at Darkware but Darkware dodges every shot and Soyaka is forced to run as she keeps firing and then Darkware responses by dematerializing more buildings and growing bigger as she moves towards Soyaka. Soyaka activates the sonic cannon in her chest and then unleashes it, managing to disrupt Darkware and cause her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka sure of her victory walks up towards the cyber giantess and focuses her cannon, but when it looks like she's about to win, Darkware touches her foot and begins to disappear into Soyaka. In the process Soyaka's body turns black with blue highlights just like Darkware. She tries to morph into a new form, but Darkware spreads too fast and soon Soyaka's mechanical body up to her neck is consumed by Darkware and merged to the virus.

Ever since she landed on the planet, she decided to abandon her duties and just live on Earth and defend it from all sorts of threats, and as a result... she is seen as a hugely positive role model to the kids. With her at a massive 300ft foot tall, it is sure a huge thing. The kids would play with her on many games on VC, or just watch her trash the city, or defend the city, and they are so many things that the kids can do with Soyaka, that it's just impossible for me to list them all in one huge chapter. The parents really like her, although they have mixed feelings of her (like her always being in a bikini), but other than that.... she is just a joy to play with. Soyaka is surely a nut with kids, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the kids are watching as Soyaka is fighting a virtual Godzilla on the VC recreation of Tokyo, apparently Soyaka is winning, as Godzilla is really being taken down by her sheer wit and strength. Godzilla attempted to fire the atomic breath at her, but Soyaka continues to stomp towards him just as she fires her own breath at him, and her breath easily gets through and blows Godzilla out for good. The kids cheer as their favorite kaiju known as Soyaka have just beaten Godzilla. Ever since Soyaka came along, she became the kid's new favorite kaiju, much better than Godzilla, and she ends her session with an iconic monster roar (won't get into specifics.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids were all wowed by her and she comes by them and lets out a roar that the kids love, heck... Soyaka just likes having fun, so she sometimes acts like a monster to the kids as well, and they love her for it. Just as the kids finish talking to her, etc... Someone comes in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a man in a black suit... and he asked Soyaka (Soyaka has heightened senses you know) for good reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soyakazilla... as the kids call you!

Only that morning had the object been detected entering Earth's gravity well, seemingly from nowhere--it was almost as if the big rock had <i>sneaked past</i> any detection. Despite the strange behavior, an impact site and time was soon determined: Tokyo Bay, sometime that afternoon. The Japanese response was immediate and decisive: evacuations were issued of much of the capital, the Diet (Japanese legislature; think Parliament or a Senate) was relocated to Nagasaki, and all flights and incoming ships were warned and redirected towards safer destinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all <i>would</i> have been a fantastic reaction, if not for one detail: the \"meteor\" was, in fact, an orbital drop pod--a troop transport with a single, gigantic inhabitant: Soyaka. And the people of Earth would soon wish, oh so very, VERY much, that they had suffered a mere meteor strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka had already made a name for herself as a one-girl army. Whenever someone wanted a race of smaller scale dealt with, but didn't want to send in an entire army, they sent <i>her</i> instead. She was young for a mercenary, just on the tail end of thirteen, but that hadn't stopped her from smashing entire cities to rubble--or getting filthy rich from doing it. And it looked like she was in for another paycheck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her disguised pod, Soyaka grinned ear to ear as she neared her destination. No matter how many times she had done this, she always got giddy before a job; always relished a chance to \"Smash, Thrash, and Get My Cash\", as she put it. And from what she'd learned about this \"Earth\" place, she was in for one hell of a fun time. The planet was nothing short of beautiful, covered in giant blue oceans, and the land held everything from deserts to jungles to mountains and everything in-between. It was a really nice place to live; these humans sure had lucked out evolving on a place like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I have to make a mess of it,\" Soyaka said out loud, giving her blue bikini a once-over. These humans weren't exactly the most advanced race on the galactic neighborhood, so wearing her usual combat armor would be a waste of time. \"Better to go in something comfy for an easy job like this,\" Soyaka said with a giggle, adjusting the straps on the bottom (hired gun though she was, Soyaka had a sense of modesty). \"Besides, this isn't an extermination--thank the gods for that!--I just have to smash the place until the local tinies surrender, then call in Saris and tell him he can drop by and build his vacation home...heh, if that smooth-talker hadn't offered so much money I'd have turned him down; this place is <i>nice</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pod slammed into the bay, Soyaka had another thought. <br>\r\n\"I REALLY have to stop talking to myself.....\"<br>\r\n=======================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>10 Minutes Later, After Impact</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meteor's impact was...underwhelming. It made the ground shake and caused a titanic fountain of water to erupt into the air, but beyond that, nothing. No damage was done beyond a few abandoned boats being smashed and a slew of windows broken on buildings close by the bay. The people of Tokyo breathed a sigh of relief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the meteor <i>opened.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the supposed meteor emerged what could only be called a gigantic young woman, easily 300 feet tall.  Clad in a bright blue bikini (small enough to earn many a male's gaze but large enough to still be in good taste), sporting a head of black hair tied into a rough ponytail with a green band, and possessing a slim, toned figure that was still pleasantly big in the \"right places\", she would have looked like any ordinary girl her age, had she not been so <i>impossibly huge</i>. And then there was that grin she was wearing. It was somewhere between \"Kid pulling a prank\" and \"A cat in front of a mouse.\" From news helicopters, cell phones and cameras, Tokyo and the world got a very good look at this unexpected visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka held her smirk as she looked out on the sprawling city. Oh yes, this was going to be <i>fun.</i> All that remained was how to announce herself. She enjoyed making a speech before her rampages whenever she could, and this was just too good a chance to pass up! Even better, these humans seemed to have a liking for giant creatures destroying cities, especially this Tokyo place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could act like some cartoon villain, right down to the evil laugh? <br>\r\nOr, maybe keep it professional; just say why she's here and apologize before she got to work? This was nothing personal after all, just business.<br>\r\nOr perhaps just skip the speech and get to the squashing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decisions, decisions....\" Soyaka muttered, tapping her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soyaka crunched through the streets, each step killing dozens. A giant hand lashed out and dragged across the side of a skyscraper. Glass and bodies rained from the shattered structure, bouncing off the giantess's thigh and hitting the ground far below. Soyaka bent over and grabbed a bus that lay in her path. It was brought before her black hole of a mouth and dropped in. Her gleaming white molars made short work of the metal vehicle and its occupants, and she sighed contentedly as the salty-sweet lump travelled to her stomach. This was a fairly standard Soyaka introduction as she entered a new city. She had landed months ago and ravaged everything in her path. The Midwest was a dead wasteland. Nothing human lived, and very few things as large as a cow had survived Soyaka's visit. Cities were flattened and small towns simply ceased to exist. Now, the alien moved East. She followed several rail lines in a predictable, orderly, brutal, and scarily fast manner. Anything man-made along the side of the tracks was obliterated. Even the largest towns, boasting almost a million people, were consumed and eradicated in hours. Before any type of evacuation could be mounted, the monster was already at Grand Central Station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka admired the structure. The humans had interesting architectural styles. Months doing nothing but crushing it had made her somewhat of an expert. The huge building before her was beautiful in its own, simple way. The technology on her home world had been so much more advanced though. Buildings commonly existed in several realities at once, allowing billions to be housed in a square mile. At least, before she grew to her current size and ate them all. Soyaka had needed years roaming space to work all her fellow species off. But she found glass a charming sensation. The way it cracked at the slightest pressure. The charming tinkle as it cascaded downward. The soft tickling against her thick skin. And the shrieks and screams as her arm descended on the wounded and terrified below. Her massive fingers crushed people, benches, and newsstands before cracking the marble floors. They began to close, causing warm popping sensations as they ran over people not being dragged together. Finally, the nightmarish claw machine pulled its victims up to a charmingly cute face Hell-bent on the extinction of their kind. Her warm breath washed over the people and debris clustered in her hand. The force of it sent everyone backwards, blowing much of the inanimate objects and a few of the people off the edge of her palm. The fall ended mercifully quickly, a much kinder end than what Soyaka would give her victims. They were raised over two full, red lips as they spread apart. Wreckage of bodies and vehicles were visible between monolithic white teeth. A glistening red tongue slithered from the moist cave, ready to accept them. All the refugees held on as long as they could, but inevitably they took the tumble onto the soft and damp muscle. It quickly withdrew inside, and the people trapped on it were washed down into a nightmarish hell scape of a slowly digesting city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka burped loudly as the newest voyagers reached her stomach. Covering her mouth self-consciously and blushing slightly, she looked at the rest of the city. Below her people scattered in every direction. The trainstation had erupted like a kicked anthive, and now people flooded the street so thickly that they were being crushed against her feet just by the two massive things being there. The police tried futilely to stop her. Soyaka felt their tiny guns' useless shots hit her thighs and stomach like gnats gently tickling her. She wondered at the courage and stupidity of this planet's occupants. They would never be able to stop her, and yet they still kept trying. A staccato burst of gunfire and an increase in the rate of hits alerted her to the arrival of the SWAT. The giantess found their van, it's occupants still in the process of deploying. With particular savagery, she slammed a foot down on it. The reinforced armor gave way with barely a protest, armored troopers barely even registering. Only the sheer number of people crushed under her step alerted Soyaka to the presence of her attackers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soyaka smiled at the carnage and chaos beneath her feet. She strutted down the street humming happily as more lives were snuffed out by her steps. Finally, she reached a suitably large intersection from which to watch the tiny people panic. Gently, she leaned backwards against a skyscraper behind her. As her butt gently pushed against it the windows broke and her massive ass invaded the cramped office building. She felt workers being sandwiched between their cubicle walls as her body crushed them together. She giggled at the feeling and the madness beneath her feet. No matter how they tried, the humans couldn't seem to get away from her. They scurried endlessly over cars and busses, abandoned in the hope that running would be faster. They tripped and fell into the craters her feet left behind. She laughed out loud at the sight of one man trying to get out of a really deep puddle of gore, only to slip and fall back in. The police and paramilitary forces trying to reach her had to fight the flow of traffic, making things even worse. And from the streets leading to this intersection more people kept coming. Soyaka wondered how this species had survived even before she'd arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now they seemed to gain a sense of direction and order under the instructions of the police. Time to get to work. She pushed off her building, making it creak under the pressure. With a \"HIYA\", she swung in a circle and kicked the structure in half. It crumbled, slowly falling onto one of the avenues leading in. She caught a chunk of falling concrete feeling its weight. Taking careful aim, she hurled it at the nearest officer holding a loudspeaker. It landed short, rolling over several cars and people before crushing his car. The officer leapt out of the way just in time though, meaning Soyaka had to finish him personally. With a smile she took two steps closer, standing above him. Her body blocked the sun, and her feet right in front of him created an instant slaughterhouse. He dropped the bullhorn, gazing up at the goddess defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do, eat me?\" He yelled. Soyaka could barely hear him, but she got the gist. She beamed down her cutest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, that wouldn't be much fun! I'm going to do this!\" the giantess said. She fell backwards, landing on her rear amid a large crowd of refugees. They tickled slightly as they popped, forcing a sigh from her. Then she leaned over, crushing the area in front of her with her breasts. The policeman tried to get away, but two mountainous mounds of flesh weren't dodged as easily as a boulder. Soyaka dragged them back and forth over the ground. Cars, people, and everything vanished beneath them. Soyaka groaned at the stimulation to her mammaries. Her bikini was stained red with the remains of hundreds. In fact, most of her was a beautiful shade of crimson. An evil thought came to her devious mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just filthy! I should probably go take a bath. Who wants to come with?\" she asked excitedly, getting back up. She walked around, grabbing people off the ground while saying \"You do,\" and stomping them into mush in equal measure. Soon the square was empty, either dead or clutched in the alien's hands. \"Now wait here while I go to the ocean. It'll only be for a minute!\" She said. Then she pulled open her bikini bottom and poured all her victims down the back. She felt them forced against her cool skin by the tight garment. There were so many that it was inevitable that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Squelch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first step stretched the overloaded underwear tightly against her backside. The tightly packed people were crushed flat against her cheeks or the fabric. Even more unlucky ones were forced down her crack, never to be seen again. Soyaka gave an evil laugh, loving the feeling of the squishy mass fighting for survival against her rear. Then she set off towards the harbor. She knew a rather large evacuation was taking place there, and they'd welcome her rescue of those trapped in her swimsuit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soyaka decided to do the right thing and save those trapped next to her butt. She charged forward through the crowds beneath her and buildings in her way, leaving a trail of destruction behind her. She shrugged off skyscrapers, a few scattered bullets, and low-flying helicopters like they were nothing. And there before her was the dockside. Ships of all shapes and sizes filled the water waiting to save people from the alien invader. Soyaka realized that her passengers had not survived the journey sadly enough. Her heart heavy with misery, she stomped over and on the parked emergency buses filled with refugees and into the water. She jumped in with a tremendous splash and doused everything nearby in seawater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brrr!\" Soyaka said, rubbing her arms as the freezing water lapped against her thighs. She stepped forward sending miniature tsunamis in all directions. A few small motorboats were smashed against her legs like twigs as she walked between the bigger boats. A small coastguard dinghy started spraying her with a .50 caliber machine gun. She giggled as the bullets were harmlessly absorbed by her skin. She stepped forward and the vessel was smashed against her flesh. Soyaka examined the floating lunchboxes and tried to decide which one to eradicate first. But then a sound like a freight train raced past her ear. She looked up to see another Coastguard ship, this one the size of a small destroyer advancing towards her. Another shot by one of the main guns hit her like a punch to the stomach. She clutched her midsection and toppled over. She felt metal twisting and crumpling against her side. Tiny screams sounded much closer to her ear now. She opened her eyes and saw she'd fallen on one of the cruise ships, destroying its upper decks. Soyaka lifted herself up just in time to see the ship fire again. She quickly jerked sideways, cutting the damaged cruise liner in half. It began to sink to the bottom as she walked over the rear half. The destroyer desperately tried to back away as the angry giantess advanced on it. But she reached out towards her prey and lifted the boat that neared her size out of the water. She held up her knee and smashed in over her leg. She hurled the aft end at another ship and was rewarded with a satisfying explosion. The front half she looked over. A few sailors clung to the railing or weapons. She plucked them off and ate them whole. They joined hundreds of others in kicking futilely at her stomach walls. The hulk of the ship fell into her cleavage. She savagely pressed at the sides of her breasts, rolling and smashing at the sides of the hull. After much denting and bending, the damaged hulk gave in and compressed into a thin sheet of metal. She let the wreckage slide from between her breasts and splash into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ocean people are way too mean for me. I don't want to spend so much time having to deal with those,\" Soyaka panted as the destroyer sunk below the surface. Raising her hand, she fired a bolt of green electricity at several small yachts. They burst into floating funeral pyres for their occupants. Soyaka's churning legs dealt with the few who'd managed to jump overboard. She noticed one of the bigger ocean liners trying to slip away unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop running!\" she said with annoyance. She raised her left palm and fired a stream of greenish liquid at it. The liquid splashed over the entire boat, which began to steam. The screams took on a desperate tone as the acid ate through the ship and doused the people within. Soyaka giggled evilly as the ship rapidly dissolved into a steaming greenish slick on top of the water. The giantess turned back to the inner harbor to see a sight of surprising bravery. One of the ships was moving as fast as it could towards her legs! She quickly lifted a foot and stomped on the front of it, forcing its momentum to drive it deeper. She bathed the portion above water in flames which continued to burn angrily until the entire vessel sunk to the bottom. The harbor effectively blocked, she returned to the few boats left. She sliced a few into neat sections with lasers, leaving two. She dragged one next to the other. The one nearest to land she lay down on, crushing everything above water and forcing its keel to scrape the sandy bottom. Using some of her telekinetic abilities to help her, she lifted the other up over her body. She cut the ship open like slices of cake and held it over her mouth, feeling thousands of tiny people slide from the boat and into her gaping maw. Incapable of scaling her pearly whites, they were slowly forced down her throat by their own weight. When her mouth was full to brimming Soyaka cast the ship aside and closed her mouth. She chewed the mob a little, creating a group small enough to swallow. They were slowly dragged into her belly and landed like a boulder amid other survivors. Soyaka drifted off as her body started the monumental task of digesting thousands.</span></div></div>",

The clean-up crews would get rid of it, but there was no reason to just leave garbage lying around where everybody could see it). Her dragon-form's tail swished from side to side with every step, stirring up a strong breeze that made the trees shake and wave like a green ocean. She chuckled at the sight.

Her preference for wearing a bikini most of the time had rose a few eyebrows with tourists whenever children were present. Not that Soyaka minded much. \"Thanks, Luke!\" she quipped. Addressing the crowd as a whole she announced, \"Now for all of you--I've got something really cool to tell ya: the guys who keep my island running have just finished upgrading the Virtual City, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that where you go when you wanna smash stuff without hurtin' anybody?\" A red-haired girl interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka chuckled, ignoring the interruption. \"Right-o, missy. Anyway, they changed it up so other people can be in the simulation with me...no more chasing around fake digital people. And even better....\" she paused for dramatic effect, \"...they added a few <i>special</i> games for the tinies with me. If you want to, and your parents are okay with it,\" she looked up at the adults and smiled; \"you all can hop in for a spell and play! Maybe you could all be superheroes fighting the evil monster Soyaka-zilla!\" She finished with  big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids went into a happy frenzy, all clamoring at once for their parents to let them play with \"Miss Soyaka\". <br>\r\nNeedless to say, they conceded quite quickly.<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 1: When one has a crowd of giddy children pleading to do something fun, and a 300-foot alien standing nearby, parental strictness tends to go out the window.\">1</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>===30 Mintues Later, on another part of the Island===</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka stood in the huge, empty room with her hands on her hips. She'd traded her bikini for a black body-suit (that was so tight that she felt a little embarrassed wearing it around the children) that let her interract with the Virtual City. The kids were similarly garbbed, all standing together in a bunch just before her and looking giddy. Luke had even gotten a special wheelchair that would change shape once the VR kicked in (he'd chosen a small UFO as his vehicle). After some assurances that this was all indeed safe, the adults had all gone off to the villa for lunch and some relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kids, we're about to start up the Virtual City!\" Soyaka announced. \"Now remember, you can't get hurt here, no matter what happens--but you <i>can</i> get a 'Game Over' and drop out of the sim. If that happens, you'll have to wait a bit before you jump back in. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now, everyone get ready....\" Soyaka announced, as a deep rumbled kicked in from what seemed like all the walls. \"Because here...we...GO!\" There was a flash of light, and Soyaka and the children found themselves in a cityscape, towering skyscrapers and busy streets everywhere.<br>\r\nAnd of course, Soyaka herself--rendered in the VR clad in her trademark blue bikini--towering above much of the city, with only a few skyscrapers coming close to her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cracked an ear to ear grin, and rose her hands into the air. \"Let the games begin, kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>But what <i>was</i> the game Soyaka and her playmates had chosen for their romp in the Virtual City?</b><p align=\"left\"><u>Footnotes</u><br><a name=\"footnote1\"></a><a href=\"#freturn1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 1\">1</a>\u00a0 When one has a crowd of giddy children pleading to do something fun, and a 300-foot alien standing nearby, parental strictness tends to go out the window.</p></span></div></div>",

She was a revolutionary model for her age, and one heck of a star. She started in several big series, including her own giant monster series known as Maydora. She was in the film a giant bikini-clad girl with atomic breath, roars, and near invulerability and she terrorizes the world. Well somehow her parents paid her and the government to test a monster formula. She agreed to it and she tested it, and then she grew in height and gain the same powers she had in her movies. Now she is really Maydora. Also, her breasts for some reason grew to C-D size. She was then a really big hit in the world. The people loved her new size and powers, and she loved it as well. Heck, she even began to roar like a giant monster alot more. She is a nice person at heart, but in the film she is downright monstrous. Thankfully the government adjusted to her for a bit and her fans loved her, etc... but then they decide to send her to the island that Soyaka lives in. She is a fan of Soyaka, and it was her inspiriation for the Maydora movies. I can see her being good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSide note: She roars and moves like a giant monster alot. Heck when she walks around, she does it like a giant monster, and with tons of monster-like roars.</span></div></div>",

Everything a major urban area had to offer was contained on Atlantis. Sam had come for the week after finals, to relax and unwind after a particularly brutal set of tests. And spending days on the beach interspersed with good food had certainly done this for him. Today, he had journeyed to downtown.

When the steaming creation was delivered next to a mountain of golden, oversalted fries he was inclined to believe them. The burger was heavy in his hands as he raised it to his mouth. He closed his mouth over the delicious bun and the succulent meat, the flavor erasing all other senses as his taste buds absorbed the best sandwich in creation. When the first bite slid serenely down his throat, a harsh shrieking sound filled his ears. The population of the restaurant surged to the windows, chattering and pointing excitedly. Sam was torn between the window and the burger. He quickly took another bite, savoring its every flavor and texture. Then he went to the windows to satisfy his curiosity. The crowds were already too dense to allow a good view of anything, but he saw a vague shape hurtling from the sky. It seemed little more than a spot of orange light streaking across the sky, right for Atlantis. Sam was not unduly concerned. The burger would grant him immortality. Speaking of which, he hadn't had a bite in a moment. He hurried back to the table to grab another chunk before returning to the impending doom. He wiped the excess grease off with a napkin and tried to return to the window. But the object was much bigger now and coming closer, pushing a wall of sound before it. While Sam was still steps away from the table it struck the street several hundred feet from the restaurant. The entire city shook, and the object kept hurtling up the street. As it passed the restaurant the entire front half was torn off, obliterated by whatever had landed. Sam was fine, just thrown to the floor instead of annhiliated by space debris. Calmly dusting the remnants of the building off of himself, Sam picked up his burger and walked onto the street. Taking a bite, he peered around a shattered wall. The next three shops had been similarly destroyed. Sam took another bite, calming his inner terror at his near death experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stepped onto the street. The pavement was gouged by the landing. In some places, water seeped up through huge cracks in the surface. Looking up the street, he saw the landed thing. It appeared to be a pair of huge feet. Sam's heart jumped. Another bite of burger calmed everything. He casually walked towards the space feet. They radiated heat from entry into the atmosphere, steam rising off them in waves. As Sam stepped between them he saw they were connected to two huge legs. Which were in turn connected to a huge waist, covered in an electric blue bikini bottom. Which was most likely connected to the rest of a huge body. Sam stepped to the outside of the feet and walked on. When he came to the swimsuit bottom he could see the rest of the body. A rather cute girl, unclothed except for a blue bra matching her bikini bottom. Her face was framed by black hair, a contented smile on it. She appeared to be sleeping. Sam chewed on another bite of Zeus' burger and walked on. He reached the stomach, which rumbled loudly as he passed. Another bite of burger. He stepped over an arm and past the chest, which lay atop a flattened bus. More burger. Finally he reached the face. Sam was unsure of what to do from here. He stared up at the enormous girl for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes flickered open. She looked up at the skyscrapers and the blue sky. She sat up. She looked at the path of destruction her landing had created and laughed, a cute little giggle. Because of her size it nearly ruptured the eardrums of everyone present. She spoke in an alien tongue, but Sam could understand her because of the mighty burger's powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After 10,000 years in space to see the greatest vacation planet in the galaxy, finally! I am feeling a tiny bit peckish, I heard the local fare is delicious!\" she licked her lips. \"Endangered species like humans are so much fun to play with. I hope you don't all break too soon. But now, something for my belly!\" With that, the girl snatched up a few nearby people and dangled them over her perfectly spaced teeth. Her tongue stuck out to accept the gifts and they disappeared forever. She popped to her feet, curves bouncing, and bounded off down the street. Sam tried to take another bite of burger, but it was gone. Panicked, he began to scream hysterically while running in circles.</span></div></div>",

The downtown area was little more than rubble thanks to her, and thousands of citizens would never again see anything. But the menace from beyond the stars was no more. Everywhere alien troopers lay dead and dying. The elite of the Emperor's army was vanquished in a day by this colossal beast of a woman. Even the most stalwart of soldiers, trained to exterminate an entire race without batting an eye, broke and ran, even SURRENDERED to the humans when they got the chance. The bravest had fought for a time before her feet had pounded them into submission. She knew the humans would begin to move in to reclaim the land soon. Mayhaps they would wonder about the high rate of civillian casualties. Her satisfied stomach argued it wouldn't matter, they would find nothing anyways. Soyaka normally didn't eat the people she defended but the aliens had tasted absolutely revolting. And well, when you're hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment she watched a mob of five or so humans brutally executing the wounded in a crashed transport. She was slightly sickened, and her thundering footsteps scattered them like roaches. She plucked one of the slower ones up, staring at him with unrestrained disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like it if I did that to your race? Or better yet, if I squeezed just a little tighter,\" She said, doing just that. He didn't pop like some of her victims, but it did him no good. She gathered whoever was still breathing from below her and laid them out in her hand. With utter disregard for any below her, she strutted through the ruins. It only took about ten minutes to find a human military outpost. At her approach they readied their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not like they could stop me,' she thought. But she would crush them another day. With unusual gentleness, she lowered the injured aliens and human to ground level. Seeing what she intended, two corpsmen ran forward and onto her fingers. Despite the atrocious things she did to essentially everyone, Soyaka was known to try and be nicer to medics. This meant she never intentionally killed them. But when there were thousands of tiny people swarming beneath her feet, it gets a little hard to tell. Nevertheless, they managed to pull the dozen or so people off. Then she stood up to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treat him last,\" Soyaka pointed to the human and then left. At the edge of the Atlantic ocean, she jumped in and headed for home</span></div></div>",

She appears 10 years old, but don't let her cute looks fool you... as she is a surprising bombshell. She has surprisingly a sharp butt and D-F cup breasts like Soyaka (perhaps just as big as hers), and wears an orange bra and panties. She looks alot like Chihiro from Spirited Away.

Soyaka brought Chihiro to the new planet, and Chihiro was assigned the city of Osaka, Japan. Chihiro stands about 230-240ft tall because of her age, (smaller than Soyaka since she is a preteen and Soyaka is a teen) and can easily tower buildings. She of course have her kaiju powers like Mecha, Zilla, etc... but she loves being a giant robot girl, as she can fly better than a dragon, shoot missles from her breasts, and so much more. She is also the most friendiest, nicest girl you will ever meet. I mean she is playful, fun, adorable, has a truly kind heart, and always put others ahead of herself. She is happy to do any deed for the people, including using her body to destroy buildings, and other stuff. Heck, she doesn't mind the fact that the people truly adore her for her sexy looks, and stuff. The bottom line is that she is truly happy to be helping and living with the humans.

Suddenly, a space pod came whooshing across the night sky, and banged into the ground with a mighty thud. This thud did not just go away, though. Instead, it caused a few tremors in the ground that woke everyone up. Coming to the crash site, they saw what looked to be a girl; not just that, but a preteen! Suffice to say, though, that this preteen was about the size of a tall skyscraper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long brown hair, flushed cheeks, an orange bikini and, once she opened her eyelids, purple eyes. At first, the people were quite afraid of this new, towering beast.  Understandable as this was, the girl stood up and said, \u201cHi! My name\u2019s Chihiro!\u201d<br>\r\n Shocked looks and gasps came from the public; they knew that the Gonina were friendly and such, but they had no idea that they could be this cute! Nor, they had no clue as to how helpful and friendly she is.  In a few weeks, she had already become the biggest star in Japan, even outranking Godzilla!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she spend her days?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zilla because of her destructive strength and monstrousness, but also the Dragon for the feeling of flight and looking awesome at the same time. She loves to roar like a giant monster alot, and heck, the fun she does comes from helping the construction workers destroy buildings. She entertains people as well with many shows using her built for her size movie studio. Like Chihiro she doesn't mind the people adore her for her looks, but she loves it when they love her for being a great giant monster as well.

She is revealed to be 10 years old, and somewhere around the heights of 200ft tall, give or take 15ft. \"Soya.\" Soyaka said with a nice and charming voice. The young girl wasn't frightened anymore, but still was a bit shocked of her opening. \"Do you mind me helping you with your sand kingdom?\" Soyaka asked. The girl replied \"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka then grabs a got amount of sand and the two girls then began to work on the castle together. Soya was doing all of the minor stuff, but Soyaka is doing the big stuff, as she grabs lots of sand to make her castle truly stand out. In about an hour, the castle was made, and it was about a half of Soyaka's actual height. \"Wow.... thanks Soyaka.\" Soya smiled at her. Soyaka then smiles back, and then she stands at her full height once again, and carefully moves around the castle so it doesn't get destroyed.

Her clothes looked very homemade and it resembles those of a flower girl. She had overalls with with a long skirt and a long sleeve shirt under it. Her skin has marks that are so colorful. She does have pale skin on parts of her body that the marks on her didn't cover. Her butterfly wings glittered many patterns as if its moving. The girl has long wavy light golden brown hair and her eyes has many colors of the rainbow in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle one, or possibly the leader, is a girl made of mist. She looked very human, just very transparent, grayish blue, and has a ghost like tail. She is not naked, but her mist body is just shaped like a human. Similar to Annie's situation. Her eyes looked cold and somewhat fearsome even with a calm and peaceful attitude. Her hair was long and wavy like the butterfly girl, but its the same color as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome fellow meta-human. I see that you found our base.\", said the mist girl, \"Please don't be afraid. We are all the same. Our family and friends has abandon us and every human fears us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah yeah, all that boring crap again.\", said the lizard girl, and now she looked at Annie, \"Basically, join us and we can show those humans to not mess with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volt, you know its rude to interrupt Lady Mist.\", said the Butterfly girl in a pleasant sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simmer down you two. Like Volt said. We welcome anyone like you.\", said Mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMist seemed to notice something, \"Oh silly me, I forgot to introduced ourselves. I am Mist. I know its a generic name, but I don't really care much of how elegant my name needs to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That name's Volt. You don't mess with me, I don't mess with you.\", said the Lizard girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I am Viola. It's nice to meet you.\", said the butterfly girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls don't really have normal names, but they're not terrible names.\", said Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its our trademark to have nicknames. Its to leave behind our old self and be reborn with our current state.\", said Mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us what you name and show us what you can do. We might be able to give you a name or you can make one yourself.\", said Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my name is Annie and I can do this.\", the blob said. Though I want to say that Annie can still talk even though she hasn't formed her head. Sometimes you can see her normal human face in her state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob then shapes itself into many objects like a sword, but in the end she struggles on turning human. Mist tells her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see to have powers similar to mines, but only more solid and you can alter your form. With some training with me, you can look more human again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a name for you. You can be called Anni-thing. Get it, the name has your name with the word anything because of your powers.\", said Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie formed her human head and smiled. She finally has a home, sadly not a good one to be honest. The girl doesn't know what she got herself into. The best way to explain it is that this group will attack people and probably going to be Soyaka's enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know that I'm too big to be inside.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor just went to the backyard and was overwhelmed by the size of Soyaka. The giant was nervous because this was the first time she met the mayor of her town. It might be very urgent if he is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Soyaka, I have something to tell you. I'm not sure that if you are aware, but the Kaiju attacks are not just happening in our town, but also beyond it. I can't blame you if you are not aware of it, but I have many things to tell you and a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all ears Mr. Mayor.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor told Soyaka that the biggest Kaiju attacks are happening in Aurum City and proceed to give her a list of at least four of them that are causing major damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis part will be a list: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject 1:<br>\r\nName: Volt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: She seem to be able to conduct electricity with her very scales and is able to control it at whim. Not only that, she seem to have a huge amount of physical strength and very sharp claws. One possible weakness is cold temperature. Volt is very destructive and will not hesitate on destroying everything in her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject 2<br>\r\nName: Viola<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Not only her wings can help her fly, but also releases some spores that could either knock out or poison people. It is random. She is not really good in physical combat so take advantage of this. She is able to release lasers, flaps her wings to create strong winds, and is really fast in the air. She will use her spores a lot. She is very reasonable and is really friendly so its might be a good idea to talk to her first if you want to avoid battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject 3: <br>\r\nName: Mist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: She does have the ability to clog weapons and suffocate people. She is really hard to damage since everything would just go through her. She is made up of some sort of acidic base which is impossible, but it just did. Do try to avoid her trying to suffocate her because you may be burned in the inside. She might even prevent you from using your hyper beam attacks or your fire breathe. Other than that, she is just made of air. Past records show that she attacks humans, but not other Kaijus. We predicted that Volt and Viola might be working with her and plan on recruiting an army of Kaijus effected from the Park incident. In fact, she doesn't seem to have any desire to kill them if they reuse her offer. She attack, but not harm them too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject 4<br>\r\nName: Unknown<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: She seems to be new, but all we know is that she is made up of some sort of acidic solid/liquid material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote* It might be Annie or now she's called Anni-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka glared at the list and looked serious. The mayor had a delivery truck come by to give her a wristwatch that would help her teleport to anywhere so that she can find and fight Kaijus more easier in other cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. Mayor for the warning.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me, thank the guys who did the research. You are becoming a bit famous as our town hero. It may be time for you to be the hero for the whole world.\", said the mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...</span></div></div>",

She used her new teleportation device to get ready for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have Volt who rammed through the streets and to a fast food restaurant screaming at the cashier, \"Give me lots a burgers and fries! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scream gave out a big shock wave of electricity. The man ran and tells the workers to do as she said. The kaiju then went to a nearby doughnut shop, ripped the roof and grabbed all the doughnuts in display. She ate all of it, but was not satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola simply glided around town releasing spores that made people cough. She went to a nearby craft shop and brought out her homemade bag and took everything. Viola ironically used the money she stole from the bank and gave it to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMist floated around, suffocating those near her and screamed, \"Humans! Fear us! No longer you will shun us and look away, but look up and tremble! Pay for your crimes of discrimination!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnni-thing proceeds to eat and harm people around her. She manage to learn how to shape herself to be more human, but not exactly since she still look really sloppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka then appeared as she shot a laser at Annie. Volt saw this as she ate her truck load of burgers and fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, its the rookie's problem now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka and Annie looked at each other getting ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soyaka, don't get in my way.\", Annie said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie, don't do this. You know its wrong.\", cried Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not Annie anymore, its Anni-thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnni-thing formed a big boulder like fist and punched Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do anything thing I want to do!\", cried Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka was heartbroken that her friend would do such a thing. She has no choice, but to use her fire breathe on her friend. She proceeds to do so and cried that her friend is slowly disseminating. The blob tries to go after Soyaka, but then Mist came in to put the flames out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well Anni-thing, though she is a kaiju after all so it would be difficult.\", said Mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob then fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transparent being got closer to Soyaka and said, \"So, why do you go against us? We are just avenging ourselves from all the discrimination of those humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because its wrong to do that.\", cried Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heroism has misguided you. We are the good guys, those people you try to protect are the bad ones. I know that you felt your parents and friends hating you and all of humanity looking down on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wrong! My mother still loves me, even though I'm stuck like this. With my curse, I will protect everyone from the likes of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity, I do wish to recruit you, but you have a choice. That does not mean that we will stop bring justice in our own hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moron!\", screamed Soyaka as she shoots out a really strong hyper beam, but it simply went through Mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power is both a blessing and curse. I can no longer feel pain and I can no longer feel anything. I'm just a gust of wind as you can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka proceeds to attack and then Viola got in the way shooting spores at her. Soyaka hesitated a bit, but Viola flaps her butterfly wings and it blew Soyaka away a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka trying to resist the wind and the spores feeling her lungs being damage. She then decides to turn into her Robot form. Her body transmute into metal and she can withstand Viola's attack. Robot Soyaka now looks like herself, but with silver skin and hair with a jumpsuit like clothing. She ran after the butterfly kaiju and slams her down and proceeds to punch her. Mist tries to help her companion, but she can seem to suffocate Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka then releases a big shock wave made out of plasma energy and it seriously weaken Mist and Viola. Mist is losing her form while Viola was unconscious. The shock wave disturbed Volt's meal and she got really angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now its my turn.\", screamed the lizard girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl jumped high in the sky and slammed on Soyaka. The electricity followed Soyaka and it really shocks her. The Kaiju girl turned back to normal and fought Volt in hand to hand combat. It was painful punch Volt, but she really packs a punch against the Lizard. Volt shot a ray of electricity at Soyaka and the giant girl dodged a bit, only getting hit in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka decides to use her Godzilla form. Soyaka proceeds to gain some scales and a tail. Her face remains the same. Soyaka never used this form a lot because of this angry feeling she has inside of her. She ran at Volt and throws a big punch. She grabs a broken building and slams it on the lizard girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka then shoots multiple laser beams at her and then shoots a big one. Volt was left there cursing at Soyaka. Then Anni-thing came in a flash and grabbed Volt away. She also saw Viola in Anni-thing and possible Mist. Anni-thing tries to flee, but Soyaka raged on her an attacks. The blob does accept which really angers Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl gave out a huge roar. She felt angry that she can't save her friend. She proceeds in destroying everything in her path and then spotted a little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka stopped and had a flashback. She remember that as a child, she was standing there with her father. On that day before he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka stopped and starts shrinking and losing he scales. She then laid down on the ground and the boy was shocked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right now we see the villains heading back to their lair to begin their discussion on how they could get Soyaka to join their side. They really shown a great demonstration of their powers on Soyaka, and they gave her a good beating as well, also they broke Soyaka spirit as well when Annie angrily fought her friend. Annie did felt some emotion having to do that, but she doesn't regret the innocent people that they killed or anything, or the buildings that were destroyed. Just as they got back, the other kaijus then proceed to talk to Anni-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done great today Anni-Thing. Breaking your friend's spirit is one of the things that needed to happen.\" Mist told her with a smile just as she flies around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is painful for me to do it, but it had to be done, the humans wouldn't tolerate us anyway. It almost makes me want to go back to them and try to get them to accept us as their new goddesses.\" Anni-thing then muttered the fact she ended Soyaka's friendship was painful, but the real fact is now having to fight a former friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good thought. You see, the humans will always discriminate us for being big and different, and I am sure that they are some who do respect us. They seem to respect Soyaka, and we all want the same thing, but in reality, and I am sure they are going to do it with Soyaka, they will backstab her and just use her or any other kaiju girls that somehow are brought to her side or anything unless we get to them first, for their own selfish gain!\" Mist thought out to tell everyone. Volt, Viola, and Anni-Thing were listening, and seem intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly my point. Not only we shall bring justice to them to get them to respect us, but if we were to rule over them, then that will be ensured, and if not... we bring them to extinction!\" Anni-thing smiled just as she forms some sort of a human face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be interesting having all the pretty boys and girls bowing down to us a goddess. And we can do anything that we want. I can see Volt destroying anything she wants to destroy.\" Viola smiled just as Volt grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true. Perhaps the goddess idea is not a bad idea Anni-thing. But here is the thing, you need to end one part of your friendship with Soyaka, and that is your tolerance for humanity. You must become a merciless killer like us, killing innoncent men, women, children, and newborns for crimes they have committed to us and this planet and themselves. True some of it is intense, but they are not innoncent, and they are responsible for what they done to us and the planet. They abandoned us, and if were foolish enough to believe that they can help us or tolerate us like they did with Soyaka, they will just turn back on us and stab us in the back for their own gain.\" Volt explained to Anni-Thing and she was now interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't want to be a merciless killer completely, and I don't want to truly end my friendship with Soyaka, but if what you are saying is true then I will become a merciless killer. Still, we should still convince Soyaka to join us, but if she doesn't then she will become our true enemy. We will then take out everything she has ever cared about.\" Anni-thing said out wth a roar, and then suddenly dark energy then courses within her from a lightning bolt and hits her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you have done it! You have awakened your darkness!!!!!!!\" Mist siad excited just as Anni-thing is now enveloped in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this dark energy?\" Anni-thing asked in wondering of what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMist then flies around and shows her the dark energy in her hand. \"This is known as the dark kaiju soul, you see, Soyaka is that of light, and I am sure they will be more darks and light. Light is having tolerance for humanity, caring, etc. Darkness is fueled by hatred, the need for revenge, and you have a great revenge. Let it be something that can never be erased! Anything negative in emotions work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So interesting, I am a dark kaiju girl.\" Anni thing replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. We are all dark kaijus. We all want payback on humanity, and we shall ensure it. By giving into your dark side, you have awaken much more of your abilities, now you must put them to good use and really show what we are made of.\" Viola then replies just as she flies around for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! This is good, but enough of that. What shall we do tomorrow?\" Anni-thing asked just as she tries forming into a young giantess girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall return to the city tomorrow and force the humans to give us over Soyaka. Perhaps we can tempt her into using darkness, and if they don't, then we destroy the city and all of its people. Of course the real thing comes from Soyaka being tempted to joining us, and if she doesn't then we must destroy her! We will destroy all that is good and force humanity to bow down to their goddesses!!!! Tonight we shall broadcast a message to the city to hand us over Soyaka tomorrow at Noon, so we must all be ready to go to the city tomorrow. Get some rest, and Anni-Thing, great job out there!\" Mist said just as she prepares the plan to happen tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, perhaps I can still be Soyaka's friend, she just has to see things our way, and if she doesn't, then we shall destroy her.\" Anni-thing said just as she walks around for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volt and Viola, train Anni-thing to become mercilless like us. We have a big day tomorrow.\" Mist aid just as she is thrilled that tomorrow might be the day that they will get a kaiju on their side. After all, they have a new plan now. To rule the planet as goddesses, and if not, destroy all of humanity and that is good. Mist will broadcast the message tonight, now it is a matter of Soyaka or humanity obeying their demands.</span></div></div>",

She did wake up seeing a bunch of people growing and having some mutations happening to their body. Luna looks at herself and saw that she was normal. However, she felt stronger. She saw a girl who grew into a giant squid like monster, and is able to stomp on Luna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl thought that she was going to die, but after the stomp, she lives. She felt some pain, but its as much as a small slap. The hospital was being destroyed and the nurses and doctors were panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna got out of her bed and somehow ran really fast. She manage to carry a bunch of people with just one arm. Is she some kind of super hero? She got everyone to safety, but now she has to deal with all the people who got mutated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them seem to ran away, but one in particular started rampaging. Luna was afraid because this Kaiju girl is bigger than her. The girl then decides to use her new gift to see if it works. She manage to really throw a punch at the Kaiju girl and it really worked. She tried jumping to hit its face and that worked too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl was defeated and a bunch of helicopters came. Luna ran away with her new super speed home. She finally made it and dashed straight to her room and looked at the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discovered that she hasn't change much accept some small details. Her once medium size brownish blond hair turned silver and has grown really long, but as long as her shoulders. and her eyes were of gold instead of brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents knocked the door and said that they notice about her powers because the news showed it. The girl opened the door and talked with her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna my love! You became a super hero! My own daughter is going to be like my childhood hero!\", her father said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dad, I don't want to be like those guys in the comics.\", said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know that some of these giant monsters lurking around the city and might attack. You have the power to stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, don't pressure our daughter.\", said Luna's mom and she turned to her, \"Its really up to you on how you use your powers. Just remember to be careful with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna thought about what her parents said and what just happened. She even wonders about what happens to Annie and Soyaka. She might consider to be a hero since its a bad idea to have the military involve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll be a hero, but I'm going to need some help.\", said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father immediately showed her a quick sketch of what her costume should be like and what her name should be. In the end, Luna looked like a knight of the moon with some clothes that looks like a knight's armor. She wore a white mask that covers her eyes. When she wore the costume, she is known as Lunar Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always fought at night since she needs to catch up in school and all. She has been fight while Soyaka is training.

That's when Volt says something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I am bored, let's go to the city and terrorize it again.\" Volt suggested just to get herself out of her boredom. She is a destroyer, and she wants to destroy stuff. Viola was bored to, but she really doesn't care at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Mist, we should go back out there.\" Viola said, agreeing with Volt's idea. However Mist wasn't really too happy with this idea, and proceeds to snap at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!! We must think morons. Don't you get it, Annie nearly killed us, plus Soyaka proves to be one too much. That is why we need to start thinking a way of defeating her, so we can get her to either join us or destroy her. It is cruical that we ensure our rule as goddesses, so we cannot go out there risking ourselves again.\" Mist shouted just as she suffocates Volt and Viola a bit before she stops. She then turns back to the mirror that was in there to look at herself. \"So far, nothing has work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is that so?\"</i> said an unknown voice that is extremely loud so that the kaiju girls can hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?!\" Volt said, starting to notice something is not right. The voice is loud, so it seems to be another kaiju girl. \"SHOW YOURSELF!!!\" Volt then roared just as she got into battle position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, show yourself!\" Viola demanded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, but you will be surely surprised. Don't you want to take a guess of who it is?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in no mood for games! Now I will ask you just like the others... SHOW YOURSELF!!!!!\" Mist demanded.

Now you will pay the price for it!!!!\" Volt said just as she raise her monster foot to stomp her, and just as she tries to do it, a barrier forms around the girl, who was holding some sort of magical staff and Volt was blasted back against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have every right coming here. My name is Haruka (note I am using only her name and appearance from Daigunder), and I am now the ruler of the kaiju girls, and you will bow down to me and do my every bidding.\" Haruka said with an assuring stance just as she uses her staff to get both Volt and Viola to bow down to them, shocking Mist. Mist was now angry, and tries to use her power to suffocate Haruka, but Haruka was unfased at all. \"Sorry foolish girl, but I am afraid that my powers that I have makes me invinicible to your air attacks. You will bow down before me or suffer the consquences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bow to no one! I am made out of air, so your magic cannot phase me, plus there is only one true leader of the kaiju girls, and that is me! MIST!!!!!\" Mist shouted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, perhaps this could change your mind.\" Haruka said just as she fires her staff again and this it hits Mist, and then rain pellets start to come out of Mist. She turns into a cloud and rain comes out of her. \"No... what have you done?!!!!!\" Mist screamed in pain just as she turns into rain and liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate my immense power!\" Haruka then said just as she fires her staff again and make some sort of a new cup that will contain her. \"I am now the leader of the kaiju girls, and anyone who stands in my way will suffer the consquences. Now I understand that you have a enemy you want to either convert or destroy, and I will surely help you with that, however there is a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?!!!\" Volt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must serve me as of now. I have big plans for this world, and we all want to rule it, but I also want to gain immortality, so I would rule this world as a goddess, but just lke Mist said. We need to plot things out. So Mist, I have a job for you. I want you to warn Soyaka, and any of her allies about me. I want her to know about me, and what I am capable of. Fail me and I will ensure that you never go back to your mist form again! Better yet I will just strip you of your power and kill you on the spot. After all, I got more worthy replacements coming here at this very moment.\" Haruka added just before she spills the liquid that the Mist is now into the sewers. Volt and Viola were all in fear of Haruka's immense power, but were impressed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come you two, we must begin preparing our plan. We are going to break Soyaka's spirit, and then we can either convert her to darkness, or destroy her and everything that she ever cares about.\" Hakura said just as she uses her magic to make the base of the kaiju girls much better.

Her father never accepted weakness and would always scold her if she cried or was too slow to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people think that since she's rich, she gets the good stuff. You thought wrong. Mist never had any of that. She had really plain dull food and a plain room compare to what her home looks like. She spend her time studying or be neglected by her father. Her father ironically also tortures himself the same way as he kept reading through notes and yell at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father would sometimes yell at her about how the current mayor is not worthy and complains about how everyone thinks he's crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day as she was watching her father make a speech in the park. A strange gas appear. Everybody ran away, but Madeline tripped and the gas got her. She looked at herself seeing that she is slowly turning into air and becoming transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt lighter, but at the same time felt as if air pumped into her. She got to her father who was frighten of him. Madeline saw herself expanding and part of her gassy form got into her father's mouth, killing him. The girl was frighted and drifted off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept growing and became more transparent. She spotted a group of people trying to leave, but the walls are in the way. Madeline things that this might be a chance to be a hero. She went up to the wall and tries to use her gas body to break down the wall. Instead of gratitude, they ran in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline notice that her appearance really does look scary. She looks like a blob melting into gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the event, she kept going and going with no direction. Everywhere she went, people feared her. The police and military attacked her, but everything they do always go through her. At this point, Mist is just a giant piece of air that is a silhouette of her old self. At least she still got her face. She floated in hiding to the nearby woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tries to settle there, she spotted a giant girl with butterfly wings with a colorful aura. The girl was just sitting there looking like she is moping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\", asked Madeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kind of upset of what happened. At least I could somehow made this giant Viola. No need to worry about the size of my instrument.\", said the girl as she presents Madeline a violin like instrument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gassy girl looked at her with confusion, \"How come you don't look too upset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always get abandon by my family and friends. They think I'm weird. They started to really not like me after I became like this.\", said the butterfly girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know where you been through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how about we be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline/Mist was happy about the idea. She then spotted some campers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find another place to hide in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found a big hole suddenly. It looked like someone broke through it and the Kaiju girls went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran they converse a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Violet! How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Madeline. Its nice to have someone nice to me for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to look for a place to hide in, hoping that there is still room for them to move, until they heard a thumping sound. It came from further in a damaged pathway and the girls followed it. They then spotted an alligator like girl just sitting there. She woke up looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck are you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, we're monsters like you. Since you live here, could we live with you too?\", asked Madeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one good reason why.\" asked the lizard girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline/Mist started to remember what her father has taught her. After all that she being through from drifting to places seeing people hate her. Hearing the fact that her new friend was always abandon by people who are suppose to care for her. The girl decided this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have something in common. We turned into monsters that no one likes. You are probably neglected too I suppose.\", said Madeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. I got nothing to begin with. Though I do scare people a lot and I destroy things when I felt like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how would you like to join me to do so? Join me to finally get some respect. Humans are weak and they continue to show weakness when they see us. They need to be place where they belong, below us. We have the power and they don't. You can destroy them and anything as you like while I will help you and all that has suffer the same fate be the superior race!\", cried Madeline with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe misty girl did not care if her dad is proud of her in hell, but she did what she had to do. Violet was interested on what Madeline said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got spunk. I'll let you lead your master plan, but remember this. This is my house and I demand some authority.\", said the Lizard girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, we are all equal aren't we. We do live in a country that believes in freedom.\", said Madeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get ya. Also, the name's Volt.\", said the Lizard girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Madeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Violet and we just met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, you girls need nicknames. It would be stupid if we attack and scream 'Ah its Madeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall be called Mist.\", said Madeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Viola? Its represents my love for music and it reminds me of my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Welcome home.\", said Volt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the story of Mist and how she met Viola and Volt. Ever since that day, she has become strict. Volt gain some more respect for her and Viola does the same and manage to make new clothes. The occasionally attack cities to steal for some useful goods and spread their terror. </span></div></div>",

She is still lock up and has to ask for food, but right now she is eating some sort of a substance for her body which is good for her. \"Hey, at least the food here isn't bad at all.\" Annie said to herself, still disliking the fact that she has to ask to be fed and is still fed like a baby. If only she could get out of there, at least she won't have to resort to asking for food as she can work for some or find some. Still, even though Soyaka made it up with her, she still has distrust for humans, and even her former family as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I surely wish I can get out of here one day. Perhaps just run away and start a new life. Perhaps try to make amends for my actions.\" Annie thought out just as she finishes the last bit of her meal. Then suddenly some sort of explosion happened inside the room and the doctors were knocked out. Annie wonders who could it be, and then she saw some girl with a staff, that looks like Haruka from Daigunder, only eviler and has a suit, and her name is similar to. \"Well well well, isn't the the kaiju who managed to awaken her darkness, and then somehow thanks to Soyaka seal it away!!!! Annie, or... Anni-Thing, how are you doing?\" Haruka asked evilly. \"I am Haruka in case you might ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Haruka, you aren't allowed here, so scram before I...\" Annie saids but remembers that she is frozen and cannot move at all. \"Oh wait I am stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and Soyaka made that happen.' Haruka smiled evilly just as she comes to the door. \"But I could help you get revenge on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am no longer her enemy. Whatever happened has happened and I am accepting the punishment.\" Annie replied just as she fights back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait... would you like to get out of this junk and perhaps join my side? If you do so, perhaps I can help you finish what you begun. After all, Mist opened you up to the truth, and she is one of my minions that I am using to ensure not only that I and we rule the world, but also ensure our immortality, don't you want it?\" Haruka offered just as she uses her staff to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am no longer evil with humans, although I cannot trust them, but I will not turn on Soyaka again, not after what I done to her!!!\" Annie shouted, and then Haruka smiled. \"Well light can be such a dangerous thing, and you seem to be a useful girl with a great amount of distrust. Perhaps you just need a little bit of a reminder of who you are dealing with here!!!!!! And deep down I know you want revenge on Soyaka, and I know you want to rule the humans after what they did to you... perhaps I just need to make that image fresh again. And thankfully I am the girl to do it!!!!\" Haruka said just as she begins using her staff and conjure up some dark magic and then inserted it into Annie. She then suddely melts and turns into a dark goo. \"With this, not only you are more powerful than ever, but now.... you can transform back into your original human form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you master Haruka.\" Annie said in her full human form emotionally, and then bows to her. \"As repayment for you giving me more power than ever and restoring my human side, I shall side with you master Haruka for your plans, for that is you that have shown me the true light!!!!!\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and thankfully our plan is going perfectly. Mist has warned Soyaka and Luna about me, and now we must go back, and begin to plan our next move!!!!\" Haruka said, just as she uses her magic to disappear with Annie, but also in her hand at the time was the bottle that contains Mist. \"BTW, Mist did her job perfectly.\" All hell is now about to break loose. What plan could Haruka be cooking up now<br>\r\n?</span></div></div>",

However, her eyes seem kind of zombie like and really pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind that.\", said Haruka and she got close to Viola, \"Its my hypnosis spell. Its my way of making her loyal and under my control in case she were to betray me. I made her want to serve me because I helped her. Its fun playing with people's minds. All is going according to plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this plan?\", asked Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, other than getting immortality, I want to get as many Kaiju girls as possible. I even came up with a plan on how to get Soyaka. First off, we need to get her mother and turn her into one of us.\", said Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. I should get going now, right?\", said Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, but take this.\", said Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka handed the butterfly girl and orb that reveals the location of Soyaka's home. With that, Viola left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka looks at her jar that contained Mist. The gassy girl looked her her captive and though that she had a chance to escape. What really happened was that after she warned Soyaka, she was suddenly transported in this jar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my lovely Mist, I had to do this. You had been a naughty girl.\", said Haruka, \"If only you served me, it would have been easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rule for your own selfish needs while I rule for the sake of others! You control your people like servants while I enlighten my people as equals and as friends!\", said Mist in the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity and I thought we have something in common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disgust me. I am really hoping that Soyaka defeats you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll just put you away until you learn how to be polite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka then made the jar containing Mist disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Viola headed to Soyaka's house and ripped the roof of the house. Soyaka's mom screamed as she is grabbed by the butterfly girl. Viola releases her spore to knock her out and flew back to base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Viola returned, Haruka got a magic circle with some machines ready. The girl places Soyaka's mom in it and prepares a spell. This transfers Soyaka's mom soul to a whole new body. A body that is meant to counter Soyaka in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka's mother woke up as a giant robot girl. She looked about the same age as Soyaka which is about 13 years old. She really does look like a twin Soyaka, but silver all over and is more sexy. She has no memory of herself other than to serve Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see, your making Soyaka fight not only her best friend again, but also her mother.\", said Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, now to discard this useless piece of junk.\", said Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl waved her safe and eliminated Soyaka's mom old human body, making sure that she will never be back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall name you, Anti-Soyaka!\", cried Haruka with glee. She is called that because her body can withstand fire and laser beams and knows how to counter Soyaka's every move. This robot is made to destroy Soyaka.</span></div></div>",

You see, we have all been weak for far too long, and we have suffered in the dirt and hide under the shadows, while humanity and all that is good embraces the light.

People were screaming, running, driving, etc just to get away from the kaiju girls' biggest attack. Not even the miliary is able to do anything about it at all, since their weapons are about as useful as their strength, which is weak at the moment. Both Lunar Knight and Soyaka come to face the kaiju girls to see a few shocking things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!!!

Soyaka then fell to the ground, noticing her mother now as a robot, but she looks like her. \"Mom?...\" Soyaka said in shock. \"Is that really you? Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help us ensure our spot as goddesses among this planet. Haruka has shown me the truth. I knew as a mother, I needed to do the best for you, so now decided that you and everyone else who is a kaiju girl, along with Haruka should rule the planet as goddesses. Don't you see, they will betray you. Just look around you Soyaka. Those military men are running like cowards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka cries just as she notices the military men running like cowards, retreating, etc. \"Well.... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true, just admit it!\" said by a small flying girl in the air. She was riding her staff. \"My name is Haruka, and I have came here to watch this battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the girl that Mist warned us about?!!!!!\" Lunar Knight gritted her teeth just as she prepares to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, but boy was she a naughty girl, I had to get her out of the way before she can cause me anymore problems, but since she was nice enough lately, I think I will bring her back now.\" Haruka smiled, and then she opens the jar, and releases Mist from her containment. \"Now Mist, you be nice, or I will trap you in the jar completely!\" Haruka smirked just as she uses her staff to control Mist. \"But that is enough from me, I got big plans to start after I am through with you. After all, it is 2 against an army, and thankfully my army is ready to destroy you completely, or convert you into our cause.

The humans were praising for her return and thought of her as a really cute goddess. The Kaiju girls and Haruka were laughing about how Soyaka looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all the comebacks you got, you have that. If I had a mother, she would never dress me like that.\", said Volt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka then releases a shock way that ends up defeated all the Kaiju girls that were in front of her. This is a bit Mary-Sue, but that what happens if you got some power from an entity. Soyaka bashes to a bunch of Kaiju girls, not killing them, but making them unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the kajiu girls that were brainwashed, but was free from it realize what's going one and helped Soyaka out. The humans go all out with their support, but with some casualties of both humans and Kaiju girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was trying to quickly work on her ritual for immortality. Preparing to sacrifice the Kaiju girls. Soyaka brawled through the city and faced Anni-thing and her mother. The giant girl charged and slammed the two to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnti-Soyaka and Anni-thing pushes Soyaka off and the giant girl shot a laser at the robot girl. The robot girl's body was meant to handle Soyaka's laser, but not Zenith Soyaka. Anti-Soyaka was blasted way while Anni-thing charges at Soyaka. The dark energy was consuming the giant girl, but her light energy has increase with her new powers. With that, Soyaka glowed with a heavy light and dealt heavy damage at both Anti-Soyaka and Anni-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two woke up no knowing what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my head hurts.\", said Soyaka's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soyaka, what happened? All I remember is that a little girl came to my cage and used her staff.\", said Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that little girl is causing more trouble as we speak.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I a giant robot?\", asked Soyaka's mom with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's talk about that later. We first need to defeat Haruka.\", said Soyaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to fight.\", said Soyaka's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just punch and smash mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then head to where Haruka is at, but with her is Volt and Viola.

Soyaka's mom figures out that she can fire weapons from her body and begins to fire at her, and she eventually knocks Volt out cold and then gives her a punch. \"No one hurts my daughter and gets away with it, nor the people that you harmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnni-Thing proceeded to absorb just about anything Viola throws at her. Viola tries to use her plants as a shield and what not against Anni-thing, but Anni-thing now has some new tricks up her sleeve. She ate and ate and got bigger, and soon Viola was cowarding to a towering Anni-Thing and then behind Viola herself was Soyaka in her Godzilla form. She swipes her tail at Viola and then Anni-thing traps her in her gooey body. \"Nice work Soyaka, just like always. Never liked her anyway. Just remember that I still don't have trust for humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am well aware of that. But still, at least you are doing some good.\" Soyaka smiled for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I am glad that I am able to fight alongside with you one time at least, we are friends still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know, your mother might really like the superhero business now, as this new form rocks!\"  Soyaka's mom smiled for her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they heard and evil laughter just as Haruka manages to complete her ritual. \"You fools, you think I am that easy to take down. It is already too late, while I will need to get all of the kaiju girls myself to fully complete the ritual, I am at least able to use my ultimate form against you all, as I will have much more power than any of y'all, and how better than to issue in the coming age of the kaiju girls and my rule then with a solar eclipse. The eclipse willl unleash the darkest of my powers, and will allow the ritual to proceed with my immortaly even faster, and that's not all... the other kaiju girls come back, but even strogner than ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!!!!!!!!!!!!\" the 3 heroes gasped just as the dark energy from Haruka's staff begins to cast a dark storm over the area, and then a dark lighting hits all of the kaiju girls, bringing them back, but making them even more stronger than ever. Then suddenly Haruka begins to transform as well. Her size just increased to that of Soyaka's, but now she is wearing a golden swimsuit with some sort of dark gold wings and even red eyes. Her breasts even got bigger. She lands right in the city and gives out a powerful roar that shatters the glasses and even knocks everyone off their ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, this is going to be hard.\" Soyaka's mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

The two then release a huge laser beam that then destroyed the whole city, but everyone not in the fight is safe because they are far away from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka and Harukazilla looked tired.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Thinking back on Korina was kinda bad for me as I kinda gotten myself into a rut with the stories, and seeing that my story wasn't all that a hit, I decided to get rid of Korina, so now in it's place is Soyaka: The Cute Kaiju Giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiju is the term for giant monsters, and for this case, a 200ft-300ft tall giantess with superpowers. However, she is incredibility cute, and this story is all about here that's for sure. She is actually an alien known as the Gonina, and she has came to Earth for one reason only, to conquer us with her incredible beautiful looks and abilites, however... you be hard pressed to find a scary monster unless you choose a different route, because she is all about looks, cuteness, etc... and everything else... that will come to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is Soyaka's looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://giantessbooru.com/post/view/137599?search=Giantess%20swimsuit%20destruction%20ocean\" target=\"_blank\">http://giantessbooru.com/post/view/137599?search=Giantess%20swimsuit%20destructi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyaka: She is a 13-14 year old alien that looks completely like a human, and even is a human if you have to explain that somehow. Her long plurish blue hair with a green bowtie on it, pale skin, sharp body, green eyes, and C-Cup (maybe D or F) breasts sure make her attractive and a joy to behold. She is around 200ft-300ft tall (you can decide the specifics) and she has the abilites of being able to breath fire, shoot hyper beams from her mouth or hands, shoot out lasers from her eyes, can do sealth, and lastly... she has a very unique power that seperates her from the crowd on my other stories. She wears a light blue two piece bikini suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can actually mutate into different forms and go back to human at her very own will. She has alot of forms, but I am going to go over 3 of them right now. She can also do mixed forms, where it gives her some of the monsters features, but other than that, she is mostly human in look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGodzilla Soyaka: The Godzilla form of Soyaka... she takes a very similar look to the Giant Lizard (head is not mutated at all and is pale) and her powers are increased, but she has less control and is more easily going to destroy. She gains a new tail, mutates, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMixed Dragon Soyaka: Soyaka gains a mixed form where dragon wings and a dragon tail appear on her, and she uses this for flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobot Soyaka: This is the third of her forms, in this one... Soyaka turns into a robot (technology) and she can let others use her, etc... you get the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow you use her... is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No Nudity, she will be clothed somehow regardless, and no heavy sexual stuff.<br>\r\n2. Vore is fine (if she is evil)<br>\r\n3. Chapters must be at least a paragraph or 2 long.<br>\r\n4. No Male Giants<br>\r\n5. They can be more than one Giantess in the story<br>\r\n6. No Scat or Tiolet Crap<br>\r\n7. No Gay or Lesiban stuff<br>\r\n8. Do have fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you got that down, here we go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso: Make sure to check out my friend Redhurricane's interactives Monster Arms and Monster Shores<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1927548-Monster-Shores</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1897471-Monster-Arms</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE:  UltraGTS created this and is allowing me to have it!
