Sephiroth the One Winged angel of Destruction...Could Strife the hero, the EX-SOLDIER... Tifa Lockheart my love... Sith, the Master... and me A regular Joe who was fortunate  to have some great friends. You may be wondering why on earth I would be here with some Final Fantasy VII characters and Sith the one who cant ever find a break away from Giantess. Well it all began on that faithful day, back in the world we all know....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Andrew Figueroa, an average guy who just wants to have a nice life. It was a regular day for the 18 year old teenager. I just came back from a long day of school. Sat on my trusty chair in front of my Computer and logged into writing.com. I began adding to one of Sith's many weird adventures. My writing isn\u2019t to great at least I didn't think it was too good. Sith saw the many additions I made to his Giantess Weirdness Story and decided to send me a message. I opened it and read what it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Redius, (note that\u2019s my screen-name here if you didn't guess)I noticed the many additions you have made into my stories and just wanted to thank you. I can see you have talent and maybe we can become friends and write up some great stories. The potential is there and it is unlimited. Just...Just send me a message if you are interested. Also tell me which your favorite GTS character is. See you later hope to talk to you again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemed like a harmless gesture of friendship. Little did I know it was the beginning of something bigger then i can possibly imagine. I replied of course cause of my nature to reply to anyone who bothers to talk to me. I told him about my self and that My favorite GTS character from his stories was TIfa Lockheart, cause for some reason she is just perfect... As soon as I pressed enter I received a reply almost instantly as if i was in a chat room. I opened it and read the very short message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to meet her in person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was like WHAT!? is this guy smoking something or what I mean i read his stories which were great and all almost seemed like he actually been in a girl or two. But that cant be true. Then I think to myself \"Maybe its just a friendly question from one writer to another.\" So I began typing a short response to it. \"Yes.\" Like I said a short reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI received another message from him this time even a bit weirder then before. I began to read it <br>\r\n\"Your wish is my....\" <br>\r\n\"Command.\"<br>\r\nBefore I can finish reading the sentence I heard a guy behind me. I instantly turned around in time to see a man in a Cloak covering his body. All i could see from his face was a scar. The Man raises his hand to me. It begins to glow like what Kadaj's hand did in Advent Children. Before i can even react my body was covered in some sort of light. As soon as it came it disappeared. All i can remember was freefalling to a soft ground. Almost like a human skin. Last thing I heard before i was unconscious was a lovely voice. \"What was that?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dark... It was all I remember when I was unconscious after that unexpected freefall. I began to regain conscious but \"Instead of big dark blur I began seeing a big bright blur.\" (Similar quote form Return of a Jedi) Then I heard a voice. At first I couldn\u2019t tell what it was saying all I knew it belonged to a woman, a beautiful one from such an angel like voice. Finally I began to hear clearly then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, your awake you gave me quite the scare when you landed on me...\"<br>\r\nMy eyesight still hasn\u2019t fully returned. but from what you can see your on a vast white field and its late in the afternoon due to ten light coming from the window.<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then hear the person began giggling slightly \"Its ok I was just worried about you. You were out for about four hours now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours? What kind of fall did I have? I began to stand up and rub my eyes together in hopes of returning my eyesight. Luckily it worked. My eyesight returned but i didn't expect what I saw next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I would find something weird when I awoke like maybe in some strange room or something but not...not a gigantic Tifa Lockheart's face towering over me. With the little scream I fell back on my sore bottom. I didn\u2019t scream cause of the fact she was big...(ok so maybe it was a part of it.) But it was the fact that it was Tifa, a video game character who I kind of always liked to be in front of me at this very moment. TIfa a little sadden of my reaction just said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid I wont hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my mouth still gaping open I realized what I was doing and quickly punch myself in the face. (OUCH!)At that moment I regain my composer (sort of I was still holding my face in pain)Tifa couldn\u2019t help but look upon you with a confused stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you just punch yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakes me awhile to answer her question cause i was in pain, still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit myself to stop acting like an idiot... was a good idea at the time but now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly went back to rubbing my face hoping to relieve the pain. 'IDIOT!' was all i was thinking about in my head. 'Cant believe I just did that in front of Tifa. She probably thinks I am a weirdo or something.' Didn\u2019t hit me then (not literally that she was pretty big compared to myself. All I heard was her again laughing lightly as if she saw my action funny... Tifa stopped quickly and apologized for her up brut behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay I shouldn\u2019t have been... well surprised and a bit to see you Tifa...\"<br>\r\n'OH CRUD! Now she\u2019s going to get suspicious on why I know her name! IDIOT!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know my name?\" She begins to stare down upon me with a angry look. \"Who are you and how did you enter my room and...\" She pauses for a moment. \"and why are you so small?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in a lost how could I tell her that she isn\u2019t suppose to exist that she is a video game character and 'GOOD JOB IDIOT! What are you suppose to tell her, even you don\u2019t know how you got here, in Tifa's room and SMALL?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-T-Tifa, I don't know entirely for sure. L-L-Last thing I remembered was being in my room the next thing I know I was covered in light and awoke in your room. I-I don't even know how exactly I got here or even how I can ever go back...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason I began to cry. I can't exactly remember why I did... I was probably scared stiff of what Tifa may do to me due to my current size or... or the realization of the fact that you may not even be able to return home... Tifa notices me crying... sobering on my knees (because i was sitting down and my face buried in my knees). Tifa with her kind heart couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for me. She uses her right pointer finger to gently pat me on the head to try and reassure you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry if I scared you... I didn\u2019t mean too. If you don't want to you can tell me what you know later.\"<br>\r\nI began to stop crying, tears still dropping down the side of my checks but not 'crying' anymore. Tifa probably saw this cause her mood started to change. From your point of View you can see Tifa is smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am glad that you are starting to loosen up a bit. Hey I know your probably a little hungry aren\u2019t you?\"<br>\r\nI then remembered that I didn\u2019t eat anything when I got back to school... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am a little hungry. What about you?\" As if to answer her question you can hear a load roar from the bowels of Tifa stomach.<br>\r\nYou answer your own question. \"I\u2019ll take that as a big yes.\" <br>\r\nTifa blushes a bit feeling embarrassed that her stomach just did that. Both of you began to laugh at this. Looks like I will be able to live to tell about my stories with Tifa...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tifa places her hand on the counter I was on, an invitation to be carried. I 'jumped' right into her hand. She moves her hand closer to her lovely, beautiful face. At first I expected a rough ride to her face. But to my surprise it was a gentle ride. I began to think to myself 'Has she done this before? Nah! She\u2019s probably just very gentle.' Tifa just smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you never did tell me your name.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry... My name is Andrew, Andrew Figueroa.\"<br>\r\n*giggles* \"You know I don\u2019t think I ever meet someone with the name Andrew before.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\nI couldn't help but blush at this. Tifa probably noticed this and just smiles. Tifa then began to walk downstairs. I noticed that it was Tifa old home in Nibelheim. I also and sadly noticed that I wasn\u2019t even taller then Tifa's pointer finger. Heck I was even a thrid its size. She then sets me on the kitchen table. She places her face near me and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just what to make in these kind of situations.\"<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. While she was making some food I was busy well wondering how I got here. Suddenly, a loud sound interrupts me. Instinctively I jumped. I looked behind me to see what it was. It was just a plate of sandwiches... BIG sandwiches to me they were the size of a 18-wheeler cargo-box. Tifa just laughs lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Tifa says with a smile on her face. \"I know you won't be able to finish it so when your done I'll more then happily eat the leftovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh at this. For some strange reason I did not even mind the fact that the sandwich could squash me to the point that i cant breath, it was just well illumining to be around Tifa, A giantess beauty who\u2019s kindness probably surpasses her looks. I climed on to the nearest sandwich and took a bite out of it, well tired to really but i still manage to get some in my mouth. Tifa grabbed a chair and sat down to eat her own sandwiches. For some strange reason I wasn\u2019t alarmed by the fact she was eating very near me. One false move I could have been sent to the inwards of Tifa. That never did managed to enter my mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating my huge piece, I mean very little piece I began thinking on how exactly I got here. I began to recall the time when I returned from school. Back was sore from caring to many things in my back-pack, 'There was nothing different that day. I just logged into writing.com to update some of Sith's stories, then...' At the very mention of the name Sith in my head I instantly remember being engulfed in light by a cloaked figure in my room. 'That guy must have sent me here... but who was he and why... I sense a Disturbance in the force... Wait, why the hell did I just said that.' At that very moment I noticed that i was standing on a sandwich and this sandwich piece just happens to be floating upwards... 'I have a bad feeling about this.' I must have walked on to it when I was busy thinking... 'Crap Tifa must think I am still on that other sandwich...' I turned around in time to see Tifa's sparkling white teeth coming down upon me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Crap no time to shout, I can jump into her mouth and avoid being bitten or jump backwards and hope she doesn\u2019t bite twice... Crap not enough time... Dodge the Teeth and pass the gums to Tifa mouth here I come.' It was the last thing I was thinking about as I jumped for dear life into the surprisingly clean mouth. As I looked around I couldn\u2019t help but be amazed at the sight, the pink squishy tongue underneath my feet and the smell of Tifa's inwards. (or was it the sandwich she was eating... cant remember). I then noticed i was at the back of her mouth in front of me the darkness of her throat. 'Ah shit.' She then swallows with me and the pieces of food into the abyss below. \"Well look at the bright side Andrew, I am freefalling into Tifa's stomach where I am about to become one with her... AH FUCK! Who the hell do I think I'm kidding I don\u2019t want to DIE!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to descend her esophagus until I hit the bottom of her stomach with a splash. I get into the fettle position and just await the end to my sorry ass life. My eyes closed as I await the painful burning sensation throughout my body. But all I felt was a little stinging feeling on my face... 'What the Fuck! Why I aren\u2019t I dieing, I know I am in Stomach acid...' I then surface the liquid to catch a breath of air. Surprisingly there was enough air in her lovely stomach to support me. I dried my face with my hands... 'Weird what happen to the bumps of my face that I usually feel cause of my acne?' I cant rubbing my hands into my face trying to feel the little amount of zits on my face. I didn\u2019t find any. 'I guess there\u2019s a bright side after all.' I was so overwhelmed of my now clear face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! I AM ZIT FREE WOOT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I can hear and see from the Movement of the stomach walls (that i could barely see) was Tifa rubbing her stomach and for some strange reason really enjoyed that specific piece of food. 'Great she probably think that thing that tasted good was the sauce in the sandwich and not little old me...' At that moment I decided to just lay on my back an floating in her stomach's juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I wonder how long will it take for Tifa to notice I am missing.\" I said to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good. So Andrew how did you like your sandwich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I raised my hand with only three fingers showing. I began to count down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3...\"<br>\r\n\"2...\"<br>\r\n\"1...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To let her know I' am safe.' It was no use I knew that she couldn\u2019t hear me even if I yelled a teh top of my lungs cause she didn\u2019t hear my zit free shout a few moments ago. I sighed feeling sorry for Tifa shes almost half dead from worrying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use the Force, Redius\"<br>\r\n\"What the... who\u2019s there?\" I got up from my laying back position and walked on to a nearby dry patch of Tifa's stomach.<br>\r\n\"Let go, Redius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OOOKAAY! Now I am hearing voices in my head.... I probably watched Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope one too many times...' I sat down, meditation style and just thought of one thing. 'This is just a dream there is no real thing as the Force, I am not in an alternate universe of Final Fantasy VII, and I am DEFEINTLY not inside Tifa's wonderful, unique stomach.' I looked around still able to hear Tifas rising heart beat the pulsing stomach walls. \"Wow, it is really nice in here I guess this is what Sith and the others were talking about... it just feels, great.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I have nothing to lose by trying to use the 'Force'.\" Again to no one in particular. I closed my eyes, concentrated in trying to communicate with Tifa... Thinking back now I realized I had no idea what teh hell i was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa...\"<br>\r\n\"Andrew? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n\"Tifa, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n\"Andrew it is you, I was worried I may have eaten you. Where are you now?\"<br>\r\n\"Um... well, you well... I am in your stomach...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I am so sorry, Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am fine... last place I expected to be but fine none of the less.\" <br>\r\n\"Well that\u2019s good, You know I thought I would notice a bit quicker with all the accidents with Sith and all that.\"<br>\r\n\"Sith?! You know Sith?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he is my well...\" It was plainly obvious what she was goanna say. Mostly because I read all of Sith's Tifa stories... (CURSE YOU, JERK!)<br>\r\n\"Well he is my Boyfriend.\" She probably blushed at that.<br>\r\nThe next thing I remember doing was breaking the Force link and got up and in a very deep voice yelled...<br>\r\n\"NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew? What happen I cant hear you...\"<br>\r\nI quickly got back in my meditation stance and reestablished the link.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bad connection...\"<br>\r\n\"So you know Sith?\"<br>\r\n\"Well a bit I meet him on a website and we kind of became pals writing up stories... but how did you tow meet?\" <br>\r\n\"Well... He came from another Dimension. In a very similar matter how you came here. He left a few days ago saying that he was going back to his world and told me to expect a new tiny friend. of his. I guess that makes you his tiny friend.\" I couldn\u2019t tell from my position but I bet she smiled when she said that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr. Fig... I mean Andrew would you like to get out now or...\" A telephone then rings. Its loud noise could be heard even in Tifa's little stomach. \"One sec, let me get the phone.\"<br>\r\nI just nod my head... even though she defiantly can not see it. She picks up the phone and answers it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lockhart residence... This is she... CID! What's wrong... Sith told you... Now... Ok, ok I'll get ready... Yeah, yeah...See you later.\" She then hangs up the phone. <br>\r\n\"Tifa what was that about?\" <br>\r\nShe sighs \"It was Cid, he said Sith told him to gather the gang back together and come to pick me up. I guess something important is about to happen. Oh my I am not even dressed appropriately. Sorry Andrew but I guess you need to stay in there a bit longer. Don\u2019t want to have you take a look at me while I am undressing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just blushed. \"T-T-Tifa I wouldn't dare do that with out your...your p-p-permission...\" Tifa notices my difficulties to say my statement and just laughs lightly. Her stomach was shacking a bit when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to her room I guess to change I couldn\u2019t tell what was happening from inside but something told me she was in her room again. While she was getting dressed I could hear her humming a tune that I couldn\u2019t identify but it was a soothing, lovely tune. She finishes getting dressed and begins to talk to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Andrew I am goanna lay down so you can climb out of my stomach, would be pretty odd to introduce you to the gang while you\u2019re still inside of me.\"<br>\r\nWe both laughed at this.<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" <br>\r\nShe begins to lie down; I noticed the environment was shifting a bit. But before she could go all the way down to the floor a loud excessive knocking was heard from the door downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I was waiting out here for forever!\u201d A young women\u2019s voice shouts out. <br>\r\n\u201cYuffie!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you expecting the Materia Clause?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Cid is getting very impatient. He is waiting with the rest of the gang on the\u2026\u201d Yuffie instantly grabs her mouth as if she was about the barf. <br>\r\n\u201cStill have motion sickness?\u201d<br>\r\nYuffie just stares at Tifa with a serious face. Yuffie grabs Tifa\u2019s hand and leads her outside of the city.  As they ran they came upon the view of Cid\u2019s new ship. Brilliant in design it looks similar to the old Higwind.  Sadly, I didn\u2019t know what was going on inside the bowels of Tifa. I didn\u2019t mind at all though. I mean who wouldn\u2019t when you were inside a lovely lady like Tifa. As soon as Tifa and Yuffie got on board the new Airship, it began to take off due to the loud engine noise rising up near by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few odd minutes I didn\u2019t hear a thing outside of Tifa\u2019s body. I heard a few heart warming hellos. But that was about it. It was an eerie silence. From my position will the hellos were going on I guess Vincent, Red XIII, Caith, Cid, Yuffie, Barret and Cloud where present. It was Cid who broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I traveled across this planet finding the team for this meeting and SITH ISN\u201dT EVEN FREAKING HERE WITH YOU!\u201d Obviously Cid hasn\u2019t lost his anger issues.<br>\r\nTifa finally talked after a hesitant reply. <br>\r\n\u201cSith left a while back to his own dimension a few weeks ago, I haven\u2019t heard from him since then. I was hoping if you guys knew.\u201d<br>\r\nThe whole gang sighed in annoyance in unison. Except Yuffie cause she was probably in the hold hanging on to her lunch. <br>\r\n\u201cSo why are we together then? Didn\u2019t Sith say he will meet up with us when the gang is back together?\u201d Cloud finally says<br>\r\n\u2018I think it is time I made an appearance.\u2019 I said to myself. I establish a Force link with Tifa to inform her that now would be a good idea to present myself. Tifa agrees and talks to the group.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there is one thing I need to show you guys.\u201d The whole gang looks upon her with a confused stare. Tifa then lied down to give me a easy way up her throat. I began to ascend her long esophagus. The constant down motion of the tunnel made it difficult to climb. But I made it to her mouth where I saw day light again. She gently placed me on her right cupped palm. The whole grouped yelled out in unison.<br>\r\n\u201cSITH!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNot quite.\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the Fuck! Who are you?!\u201d Barret asked<br>\r\nTifa answered that question <br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Andrew. And I think this is one of Sith\u2019s friend.\u201d<br>\r\nIt was understandable for there mistaken outburst. When they first meet Sith he was as tall as I was. <br>\r\n\u201cHell-o\u201d I was about to say high when. \u2018Something\u2019s not right\u2026\u2019 I looked around the room from my position on Tifa\u2019s hand but saw nothing until I spotted something Coming from the top right of my position. It was coming in fast I didn\u2019t even know what it was and it was coming at me. As it came closer I saw the thing no a person who was my size take out a small rod of some sort. I then realized a little too late it was a weapon. And not just any weapon. The rod was activated showing a blue blade extending from it. \u2018A lightsaber Coo... OH SHIT!\u2019 I instinctively placed both my hands up to try and block the attack. As soon as it came within striking distance it hit hard, Hard enough for Tifa\u2019s cupped hands to become a stretched out hand.  But instead of me being dead the attack was dead in its tracks. In my hands was a golden hilt Lightsaber with a Viridian color blade. My outfit changed as well. I was now wearing a burgundy (dark red) gi similar to what Crono from Chrono Trigger and un top of Gi there was a similar colored cloak. The attacker was still in the air with his saber diagonally perpendicular to my blade.  I looked upon the attacker. He was wearing a Dark Brown Cloak with a darken face with a scar. \u2018A SCAR!\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Redius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With each strike the attacks became more furious then the last. Luckily I managed to Block all his attacks. Downward slash, overhead block, diagonal slash, reverse parry. I finally found an opening I parried his diagonal attack and countered with a 360 horizontal strike. Sadly it didn\u2019t connect; Sith Just dodged it with a Cool Jedi style back-flip. It was obviously a one sided fight. We stared at each other from opposite sides of Tifa\u2019s left hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA show down for the ages, a master and a apprentice. I remember getting Goosebumps during the fight. \u2018I can\u2019t believe I am wielding a Lightsaber, a REAL ONE!\u2019  Remembering now of that fight I shouldn\u2019t have been concentrating more on the fact my life was on the line\u2026 The stare down lasted for what felt like an eternity\u2026 I made a newbie mistake. I attacked first\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran towards Master at full speed. He came at me as well.  At full combat now, both of us attacking each other with every thing that our little bodies can produce, Slash block, Slash Parry Counter\u2026 I recalled the fight with Obi-Wan and Anakin on Mustafar; tension was high between those two. This fight felt the same. Suddenly we are at a saber lock ounce again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, Good give into you anger, only your hate can destroy me. Then your Journey down Sith will be complete.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll never join you!\u201d still in the saber lock I tried to come up with a new tactic one that I can use to turn the tie of the battle. I then felt something, a strong tug around my belt on my right side. \u2018That\u2019s it.!\u2019 I called upon the force to reach the item attached to my belt. It was another saber hilt, same color and design as the one in my right hand. With my left hand I let go of my saber that was locked with Sith\u2019s and grabbed the other saber. I ignited it quickly attacking at Sith directly. Sith saw this coming and just smiled. He jumped backwards but this time was \u2018floating\u2019 in mid air. (Dual of the Fates song begins) I jumped after him with both Golden hilt Lightsabers ignited with the legendary Viridian glow.  I attached both my sabers together forming a New one. A pole-arm stile Saber and with it I spin it over my head 3 times before attacking Sith.  Attacking with a horizontal attack from the left to begin and Quickly afterwards another attack from the top right towards the cloaked figure. Sadly Sith blocked both of them as if they were nothing. <br>\r\nWith that Sith attacked again knocking me down back to Tifa\u2019s hand. I got back to my feet just in time to see Sith landing a few \u2018feet\u2019 ahead of myself. With a mocking voice he said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re holding the saber too tightly.\u201d<br>\r\n*angry growl* With that I attacked Sith again but subconsciously I loosen my grip around my saber. I attacked with all my might but inexpertly Sith blocked the attack knocking me back onto my back and sending my saber flying off the \u2018platform\u2019 deactivating.  I started to get beck up but stopped half way because of a blue blade dangerously close to my neck. <br>\r\n\u201cNow to loosely\u2026\u201d  (Duel of the Fates song ends)<br>\r\nTifa was about to grab the cloaked figure fearing for my life. But she stopped herself when she noticed the cloaked figure deactivated his saber and put it back on his belt. He then stretches his right arm out towards me. <br>\r\n\u201cImpressive\u2026\u201d I accepted the invitation of help and grabbed on to his arm pulling myself up and standing right next to him.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Most impressive, You have learned much my apprentice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSay what!\u201d Sith just smiles and removes his hood. <br>\r\nTifa then looks upon the small one inch attacker and realizes who he was (cause she didn\u2019t hear me yell out Sith before.) <br>\r\n\u201cSith, Is that you?!\u201d <br>\r\nSith then turns towards Tifa with an even bigger smile on his face. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Honey, missed me?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like I said before I left I was returning to my world to check up on a few things and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nI was starting to lose my nerve\u2026 I mean in a Very, VERY Bad way. \u201cHOLD IT! Why the heck am I here?! AND! Why the heck am I decked out like this, since when did I own a saber and, WHY THE FUCK DID YOU ATTACK ME I COULD HAVE DIED?!\u201d Tifa and Sith just stare at me with an awkward stare\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, It\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s just been all too weird for me. I mean I was just in my room the next thing I know I am well here\u2026\u201d I said with a more even tone. Sith just puts his hand on my shoulders.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok man; I can understand how you feel. It must be tough for you to sink it all in. Oh By the way why don\u2019t you look over there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d He points towards the edge of Tifa\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n\u201cJust look down over that edge.\u201d<br>\r\nI did what he told me to do but as I neared the edge of the hand I got on to my fours and crawled to the edge, As I peered over the side down to the ground, the site of the high elevation made me instantly dizzy. As I continued to look down I notice a shiny object approaching from a great distance. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 The object I could tell was spinning. Faster and faster it spun. I realized too late what it was. \u2018OH SHIT!\u2019 I fell back on to my bottom barely dodging the item. The object was my Double-Bladed Saber Hilt. It went straight to Sith\u2019s hand. Sith just began to laugh\u2026.<br>\r\n\u201cSith\u2026\u201d Tifa said with an annoyed tone.<br>\r\nSith quickly stopped laughing and apologized. I stood up with a furious face staring at Sith. He came up to me and gave me back my saber. I detached the two sabers and placed them back on my belt. But before I could say anything the ship rocked violently. All I heard was a violent series of curse and profanity. It was obviously Cid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! I take my hands off the wheel for one MESALY SECOND and NOW I AM LOSELY CONTROL! HIT THE DECK PEOPLE THIS THING IS GONNA HIT THE GROUND HARD!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room was shacking violently and through the cockpit window the ground was approaching us very quickly. With all his might Cid couldn\u2019t regain control of the ship. As the ship made impact of the solid ground the force knocked everyone off their feet. Tifa fell forward with her mouth open wide about to scream but she didn\u2019t. And the reason she didn\u2019t was that me and Sith fell into Tifa\u2019s mouth accidentally being swallowed. It all went dark. All I remember was furiously cursing at Sith as we fell down to Tifa\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We past the entrance of her stomach, The Lake of acid below us. I heard Sith yell out \u201cCANNONBALL!\u201d At that moment I saw Sith put his knees closer to his body forming a ball. \u2018Well if that doesn\u2019t prove that he\u2019s been in a giantess or two then I don\u2019t know what does.\u2019 With a splash we landed in the lake of stomach juices. Again in the sticky moist environment at least this time I know I am not goanna die\u2026 I swam to the surface of the lake to get a breath of air. As I reached the top all I could hear was a yell of joy from Sith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEAH! WOOT! That was fun.\u201d He yelled breathing heavily.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are one crazy son of a gun.\u201d I replied to his outburst. <br>\r\n\u201cHey it could have been worse.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked him with an aggravated face. <br>\r\n\u201cWell we could have landed underneath Tifa giantess body.\u201d<br>\r\nI hesitate to reply. \u201cYou got a point. I guess we ended up being lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn my experience there is no such thing as Luck, only the force.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhatever Obi-Wan...\u201d I say staring at the amused Sith. \u201cSo what happen?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTo put it bluntly, Cid got distracted by our fight lost control of the ship and crashed somewhere in the Mountains.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOk, but what about Tifa when she finds out what happen to us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I informed her where we were and that we will be ok.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you do this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you were busy cursing and screaming at me on our way down, that\u2019s when I informed her through the force.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh, so we goanna get out of here now?\u201d I said following Sith to a dry patch of stomach to sit on. <br>\r\n\u201cNo, this is a perfect time to discuss a few maters in secret and allow the gang to get the ship up and running.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOk, but don\u2019t you think they will need help doing that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAt our size we would only be a burden.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSize matters, not.\u201d I say to Sith with a smile on my own face.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up green midget and come and join in a meditation link. I would like to test you mental strength.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but that won\u2019t answer the questions in my head\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA strong Body and a Strong mind is the key to any victory, but if any one lack then your victory is, well lost.\u201d He said as I look at him for a moment wondering what to do. I ended up joining him in the meditation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe joined minds; at first I saw only the blackness of my shut eyelids. But after some fierce concentration I saw a white field of nothing. On the other side of this plain I saw Sith. The corners of my vision were a bit blurry as in a dream like state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe are in the battlefield for the minds. Here I want to test your fighting skills without harming Tifa and also test the reaction time of your very mind itself.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d I asked knowing the answer already.<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, Defend yourself.\u201d He rushed at my with his saber drawn and it ignited.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Just great\u2026\u2019 I said to myself grabbing my Lightsaber attached to the left side of my belt. I ignited it allowing the viridian glow around me and the surroundings. I placed the saber near my right ear at a 90 degree angle pointing the blade directly towards the charging Sith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of Tifa\u2019s inwards the gang recovered from their unwanted crash. They managed to get the ship evened out so they wouldn\u2019t have to work in a slanted position. Cid and Barret were asserting the damage on the rest of the ship. Tifa and Yuffie were alone in the conference room talking over Tifa\u2019s Two unexpected (is it really unexpected?) passengers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they really alright in there? I mean must be uncomfortable in there, no offense.\u201d<br>\r\nTifa smiles warmly.  \u201cNone taken, Sith told me they are alright earlier. Sith wanted to talk to them in private about something.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh, um so how does it feel with them in you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d She blushes at this and places her right hand on her exposed stomach. \u201cI do feel them. Every step they take, every movement I can feel. It feels weird to know someone alive is in you and well enjoying themselves.\u201d <br>\r\nYuffie giggles at this. \u201cThat\u2019s cool, well you know for some reason I have this strange feeling I meet Andrew before\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou know I have that feeling as well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nBefore Tifa could finish her sentence a loud series of curses and yelling is heard from outside the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK SHIT BICTH MOTHER FUCKING! I can\u2019t believe the amount of damage there is on this piece of shit!\u201d  Cid and Barret enter the room. <br>\r\n\u201cHEY DON\u2019T TALK ABOUT MY SHIP LIKE THAT TENT THEIF!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cStop calling me TENT THEIF! That happened two years ago LET IT GO!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless you take back what you said about my ship, TENT THEIF!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d<br>\r\nCid then notices that half the group is missing.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, WHERE THE FUCK IS EVERYONE ELSE, I AM NOT GONNA FIX MY SHIP ALONE?!\u201d  As to answer his question Cloud enters right behind him.<br>\r\n\u201cMan your loud, Vincent, Caith and Red XIII went off a while back. They said something about something important they had to take care of in a near by village.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThose ungrateful A-holes, not even staying long enough to help out. And where the fuck is that little midget I need to ask him a few questions.\u201d  Cid yells out in disgust. Tifa just points at her stomach blushing in embarrassment. Barret just shakes his head. <br>\r\n\u201cDam Tifa can\u2019t you at least eat some real food instead of eating your boyfriend and his friends\u2026\u201d Tifa blushes tomato red. <br>\r\n\u201cFor once I agree with Tent Thief here.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHEY I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL ME THAT!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAND I TOLD YOU I\u2019LL STOP CALLING YOU THAT IF YOU TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SADI ABOUT MY SHIP!\u201d  Cid and Barret just stare at each other with anger in their eyes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But do you really need a name to describe me? A definition by words is merely a means to deceive oneself. Anyway, I guess you heard of me before. My shrinking-adventures with Tifa, I guess I told you about them before. Now, I want to provide with more exciting adventures with Tifa and me, a 1 inch or smaller man. But before I start, let\u00b4s recapture what has transpired so far. Tifa and me found this strange materia on Mt. Nibel, and guess what? The materia caused me to shrink down to this pitiful size; made me this miserable being. But Tifa was kind enough not to turn against me. In fact, she cared for me since that day, and it seems it\u00b4s not even a chore for her, as if she likes caring for a shrunken man. Well, after some weird adventures, everything returned to normal. Well, normal in the sense of still being that small, but without having strange adventures a while. We still didn\u00b4t manage to get a reverse spell, so Tifa and me continued to live on like that. As a matter of fact, new adventures were about to take place. It all began...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at Tifa\u00b4s chest moving up and down as she was breathing peacefully in her sleep, I decided to hop onto her bed and climb onto her body. That\u00b4s some kind of every day procedure as well, since it sometimes causes her to wake up, and being near her makes her feel good - at least that\u00b4s what she\u00b4s telling me all the time - and it makes me feel better anyway. So I jumped from the bedside table, falling down quickly and landing on Tifa\u00b4s soft bed, only inches away from her sleeping, gigantic body. I was standing directly in front of the fingers of her left hand, and I couldn\u00b4t help but staring at them. Tifa\u00b4s fingers are just perfect, like she is in every other aspect. Her fingers are quite long - of course not too long - and her fingertips are so soft...you would understand if you were less than inch tall and being carefully touched by her fingertips so often. I somehow also like her fingernails. I don\u00b4t know why, but I hate it when women are wearing colored nail polish. It just looks so out of place to me. Tifa on the other hand has natural fingernails. They\u00b4re not too short, they\u00b4re in fact relatively long, yet not overly long. They\u00b4re also very well manicured. No matter how few make up Tifa uses, she takes great care in her personal hygiene, also in manicure. Although she doesn\u00b4t paint her fingernails with colored nail polish, she sometimes uses transparent nail polish, which hasn\u00b4t any great effect on her nails, it just makes them shine. It\u00b4s in any case better than colored polish, and somehow even cute. Speaking of her look, I guess I\u00b4ve said it many times: I\u00b4ve never seen a girl as gorgeous as Tifa. Her body is perfect, simply flawless, and by the way: she\u00b4s so slender, but fortunately not as thin as some models. Surprisingly enough, I wouldn\u00b4t even describe Tifa as \"sexy\". That term would desecrate her beauty. \"Sexy\" is for women who want to be wooed by a man and invest hours and hours in putting make up on their faces, and all that make up makes them look undesirable. Tifa on the other hand is cute and and a natural beauty, and she looks innocent. I think that\u00b4s because of her face. The word to describe her face would be \"angelic\". no matter whether you\u00b4re looking at her soft cheeks or her lips, everything reminds you of angel\u00b4s face. There\u00b4s a warmth that emanates from it, and I think it has an effect on people - like me. Whenever I look into Tifa\u00b4s eyes and see her smiling with a warm expression, it gives me a comfortable feeling. That must be some sort of gift, cheering people up with a smile. Of course, One has to mention her long black hair. It\u00b4s just too cute! And it\u00b4s really beautiful. I guess Tifa really has to invest a lot of time and effort in order to keep them in shape, especially since they\u00b4re so long. Some would certainly mention her breast...ahem. I\u00b4ll just say: they\u00b4re nice, really, although not as big as some claim, and it\u00b4s not the best thing about her overall look. Enough of Tifa\u00b4s beauty. What makes her such a wonderful person is not the way she looks. It\u00b4s her inner beauty. Tifa is simply the kindest person I\u00b4ve ever encountered. She\u00b4s always nice to everyone, and she never ever is behaving rude. She\u00b4s also a caring and loyal friend. I think I am the living example. She would never let down a friend in need of help. When I shrank down to this size, Tifa immediately told me that she would take care of me. Despite herself being a great fighter, she\u00b4s a gentle person, and in fact she hates fighting, she\u00b4s just doing it for self-protection and protecting those close to her - like myself ;). One has to say that she also is quite a funny person sometimes. Since she\u00b4s almost always in a good mood, we\u00b4re having fun together quite often. For example, we\u00b4re sometimes just fooling around like children, or we\u00b4re telling jokes to each other. But she\u00b4s also teasing me sometimes in a nice way, in any case never in a humiliating way. It\u00b4s just funny. I also have to admit that Tifa really is an intelligent woman, quick witted and having a good knowledge in many fields. You can really talk with her about some complicated or sophisticated themes. I simply love her for what she is - the most adorable person I have ever met in my life. In my opinion, she has the radiance of an angel, and from the moment I met her, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven\u00b4t though about her. And whenever I\u00b4m with her...I can\u00b4t explain this feeling. She is in my very soul, as well as I am in hers. Yes...I think...I think we love each other.<br>\r\nAhem. All this admiration for Tifa I\u00b4m telling you now are based on the thoughts I was having back then when I sat next to Tifa\u00b4s body. I was still having them when I finally climbed onto her belly and sat down there. Deep in my thoughts, I didn\u00b4t realize first that Tifa actually was awake staring down at me and smiling at my obvious daydreaming. She grabbed me carefully between her thumb and pointer finger, bringing me closer to her face, and guess what? I still didn\u00b4t realize! She was smiling as she was amused about this, and she cleared her throat in an exaggerated manner.<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? T-Tifa! You\u00b4re awake?!\"<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"<br>\r\n\"Good morning, then!\"<br>\r\n\"Good morning. What was that all about? Were you daydreaming?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes...I think so. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"Let me guess: about me?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? I...I...\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, Sith, don\u00b4t be shy! I\u00b4m your friend! You can tell me.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Hm...I\u00b4m honored to be the subject of your daydreams.\"<br>\r\n\"Very funny...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I\u00b4m not teasing you! I\u00b4m really honored! What exactly were you dreaming of - or thinking of?\"<br>\r\n\"I just realized once again how damn luck I am to have you as my girlfriend, Tifa.\"<br>\r\n\"Sith...thank you! you\u00b4re so kind! And I actually feel the same way. And besides, I\u00b4m probably the only girl whose boyfriend actually is small enough to travel through her body. I think that\u00b4s cool! And somehow romantic...\"<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\"<br>\r\nWell, that was a typical morning-conversation between us. You may call it cheesy, but I think love is always cheesy somehow. But I don\u00b4t care. Being with Tifa is all that matters.</span></div></div>",

She decided to go on a journey with a ship, in order to see all of Spira\u00b4s aspects, the world she was supposed to save someday. But alas, everything went downhill. The ship Yuna was on went into a terrible storm, and although the ship went through this disaster without any major damage, Yuna was not so lucky: she was washed overboard, and no matter how hard she tried to swim back to the ship, she soon got lost in the ocean.<br>\r\nThe last thing she knew was that she managed to swim to a beach, were she soon fell unconscious.

But unfortunately, the giantess wasn\u00b4t alone. Another giantess walked to the battleground.<br>\r\n\"Blair? What happened?!\"<br>\r\nIt seemed that these two stranded here on this island as well as Yuna. But this one seemed to be even more powerful.<br>\r\n\"You small impudent scum! You\u00b4ll pay!\"<br>\r\nOne could see that she was trained in the magic skills according to her clothes, so this fight would a lot tougher.<br>\r\n\"It doesn\u00b4t matter how many maggots you got, I\u00b4ll crush them all!\" Seproth shouted in anger, as he was about to attack the giantess. But to his surprise, he got help: he realized that Lady Yuna arrived, and more surprisingly, Lord Drez and Lord Sith as well as some soldiers flying on dragons: so Lord Drez and Lord Sith were made temporary leaders of the Dragon Brigade.<br>\r\nSith was sitting on a rather old and powerful dragon called Oddeye, the one who belonged to the former leader.<br>\r\n\"Think you can handle this, Oddeye?\" Sith asked as Oddeye flew toward the giantess.<br>\r\n\"No problem, m\u00b4lord.\"</span></div></div>",

Anyways, I came to help you defeat the second giantess who came here, who turned out to be Ayane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSith put in his two cents. \"Yeah, but you killed her, I'm pretty sure I saw her burn up, or something. But then she just reappeared. Must be some new technique taught to her by Sephroth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then,\" Drez continued, \"We all contemplated putting all our differences beside with her and going for a trip into her womb...\" Drez saw all the faces of people staring at him strangely, and quickly said\" just kidding, eheheh... damn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Drolos contributed to the whole. \"Yeah, and then I joined the fight all overly-powerful like, and completely won the battle. But then Shadow got taken over by the millenium ring of all things, and we got in a whole other fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then\", Drez finished off, \"We all made up with her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sephroth joined back into the frey, and he totally decimatedus, but a final attack managed to get him and he was carried away. Oh, and Shadow beat the evil spirit, and broke the millenium item.\" Sith crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Shadow muttered, a teardrop appearing on his head. \"I know those things are expensive, maybe I shouldn't have just done away with it like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where was I?\" a voice queried above everyone. They looked up to see Yuna with an arched eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right\", Sith thought, \"I think I saw you mentioned once or twice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud commotion erupted in the back of the gathering crowd. Suddenly, soldiers on dragons flew to the clearing and landed in front of Sith and Drez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Drez, Lord Sith, we are here to recieve our orders from Lord Sephroth.\" The general got on a knee. \"Do you happen to know where we may find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wtf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Sith thought for a moment longer, then came to a desicion. He looked at everyone in the crowd, and spoke aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the king's go-to guy, I hereby make this unnoficial rule under his name!\" Sith looked out from Drez, to Yuna, the crowd of people, and finally Drolos and Shadow. \"From now on, please take some consideration for the rest of us, and review what you right before pressing the send button. This isn't an AOL chat room! Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone bowed their heads, and muttered \"We're sorry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna looked around, wondering what to do. Everyone looked so sad now, and she felt like she had to make up for it somehow. A thought occure to her, and she gave an exsasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who wants to celebrate the victory with a Vore Party...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted in cheers, and everyone ran off to the city to get their scuba gear and get drunk.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, she was a kind giantess and instead of hurting us, she helped us in some difficult situations. So we helped her to get away from this island by building a boat for her. Well, iz was a gigantic ship for us, but for her it was just a boat. It took a few months, but we made it.\"<br>\r\n\"So my mother was not an evil giantess...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. And I think you\u00b4re gentle, too.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The soldiers and some ordinary people who have been gathering around the tied up giantess were still surprised by the fact that Yuna was indeed Lord Braska\u00b4s daughter. It seemed that they wouldn\u00b4t have to worry about her that much, a somehow new situation. Voretopia\u00b4s people were used to being attacked by evil giantesses, and even children were being trained in the arts of giantess-hunting. So a gentle giantess was kinda refreshing.<br>\r\nLord Sith stepped onto a platform, giving his soldiers advice.<br>\r\n\"Soldiers, release her!\"<br>\r\nThe men immediately began to work on cutting Yuna\u00b4s shackles (hope that\u00b4s the right noun), but it took some time. The shackles had been thick and strong in order to prevent the giantess from getting up. Buf after some minutes, the work was done and Yuna was finally able to stand up.<br>\r\n\"Ah...at last.\"<br>\r\nShe limbered up her muscles a bit, then looked down to her feet. All those tiny persons were quite an unusual sight for Yuna, in fact they were only 1/10 of an inch tall (about 2.5 millimetres) compared to her, so she could hardly even see them. The people around here were amazed about Yuna\u00b4s size as well, although it shouldn\u00b4t have been that extraordinary, yet they weren\u00b4t used to seeing such beautiful giantesses.<br>\r\nYuna now looked at Lord Drez and Lord Sith, and she went on her knees in order to get a better look at those two tiny Lords. As her face was now nearer to them, the two were almost overwhelmed by its sheer beauty. Her face was immaculate; it was perfect, and due to her gigantic size it wasn\u00b4t that hard to notice. In fact, her face alone was so big that an ordinary person from Voretopia would have been able to enter her lachrymal gland (or tear duct; I dunno) without any problem. She looked at the two and smiled gently.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for trusting me.\"<br>\r\n\"Don\u00b4t mention it, m\u00b4lady.\"<br>\r\nShe moved her right hand down in front of them, inviting them to jump on. And so they did. The boldly hopped onto her huge hand that she now brought nearer to her face. Her skin was really soft, one could easily sleep on it quite good. Her fingernails were normal in terms of lenght, not too long and not too short. They were manicured good as well, and she was wearing only decent nail polish, not colored, but only shiny transparent polish. When she held the two in front of her face, she giggled.<br>\r\n\"You really are tiny, but...you\u00b4re soooo cute as well!\"<br>\r\n\"You heard that, Drez? She\u00b4s talking about us as if we were just some cuddly toys. Darn it, we\u00b4re warriors, for god\u00b4s sake.\"<br>\r\n\"I think she didn\u00b4t mean that, compadre. I guess she likes us. Well, for my part, I\u00b4m not surprised. I\u00b4m a ladykiller, after all, but you...\"<br>\r\n\"Shut your piehole! I\u00b4m popular with women as well, I have a cute girlfriend and...\"<br>\r\nYuna giggled again about this (terribly written) dialogue, just when a soldier arrived from the capital.<br>\r\n\"Lord Sith! Lord Drez! I bring news from his majesty!\"<br>\r\n\"What news?\"</span></div></div>",

I won\u00b4t crush anyone with my feet.\"<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m counting on that.\"<br>\r\nIt wasn\u00b4t necessary, though. As you began to walk, the people immediately stepped aside enough so she wouldn\u00b4t crush anyone. Still, the ground was shaking a bit with every step she took. In fact, she didn\u00b4t feel anything while walking; she was taking just normal steps, as if she was walking somewhere on her home island. But the tiny voretopians, on the other hand, are countless times smaller than an average inhabitant of Spira, so one of Yuna\u00b4s steps was quite powerful, yet not earthquake-like. Anyway, only a few minutes later, Yuna stopped and looked down, where she saw the man the soldier spoke of. She could hardly recognize the shape of the man since he appeared to be smaller than a bug compared to her, but she figured out that this would be him.<br>\r\nShe carefully put Sith and Drez on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Be careful, you two. In case of need, I\u00b4ll assist you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Yuna.\"</span></div></div>",

Lord Drez?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Yuna?\"<br>\r\n\"...I\u00b4m going to help you. If that giantess reall is evil, then I\u00b4ll fight her. I\u00b4ll protect you and your people.\"<br>\r\n\"M\u00b4lady...I don\u00b4t know what to say.\"<br>\r\nYuna smiled with determination. This was her chance to prove that she was not evil. And she really liked this country and their inhabitants, so helping them was the least thing she could do.<br>\r\n\"Lord Drez, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n\"It sounds like a good idea to me. She will be very useful to us in case the giantess is evil.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, then. You\u00b4ll carry us?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\nSo Yuna began to move to the east coast, with the two tiny lords on her right hand. She was full of self confidence, for the first time in her life she would really be able to help others. As if it was an exercise for her great task: one day, she would become a summoner, like her father, and would travel through Spira in order to destroy Sin. But that was the future in that moment (or wasn\u00b4t it? Sometimes the future can change...). Right now, she had to concentrate on a possible fight.</span></div></div>",

Well, a great distance for voretopians, not for an ordinary inhabitant of Spira like Yuna. The giantess realized that someone was coming and turned around to Yuna. She had long blond hair that she\u00b4s been wearing up. She was wearing an orange shirt as well; and there were some accessoirs in her outfit, for example she had her fingernails painted yellow. Strangely enough, she had bright green swirls in her eyes, and that made her eyes look even more beautiful.<br>\r\nIt seemed that she was surprised to see Yuna; she came nearer to Yuna and looked into her eyes curiously.<br>\r\n\"Hello there. Can you help me? I was washed onto the coast of this island, and I haven\u00b4t seen any other person around here.\"<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Yuna asked, a bit relieved as the giantess appeared to be gentle.<br>\r\n\"Me? I\u00b4m Rikku, the daughter of Cid.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you say...Cid? Cid from the Al-Bhed?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm...yeah, that\u00b4s right.

My father told me so much about you, Lord Braska and his wife.\"<br>\r\n\"*giggle*\"<br>\r\nLord Drez and Sith didn\u00b4t know what to think of these events. Sure, it seemed that the giantess was gentle, but they didn\u00b4t understand their girlie talk.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, can you tell me where I am?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, what\u00b4s that on your right hand?\"<br>\r\nRikku took a close look on Drez and Sith, bringing her gigantic head close the hand they were on. She stared at them, curious like a child.<br>\r\n\"Are these your miniature toys?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, they\u00b4re living persons.\"<br>\r\n\"What? They\u00b4re alive! Hm...now I see it. Wow, they really are tiny...but soooo cute as well!\"<br>\r\nRikku giggled, and Sith was pissed a bit while Drez enjoyed the women talking about him like that.<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, not that \"cute\" talk again...\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, Sith.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you two. My name is Rikku. And who\u00b4re you?\"<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m Lord Drez, m\u00b4lady.\"<br>\r\n\"Lord Sith, m\u00b4lady.\"<br>\r\nBoth of the girls began to giggle again, when Sith interrupted them.<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Didn\u00b4t you want to know where you are now?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, I almost forgot.\"<br>\r\n\"I propose we go to our capital. The king will tell you everything.\"<br>\r\nYuna and Rikku prepared to leave, when Rikku asked Yuna something.<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Yunie?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"May I hold one of the two while we\u00b4re walking? They\u00b4re so cute, and I\u00b4d like to.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! What does she think we are? Toys?!\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, Sith. Enjoy the ride.\"<br>\r\n\"All-right, all-right. Tsk.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that okay for you two?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure. It\u00b4s okay for my pal here as well, I think.\"<br>\r\nSo Rikku carefully grabbed Sith and placed him on her right hand.

Its appearance resembled  ancient cities (i.e. Rome or Athens; there were also resemblences to a certain city called Theed), and yet the city was not without any signs of technical progress, as Vore City possessed some powerful and modern weapns, as well as some modern vehicles. The king\u00b4s palace was located directly in the center of the city, resembling chateau Versailles and other 17th century buildings. It must have been an amazing sight for Yuna and Rikku: they have never seen something like that before, the sheer beauty of Voretopia\u00b4s architecture was overwhelming and unlike anything that could be seen somewhere else in Spira. Although it was a big city, there was no way Rikku or Yuna could have moved further into the capital; though the streets were wide, they weren\u00b4t even half as wide as one of the giantesses\u00b4 feet. So they had to stay outside the capital.<br>\r\nSome people came out of their houses and looked at the two gorgeous giantesses with great interest. It was unusual to see a gentle giantess here in Vore City, and the people actually enjoyed it.<br>\r\n\"Wow. This city really is beautiful.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Lady Yuna.

Our existence is completely unknown to the rest of the world. But despite our nearly microscopic size, our country has become quite wealthy. Unfortunately, our lives are sometimes disturbed by giantesses who strand on our coasts. Mostly they\u00b4re evil, and in some cases we even have to kill them.

Yuna might have saved the entire world from the infamous Sin, but she was still sad about the loss of Tidus. But one day, her cousin Rikku brought her a sphere with images of her beloved friend. So she decided to become a sphere hunter in order to search for hints on Tidus\u00b4 whereabouts. Of course Rikku and some of her Al-Bhed comrades joined Yuna in her desperate search.<br>\r\nOne day, they heard rumors about a very special sphere no one ever dared to collect, as it was said that it possessed terrible and uncontrolable powers. This gained Yuna\u00b4s interest, and despite the dangers that could have been waiting for them, she and Rikku quickly tried to locate the sphere. In the end, after a long journey they found the sphere in a cave somewhere near Bevelle. Though it was guarded by a behemoth, they defeated the creature and took the sphere with them. Back onboard their airship (called \"Celsius\"), Yuna and Rikku as well as the crew of the Celsius (including Rikku\u00b4s brother) were gathering in order to see what the sphere would show them. Well, nothing. Yuna, disappointed by the fact that sphere didn\u00b4t even show any useful images, threw it onto the ground.<br>\r\n\"Yunie...don\u00b4t worry!\" Rikku yelled.<br>\r\n\"We\u00b4ll find a useful sphere next time! I\u00b4m sure about that!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Rikku.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you should go to your room and rest a bit. Oh yeah, before we leave, I\u00b4ll have to go to Bevelle again. I have some business there, y\u00b4know.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, Rikku. We\u00b4ll be waiting for you.\"<br>\r\nSo Rikku (as the only member of the Celsius) left the Celsius and went off to the nearby city of Bevelle. Yuna, while sitting on her bed, looked at the sphere again. Something was strange about it; the sphere had something she never felt about other spheres. So she grabbed the sphere again, and...woosh! A strange light came out of the sphere and covered the whole airship. What Yuna didn\u00b4t realize then was the fact that the airship was shrinking down to the size of a mere ant.</span></div></div>",

And they have asked the SeeDs for help. And Squall, Xell and Selphie were the ones to be send there. They met in a small room in Balamb Garden, where they were awaiting Quistis. She wanted to give them some advice before leaving. <br>\r\nBut during their wait, something unusual was happening. Each of them felt a sudden tiredness, and seconds later they collapsed and fell asleep (much like in the game, when they are sent to...oh, I don\u00b4t want to spoil anything in case you haven\u00b4t played part 8). After what seemed like an eternity, Squall was the first one to wake up again. He rubbed his eyes, looked around...and was shocked by what he saw. Quistis\u00b4 right foot was directly in front of him, but...it was as big as a house and he was only as big as an ant!<br>\r\n\"Hey, everyone, where are you?\" Quistis asked, surprised that there was no one here. But of course, Squall and the others were in the same room, with one small difference: they must have been shrunken to microscopic size somehow. Squall didn\u00b4t care why this happened, right now, it was more important to stay alive, as Quistis could easily crush them by accident.<br>\r\n\"Xell, Selphie, wake up!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...what\u00b4s the matter, pal?\"<br>\r\n\"*yawn* I had such a niiiice dream!\" Selphie murmured.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4ve been dreaming I was ant-sized, and...\"<br>\r\nXell and Selphie grew silent as they saw the titanic Quistis in front of them.<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahhh!

I take it you all know who I\u00b4m talking about, right? I\u00b4m speaking of Hitomi, the daughter of a beautiful Japanese woman and a German martial arts expert. And I can tell you, Hitomi is stunningly gorgeous! She\u00b4s 18 years old, thus she\u00b4s still visiting high school (of course, here in Germany, we don\u00b4t call it high school. We have something different, we call it Gymnasium, and no, it\u00b4s not the same as in America, not the building where you can do sports), and the best part is: she\u00b4s in the same class as I am, and she\u00b4s directly next to me! That\u00b4s hardly a surprise, since Hitomi and I are close friends since our early childhood, and our parents are close friends as well. I even traveled along with her in order to witness her fighting skills at the DoA tournament in Japan, and she\u00b4s a great martial arts expert, her father can be truly proud of her. Of course, one would not expect a gentle girl like Hitomi to be doing so well in the martial arts field, but believe it or not, she\u00b4s a great fighter.<br>\r\nSo, you now might ask: \"what\u00b4s the point of all this? Isn\u00b4t that a GTS-endosomatophilia story?\". In that case, you\u00b4re right, my dear reader. I was just giving you some exposition before the really exciting parts starts. Because one day, I, a perfectly ordinary 18 year old guy, went on an adventure of a lifetime, an adventure that lead me to places no human has gone before, where no man ever was able to set his step personally. If I may say so, I am the first person ever who was able to shrink down to near microscopic size!<br>\r\nSo this is where our true story begins.</span></div></div>",

Imagine someone like...Wayne Szalinski from \"Honey I shrunk the kids\" (nice flick by the way, and Rick Moranis does a cool job), without the nerdy and clumsy attitude. In fact, my father really was able to develop a shrinking ray, like in some sci-fi movies. Of course I didn\u00b4t know about that before, but unfortunately, I was about to find out, and Hitomi indirectly.<br>\r\nTwas one day after school, and Hitomi and I went home to me. We didn\u00b4t have much time, since she had to go the dojo for her training, so we just wanted to eat something before leaving. You must know, I myself am not practicing martial arts like Hitomi, I\u00b4m just sometimes accompanying her, because I like spending time together with her. My mother prepared something sweet, a cake for both of us: Sachertorte, Hitomi\u00b4s favourite meal. I still thank my mum for that, as if she knew I really like Hitomi and thus prepared her favourite food. I finished the cake before Hitomi could dinish hers, so I decided to go upstairs into the attic, just for fun. I still don\u00b4t know why I went to the attic that day, but afterwards, I think it was the right decision. Besides, dad often worked in the attic on his devices, so I was a little curious, and since he wasn\u00b4t there and Hitomi not yet ready, I went up the stairs to the mysterious looking attic. I opened the door, and...was kinda disappointed. There wasn\u00b4t really much to see, in fact nothing, only a strange looking thing hidden under a wite blanket.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What\u00b4s this?\", I thought, so I took a closer look. I removed the blanket, and before me, there was a futuristic looking...superlaser? It really looked like some metallic laser-weapon from some sci-fi flick.<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s what dad was working on? Lame...\"<br>\r\nI saw a bagpack on a table next to this strange machine, and I simply grabbed it.<br>\r\n\"Hm...quite heavy. Hm? What\u00b4s that inscription? \"All you need for the trip of your life\". Now what does that mean?\"<br>\r\nOut of fun, I put the bag on, and while doing so, I noticed a control panel attached to the machine.<br>\r\n\"Hm...I shouldn\u00b4t do this, but...why not?\"<br>\r\nSo I pressed some buttons on the control panel, just out of fun.<br>\r\n\"Well...nothing happened at all.\"<br>\r\nThat was when the machine suddenly was activated and started making strange noises, as if it was charging. Before I knew, I was hit by a greenish ray!</span></div></div>",

Everything around seemed to be getting bigger and bigger, until it finally stopped after about 10 seconds. And as the change stopped, everything was different. That was no longer the boring attic...no, this was now a vast wasteland, and this device I activated was towering over me like a mountain, and I mean a really high mountain. I was trembling in fear, angry at me because I activated the machine for no apparent reason. Suddenly, I heard some bleeps coming out of the bagpack I was wearing, so I put it off and opened it. There were all kind of things, and I had no idea what their purpose was (but I gladfully found out about that later), and I realized the bleeps came from some sort of watch. So I put it around my wrist, watching on the display, but there was nothing, obviously that thing was not activated yet. I pressed a small button, on the right, and there appeared a message on the screen, accompanied by a robotic voice.<br>\r\n\"Shrinkage successful. Current size: 1 millimeter.\"<br>\r\nYour face was turning pale. 1 millimeter? Shrinkage? So that machine...was a shrink ray? And it shrunk me down to 1 millimeter? That\u00b4s even smaller than 1/16 of an inch? With that size, I was merely a speck for an ordinary human! I had to get help, but how? How would I be able to get in contact with a normal person, bein just an insignificant speck?<br>\r\nAs if my situation wasn\u00b4t already grim, things were getting even worse, as the ground began to shake heavily, just like during an earthquake. And I was able to see the reason for the quake: Hitomi was entering the room, and every step she took with her gigantic boots caused me to fall down on the ground, due to the powerful impact.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Marcus, where are you?\"<br>\r\nSurprisingly, her voice didn\u00b4t seem to be that much louder, still her soft and kind voice.<br>\r\n\"Hitomi, I\u00b4m down here! Hitomi!\"<br>\r\nOf course, she didn\u00b4t hear me, and she couldn\u00b4t see me as well, and I was getting sad because of this. She could have been able to help me, but that was more than unlikely at that moment. Staring at her in all her beauty, I realized that she was not just huge. No, she was monstrously huge, in any case it\u00b4s hard to put in words. I also realized that she was holding a glass filled with water in her right hand. If I had known back then that the true adventure was just about to start...</span></div></div>",

Hitomi probably didn\u00b4t even notice, but to me, the breeze was so strong that I was engulfed by it and whisked away. I had no idea where I was being blown, it all went on so fast. But then I suddenly fell down, and I splashed into some water. Due to the impact, I was underwater for a few seconds, but then I swam up to the surface.<br>\r\n\"W-where am I?\"<br>\r\nIt seemed like a gigantic ocean, and I slowly realized where I was. I was inside Hitomi\u00b4s glass of water.<br>\r\n\"Oh no! If she\u00b4s going to drink, then...\"<br>\r\nTo my dismay, Hitomi took a sip as she left the room. The glass began to shift and the masses of water began flowing into a monstrously big pink cave in the distance: Hitomi\u00b4s mouth, framed by her rows of teeth and her lips. She then closed her gaping maw again, walking into the kitchen to my mother.<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Marcus?\"<br>\r\n\"No, isn\u00b4t he in the attic?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n\"Hm...\"<br>\r\n\"That idiot! He promised me to go with me to the dojo!\"<br>\r\nOuch. These words really hurt. I absolutely didn\u00b4t want to make Hitomi angry, but I managed to...although I was so near to her. Fortunately, my mother managed to minimize Hitomi\u00b4s anger. My mother always knew that I really like Hitomi, so she wanted to help me with that out.<br>\r\n\"Hitomi, I don\u00b4t think Marcus is doing it on purpose.

Uh, sorry.\"<br>\r\nBut then, the inevitable was about to happen as Hitomi screamed in pain and her body began to change.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere else on the island, a tired looking, ordinary guy was walking on the beach.

And did you see Hitomi?\"<br>\r\nSuddenly the girl began to scream, pointing with her finger at some place over the ocean behind Sith.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\nSith turned around, and what he saw wasn\u00b4t that scary or unusual. Just the gorgeous Hitomi, with astronomic size, walking toward the beach he was on.<br>\r\n\"Oh...not again.

You recongize Helena from all the DOA Tournaments you've been to.  You have a crush on her...funny thing, since she could crush YOU now.  Helena's stomach growled so loud that even you can hear it.  Helena bends over and opens the big double-doors to the factory and starts to suck everything in. Luckily, you were loading up a truck filled with ice cream on the outside, so you didn't get sucked up into Helena's mouth.  After 4 minutes, Helena stops sucking from the double-doors and gets into a sitting postition on the ground.  People from all around are running from the beautiful opera singer.  You know that over 200 people work at the factory. You begin to wonder how many people are in Helena's stomach right now.  You don't have time to wonder long, when Helena sees the truck you're in!  Helena picks up the truck that's filled with ice cream and you.  She lifts the truck above her wide-open mouth and tilts the truck, so that ice cream can enter her mouth.  You slide right into Helena's cavernous mouth, being unable to stop yourself.  Helena's tongue is about as wide as a football field to you and is covered in ice cream. Not that you have time to admire her tongue, because she swallows you as soon as you enter her mouth.  The trip down the throat doesn't take long, and you enter a large chamber that can only be Helena's stomach.  You land right in stomach acid.  You can't last long in here.  But...you aren't digesting.  All the ice cream around you is digesting, but not you.  Helena has eaten about 100,000 gallons of ice cream (or more) and you! <br>\r\n         Outside, Helena puts down the now empty truck and licks her lips.  <br>\r\n          \"That hit the spot\" said Helena, rubbing her stomach.  \"now, for something to drink\"  </span></div></div>",

Your job in the ice-cream factory was boring and could not fit your abilities, but it was just a job to gain some money. You had plans, you wanted to get a job with a perspective. But that didn\u00b4t matter anymore. You were now just part of a meal inside the body of an opera singer. Honestly, it would have been ridiculous to think about your future, your perspectives right now. Though it was kinda funny. Despite the incredible size of Helena\u00b4s stomach, the ground of her stomach seemed to be covered with ice-cream completely. So you could walk over this ice-cream mountains without getting in contact with stomach acids. Yet the acids didn\u00b4t seem to affect you (a few drops of acids were coming down from the \"ceiling\" of her stomach, and neither did it hurt nor did it affect your skin. You also realized that you were the only person inside Helena. Looks like everyone from the factory was able to escape, except for you. That was just so typical.<br>\r\nHelena\u00b4s stomach was shaking violently as it tried to digest all this ice-cream, and it almost caused you to fall; her pink stomach walls were vibrating heavily due to that. You could feel that she was now walking though you didn\u00b4t know where.<br>\r\nOn the outside, Helena\u00b4s hunger might have been satisfied. But the situation still made her sad; yes, even tears were coming down her cheeks. Everyone would avoid her now, as most people considered her to be a monster now, though she didn\u00b4t want to hurt anyone at all.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m...thirsty.\" she whispered.<br>\r\nFrom the distance she saw a swimming pool, and no one seemed to be in it, so she walked there, bowed down and begin to slurp some water.</span></div></div>",

It was disgusting yet fascinating, the thought of being inside a gorgeous girl like her was still too unbelievable. But the thought of the possible exit was scary, you really didn\u00b4t wan to get out of her rear. So you decided to try entering her stomach again. You swam to the entrance of the intestines that was about 1.5 metres above you (not to mention slippery as hell). You gave it your best shot and tried to climb up, jump there, every way possible to reach that hole. You were jumping around in there quite some time, and that wasn\u00b4t without any result. Outside her body, Helena put her hand on her belly.

Ayane was mad at Jack for a number of reasons.  1) He promised that the next DOA Game would be on the island and 2) Ayane was always mad at something, or someone that made her mad.  On the Tuesday morning our story starts, Ayane was going to play volleyball with Tina, Helena, and Hitomi.  That's when Ayane saw a new shop on the island.  The man who ran the shop was selling all sorts of potions.  Ayane picked out a potion in a bottle that was marked  \"Growth Potion\"<br>\r\n     \"Ah, a very good choice\" said the man.  \"for you, that potion is free.  Be sure to read the instructions that come with it\"<br>\r\n     Ayane walked out of the shop, which mysteriously vanished.  Ayane read the instructions that were on the bottle:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Drezzy's Growth Potion <br>\r\n <br>\r\n         Drink and grow to the heavens; have fun smashing whole cities; you can even take over the world if you choose!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            WARNING<br>\r\n <br>\r\n          DO NOT EAT ANYTHING AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN THIS POTION FOR YOUR STOMACH WILL NOT DIGEST ANYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   Ayane got a wicked gleam in her eyes.

But let us begin to tell your story from the start.<br>\r\nYou are Marcus Brody (yes, that\u00b4s actually your name...don\u00b4t sue me if it sounds familiar...), an 18-year old student from the United States. Last summer, you decided to go on a vacation, with your destination being Japan. You were always fascinated with that country, and you wanted to see it first-hand, and what other city in Japan could one visit but Tokyo? And it was rather cool, since you were having fun in the arcades, shopping in Akihabara or other fun-stuff. But that was nothing compared to the things to come. The things that were about to unfold are simply to incredible to be described in just a few words. So they will be described as clearly as possible, my dear reader. In any case these events were unlike anything you could have expected from a vacation. Icing the cake if you want.<br>\r\nOne day during your vacation, you decided that studying some cultural aspects of Japan would be an interesting thing, so you went to an old shrine in the \"outskirts\" of Tokyo. First, it was quite the thing you would expect from such an antique shrine: nice architecture, and many tourists. But then it happened. You saw HER. She was caring for some flowers outside the shrine, and the flowers matched her beauty perfectly. In fact, you spotted there the most beautiful girl you\u00b4ve ever seen, in that field flowers. She was wearing some traditional, white robes, which made her look gorgeous in a special way, since that outfit put some emphasis on her natural beauty; since you detest slutty, over-the-top clothes. She had long black hair, and a face with a look like that of an angel, perfectly smooth and natural. She had absolutely no make-up in her face, her fingernails were white and quite long - yet not too long - and she wasn\u00b4t wearing any jewelry. You knew immediately that she was the girl you always dreamed of. You had to talk to her. And you had the guts to pull that of. Indeed you talked to her, and thanks to your kind words, she immediately liked you. Her name is Kokoro, she said, daughter of the current guardian of the shrine. Kokoro and you spent the whole day together, and in the evening, you and her were sitting on a bench outside the shrine, in front of the flower field.<br>\r\n\"Say, Kokoro, have you any plans for the near future?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I have. I\u00b4m planning to participate at the Dead or Alive tournament.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow...that\u00b4s...that\u00b4s just incredible, you know. You don\u00b4t look like a person who likes to fight. You look more like an...angel.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But I\u00b4m not participating because I like the fighting. I\u00b4m doing it for the sake of my family. Many of my ancestors were great fighters, and I want to continue this tradition. But honestly, I prefer taking care of the shrine. I don\u00b4t really like fights. By the way, are you hungry? I have some candy with me.\" she said as she showed you a pack of candies she was holding in her right hand. They looked like some ordinary pieces of chocolate. At least they looked like that.</span></div></div>",

Chun-Li caught sense of his motion as she began to turn around, the man had all ready jammed the needle in her voluptuous rear!  The needle had sunk deep into the officer's very much all ready large bottom and the liquid had been injected into her rump.  \"Ah!!\" she yelped as the man chuckled, but was soon silenced by a violent round house to the jaw which flung him into a far wall of the alley, bouncing into a trash can pile.  \" What the hell did you inject me with?! \" she demanded as she began to felt her sore rear begin to throb as she rubbed it.  The man collected himself, getting up as he chuckled a bit, his sunglasses broken and filled with cracks.  Chun-Li began to turn away once more but stumbled, hunching over as she tried to maintain her footing, bending over with her hands on her knees.  She felt the panty hose which she wore over her voluptuous thighs began to feel tight, Chun-Li thinking it was just her mind.  She rubbed her bottom once more and noticed that part of the panty hose like material had began to rip!  Initially, she thought the was just because of the needle but there were gashes in the fabric everywhere, especially on her posterior.  She regained her vision clarity and looked back to him, \" Answer me! \" she yelled but he remained silent, chuckling though.  She turned her head over her shoulder to look at her outsticking round rear, \"God! I'm hallucinating. \" but soon thought differently, though the situation worsened as her hips, thighs, and bottom increased rapidly in size!  \" Ah-god! \" she said as she turned to evacuate the alley, but stumbled as her massive rear got larger and larger along with her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Heh heh, magnificent. \" The man said, watching.  It had all ready turned late and not many people were on the street, and hardly any cars passed.  Though they passed so fast now since the traffic was gone and the pace picked up no one noticed.  Chun-Li's rump only continued to grow as it filled the alley, along with her thighs.  Though it did not chunk up, it merely seemed to just grow and enhance.  The man was cornered, to think about it as he looked over his shoulder at his blocked passage, he proceeded to the whining Chun-Li.  \" What the hell?! \" she said as she struggled around, still having control but her massive size in the bottom was stuck to the alley somewhat.  The shady man came up to the now rapidly growing posterior of Chun-Li, giving a light slap to her right butt cheek which jiggled from it's mass, though still somewhat firm.  Chun-Li had given up for the time, just hoping it would go away soon as she then felt her rear shrug, and grow in one big spurt as the panty hose around her thighs and ass ripped into a spider web looking pattern, the tan flesh under it now visible greatly.  The man backstepped quickly as he was surprised by the rapid jerk of growth, but we too slow as the hungry cheeks snatched him up and pulled him through a tear in the fabric into the soft confines.  \"Ahck!\" Chun-Li exclaimed as the man was yanked into her posterior!  She felt him between her large cheeks moving about closer to her still it seemed until it felt like he just vanished at her anus.  \"Ahh..!\" she thought, the man had been sucked into her rear as she then noticed the two walls of the buildings in the alley collapsed, one being an abandoned store house and the other a bustling convienent store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man at the register saw the encroaching left cheek as the man working the counter didn't notice surprisingly.   The cashier was crushed under the titantic rump as the man who was buying a product was captured between two voluptuous cheeks as Chun-Li shifted around, panicing without noticing she positioned her massive rump in the direction of the people.  The man glasped between two cheeks was raised up as he was stuck in a small fabric tear of her hose and couldn't help get a notice of the situation and gain an erection which he tried to enjoy himself and thrust it deeper in her massive rump but lost his grip in the clothing and was sucked under, deep into the crevice of the cheeks.  \"Merrmph!\"  Chun-Li exclaimed as her rear slowed for the moment in growth, but seemed to grow each time a victim was claimed according to the size!</span></div></div>",

Wendy was once again being teased by her siblings who, despite not being much taller than her themselves, insisted on calling her short. Wendy quickly got fed up with the teasing, and ran to her father's throne room in a tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DADDY!\" Wendy yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Wendy?\" Bowser responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SICK OF THE OTHERS CALLING ME SHORT! MAKE ME BIGGER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser began to think it over. He quickly came up with a perfect evil plan: He would grow Wendy to a colossal size and have her destroy the Mario bros once and for all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Wendy, I'll make you big. But you have to do something for me afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Okay daddy, I'll do it! Just make me bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sweety. Here's the deal: I'm gonna make you grow 50 feet tall, then you go and destroy those pesky plumbers once and for all! Do that, and you can stay huge for as long as you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy simply nodded her head in agreement. Bowser the pulled out a magikoopa's wand and aimed it at his daughter. The wand shot a blast of green energy which struck Wendy. She immediately began to feel the effects of the magic. Her body was tingling all over, and it felt absolutely amazing. Suddenly, her body began to grow to monumental proportions. She continued to grow until she reached the amazing height of 50 feet tall. She looked down to her feet and saw her father looking up at her in awe. She simply smiled at her new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you daddy! The view is amazing from up here! I love being this huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good, sweety. Now remember your end of the deal! You have to eliminate the Mario bros once and for all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Wendy do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello there! With my first GTS Interactive, I wanted to see what I\u00b4m able to write and I also wanted to learn how to create a GTS Interactive. And of course, my first one was flawed. Well, this time, I\u00b4m trying to get rid of my former mistakes. Now, the instructions:<br>\r\n1. Needless to say, no sexual content or adult language, okay?<br>\r\n2. You might have guessed: I\u00b4m into the vore thing; and you could see that in my first one. So, you can bet that I\u00b4ll create vore scenes in this one as well (I hope you\u00b4ll do that, too ;) ).<br>\r\nBut I\u00b4m trying to use more exposition, explanations and dialogue in order to stay true to the characters. So, I won\u00b4t start directly with a vore scene, exposition comes first.<br>\r\n3. Another problem in my former story: too many choices. This time, I\u00b4ll reduce the number of gals. I didn\u00b4t choose the available girls yet (coming soon), but in any case there will be the ones from DoA and Final Fantasy.<br>\r\n4. Most importantly: the setting. That\u00b4s no problem with Final Fantasy, there are already huge worlds from the games you can use, but in some other games, it\u00b4s a more complicated thing. So I\u00b4ll allow to create your own worlds for some stories; your own setting, in case there isn\u00b4t much explained in the game.<br>\r\n5. Vore: yes, please! But: no chewing, no digestion!<br>\r\n6. Be creative! Have Fun!<br>\r\nUpdate! In case you\u00b4re going to add chapters: please, for god\u00b4s sake, try to use decent grammar and spelling or punctuation marks! My English is bad, I know, but at least I\u00b4m trying, and you\u00b4re supposed to as well. Thanks!</td>",
