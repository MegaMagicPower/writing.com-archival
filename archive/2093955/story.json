            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year is 2012 and Susan is a 44 year old women with a 22 year old son, John. Her husband and John\u2019s father, Bob, died on 9/11 when John was 12. Her brother Jeff joined the army right after 9/11. Now that John was done with college, he wanted to join the army like his uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate John went through basic and was shipped off to Afghanistan. By some chance one of his squad mates was his uncle, now a sergeant. About a month after arriving, John, Bob and several other soldiers were on patrol when they came under fire from several Taliban fighters. The soldiers called in an air strike and killed all the Taliban. As the soldiers regrouped, they discovered that John and Bob were missing. They found both John and Bob dead at the end of the street. At their funeral Susan vowed to have her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a job at a government research facility and decided to make a growth potion in secret. Soon she met a nice man named Robert and the two started going out. After about a year of dating, they ran off to Vegas to get married. About a month later Susan found out that she was pregnant. A few months into it, she found out that they were going to have twins. On August 1st 2014, she gave birth to healthy baby boy and girl. Robert and Susan decided to name their kids Matthew and Amanda. Everything was going great for the new family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it is August 2016, and Susan had just finished her potion. Matthew and Amanda had just had their second birthday. These kids loved playing with bugs and toys like they were giants. This gave Susan the idea to have her kids grew into giants with her to help with her revenge. That night she told Robert her plan for revenge. Robert wanted to go along because he had always longed to be giant. Susan had to go to Afghanistan to help with some projects her lab was doing over there. She was able to convince her boss to let her husband come to help and the kids to come along as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the family got there the parents got to work and left their kids at the nursery inside the lab. They were done with the projects within a week. The night before they were scheduled to fly out, Susan and Robert set their plan in motion. Susan poured the growth potion into their night coffee and into the kids\u2019 sippy cups. Susan said that it will take a little bit to take effect. They put the kids to bed after they finished their sippy cups and had their diapers changed. Once Susan and Robert were finished with their coffee, they went to bed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got up the next morning, they packed up like there were going to the airport. Susan made sure to pack some extra diapers, wipes, and powder for the kids. They got into the car and drove off. Instead of going to the airport, they drove off into the desert. Robert told the kids that they had a surprise for them. The kids smiled with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they all started feeling tingly. Susan pulled over and they all got out. She quickly grabbed the diaper bag out of the back and told the kids to close their eyes. As they did, all four of them started to grow. The kids\u2019 onesies started to rip as they couldn\u2019t keep up with the growing toddlers. The same was happening to Susan\u2019s and Robert\u2019s clothes as well. Soon enough their outer clothes ripped. They kept growing until the twins were 200 feet tall and the parents were 400 feet tall. Matthew was clad in only his blue diaper, Amanda in only a pink diaper, Susan in her black lace bra and panties, Robert in his gray boxers. The diaper bag and supplies also grew with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert told the twins that they could open their eyes. When they did, the twins were wondering when their surprise was going to come. Then they noticed that they were wearing just their diapers. Then they noticed that there was a small city out in the distance. Susan knelt down and said that we got some new toys for you guys. Go ahead and have fun. They squealed with joy and walked over to the city. Susan and Robert smiled. Susan lifted up her foot and stomped on the car. She laughed as it crushed beneath her foot. Susan and Robert walked after their kids. The kids reached the city and their parents sat down to watch the kids\u2019 playtime. What do the twins do first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matthew and Amanda loved playing as monsters. Many in the city just stared at the diaper wearing giants. Matthew unleashed a loud toddler roar. This sent the little people running in panic. Amanda stepped on a small house and giggled as it crumbled. Matthew stepped over a house and then sat down. He giggled as the house collapsed beneath his diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew stood up and the two looked down at a group of little bugs and smiled. These people started running in a mass panic. The two giants started chasing after them, leaving footprints in the street. Amanda stepped over onto a side street. Once she passed the group, she turned and smashed through a building. The people were trapped between the two giants. Amanda lifted up her foot and stomped it down on the crowd, squishing several people. Matthew stomped on a few more. They both giggled as they squished these tiny people. The bugs screamed as a toddler\u2019s foot came down and flattened them like pancakes. It hardly took a minute for all the people to be squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they squished these people, the buildings stayed standing. Matthew had an idea to change that. He walked over to one side of the street. He yelled, \u201cWatch this\u201d to his sister. He started walking along and stomping on buildings. These buildings didn\u2019t put up any resistance. Amanda smiled and walked over to the buildings on the other side of the street. She started walking along after her brother. Dozens of buildings were crushed on both sides of the street. The two toddlers just giggled at the easiness of causing such destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants noticed several dozen people nearby. They walked over to these people and quickly trapped them. Matthew reached down and grabbed a few terrified people. He smiled at them and said he had a place to save them. He proceeded to open the waistband of his diaper and dropped them inside. He giggled as the bugs squirmed inside. Amanda picked up a few herself and too dropped them into her diaper. The two toddlers kept going until they both had dozens trapped in their diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey noticed nearby buildings that were about knee high to them. They ripped off the roofs and got into a squat above the buildings. The tiny people just stared at the skulls on Matthew\u2019s diaper or strawberries on Amanda\u2019s diaper. Then they could hear what sounded like a waterfall and people screaming. The toddlers unleashed gallons of pee into their diapers. Then Amanda pushed a log into her diaper. She pushed several more logs into her diaper until it was sagging into the building. All inside Amanda\u2019s diaper were dead, but there were a few survivors in Matthew\u2019s diaper. They put their full weight on the buildings and giggled as the buildings crumbled and crushed everybody inside their diapers. They stood up and giggled at their used diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey noticed the tall buildings of the city center. Amanda challenged Matthew to a race to the city center. Matthew suggested that they could race and smash buildings at the same time. His sister just smiled in agreement. They walked over to an area that had a line of several dozen building for each of them. The height of these building ranged from reaching about hallway up their diapers to being level with their tummies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first building for both kids was the shortest of all. Their diapers were pressed up against these buildings. The people inside the top floors were gagging from the smell of the kids massive diapers. The kids ripped the roofs off the buildings and smiled at the bugs inside. Amanda said go and they smashed through the buildings, giggling as the buildings crumbled. They kept skipping along smashing buildings. The people in the floors that were level with their diapers got a quick view and sniff of their diapers before they smashed through the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew smashed into the city center first and yelled \"I win\". Amanda just smiled and sat down on a building, and it crumbled beneath her. Matthew targeted a building that reached his knees. He got down on his knees, put his hands on the building, pushed down, and the building crumbled. They both got up and smiled as both of them destroyed another building by pulling it towards them. Amanda pushed another building to the ground. Matthew knelt down and slammed his fist on another building. Then he backhanded another building and swung his hand forward, destroying another building. Amanda walked down the street a bit and swung her hand back. Her hand smashed through a few buildings. Matthew did the same thing. The people on the ground were running. Amanda just smiled and shoved a building, this created a domino effect. Adam did the same thing on the other side of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of buildings were destroyed and the rubble trapped the citizens. The two giants walked over to their trapped toys. The people looked up at the giant kids\u2019 sagging diapers. Amanda smiled at the little bugs and stepped over the group of bugs. Matthew turned around and patted his diapered butt. Amanda sat down and giggled as several people squished beneath her full diaper. Matthew sat down squishing several more. The two took turns sitting down and crushing people. It only took a couple times for all the people to be squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert and Susan were watching this the whole time. They walked to the other side of the city and called for their kids to come over. Matthew and Amanda quickly ran over, smashing many buildings in the process, into their parent\u2019s arms. Both parents soon could smell the odor of a full diaper. \u201cSomeone made a stinky in their diaper\u201d, said Susan. They checked both diapers and realized both needed changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over to the last few buildings still standing. The parents lay the kids down on top of these building and the toddlers just giggled. Susan got the supplies and handed some to Robert. Both of them undid the tapes on the diapers and used the diapers to clean the kids up as best they could. They slid the diapers out and finished cleaning the kids with a few wipes. They sprinkled on the baby powder and slid the clean diapers beneath them. They pulled the front of the diapers onto the kid\u2019s waists and taped them on tight. Robert and Susan lifted their kids back on their feet. Since the current city was destroyed, they pointed out another city and said have fun. They put the diapers in the city dump and followed their kids to their new toy city.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their \u2018toys\u2019 were staring at the massive toddlers paralyzed with fear. Matt and Amanda stepped forward, both smashing through a building. They giggled and yelled out \u201cbwilding go boom\u201d. This sent the citizens running in panic. The two toddlers just smiled and started walking after their running toys. What they didn\u2019t know was that there were several squads of Taliban in this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the street, they started feeling something hitting their legs. Looking down they saw a man with an AK shooting bullets at them. These bullets were doing nothing but annoy these giant toddlers. Matthew looked down and picked up this little bug and he dropped his gun. Matthew brought the toy to his face. \u201cYou mean, you go into diapa.\u201d With that he opened up the diaper and dropped the toy inside it. He giggled as the bug squirmed inside his diaper. The bullets kept hitting their legs. These two started ripping apart buildings looking for who was shooting at them. Whenever Matthew or Amanda found one, he/she took away the gun and shoved the toy into his/her diaper. When the shooting finally stopped, both of them had a few dozen people in their diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda felt a gurgling in her stomach and wrapped her arms around it. She turned to her brother and said that she needed to go potty. As if on cue, Matthew felt a similar gurgling in his stomach. \u201cI gotta go potty to.\u201d They both walked over to a building that was half their size. They ripped off the roof and smiled at the petrified people inside. Then they turned around and sat down on the buildings. The people screamed as the cloudy sky was replaced by a blue or pink diaper. Matthew and Amanda started peeing into the diapers. The people inside tried swimming, but half of them drowned. The two smiled and then released a massive fart making people inside the diaper and building gag. Then they both pushed a massive turd into their diapers, killing several people. Several more were pushed into their diapers. The diapers were sagging so much that they pinned the people in the building to the floor. They didn\u2019t have to suffer long as the building started to creek and collapsed into rubble. The people inside the building were dead. Somehow, half the toys inside the diapers were alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert and Susan were watching the entire time from outside the city. They walked over to their kids, making sure not to cause much damage. Robert looked at the kids and said, \u2018wow both babyzillas filled their diapers.\u201d Matthew and Amanda just smiled their innocent toddler smile at their parents. \u201cLet\u2019s get your diapers changed.\u201d Robert picked up Matthew and Susan picked up Amanda. They carried the kids over to an undamaged portion of the city. They set the toddlers down, crushing a few buildings. Susan set down the diaper bag and got out a pink diaper, wipes and powder for Amanda. They she got out some more wipes, powder, and a blue diaper for Matthew and handed them to Robert. They both unfolded the clean diapers and slid them beneath the kids\u2019 old diapers. They unfolded the old diapers and lowered them to the ground. They were surprised when they saw that half of the toddlers\u2019 diaper toys survived. They picked up the toys and set them aside and made sure they didn\u2019t escape. They cleaned up the kids with the old diapers and wipes. Then they put the wipes in the old diaper and slid it out from beneath the kids. They sprinkled on the baby powder and redid the Velcro on the diapers on tight. They lifted the kids up to their feet and said, \u201cBabies are all clean\u201d. The kids sat down and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they packed up the supplies, grabbed the toys that were in the diapers and the old diapers. Robert and Susan dropped the old diapers into the dump. They smiled at the toys in their hands. \u201cYou insignificant bugs tried to hurt our babies. Now you guys can change their diapers for the future\u201d yelled Susan. With that they tossed the toys into the diaper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they noticed that the Afghan army was coming towards them because the Americans had already left. The tanks started firing at the giants. Their shells did nothing. Robert and Susan just laughed. \u201cShould we have fun with these bugs\u201d yelled Robert. Susan nodded her head and smiled. The commander came out of the tank and ordered for their surrender. The giants just laughed and Susan stomped on the tank, killing everyone inside. The two started stomping on tank after tank until every last one was flattened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers started firing their rifles with no effect. The giant just laughed and smiled. Susan said that she had an idea as she removed her panties exposing her wet pussy. Robert smiled and removed his boxers exposing his hard dick. They both grabbed several soldiers. Susan shoved her captives up her pussy and Robert started rubbing the people on his dick. The squirming of the soldiers were driving both giants wild and making them moan in pleasure. The force of their pleasure seeking caused the soldiers to be crushed. This didn\u2019t slow the giants as they grabbed more sex toys. They kept going until they both climaxed, soaking the survivors in their sex juices. The smiled at the people and told them that their friends were awesome. They put their underwear back on and dropped the toys inside. They gasped as the bugs squirmed inside. They walked back to just outside the city and continued watching their kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

They giggled as they saw many columns of smoke from destroyed buildings climbing into the sky. The two toddlers started following their own group of around 100 people. The ground was shaking from their footfalls. Then both groups turned a sharp corner to try to get away. They found themselves on a street blocked by rubble and their giant pursuers blocked the way they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew was smiling at the little bugs. These people had no idea what this giant toddler was thinking. Then Matthew turned around and sat down.  The little bugs screamed as they watched a blue diaper coming towards them. There was a loud crunch as several people were squished by his diapered butt. He just giggled and yelled out \u201cToys squishy\u201d. He stood back up and yelled out \u201cmeet diapa\u201d and sat down again. Several more people were crushed making him giggle. He stood up and sat down again. The last thing his victims saw was his blue diaper before becoming pancakes on the street. After a few more times of doing this, he turned back around to face the remnants. Only about a dozen were alive. He picked these people up and dropped them into his diaper. He giggled as they squirmed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Amanda did her own thing with her toys. She was smiling at them when her stomach growled. She rubbed her tummy and sat down. \u201cHungwy\u201d, she yelled and smiled at her snacks. These people were panicking, but trapped. Amanda picked up one little morsel and brought it to her face. The person screamed, begged, and even offered to change her diaper. Amanda ignored the bug and shoved it into her mouth. She let out a loud mmmm as she tasted her meal. Then she tilted her head back and swallowed the bug whole. The people screamed as they watched a bulge appear in her throat and slide into her stomach. Amanda started shoving handfuls into her mouth and eating them. It only took a couple minutes to eat them all. She smiled and rubbed her belly as her meal squirmed inside her. Within a few minutes the 100 people were mush within her belly. She burped loudly and said that the people were yummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew walked over to Amanda. He giggled with Amanda at the fact that she ate her toys. Amanda giggled when she saw his blood stained diaper. Amanda stood up and they both looked over the city. They both stomped down on a nearby building which collapsed into rubble. They giggled and yelled out \u201cthis be fun\u201d and started stomping forward. With each step they stomped on another building. They occasionally would stomp on a little bug. After a while, much of the city was destroyed. Once again, they both trapped another 100 bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew suggested that Amanda should sit on the little bugs because it\u2019s fun. Matthew\u2019s stomach growled. Amanda told him that the toys were yummy and that he should eat them. Amanda started sitting on her captives and Matthew was eating his. Both were having fun. Amanda grabbed the last few survivors and shoved them into her pink diaper. Matthew was sitting on the street and rubbing his full tummy. Then he let out a loud burp. They both started rubbing their eyes and then they let out a big yawn. When Robert and Susan saw this, they walked over to the two kids. \u201cLooks like its nap time\u201d said Robert. They picked up the two kids. They smiled when they saw that both of them had blood stained on their diapers. \u201cLooks like our little ones had some big fun\u201d, yelled Susan. They carried the twins over to the last few buildings still standing. They set the kids down destroying the last few buildings in the city. At the same time, those in their diapers were crushed. The kids calmly fell asleep amongst the ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert and Susan still had people in their underwear that were alive. Susan smiled when she saw a bigger bulge in Robert\u2019s underwear. \u201cLooks like somebody is horny\u201d she said smiling. Robert grabbed her and pulled her in for a kiss and they started making out. After a few minutes, Susan pulled away and asked to wait a minute. They walked over to a small village nearby. The people started up at the massive giants. Susan smiled and lay down on her back crushing most of the village. Both of them took off their underwear and grabbed the soldiers that were inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked at the soldiers in his and Susan\u2019s hands. \u201cThis is going to be fun with you guys\u201d. Susan shoved her captives into her pussy and Robert put his on his dick. The captives on Robert\u2019s dick struggled to hold onto the pulsing piece of meat. Robert held back and rammed his dick into Susan\u2019s wet pussy. He kept humping; making the ground shake each time. The squirming of the soldiers were driving both giants wild and making them moan in pleasure. The force of their pleasure seeking caused the soldiers to be crushed. This didn\u2019t slow the giants as they grabbed more sex toys. They kept going until they both climaxed, soaking the survivors in their sex juices. Robert rolled off of Susan, crushing the last few buildings and survivors. He looked over at Susan and smiled. Between pants he said \u201cthat was awesome\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they lay there panting a sperm met an egg inside Susan\u2019s pussy. When Susan found out she was pregnant again, she was ecstatic, as well as Robert when she told him. The twins were also happy when Susan told them. They walked to another city with their twins. Instead of having the twins destroy the city, they had the people worship them. They live outside the city for the nine months that she was pregnant. She gave birth to another healthy baby boy. They named him Samuel. The twins absolutely adored their little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Robert let the twins play with the city. Matthew and Amanda start stomping on buildings. After a while, they were getting tired. Susan and Robert lay them down for a nap. Looking at the destruction the kids caused, Susan joked that it would be great if we could repair the damage our kids caused so they could play forever. On cue, the destruction caused by the toddlers was instantly repaired. Susan and Robert stared in amazement. \"Must be a side effect of the potion we drank\", said Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Robert cared for Samuel and the twins outside the city. The twins perfected the art of the rampage in this city. When they were done, Susan would instantly repair the damage so they could continue their playtime. They kept this up until Samuel was 18 months old and the twins were just over 4. Samuel stood at 150 feet tall. The twins were 250 feet tall and still in diapers because there was no point to potty train them when there is no toilet big enough for them. Now Susan and Robert felt that Samuel was old enough to play with the twins. The twins had destroyed the city again and it was time for bed, so Susan and Robert put the three kids down for the night.</span></div></div>",

The twins were clean, but Sammy\u2019s diaper was wet. Robert had the captives inside the diaper bag change Sammy. Sammy squished all of the little people when they finished. Robert put all the supplies back into the diaper bag. With the city destroyed the family started walking along an abandoned road to find a new city. They came across the city of Jalalabad. The parents stomped around the city being sure nobody could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tiny people saw the giants, they all began to panic. Susan and Robert told their kids to have fun. A jet flew by and Robert snatched it out of the air and crushed it in his hand. The kids saw that the airport was a few steps away and walked over to it. Sammy stepped on the runway preventing any planes form taking off. He started walking down the runway and started stomping on any planes he found. Mattie and Amanda walked to the terminals. Mattie smashed through part of the building and Amanda did the same. The twins walked around crushing the terminals and planes sitting at the gates. When Sammy had finished crushing planes, he walked around crushing anything he found. He walked over to the control tower and sat down crushing the building beneath his diaper. The entire airport area had been destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins walked over to Sammy and looked around at the destruction. The twins asked if Sammy had fun and he nodded his head. Sammy stood up and the three walked over to the main city. They each smashed through another building and giggled. A group of people began running away. The kids started walking after them. Mattie was able to jump over the group, knocking them down and crushing a few buildings. Mattie told Sammy that it\u2019s fun to have toys in their diapers. Sammy started scooping people up and shoving them in his diaper until dozens were trapped inside. He sat down, squishing nobody, and giggled as the toys squirmed inside. Amanda and Mattie walked around scooping people up and shoving them into their diapers until they had dozens inside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids got up and walked over to each other. Then Sammy felt pressure inside him and ripped off the roof of a nearby building. He squatted above the building. The people screamed as a diaper with skull prints came towards them. A log poked out of his butt and the people in his diaper panicked. The turd fell into the diaper, killing several people and making the diaper sag. Several more turds were pushed into his diaper killing many inside his diaper. The diaper sagged into the building, pinning the people inside the building to the floor. They weren\u2019t suffering long as the building groaned and collapsed to the ground. A crunch sounded when Sammy landed on the ground as everybody inside his diaper were squished. \u201cBwugs and bding squishy by diapa\u201d, said Sammy. Amanda went to get Robert, smashing through several buildings, and told him Sammy had a full diaper. Robert came over with the diaper bag and picked up Sammy. He lay Sammy down nearby, crushing a few buildings, and began changing him into a clean skull printed diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their dad was changing Sammy, the twins continued exploring/destroying the city. Then Mattie and Amanda felt pressure inside. They both targeted a building that reached a little past their knees. They ripped the roofs off and squatted onto the buildings. Mattie\u2019s victims looked up at his skull diaper and Amanda\u2019s victims were staring at strawberries on her diaper. Both of them began peeing into their diapers. Some trapped inside tried swimming in piss but in was no use and they all drowned. Then the twins began pushing and grunting and a log poked out of their butts. The logs fell into the seats of their diapers and the diapers sagged a bit. They pushed several more logs into their diapers. When they were done, everybody inside their diapers were dead. The diapers were sagging into the buildings and pinning people to the floor. They weren\u2019t suffering long as the buildings crumbled, squishing all the bugs inside their diapers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins giggled and stood back up. Robert and Susan noticed their diapers sagging several feet. They walked over to the twins and smiled. \u201cLooks like these two babyzillas have filled up their diapers\u201d, said Robert. \u201cLet\u2019s get those diapers changed\u201d said Susan. Robert picked up Mattie and Susan picked by Amanda. They carried the kids to an undamaged portion of the city. They set the kids down, both crushing several buildings. Susan got out some wipes, powder, a strawberry printed diaper for Amanda amd a skull printed diaper for Mattie. They slid the clean diapers beneath the proper giant. They undid the Velcro and lowered the used diapers off their kids. They just smiled as they saw the squished bodies inside the diapers. They cleaned the kids up, making sure to get all the human remains and waste out of their crevasses. They put the wipes inside the diapers and slid the diapers out. They sprinkled powder onto the kids and folded the clean diapers onto the kids. Robert and Susan packed up the supplies and lifted the kids to their feet. They told the kids to have fun and grabbed the old diapers and tossed them into the city dump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the twins were playing and going potty, Robert finished changing Sammy\u2019s diaper. Sammy got up and saw a large group running away from him. He started stomping after them, leaving a footprint in the street with each step. One person tripped and starred up at the giant toddler. He smiled and stepped on the little bug and giggled as he squished. He kept walking, squishing several people with each step. He was just giggling away as the little bugs squished beneath his feet. It only took a little while to squish all the little bugs. He started smashing through buildings as he walked over to his family. He got there just as Robert and Susan had finished changing the twins\u2019 diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids were smiling as they looked round the city at the fun they could have. Mattie stomped down on a nearby building. Amanda smashed her fist through a building. Sammy sat down on a building and giggled as the building crumbled. Amanda walked over to another building and gave it a \u2018light\u2019 shove. That building collapsed into the building next to it and that building crashed into the building next to it. The chain reaction continued until dozens of buildings were destroyed. Mattie and Sammy did the same thing with their own line of buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, all three kids\u2019 tummies growled. Amanda told Sammy that the toys were really yummy. Each of them chased after their own group of little bugs. The little people eventually were trapped by rubble. Sammy picked up a little bug and lifted it up to his face. The bug was begging for Sammy to let it live. Sammy just smiled as he tossed the bug into his mouth. He smiled as he tilted his head back and swallowed the bug whole. \u201cMMMmm bug yummy\u201d, Sammy yelled. All the kids started shoveling people into their mouths until all of them were eaten. They just sat there smiling and patting their bellies as the bugs squirmed in their bellies. After a few minutes the squirming stopped as all the bugs were mush in their bellies. After this the kids went on a rampage around the city until the entire city was rubble.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Jalalabad destroyed, Robert and Susan picked their kids up and began walking towards a new city. A little while later, the family came across Surobi. They put the kids down and said have fun. The kids started walking and destroyed the town within a few minutes. They kept walking towards Kabul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them about an hour and a half to reach the city. When they did, the boys walked over to the Ahmed Shah Babba Meena neighborhood. The girls stayed in a neighborhood northeast of Kabul. The parents went to the nearby prison. The ripped off the roof and told the guards to leave. They grabbed all the prisoners and dropped them into the diaper bag. The parents walked around the city blocking any roads out and damaging the airport runway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was smiling. She walked over to a packed parking lot nearby. She lifted up her foot and stomped on a few cars. She giggled as the cars crunched. She lifted her other foot and stepped on more cars. She sat down and crushed a few more beneath her diaper. Then she rolled over onto her hands and knees and started crawling. Her hands and knees crushing more cars. When there were only a few left, she put them into her diaper. She got onto her feet and walked over to the buildings and stomped them all into rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the next area of buildings. The place was abandoned, but there were plenty of buildings. Again she started stomping on the buildings. Then she fell forward onto her hands and knees, leveling a few buildings. She began crawling around destroying any building she came across. After a few minutes of crawling she fell back onto her butt. The cars and another building were crushed. She got up, bent over, and smashed her hand through a building. She lay down on her tummy and crushed a few buildings. Then she rolled around and crushed any building still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Amanda walked over to Dehkhuda Dad. She saw many panicked little people on the street. She started walking after the people, scooping them up, and shoving them into her diaper. She was giggling as they squirmed inside her diaper. Then she needed to go potty. She got into a squat and began peeing into her diaper. Many tried swimming in piss, but to no avail. Then she began pushing and a turd dotted with remains poked out of her butt. Her victims panicked as the turd landed into her diaper, killing several people. She pushed several more logs into the diaper. Then she fell onto her butt, crushing a building and all the people inside her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and walked after a group of little people. She smashed a building into the street and stepped over the little bugs. They were trapped and at the mercy of a four-year old girl. She turned around and squatted above the little bugs. She fell down and there was a crunch as several people squished beneath her diaper. She giggled as she felt bugs crunch beneath her. She got up a bit, she yelled \u201cbugs meet diaper\u201d and sat down again. She got up again and said, \u201cDiaper squish wittle bugs\u201d as she sat down again. She kept doing this until all the toys were stains on her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan walked until she was standing just outside the neighborhood with dozens of building between her and Amanda. She held her hands out and said come to mommy big girl. Amanda stood up and walked up to the nearest building. She started walking and smashing through buildings with each step. She walked into Susan\u2019s arms. Susan just smiled as she looked at the destruction caused by her \u2018little\u2019 girl. Then she could smell something pretty bad. She slid her hand down Amanda\u2019s back and cupped the seat of her diaper feeling the big bulge. She pulled out of the hug and put the back of her hand against the front of Amanda\u2019s diaper and felt it was soaking wet. \u201cMy big girl needs diaper change\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up Amanda and then lay her down onto a few buildings. She giggled as buildings crumbled, and as she smashed several more building when she spread her legs to be changed. Susan took out the changing supplies and prisoners she and Robert caught earlier and told them to change Amanda. The bugs undid the Velcro and let the diaper fall down and gagged at the sight and smell of human waste and remains. They cleaned her up with the diaper and wipes and slid the diaper out. They slid a clean diaper beneath her and sprinkled on baby powder. Then pulled the front up and re-did the velcro on her diaper. Susan was pleased with them and packed up the bugs and supplies for the next change. Amanda rampaged around the neighborhood until it was completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew and Sammy walked up to the empty prison. Sammy started crushing the prison building beneath his diaper while his older brother destroyed the wall. Then they walked over to the town. Matthew roared at the people at their feet and started stepping on buildings. Sammy started crawling through buildings. Both boys started stepping after their own group of people until they were trapped by rubble. They both turned around, sat down, and giggled as several bugs crushed beneath their diapers. The last their victims saw were the skulls on the kids diapers before being flattened like pancakes. It took a few bounces for all the bugs to be squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stood up and giggled at the sight of their blood stained diapers. The kids both bent over and smashed a hand through a small building. Sammy grabbed a nearby car and rolled it down the street. The car careened into another building and Sammy giggled. Matthew picked up a small house and dropped it on another destroying both. They both started kicking and smashing their hands through buildings. When there were only a few buildings left, the two boys sat down and crushed the buildings beneath their diapers. They walked over to Susan and Amanda just as the toys finished changing Amanda\u2019s diaper. The family looked over Kabul thinking of the destructive fun the giant toddlers could have.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am pregnant again.\" She said the with a smile, as she is super happy now. Robert then smiled for her as well and then another thing just came up to his mind. \"You know something, I was wondering, maybe the Middle East was just the start. Perhaps we can take over the entire world with our giant family, and have the entire world bow down to our incredible will.\" And Susan replied. \"That would be great. Besides, why do just this city if we can do the entire world. Let's tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the parents then went back into the city, where they saw both of the kids were getting finished with destroying the whole town as if they were playing with the toys. The parents were really smiling at them and said. \"You know, this is just one toy town, they are many toy towns around the world that is just waiting to be discovered.\" Susan smiled as she tells the kid. \"And we are going to as a family take over the entire world.\" The kids then got really excited and jumped with joy as they heard about a \"take over the world\" scheme. For the next several hours, any remaining survivors were forced to worship them as if they were there gods. 9 months later, they gave birth to a baby girl name Aisha, and she was 150ft tall. Then came the day that they start heading towards a new city, to begin their domination tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is the first city they are invading?</span></div></div>",
