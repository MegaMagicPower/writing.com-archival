Until the last great war happened. A global conflict that ended up destroying society to its very foundations and leaving very few survivors. Hundreds of years later the world has recovered from the disaster, nature has reclaimed the ruined cities covering everything the eye could see. After the great disaster people had to reorganize and they did so in tribes. Nowadays, family is dictated by the tribe you belong to and each of its members are to be considered brothers or sisters. Each tribe is unique and has a determinate way of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich tribe do you belong to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep in mind there are humans in all the tribes.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are known as the proudest of all the tribes. They rely on their sharp senses to track their prey and their brutal unarmed combat and weapons to kill their adversaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCanids are very good at tracking and surrounding their enemies.

They are known to be the most inventive and resourceful of all the tribes. Having also a special interest over the performing arts (music, dance and theater). They use all sorts of long-range weapons and traps to defend their territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Murids have an exceptional sense of orientation and moving in tight dark spaces. For this reason, they travel in the sewers and through abandoned buildings of the cities in search of resources they can use and a safe place to stablish their homes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeporids are incredible agile, being able to jump to great heights, move at great speed and give bone breaking kicks with their powerful legs. Not to mention their great hearing range, ideal to detect danger. They have a great appreciation for music and dance. Their homes are basically big burrows, connected with on another, forming an enormous web of households in the underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSciurids are innate climbers, able to jump from tree to tree at vertiginous speed. They are good at finding all sorts of valuable objects, trading and have a great appreciation of visual arts, reason why they also make handicrafts. They make their homes up in giant trees and connect them to each other by bridges. These are ideal to keep vigilance over the territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans are not something to mess with. Given the great quantity of resources their seulnian brothers and sisters collect, they can create an enormous variety of artifacts, tools, mechanisms and of course, lethal traps and guns. Even the strongest and most brutal of all seulnians should think twice before confronting directly a human with a gun and good hand/eye coordination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurids, leporids, sciurids and humans collaborate with each other by distributing their resources and doing expeditions together. This union is accomplished by stablishing safe routes and underground passages that connect the cities, their periphery and the nearby forests. This way is easier for everyone to move from one place to another and keep in touch. Not for nothing they are all from the same tribe. It\u2019s very hard not to find members of all this families in the same place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, humans don\u2019t have the natural agility their seulnian brothers and sisters have, making them inefficient for expeditions. To solve this problem the seulnians resorted to carry their human brothers and sisters in their backs to not leave them behind. Given their natural strength, the weight of the humans is not a problem but rather how many humans can they carry on their backs before running out of space. Seulnians don't mind one bit doing this and even encourage it, but it\u2019s understandable if there are humans who aren't comfortable with this solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the protagonist?</div></span></div></div>",

They go wherever they want and leave as they please. They make incredible messengers, deliverers and bombers. If someone needs something to be delivered somewhere, they can surely do the job. They use bombs and long-range weapons to defend themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirds fly through the skies with grace, traveling great distances in a short amount of time. They can carry heavy objects in mid-flight without losing stability. Unfortunately, not all the birds can flight in the darkness of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiropterans for their part share a lot of similarities with the birds, except for the fact that they can use echolocation to \u201csee\u201d in the dark, prefer to fly at night (ideal for night watch), sleep hanging in the ceilings upside down and can fold their wings like capes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans craft all kinds of bombs to use against their enemies and long-range guns. Considering that humans are the only ones in the tribe who can\u2019t fly, they must resort to be carried by their seulnian brother and sisters on their backs. This way not only they can accompany them but also provide support with their guns or smoke bombs to lose their enemies. Of course, humans also use parachutes, because you never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone lives at the base and on top of the mountains by building enormous structures that are partially inside the mountains and the part that\u2019s outside is a huge platform that serves as an \u201cairport\u201d to birds and chiropterans where they come and go to make their deliveries to other settlements and to prepare their equipment for expeditions or possible battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the protagonist?</span></div></div>",

As for their offense, they use medium, long-range and heavy weapons to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquines despite their heavy muscular bodies move quite fast, can carry incredible amounts of weight and can endure a lot of physical stress, allowing them to use heavy armors and weapons for battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCervids are agile and can tackle their enemies with their big horns. They usually wear light armor and mid-range weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBovines body types vary from light to heavy. Depending on their species they can either wear light or heavy armors and wield light or heavy weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans make talented blacksmiths, responsible for creating all kinds of durable armors and weapons. The also are involved in the architectural designs of the buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all live in walled cities. Within the walls there are all kinds of architectural wonders. Among these, the greats archives stand out, containing the knowledge of the old world. Unfortunately for them, a lot of it is missing.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not hard to notice they are very distrusting of strangers, reason why they only open the gates of their cities to trade with reliable merchants and to send expedition groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the protagonist?</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><div align=\"justify\">Welcome to the post-apocalyptic world of Phanros where humans and Seulnians (really big anthropomorphic animals) try to live their lives in the 5 different tribes that rule the lands of the new world, facing all sorts of troubles and trying to stay together in mist of uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are some things that are important to consider before adding content<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What are Seulnians?<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nSeulnian is just the term used to refer to all the anthropomorphic animals that inhabit the world. There are so many species that is better to classify them in families or classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>How many families or classes compose the seulnians?<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nThe are 10 families and 2 classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Canidae (Dogs, wolves, foxes, Jackals, etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Felidae (House cats, Ocelots, Tigers, Panthers, etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Hyaenidae (Hyenas)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Leporidae (Rabbits and Hares),<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Muridae (Rats and Mice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sciuridae (Squirrels). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Chiroptera (Bats)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Equidae (Horses, Zebras and Donkeys)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Cervidae (Deer and Moose)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bovidae (Sheep, Goats, Impalas, etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Reptiles (Lizards, salamandres, crocodiles, frogs, etc) and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Birds (Only the flying type, like. Canaries, Howls, Parrots, Eagles, etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Is there something important to know about them?<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nAll species have their unique attributes and behaviors. Not to mention the fact that all are individuals with their own personalities. However, all Seulnians have things in common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-They are quite big in comparison to humans. Humans can barely reach their knees when standing side by side. Not to mention their great resistance, strength, speed and agility. Despite this disparity, Seulnians treat humans with the same respect they would give to one of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Compared to humans they are not very creative or innovative. Because of their natural advantages, they never had such a need to create in order to survive. Making them simple minded but not any less intelligent. They just have a hard time understanding abstractions and see the world in a more practical way. After all, why create hunting tools when you already have claws and sharp teeth? Well, humans may have a lot to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-All seulnians have an extreme behavior regarding love and hatred. They love their families with all their hearts and would do anything for them. But also, they would rip apart and drink the blood of anyone who would dare to hurt their loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-It seems very easy for seulnians to develop a great physique, even at a young age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wait, if there are anthropomorphic animals in this world then what do carnivores eat?<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nThey eat enormous bug-like creatures, which meat resemble the ones of mammals. Also, fish are still a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>If seulnians are much bigger, stronger and resistant than humans, then how can a human defend against a seulnian enemy in direct combat?<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nThe only way a human can have a fighting chance against a seulnian enemy is using weapons to attack their vital points, but not even this is a guarantee of success if the human doesn\u2019t have the strength and precision required to penetrate their thick skin and considering they can only reach the knees of the seulnians, this ends up being an unreliable method. The most effective way for a human to defend against a seulnian is with the usage of guns or stealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis vulnerability is the reason why seulnians never allow humans to participate in battles unless they have the proper equipment to fight. It\u2019s also the reason why seulnians have a sort of unwritten rule about how dishonorable and downright coward is for a seulnian to fight against an unarmed human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Some small rules:<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n-Please respect the 13+ rating. Sex, drugs or alcohol can only be implied. Violence can be shown at moderate levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The story can be narrated in 1\u00b0, 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 person. But I recommend that once it starts in one of those it remains as such. For the sake of consistency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Birds and reptiles don\u2019t have mammary glands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Birds and Chiropterans have their wings on their backs leaving their arms and hands free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Snakes are basically nagas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No species can reproduce with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are free establish the type of relationships between the tribes. Are the Copper and Silver tribes allied with each other while being enemies with the Steel tribe? Are all at peace or at war with each other?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Have fun!!!<br>\r\n</div></td>",
