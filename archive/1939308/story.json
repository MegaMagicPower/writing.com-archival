Mind control: You are able to exert your will onto others. It will work on everyone (with special exceptions) but will be very difficult to use on telepaths or magicians. For now you are limited to one person at a time and you have to focus on them. After helping the Justice League you will unlock your full power. You can then exert your control on a couple people. Also, you may enslave people permanently, but only one at a time. You will still have some trouble with telepaths but not magicians. After joining the inner circle of members you will be so powerful that nobody can resist you, and you can control several people at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Possession: You may enter another persons body and control them. It can work on telepaths and magicians fine, but anyone with a powerful will may resist you. After helping the JL you will be able to control any one person at once, and access their memories, skills and powers as well. You will also be able to create multiple spirits of yourself that share your consciousness to control multiple weak willed people at once, with no memory access. One you join the inner circle you can be inside several people, regardless of willpower, and full access to their memories and skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Shapeshifting: You are able to change your appearance to anyone or anything, with no access to memories and powers. After helping the justice league, you can use the powers  and memories of those you change into. After joining the inner circle, you will be able to change anyone or anything into anyone or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Domination: You have a sphere of influence, a silver tongue, and a powerful will. You will be more attractive to the opposite sex, and find that if you want something, people do their best to make it happen. Telepaths will resist, magicians will be immune. After helping the JL you will be able to dominate another's will, essentially making them your slave. Your influence will be larger, and your words will drip with honey. Only powerful magicians will resist. Joining the inner circle will allow you to control a large sphere of people with no natural resistance (but machines are unable to be affected.) I know this seems like a more villainous power, and that's why it would be fun to have a hero use this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Create your own! Make sure to include skills that you unlock later on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had been working a part time job as a mechanic at a amusement park. Today was the day of inspection, where all of the gears, screws, and gadgets of the park were being inspected to see if they were in optimized condition. It just happened that today was the 50th anniversary of the park, so everyone was in a hurry to finish the inspections. All seemed to be fine until... the accident happened. One of the rides, had a screw loose, which was carelessly left loose by one of mark's co-workers, david. The ride was one of the rides that was a straight drop. The screw tangled the cables in the ride and built up tension. Mark, being the good person who he was, managed to get everyone out of the ride intime. It just happened to be that there was a little girl underneath the ride. \"Get out of the way kid!!!\" Mark shouted, as he pushed the child out haems way, before being crushed by the ride. Mark saved the girl, but he was dead... several moments later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am i? What happened, and why does my head hurt so much?\" \" listen well, one known as mark fox, you have been given a second chance, for being such a kind and good-hearted soul. You have characteristics that of a true hero. From now on, you must help others in their life time, guide them, and teach the meaning and value of life to those who are lost. If you need guidance, find the one known as deadman. He too, is like you. You have a long way to go. Farewell for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are blinded by a pulsing light, to be returned to the place where you died. You see blood splattered at the very spot you died. Now a wondering soul, you decide what to do now. You walk through the park until you see a lady walking down a sidewalk, and decide to see if you can somehow try to talk with her. You try talking, doing motions, moving things, but nothing works. She can't seem to see you or hear you. Not to mention, you phase through anything you make contact with. You're about to give up and walk past her until she stumbles and you walk into her. The next thing you know, you're one the ground wondering what just happened. You look around for the lady until you realize that you are her. To be more precise, you're possessing her. \"So this is what it feels like to be a woman huh,\" you think to yourself. It's weird being a woman, as you have to adjust with the long blonde hair she has, the skirt you are currently wearing, painted finger nails, high heels, and most of all, the weight in your chest. You look to see if anyone is there, and you do a quick feel on your new body's curves and chest. \"Let's see who i am\", you say to yourself. \"Jessica halford, huh.\" After learning this, you decide to walk down the sidewalk as jessica until you run into david. He seems to be dressed out in an all black tux aith a tie, hat, and everything. \"Hey jessica\" he says to you. \"What's up david\" you autmatically reply in jessica's voice. You then realize you can look up the memory of the person's body you are currently inhabiting.  It appears that david and jessica have been dating since last year, and that they were both about to tend  your funeral. You get in the car with david and arrive at the funeral. In jessica's body, you say remarks, apologies, and comfortings to your family and friends. After completing all of your personal and fixing the things between you and david, telling david it was only an accident, you decide to leave jessica's body. You've already stayed long enough. She is left with a dumbfound expression on here face as she has no idea how and what she was doimg at the funeral in the first place.

In  the  early  1600's,  a  family  of  weavers  created  a  loom  that  could  bend  shadows  into  garments,  imbued  with  the  power  to  form  solid  shapes  from  the  shadows  themselves.

Wow, batman it talking to me!!\" you say in excitement, and suddenly recoiling at your freakishly high voice. \"Second, I'm another kid who got picked to be shazam. About 2 hours ago I woke up in an alley as a woman with powers! I came here to test them out and to do some good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman stares dead at you and says \"Well, you better come with us to the batcave.

The commissioner will deal with these two, I'll deal with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree to go to the batcave. In the cave, Catwoman, Nightwing, Oracle and a redeemed Harley Quinn are waiting. Batman decides that you can be allowed to continue and will have his funding but you have to go home and tell your parents, and, you have to test other heroes if you want to join the League or Titans. Hell, there are so many teams now. First, way before you were born there was the Justice Society, then in the 80s there was that Watchmen group and some of them are still out there, and now ths Justice League, the Doom Patrol, the Titans, it's jusy getting out of hand. Either way, you want in the League. But first, you have to go on missions with The Flash, Wonder Woman, and Superman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Hi, author's note here, in my story, here is the Justice league line up:<br>\r\nWonder woman(leader) <br>\r\nBatman<br>\r\nSuperman<br>\r\nThe Flash (Barry Allen) <br>\r\nMera (Aquaman has died in this world so she took his place)<br>\r\nMartian Man hunter <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully Shazam will join next! - Author) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go home, transform into shazam in front of your mum, dad and sister. Your mum is sceptical about it, but reluctantly agrees for you to be a hero if you keep your identity secret and you stay in the league, no other teams. Your dad, however, instantly agreed, because even though he works for Bruce Wayne, he secretly has different loyalties.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister is forced to keep your identity secret, but, she retains the right to make fun of you for turning into a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, time to be a hero.\"  you say. Who do you test first? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In 20 minutes you arrive, looking for any sign of the amazonian. Using your instinct sense, which is mistaken for hypersense by Julia, you head to the city centre, where you see Wonder woman having a face off against a group of villains, some of which aren't usually in her rogues gallery:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker<br>\r\nCaptain Cold<br>\r\nZoom<br>\r\nBlack adam<br>\r\nCheetah, the leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that she is outnumbered 5 to one. You were disguised as your normal form, so you turn into Shazam woman and run over to wonder woman. She doesn't notice you at first as you are behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, princess!\" laughed Joker. \"Joker, why are you here, and not up at Gotham in Arkham Asylum? How about you Zoom, Cold? Shouldn't you be up in central city bothering Flash instead of working with these guys!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheetah laughs, stating \"Well we do try to challenge you, Diana of Themiscira.\" wonder woman, shocked, says \"How to you know who I am!?\" \"Zoom can move faster than light, he can see you changing out of your suit. Black Adam here also had been talking to Hypolita.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... this can't be...\" says Black Adam as you step out of the Shadows and stand next to wonder Woman. \"Who the hell are you!?\" says Diana. \"I'm the new Shaz. Batman told me to come here to prove myself.\" you reply. \"Well, I clearly could use a hand, so let's see what you've got, Ms. Shazam!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you start battling the villains. You grab Black Adam and he punches you with pure fury, knocking you to the ground. Before you get back up, Zoom speed punched you, and almost breaks your ribs. But, thinking quickly, you zap him with lightning and he's instantly out of the fight. You kick Black adam on the back of his head and then he elbows you, but you turn and throw him at cheetah who is fighting wonder woman. You spy cold coming up behind you and simply crush hus freeze gun. Joker seems to have slipped away, so you go to fight Cheetah while Wonder Woman gets black adam. She tries to scratch you, but your skin is claw proof! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dead, haha\" you say with childish excitement as you pick her up and throw her away. Wonder woman finally beats Adam and then lassos the 4 of them up. Joker unfortunately escaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shazam, you've certainly proved yourself. I would have lost this today without you. Thank you.\" says wonder woman gratefully. Also, Billy told us his name to avoid saying Shazam and turning back. What do we call you, Ms.?...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Funny story, I'm a 14 year old boy called Mark Fox. I havr no idea why my version of Shazam is female, but, I guess it's worth it. It's an interesting new perspective and the powers are great. \"you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, Mark, yoh are in a funny situation talk to Batman about getting you in the league. In the mean time, I would head up to Central city and meet flash, to tell him about Cold and Zoom. See you, Mark, and good luck. \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mind control: You are able to exert your will onto others. It will work on everyone (with special exceptions) but will be very difficult to use on telepaths or magicians. For now you are limited to one person at a time and you have to focus on them. After getting your ass kicked by the Justice League you will unlock your full power. You can then exert your control on a couple people. Also, you may enslave people permanently, but only one at a time. You will still have some trouble with telepaths but not magicians. After destroying the Justice League you will be so powerful that nobody can resist you, and you can control several people at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Possession: You may enter another persons body and control them. It can work on telepaths and magicians fine, but anyone with a powerful will may resist you. After getting your ass kicked by the JL you will be able to control any one person at once, and access their memories, skills and powers as well. You will also be able to create multiple spirits of yourself that share your consciousness to control multiple weak willed people at once, with no memory access. One you beat the Justice Leage you can be inside several people, regardless of willpower, and full access to their memories and skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Shapeshifting: You are able to change your appearance to anyone or anything, with no access to memories and powers. After getting beat up, you can use the powers  and memories of those you change into. After destroying the Justice League, you will be able to change anyone or anything into anyone or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Domination: You have a sphere of influence, a silver tongue, and a powerful will. You will be more attractive to the opposite sex, and find that if you want something, people do their best to make it happen. Telepaths will resist, magicians will be immune. After getting your ass kicked you will be able to dominate another's will, essentially making them your slave. Your influence will be larger, and your words will drip with honey. Only powerful magicians will resist. Ending the Justice Leage will allow you to control a large sphere of people with no natural resistance (but machines are unable to be affected.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Create your own! Make sure to include skills that you unlock later on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet for one young man this place was his home a place he could not imagine living within and that young man name is Mark Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAged eighteen, he is white, six feet tall, brown haired and blue eyed young man who grew up in suburban Metropolis with his family in a middle income neighbourhood. His family is mostly known due to the fact his father Gary Fox is financial analyst at Wayne Enterprises a name familiar to all in the city many people suggest perhaps out of jealously that this man is corrupt and is helping himself to company funds or even cheating on his wife with an intern within the company.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Mark, his two sisters and their mother don't believe such nonsense and have simple learned to ignore such rumors even if his father has recently been buying things like there's no tomorrow. That was until a recent event that would change Mark life forever where this once easy going young man would not only find the true but also come to earn that being sometime to solve a problem you have to be a little dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all starts on Friday afternoon when Mark is out enjoying himself in the city itself. He was doing what most eighteen year old do in the city looking for girls to flirt with and enjoy himself after a working week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ticket sir?\" a bus conductor asks the day dreaming teen who fumbles around a bit in his jeans left pocket before giving his crumpled ticket to the conductor with a grin. The conductor however gives him a disapproving grunt before snapping his ticket with his machine before moving on to the next customer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look out ladies because Mark Fox is hitting the city.\" Our young man says to himself allowing himself to start day dreaming again about him making every women he meets swoon over him. He didn't see himself as a ladies man but hey guy can dream right? Yet unbeknown to Mark above the city a battle between super man and new villain was already well underway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minder I'm stopping you before you use your powers to hurt someone.\" The brave sounding super man said flying before his floating enemy. Yet the minder a villain who looked to be no more then some young man dressed in a gold and light pink super man costume simply with goes on and on like a broken man about being invisible and not even the justice league could stop him from living out his wildest fantasies!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing such a thing it left the hero no choice but to deal with him and he did in not flashy style. For perhaps being a bit too powerful for him the minder tries to use his power to control super mans mind only to end up on the end of one of the hero super punches that sends him crashing down to the city below like a sack of studs. It took mere seconds before suddenly the world went dark for Mark as simply looking out the window from his seat he saw a person flying towards him before suddenly everything went dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocked out from punched minder, it would take a few hours before mark awoke not on the bus but in a hospital bed surrounded by none other then super man himself and a doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? how did I get here?\" Mark said coming too from his accident. He had no idea how he'd gone from his daydreaming to being in a hospital bed but super man seeing this in the young mans eyes quickly spoke to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark is it not? I am sorry to say you were involved with a battle between myself and a villain. However be assured the justice league will be paying for your treatment and wish to apologies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth mark wasn't that bother to super man or the doctor surprise, he simply thanked super-man for his help before asking the doctor what treatment he was on worried it was something serious. To the young man surprise the doctor reported to him that he'd only suffered from scratches from broken glass and a small head injury from the impact of being hit by another human body at some speed. He went to explain to Mark that they would be release him soon and for now to take time to relax as nothing was better for injuries then rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the easy going guy he is mark simply nods before watching super man and the doctor leave the room. He didn't quite understand how he got involved in this but hey being talked to by super man certainly was worth it. However it was a few hour later after falling asleep that Mark awoke with a headache that he swore could kill a rhino, he ran the bell next to his bed for assistant but nobody came. Not after two, three or even four slowly making mark a angrier and angrier leading him to begin to think about someone asking them to help him in his pain only to suddenly to have them come in with a blank expression on their face but who is it?</span></div></div>",

She wasn't the prettiest of people but what mattered was the fact that with her glazed over eyes and blank look on her face, she quickly administered him a shot from a needle she came in with. It took a few minutes before finally Mark pain subsided and he return a more comfortable state. However unbeknown to him letting his mind take it focus away from the nurse, his limited mind control over her stop leaving he come back to her senses looking rather lost at Mark and the needle she held in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um you'll have to excuse me, Mr Fox I have no idea why I came in here?\" She said looking at Mark then at the needle before quickly exiting the room. Poor Mark couldn't figure it out either. He just saw her inject him and now she says she doesn't remember doing it? Plus what was with her blank look on her face and glazed over eyes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Too many questions and too little time to get his answers, mark slowly laid back on his hospital bed to think about it only during this time the young man fell asleep. The way his body was trying to repair itself, his deep slumber also left his mind open to another. A voice deep yet calm spoke to him like music in his ears saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Powers like yours should not be wasted. You Mark Fox have the power to control a single person mind. It is a gift give to you by power beyond your knowledge yet. Take time to test the limits of your powers. For now you require constant concentration to control someone but the choices you make will change you, shape you into the person you want to be. Remember my words and remember you can not hide from the walker\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At this Mark awakes in a cold sweat from his slumber with no clue about who the voice belong to or how he heard it he looks around the room from bed for anything that could make the sound but none could be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I have limited mind powers? Mark repeated to himself. He would not have believe it if not for his encounter with the nurse however it all made sense now. He called for a nurse and one did not come so in his pain he focused his mind to make a nurse come to him and she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Holy pickles on a burger. This is awesome.\" was the first thing to leave the young man mouth but then he recalls the voice last few sentences. Take time to test the limits of your powers.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark grinned as he continued thinking about ways to get revenge on Jessica for causing his death. On quick way to do that was to open the article she was working on and ruin the quality. It wasn't much, but it was something. As Mark began reading the article, he felt a sharp pain in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow\" the possessed Jessica said, moving her hand to her temple. When she opened her eyes again, she realized that she could now access all of her memories. \"Woah, I guess it takes a little for me to get used to a body\" she said as she remembered attenting the University of Metropolis' School of Journalism, interning at the Daily Planet for Lois Lane and being offered a well-paid position right after graduating. Her boyfriend, Tony, sat only a few desks away and although everyone knew that Jessica had a good shot of surpassing Lois lane, the two maintained a friendly professional relationship with Jessica often asking Lois for tips and tricks which the latter happily offered. <i>You know,</i> Mark thought to himself, surprised to mentally hear his own voice again, <i>maybe I shouldn't go out of my way to ruin Jessica. She did lead to me dying, but she has a better life than I'd have ever had. I'm not sure what her mind is doing right now, but as long as I'm in control, she might as well be dead anyway. Maybe I'll just give myself some freedom by breaking up with her boyfriend and call her body my home for a bit as punishment.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark finished his internal monologue, he turned his attention to the article that Jessica had been hard at work on. It was a piece she was currently co-writing with Lois Lane about Superman's heroic record saving people from crime and accidents. Mark balled Jessica's hands into fists and pounded them on her keyboard. \"No! That's not true!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark noticed people looking at him and took a deep breath, feeling Jessica's stolen chest expanding against her form fitting blouse before crossing her legs and calming down. \"Sorry everyone! I was getting a little too into my fact checking!\" he said, using the most innocent voice he could before turning back to Jessica's monitor and glaring at the article. <i>Superman is no hero,</i> he thought. <i>If he was half as good as everything thought he was, he would have been able to save me from the rubble that was falling. Jessica's not responsible for my death... SUPERMAN IS.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, an evil plan started forming in Mark's mind. He could take over Superman and go on a crime spree, wreaking havok through all of Metropolis and showing everyone that Superman could not and should not be considered a hero. Maybe even he'd use Superman's body to fight the whole Justice League and then leave to let Superman see what he had done. Now THAT would be revenge. Unfortunately, Jessica's memories didn't contain any way to get in touch with Superman. The only reporter he ever talked to was Lois Lane. Luckily, Jessica and Lois had a lunch date planned for today. If Mark wanted, he could easily transfer himself to Lois' body at lunch and use her to get to Superman. On the other hand, Mark had just been through a lot. and he did want to at least have Jessica break up with Tony before he left her so that she'd have some punishment for her hand in his death. It didn't seem like his powers were going away any time soon, so he could definitely take a few days to plot while enjoying Jessica's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do? </span></div></div>",

The only way to get to him would be to possess Lois, but Jessica's memories told Mark that Lois was rarely around the office anymore. Mark would have to meet her for lunch, possess her there, and use her to set up an interview with Superman. \"Sorry Jess, but it looks like I'll have to cut our time together short,\" Mark said, logging out of Jessica's account and heading to the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark followed Jessica's memory to a fancy restaurant in one of the nicest parts of Metropolis that Lois often used for high-end interviews. Every once in awhile, she convinced Perry White (the Editor-in-Chief) to also let her use it for personal lunch dates on the Planet's dime. Mark immediately spotted Lois Lane at a private table in the back of the restaurant. She was wearing a white top and tight black jeans, probably because whatver she had been out reporting needed her moving around faster than her usual skirts would work for. \"Hi Lois! Sorry I'm late, you wouldn't believe how many typos I found in the new article,\" Mark said, getting in character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired reporter chuckled. \"Typos? That's not like you at all. You feeling okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent Jessica frowned as she sat down across from Lois and crossed her legs. \"Actually, I'm not. I actually found myself in an accident on my way in this morning. I accidentally hit a kid and he tripped right in the way of debris that was falling from a building. The Justice League made sure no one else was hurt, but he died.\" Tears filled Jessica's eyes and her fists balled so tightly that she shook as Mark told the story. To his shock, Jessica's memories told him that she did actually feel terrible about it. Had she been herself at work, she probably really would have felt sick and been unable to concentrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! Jess, I'm so sorry\" Lois said, placing her hand on her fellow reporter's and holding it tightly. \"Is there anything I can do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there is\" Mark said, using Jessica's free hand to wipe away tears and then placing it on top of Lois' holding it so tight that Lois was unable to pull it away. \"I'm gonna need to borrow you so I can get my revenge on Super-jerk\" he said with an evil grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Lois asked, trying to pull her hand away as Mark held tighter, now with both hands, before closing his eyes and focusing on transfering his spirit from Jessica into Lois. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark opened his eyes to find that... </span></div></div>",

Mark just smiled nicely, now finding himself  sitting across from the rising reporter in the body of Lois Lane. He was impressed with how quickly the transfer had happened. Apparently all he had to do was touch someone and think about possessing them and it would happen pretty much naturally. Mark quickly maneuvered Lois' hands out from under Jessica's and instead placed her own on top, holding them supportively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were just telling me how horrible you felt about that poor boy who died this morning on your way to work. Do you remember any of that?\" Mark was particularly curious to see what, if anything, Jessica remembered about her time being possessed. Clearly Jessica didn't find it odd that she was now at lunch with Lois, which meant that she probably experienced it as more than just a blackout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded, holding Lois' hands tightly in her own. \"I do. Everything is clear as day. I just wish I could do something. I was barely able to concentrate on work over it. I even got mad at Superman for not saving him at my desk. You should have seen the looks people gave me\" she said. Lois nodded as Mark took mental notes. Jessica apparently remembered everything that he had done in her body, but as if it was her who did it. Jessica's memories must have been playing catch-up to create thoughts to fit with the actions, hence the brief disorientation. That was good information to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, believe me when I tell you this is not your fault\" Mark said in Lois' voice, trying to sound as reassuring as he could. \"What happened to that boy was horrible, but you didn't see him coming. And you couldn't have known that the building was coming down or that the Justice League wouldn't have gotten to him in time. But you know something you might be able to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jessica said, removing one of her hands so she could grab a tissue to remove tears from her eyes as Mark reached into Lois' purse to remove her notebook. He scribled an address on the page and ripped it out, passing it to Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as you said the boy's name I realized I knew of the family from a story I worked on years ago. His father is a financial analyst for Wayne Enterprises' Metropolis branch. This is their address. I think it would mean a lot for them to know how sorry you were. Maybe you could even work on a tribute to Mark for the Planet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled, at least knowing there was something she could do. \"Thanks Lois, it means a lot\" she said, folding up the paper and putting it in her shirt pocket. \"I think I'll actually heads there right now. Sorry to cut lunch short\" she said, standing up to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled from Lois' body. \"No problem, Jess. You go do what you have to do. I had something I wanted to take a look at anyway\" Mark said with a grin, which turned more and more evil as Jessica walked away. While he had been talking, Lois' memories had assimilated into his own, giving him a connection to Superman bigger than he had ever dreamed. The reason Superman only gave exclusive interviews to Lois was because he was actually her husband, Clark Kent! Knowing that, it would be very easy to get to Superman and put his body to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark was thinking about that, though, another plan crept into his mind. Lois' memories told him that Lex Luthor, though pretending to be a philanthropist and honest business man, was actually Superman's greatest foe. If Mark really wanted to get back at Superman, what better way was there than using his wife's body to team up with his greatest enemy? As Mark sipped Lois' coffee he ultimately decided to...</span></div></div>",

You laugh, you take your shoes off and throw them away, out the window <br>\r\n- Fuck! <br>\r\nYou put your foot near your nose, yoga and kamasutra could say. You inspire deeply, you did not do before, but what is good! It makes you want to throw up but so good.

He was free to use them as he wished!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he told himself, I'm not evil. Evil people like to kick babies and eat puppies, or something like that. Moreover villains were tremendously stupid. Big, flashy, gaudy idiots. Pulling up Clayface's Wikipedia page told him as much. The dude could impersonate near anyone on a molecular level, and he spent his time doing petty crime and watching actor's studio. He wasn't deserving of his powers. Mark was. Mark was the smartest 18 year old he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I could like. Totally Rob a bank right now. Or have cool sex with anyone I want.

Putty or Clayface Jr sounded dumb. Mirror sounded pretentious and confusing. But he did like the name Anybody. That sounded mischievous and ominous. Yup. That was him now.

Mind control: You are able to exert your will onto others. It will work on everyone (with special exceptions) but will be very difficult to use on telepaths or magicians. For now you are limited to one person at a time and you have to focus on them. After helping the Justice League you will unlock your full power. You can then exert your control on a couple people. Also, you may enslave people permanently, but only one at a time. You will still have some trouble with telepaths but not magicians. After joining the inner circle of members you will be so powerful that nobody can resist you, and you can control several people at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Possession: You may enter another persons body and control them. It can work on telepaths and magicians fine, but anyone with a powerful will may resist you. After helping the JL you will be able to control any one person at once, and access their memories, skills and powers as well. You will also be able to create multiple spirits of yourself that share your consciousness to control multiple weak willed people at once, with no memory access. One you join the inner circle you can be inside several people, regardless of willpower, and full access to their memories and skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Shapeshifting: You are able to change your appearance to anyone or anything, with no access to memories and powers. After helping the justice league, you can use the powers and memories of those you change into. After joining the inner circle, you will be able to change anyone or anything into anyone or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Domination: You have a sphere of influence, a silver tongue, and a powerful will. You will be more attractive to the opposite sex, and find that if you want something, people do their best to make it happen. Telepaths will resist, magicians will be immune. After helping the JL you will be able to dominate another's will, essentially making them your slave. Your influence will be larger, and your words will drip with honey. Only powerful magicians will resist. Joining the inner circle will allow you to control a large sphere of people with no natural resistance (but machines are unable to be affected.) I know this seems like a more villainous power, and that's why it would be fun to have a hero use this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Create your own! Make sure to include skills that you unlock later on.</span></div></div>",

Your arms grows back immediately, with perfect functionality, and no loss in mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacle arm was still right there, tight around his body. You tried to pull the slime binding off, but it was stuck tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nice... Now for his lower body...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be a bit trickier. Perhaps you could try something else, instead of making rope from your own body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back around to the front of his body, and examine his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His thighs are still mostly resting on the chair, but his knees and feet are still hanging off of the chair..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize something, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look below the chair to see that lever thing which can raise or lower it. You pull it upwards, and can feel the chair coming down to the ground, before stopping. Now the man's feet were in full contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your slime can regenerate itself, then how about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch both of his knees with your hands, and begin pouring slime down your arms, through your hands, covering the man's lower legs completely. You did this until it flowed well all around the man's legs, soles, and the floor, so that he would slip or even be captured if he tried to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again, you found that you could manipulate this flow of slime so that it could remain stuck to the man's lower legs, and therefore, to the floor. You relinquish your touch on his knees, before testing out the bind on his legs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hooked under one of his thighs and pulled, and there was no give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did another check of all of the binds, and after making sure that everything was in place, you closed the door, shutting out all of the light in the room. You could feel an invisible \"slime sense\" in your eyes, which allowed you to see the slime which was still holding the man. Besides that, this poor guy wouldn't be able to see anything at all once he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Perfect...\"</i> You thought.

For now you are limited to one person at a time and you have to focus on them. After getting your ass kicked by the Justice League you will unlock your full power.

Domination: You have a sphere of influence, a silver tongue, and a powerful will. You will be more attractive to the opposite sex, and find that if you want something, people do their best to make it happen. Telepaths will resist, magicians will be immune. After getting your ass kicked you will be able to dominate another's will, essentially making them your slave. Your influence will be larger, and your words will drip with honey. Only powerful magicians will resist. Ending the Justice Leage will allow you to control a large sphere of people with no natural resistance (but machines are unable to be affected.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Create your own!

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This will be a sexy story, but that's not to say that there isn't plenty of plot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark Fox: Male protagonist choice, 18. He is white, 6 feet tall, brown hair and blue eyes. He grew up in suburban Metropolis with his family in a middle income neighborhood. He only has a couple friends, but is pretty easy to get along with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia Fox: Female protagonist choice, 17. The female counterpart of Mark, but with blonde hair and light blue eyes. Her and Mark are basically attached at the hip. When they fight it's vicious, but she has always looked up to her older brother since he protected her from a couple bullies in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane Fox: The protagonist's mother. She is very proud of her body (and should be, with how much effort she puts into it), but since having kids has only focused on them. Her looks draw the attention of many guys, but she is a devoted wife and mother.  She loves her children more than anything, partly because her marriage is unraveling and she sees them as an anchor. She is an executive at Vision industries a rising power that aims to replace the failing Lexcorp. Unbeknownst to her, the company has a secret division dedicated to destroying the Justice League independent of the government and the Legion of Doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary Fox: The protagonist's father. He is a corrupt financial analyst at Wayne Enterprises, and has used his position to skim more than a little off of the humanitarian efforts and charities budget. He keeps it for himself, however, so as not to raise suspicion in his family. He has blonde hair and blue eyes which, like his wife, draw in the opposite sex. He is not as faithful, however, and is sleeping with an intern (who has no knowledge of the family).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy Fox: The protagonist's little sister, 15. Brown hair and brown eyes, she is shy and nice. If you do manage to piss her off though, she will tear you a new one. She attends the local high school, and gets on well with both of her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric White/Julie White: The protagonist's best friend. Both White siblings have been friends of the family for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whichever protagonist you don't pick will be your sibling!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever path you choose, these are the basic layouts. I don't care what you do in the story so long as these events come to happen. For instance, you can have 80 chapters between steps 1 and 3 so long as all of the steps happen eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHero's path:<br>\r\n1. Get superpowers<br>\r\n2. Screw around<br>\r\n3. Get a name and costume.<br>\r\n4. Fight some minor bad guy (bully, mugger, etc.) with your powers.<br>\r\n5. Help the Justice League with a major villain. Join the JL<br>\r\n6. Screw around<br>\r\n7. Save the JL from a major threat<br>\r\n8. Become part of the inner circle of founders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVillain's path: Much more freedom.<br>\r\n1.Get superpowers.<br>\r\n2. Do whatever you want. If it's fun (rob a bank, sex, terrorize the town) do it! Be a villain!<br>\r\n3. Get your ass kicked by the JL<br>\r\n4. Plot against the JL, and consolidate as much power as possible.<br>\r\n5. Beat the JL! This can mean anything you want. Death, enslavement, and disbanding all count. As long as the Justice League as we know it no longer exists, then you win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOU CAN ADD YOUR OWN HEROES AND VILLAINS AS THE STORY GOES ALONG. Don't think you need to use Lex Luthor or something like that. You can make your own characters that you meet in the League or villains you fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! Have fun and be creative. Also, try and give as much choice as possible. And the story isn't over when the path is complete!</td>",
