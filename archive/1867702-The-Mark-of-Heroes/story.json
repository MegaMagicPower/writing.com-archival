It was a life of hard, thankless work that turned your muscles into steel chord as you grew.  While you might not have been able to weild a blade with any precision, you could split wood and and work a plow better than anyone else in your family.  As you became a young man, your father began to tell you of the ways of the world, of places far beyond your imagination.  You dreamed of these exciting lands and the adventures you might have, but as time wore on it soon became evident that it would be impossible to set out in search of glory.  You were needed here, and although your father encouraged you to pursue a better life than this, you remained at the farm until the strings of fate pulled you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while working the feilds a familier man walks by and begins to question you about your work.  It's obvious that the speaker knows you well as he calls you by name, however with the amount of concentration it took to keep your unweildy scyth on track you could not afford to look up.  \"Are you here for my father?\"  you ask without looking.  \"No, as a matter of fact I came here looking for you...\"  You frown and finaly set your heavy tool down to look the speaker in the eye.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hail then Argamir, why do you look for me?\"<br>\r\n Argamir, the heavy set blacksmith of our small town looked at me, his brow furrowed in concern. <br>\r\n He spoke in a deep rumble, but softly as though he was afraid of being overheard. <br>\r\n \"Lad, I owe you and your father debt. I'm paying it. You saved Avi, my little girl.\"<br>\r\n It had been two harvests ago, a nacken had set itself into the local river. <br>\r\n Avice, Argamir's youngest daughter of thirteen at the time, had taken the laundry for washing. <br>\r\n Fortunately I and my father had been passing and dispatched the water spirit before it could draw the girl to her deathin it's embrace. <br>\r\n \"Argamir, you know neither I or my father hold you to debt. We did what any man should have!\"<br>\r\n The man's face stayed impassive, hard work having set his face almost to stone. <br>\r\n But a slight glint of a smile tugged as his eye. <br>\r\n \"Aye, it should be expected of any good man. And you and your father are both good men. If you won't accept it as repayment of the debt I do owe you, then consider it the same act. What I tell you now could save your life. Consider it either a debt repayed or a favor from one father to yours.\"<br>\r\n Metal is not prone to conversation, and Argamir resembled it in that way. <br>\r\n If it was serious enough to draw so many words from him, then it was worth listening to him. <br>\r\n \"Boy, do you know our Baron?\"<br>\r\n\"Only that he is mostly fair in taxes, that he has never worked with with his hands if it could be avoided. I hear he tends towards foppishness with his dress. I've never seen him, though.\"<br>\r\n \"He is not a bad man, as Baron's go. When I was a lad, his grandfather was heavy with the taxes, took enough of us so his dogs grew fat while we damn near starved. Baron Roger is good in that regard. And a Baron who interferes little with the lives of his people is not such a bad thing.\" <br>\r\n He took a breath, and thought for a moment. I'd never known Argamir to be so chatty. The wind blew from behind him, and now I could smell drink coming off of him, though it only seemed to lubricate his words. <br>\r\n \"But like all Barons, by the hells, like all men, he has his pride. At the last gathering held by the king, the Baron of Tawnion gave him insult and demeaned our lands. I don't know the full details, but while Baron Tawnion was put in his place, our Baron Rogers does not see fit to let the insult slide. <br>\r\n He has given me and all the blacksmiths of his barony the order for weapons and armor. To repair the old tools of your father's day and make new replacements for has been lost. Do you see what I am saying?\"<br>\r\nI had felt the dread rise as Argamir was speaking. <br>\r\n The Baron sought battle to repay the insult? <br>\r\n While wars had been fought, it had only been to keep out those that wished to conquer our lands. <br>\r\n The King held sway over fifteen lands, each held by a baron who managed them for him. <br>\r\n And battle fought between them would see the death of the Baron starting the conflict. <br>\r\n\"He would not draw the king's ire down on himself, surely! He would be a fool!\" <br>\r\n \"I do not know the nature of the insult Tawnion gave, I do know that Roger has certain pull in the King's court, even if not so much with the king himself. Perhaps he thinks should he win, that he will be able to use the insult as an excuse for the battle. I do not know. Whatever the reason, he is truly a fool. Tawnion controls greater lands, has more men and resources at his control. He may manage a surprise blow, but he can in no way win such an attack. He will soon begin to conscript young men, like yourself, to fight for his foolish cause.\"<br>\r\n I started to speak, but he moved forward and clasped his hand to my shoulder.<br>\r\n \"Simon,\" he said, his breathe reeking of ale,\"you must leave. If you stay, you will be forced into his army, and you will be killed by his mad plan. I'm sending my boy away as well. There's call for young men like yourselves to the north. In the docks at Taerop, or the King's works at Caereth. Even the great city of the king, should you go so far. Anywhere, but leave this land.\" <br>\r\n I felt shock to my core. I had never wanted to travel, unlike some I loved this land. My father had been granted it after serving time in the King's army, and it was good, rich farming land. I knew the rivers, the fields, it's people, and it's beasts who sometimes ventured out of the forests and waterways. <br>\r\n My father and mother needed my help working the lands. I couldn't leave them and my sisters, could I? <br>\r\n\"You must listen to me lad, if you stay you will die. No curse is so great for a father than to lose a child so nearly their own person. The brush of it was enough to wound me. Heed my advice, make any preparations you need. I will provide you whatever you do not have, but you must leave!\" <br>\r\n My head was swirling, How could I leave everything I'd known? <br>\r\n Even drunk, I couldn't question the blacksmith. Beneath the drink, I could see the fear in his eyes, hear the panic of his words. <br>\r\n If he was truly sending Ake away, then he held no doubt of his fear. <br>\r\n \"I must speak with my father and mother. I cannot believe this!\"<br>\r\nHis other hand clasped my other shoulder.<br>\r\n \"You must.\" He didn't raise his voice, but leveled his gaze at me. <br>\r\n \"Speak to them, tell them what I have told you. But you must ready yourself to leave come morning, noon at the latest. The Baron will soon come to start gathering men. You must be then gone, or he will take you!\" <br>\r\n In a sort of dull panic, not thinking I left the scythe where it lay and started walking to the home I shared with my family.<br>\r\n \"See me come morning, I will have some of that needed to guard yourself on your travels!\" <br>\r\n Having left his message of woe and destruction, destroying the peace of my day and future, Argamir left. <br>\r\n Presumably back to make sure his drink hadn't decided to slip away on him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> I sat at the family table, like most of the things I knew it is rough hewn and slightly stained. But solid and sturdy. Made years ago from a tree that had fallen on the edge of the forest. <br>\r\n I had helped your father cut it into useful lumber, then assemble it. <br>\r\n There were marks there from my inexpert hands. From dinners past, knotches from me and my sisters when we were younger.. <br>\r\n Your father looked at me, almost expressionless. But I could see the dread in his eyes. My mother was equally expressionless, but had turned pale. <br>\r\n They had both listened quietly as I repeated to them what Argamir had told me. <br>\r\nThe only reaction was a sharp intake of breath from my father as I told him what the Baron was planning.<br>\r\n \"Argamir is right, the Baron is a fool.\" my father said, rising from the table. <br>\r\n \"Come, we must get you ready. I still remember what is needed for a man to travel. It is three days travel to get out of the barony, another four to get to the nearest city. We can spare enough supplies to get your out of the barony on into Rendig's lands at least. You'll need to hunt for the rest. Take two gourds and...\"<br>\r\nI interrupted him. <br>\r\n \"Father, must I leave?\"<br>\r\n\"I have only known Argamir to panic once, when the nacken had nearly stolen Avice away. If he told you the baron seeks war, the baron seeks war. No insult between barons is so terrible as to cost the lives of young men in reparation. Even more so when they are so mismatched. In a year, perhaps two, return after this foolishness. But for now you must leave. We old men will be safe, but should you stay... boy, I would not lose you. Nor would your mother. Not in such a senseless way!\" <br>\r\n As he spoke the last sentence, his voice rose, anger giving it an edge I'd not heard before. <br>\r\n He had raised his temper to me and my sisters, but this was rage. <br>\r\n I knew in the war, like every man fighting he had lost compatriots to action. <br>\r\n Sometimes as harvest, he would drink to them and curse the fool generals who had blundered into traps or sacrificed men for scarce gains. <br>\r\n \"If you and Ake travel hard, you may even reach the King's city. It may happen you can stop this foolishness.\"<br>\r\n He walked to the back of our home, where the shelves were, and pulled out two travel sacks and my cloak. <br>\r\n \"If nothing else, you will be far from this foolishness.\"<br>\r\n He handed the sacks and cloak to me. <br>\r\n I reached to take them, but he held his grip.<br>\r\n\"Son, war is an evil. Even if you are fighting for your home and kin, even if you fight for your life, it is an evil that marks you. I will never forget what I did, what I lost. Or, what I gained. Safety, for my family. This land. Which brought to me this land, your mother, and you and your sisters. Our king knows the cost, and rewarded us who served the best he could.\"<br>\r\n He let go of the bags and cloak. <br>\r\n \"The Baron, apparently, does not know, or does not care the cost. I saw men like that. Generals, who lead for glory and not their men. The men rarely survived. The generals survived more often than the men liked.\" <br>\r\n He started pulling out dried meats and preserved vegetables from the shelves, loading one sack. <br>\r\n He paused, then went to the bedroom, and pulled his service sword from under the bed.<br>\r\n \"I know you've not used this, but you're a strong lad. Strength can cover for skill for most times you face danger. It should be in good condition, but have Argamir make sure of it.\" He handed me the belt and sword, then showed me how to strap it to my side for ease to draw it. <br>\r\n \"I hope I've taught you well boy. Only draw when needed. Keep your temper about you. Do not be like our baron and meet insults with death. There are greater things in this life to be concerned with than words of spite.\" <br>\r\n He stared at me then. <br>\r\n\"You're a fine son, a man couldn't be prouder. Do not feel shame for leaving, just return home when this is over.\" <br>\r\n He wrapped me in a great hug, strength from years of farming life almost crushing me.<br>\r\n My mother put her hand on my shoulder, and I turned to face her. <br>\r\n There were tears in her eyes, but she didn't shed them. <br>\r\n \"Your father is right. You will be a fine man soon. The Baron is a fool to spend lives so cheaply, and I know Aya and Argamir are telling their son the same.\"<br>\r\n She pressed a small but heavy sack into my hands. <br>\r\n \"This is some of the coins we've saved. You'll need it.\" <br>\r\nI moved to protests, but she shook her head. <br>\r\n\"I wish we had more time to get ready, but you will need this coin more than we will by far. It's to pay for your return. And, perhaps if you still seek Katie's favor when you return, you might buy her a gift perhaps.\" <br>\r\n A bit of a sparkle came to her eyes, something apart from the tears.<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure she knows. Now see to your sisters, your father and I will finish the preparations.\"<br>\r\n The sword felt heavy on my right side, and the coin purse felt as heavy on my left. <br>\r\n Both were gifts of importance to my parents.  My father had kept the sword after service, kept it clean and in fair condition. But he had kept it hidden, not in pride of place like some do. <br>\r\n And the coin was what little my family had raised for whatever needed supplies. New cattle or seed or something to be repaired or built we couldn't ourselves. <br>\r\n It also cemented the fact I was leaving. <br>\r\n As my parents gathered what they could to pack, I left the home and walked towards the stream, where my sisters were cleaning the cookery and clothing while watching the cattle drink. <br>\r\n \"Adie! Bailes!\" <br>\r\n \"Simon? What's wrong? why do you have father's sword?\" Adie said, looking up from her work. <br>\r\n \"Yes, what is the matter?\" said Bailes. <br>\r\n \"Something has happened, with the Baron. Mother and father know. I have to leave.\"<br>\r\n\"Leave?\" they both said. <br>\r\n \"Leave home?\" said Bailion. <br>\r\n\"I must leave the Barony entirely. I will be traveling with Ake. Before the Baron can take us.\" <br>\r\n\"Have you done something wrong?\" asked Adela.<br>\r\n \"No, but the Baron will do. I have to leave here before then. Mother and father will explain, but I must leave.\" <br>\r\nI gave them both a fierce hug, and they followed me back to our home. <br>\r\n \"I love you, I promise I'll return as soon as it's over.\"<br>\r\n\"Mother, Simon said he's leaving!\" cried Adela as we walked inside. <br>\r\n\"It's true,\" she said. <br>\r\n \"We've packed the sacks. Head out now, best to get to Argamir's smithy as soon as you can. Make sure he checks the blade.\" said my father. <br>\r\n I put on my cloak, and slung the bags over my shoulder. They were heavy, with food and other supplies. <br>\r\n\"There's tools for fire, and I added your bowstrings and fletching tools. Grab your bow.\" <br>\r\n I stood there for a moment, the weight of it pressing on me. <br>\r\n\"Go, son! Now!\" <br>\r\n I walked out of my home, not knowing if I'd return. <br>\r\n A thought struck me as I did, that even if I did, I might not find my family. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Take the bag and go!!\" Nolan shouted to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeck turnded towards me, drawing a dagger from underhis coat, saying \"Oh, your not going anywhere, 'Less'\" he said in a mocking tone. \"Give me the bag, and I'll let you live, for a little while.\" he said, sneering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting angry. \"Over my dead body!!\" I yelled, grabbing the hammer, and a red hot, half finished, sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! You might as w--\" he didn't Finnish talking before I swung the sword towards him. There was a loud 'TWANG' as Geck barley got his dagger up in time to block it. He responded by pulling out a second dagger, and swinging it towards my belly. My hammer caught that one. I swung my sword around a second time. He raised his dagger to stop it above his head, only to have the red-hot sword to rain sparks down on his eyes and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAUGGHHH!!\" he screamed, and fell to his knees. I swung te hammer down on his back, and he crumpled to the floor. I looked over at Nolan, to see him fighting Bruce. Nolan had grabbed a shield off the wall, while Bruce had grabbed a large mace off te same wall. 'maby those should be on different walls' I thought as I ran to assist Nolan. Bruce's mace came down on the shield with a 'Crack'. I knew it wasn't the shield that cracked. Before Bruce could block, I hit him in the arm with my hammer.  He fell to the floor, clutching his arm. The sword was a red-orange blur as it cut his chest open. Spattering blood on the floor. He lay silent on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly ran to Nolan.  \"Nolan! You are going to be ok!\" I said, knowing that the beakers would probably have to amputate his crushed arm. Which for a scholar, would be devastating.  I lifted the shield slightly, to check the damage. It was worse than I thought. On top of a crushed arm, the shield had splintered and stabbed him throughout his left side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Les...I need you to...'cough'.. I need you to protect that satchel from...the elves. Those thugs were probably hired to get the contents. 'cough' Ime sure they've sent someone for..'ungh'.. your uncle. He will be safe though. Paranoia has it's benefits.\" he coughed out. \"You must take the satchel to the high priest. Your uncle was suppost to do this, but I guess you'll do.\" he said with a chuckle. \"now go! I don't know if there were more, but you must leave soon. And here, take this. This should be helpfull in your journey.\" he handed me his personal satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went over and grabbed the hidden satchel and my best sword and cross bow, and headed for the door.  Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

But she adapted to the streets fast learning how she needed to act in order to survive; soon after she was orphaned she found she had a knack for magic and was waiting until the elven church would take her on for priestess training so she could help injured and sick people and have a constant roof over her head. It was her biggest dream to work there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly you hear her inhale deeply as she notices the blood everywhere in the room and the three bodies on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Les what happened here?\u201d you could hear the trembling in her voice as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she wouldn't let you go without an explanation you close the door and lock it than turn to her grab her hand and pull her the the second floor where both you and your uncle lived in the building and sat her down at a chair, taking a deep breath you explain everything that happened to you today. You trusted her enough and knew she wasn't close enough to talk to other elves being the street rat she was, to not talk about his mission to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened and stayed completely silent even after you were done explaining and she just sat there thinking until she said \u201coh\u201d you knew she hated death her parents death's traumatized her.

They did run into one or two, but without packs to back them up, they did not attack you.

It called for a hundred spears to be made within a month and your uncle was working around the clock to try and suceed in filling the order.  At least 18 spears had been completed without your assisstance and they were of fairly good quality.  However, with setbacks due a lack of iron only those had been completed within the week, which was the reason for your uncle's trek to the city.  Sighing you enter the storage room and seize a few of the remaining ingots before lighting the furnace.  After a half an hour the forge is ready for metal working.  You heat the iron until it is glowing cherry red then begin to hammer it into shape upon the anvil.  Slowly but surely, the leaf-shaped head began to take shape.  The repetitive rising and falling of your hammer and the rythmic clang of steel on iron always put you at ease.  Soon you were working several heads at a time as you settled into your comfort zone as the metal took shape.  With three broad heads completed you seize the tongs and drop the spearheads one at a time into the barrel of chilled water at your side.  The glowing metal emitted a loud hiss as it was suddenly cooled by the heat-quenching water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvening soon faded into dusk as you dutifully worked without rest.

I have brown hair down to my shoulders in braids and a beard then reaches my waist. Normally wear robes so to allow free movement when I use my spells or gadgets. However, I have been known to wear full armor when out on a raid or a mission to conquer a land near our island kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For decades, my family clan had been secretly studying the powers of witchcraft and, more darkly, the powers of science. As far as I am concerned, they are one and the same though many the uneducated see them as two separate powers. The universe is filled with powers most of the world does not understand; that is the advantage I carry over the world and those under my command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over the endless books I had read in my sleep; a forbidden technique that very few understand as the spells and events the books teach I can instantly master upon waking the next morning. There was one unfortunate side effect to this instant mastering; I woke hungry for anything I can get my hands on whether it had been cooked or not. My guards fear waking me for my morning meal as many a screams had been heard with the one waking me never returning from my quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose times had passed though and now I was a master of all witchcraft and science known in my part of the world and beyond. With such powers under my belt, I am considered invincible and it was not a struggle to prove it to anyone who found the courage to stand up to me. No one who stands against me lives to tell the tale. However, those who prove themselves loyal are richly rewarded with new weapons,  armor that eventually makes them able to conquer their own lands elsewhere. Those who leave my ranks, I know will try to take me down in the future... I relish those moments when I destroy them and take their armies as my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my little but powerful kingdom of Atlantis, my army, navy, and air force are preparing to conquer the world one kingdom at a time! Who dares stand against us?!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
