My brother was a great man; and he was the only person I could trust (until I met a certain girl...you know who I\u00b4m talking about). We both were capable of incredible fighting-abilities, although I didn\u00b4t look like someone who could pull this off.<br>\r\nAnyway, Tifa and I became friends shortly after we met, and even more importantly, her father accepted me as her, well, boyfriend.<br>\r\nWell, and now for my shrinkage. It was when I was practicing outside Nibelheim (shortly after my brother left Nibelheim for a journey), when a strange person appeared.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"He, he. So you are Sith, eh? I heard much about you.\" a female voice said.<br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s of no importance. I just want to test you.\"<br>\r\nThen, the woman pointed with her arm at me and spoke some magical words. After that, she disappeared.<br>\r\n\"What a strange woman.\" I whispered.<br>\r\nI now returned to the village, as I had to go to shool (hey, I was just a teenager back then!). But, unfortunately, something completely unexpected (really?) happened. When I was about to enter the classroom, I shrunk! I shrunk down to 1 inch tall! Although being upset about that, I had to do something. Fortunately, I saw Tifa\u00b4s desk right before me.</span></div></div>",

I simply used two table legs and force jumped from one to another, until I reached the top of the desk. The top of the desk was like a huge field, and directly in front of me, there was that incredibly beautiful girl, Tifa. I had to get her attention somehow, and I started to yell at her. But that wasn\u00b4t necessary, as she immediately saw me.<br>\r\n\"Sith?! What are you doing here?! And why are you-\"<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Tifa! Don\u00b4t speak too loud, I don\u00b4t want anyone else to see me.\"<br>\r\nFrom now on, Tifa spoke more quietly.<br>\r\n\"Sith, what happened?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n\"As you can see, I shrunk down to an extremly small size. I have no idea how and why, though.\"<br>\r\n\"And why did you come to me?\"<br>\r\n\"Because you\u00b4re the only one here I can trust, Tifa.\"<br>\r\nI didn\u00b4t know for sure, but Tifa seemed to get red in her face for a moment.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sith.

She did it so quickly that I didn\u00b4t even realize it immediately. And now, I was sitting inside a huge cave, white, teeth around me and the uvula and her threatening throat in front of me.

You\u00b4re our number one student, next to Sith. That reminds me...Sith isn\u00b4t here today, I suppose?\"<br>\r\nShe wasn\u00b4t able to react, as she was afraid of accidentally swallowing me. She didn\u00b4t even move her head. It might have been quite an unusual situation, being inside my girlfriends huge mouth, but hey, it was Tifa\u00b4s mouth, and it wasn\u00b4t that bad.

After following him. He entered a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is where he lives.\" Tifa said. She walked up to the house and knocked. She heard a voice saying \"Wonder who that can be?\" The door opened. And there stood the new guy known as Ryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that one girl from class. Um... Tifa! Isn't it?\" he said. \"What are you doing anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we just decided to drop by.\" Tifa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?

Tifa accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live here by yourself?\" Tifa said. Ryu sat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I don't have a family. No mother. No father. No sibilings as far as I know. It can get lonly sometimes.\" he said lying down. Then he quickly sat up. \"You do have someone with you. I can sense their fighting spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's joking. He has to be.\" Sith said to Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. Who ever this person is they shrunk.\" he said. Tifa and Sith were taken aback. \"I knew it! That darn old hag is at it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryu. Who is this person?\" Sith said through a mind link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telekinesis. Nice power. An old woman I knew from Corel. But she can make herself appear younger. She's been known to do this kind of thing. This is the last time she'll ever go back on word!\" Ryu said clenching a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she reverse the spell?\" Tifa asked. Ryu looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth... I'm not so sure.\" he said trying not to look eye to eye. \"Oh yeah. You might want to let out whoever you have inside you.\" he said with a face with slight disgust.</span></div></div>",

Her soft skin, her beautiful lips, her kind and warm eyes, her long black hair...everything\u00b4s perfect. But I was amazed about the fact that Tifa is a natural beauty. Tifa doesn\u00b4t use things like make up or nail polish, and her outfit is not...well, explicit. She\u00b4s wearing a normal outfit, like most other girls.

I also knew that she had a bar called  '7th Heaven' in Midgar somewhere, but it was destoryed by those evil people at Shrina, Inc.  I didn't know where in Midgar it was since I never been there.  I like the small-town life better.

Would I be like this forever?  How could I survive being 1 inch tall?  Tifa would look after me, but I still can't help but worry.  Just a stomp from someone's shoes and I'll be a goner.

But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u00b4t forget about my fate. There might be a reverse spell, yes. And what if not? Surviving a life as a 1 inch tall man was not impossible (thanks to my...\"special\" abilities), but I was concerned where I could live. Together with Tifa? Yes, it sounded like heaven, but...would she be able to handle it? Always being careful with me and caring for me?<br>\r\n\"Tifa...\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I...may I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n\"What if there\u00b4s really no reverse spell? What if there\u00b4s no way to turn me back? Where should I live? How should I live?\"<br>\r\nTifa looked at me with an expression of concern, then she grabbed me and put me on her right hand.<br>\r\n\"I already told you. Whatever happens, you\u00b4ll stay with me. I will always care for you, you understand? I won\u00b4t let any harm come to you. I know, it might not be easy, but at least I\u00b4m together with you. Ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Tifa, I...Thank you. Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I\u00b4m sure you\u00b4ll turn back to normal, so we\u00b4ll be living together the way it was.\"<br>\r\nShe put me back on the kitchen table and continued with preparing the sandwiches. Again, Tifa proved how kind she is. A true friend. And the first woman who didn\u00b4t care about my look. I am not a muscle-man, you know, I\u00b4m just an ordinary guy, and guys like me normally don\u00b4t get girls like Tifa. But she\u00b4s different. She\u00b4s not arrogant, she\u00b4s kind, innocent and yet not a helpless girl. In fact, she\u00b4s the best fighter I\u00b4ve ever seen!<br>\r\nOnce again, I thought about the dangers of my height: being crushed or maybe even...being eaten alive! I shuddered about that thought, when Tifa yelled: \"Sith, lunch\u00b4s ready!\"<br>\r\nShe put me on the same plate as the sandwiches.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I made 4 sandwiches. 3 for me, and one for you. Of course you won\u00b4t be able to eat it whole, according to your height. But hey, then I can eat what\u00b4s left, huh?\"<br>\r\nShe\u00b4s giggling, and I had to smile too.

That was before I noticed a fly on the sandwhich.  The fly looked like one of those countless monsters that Tifa had fought on her journey with Cloud  (she had told me all about it when she came back to Nibelheim) and the others.  I got on the sandwhich to shoo the fly away, when Tifa picked up the sandwhich!  The fly flew away at once, but I was half-way to Tifa's mouth!   I shouted, trying to get her attention, but it was hopeless.  The sandwhich entered her mouth and started to chew the sandwhich.  Her teeth ripped right through the bread and nearly chewed me to bits.  I managed to avoid those giant white teeth, but..<br>\r\n    \"GULP\"<br>\r\n     Tifa swallowed me and the chewed up sandwhich!  So this was my fate!  Being swallowed alive by my best friend!  I fell down her throat, being pushed down by the muscles of the throat.  I was forced through a tiny opening and into a large chamber; Tifa's stomach!  I landed with a soft thud.  I closed my eyes.  After a minute, I realized that I was still alive.   But how?  I was surrounded by stomach acid--which was doing its job of the chewed bits of sandwhich--but didn't appear to be effecting me!   It was totally dark in Tifa's stomach.  I could tell that she was still eating the sandwhich.  I could hear her heartbeat, it was somehow comforting to me.  Tifa would finish the sandwhich and realize that I wasn't with her anymore--well, I AM with her now,  but you get the point.  </span></div></div>",

I took out my lightsaber and cut one of the queen's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Very impressive toy you got there\" said the Queen.  \"but...behold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The arm that I had just cut off grew back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What the...?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Hehe...You'll never defeat me\" said the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"How did you do that?!\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I won't reveal my secrets\" said the Queen.  \"let's just say that Tifa helped me grow another arm...haha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"YOU FLITH!\" I screamed so loudly that Tifa could've heard me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"HAHA...\" said the queen.  \"we shall meet again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      And with that, the queen vanished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"COME BACK HERE!\" I yelled.  \"I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND PUNISH YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID TO TIFA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      A laugh echoed through the lungs  (like in Doom 3).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Suddenly, I realized something that I haven't noticed before.

So I took one of his lightsabers with the force, and my chances were rising. Now, the general used his lightsabers like chain saws (like in Clone Wars Episode 20), so it was impossible to attack him.

Well seeing as Sith and Tifa are fused.... Sorry. I tend to ramble on needlessly. In any case the battle was joined. Blades flashed as they did damage around 700 points. But both sides had several potions and elixers and several thousand hit points. Technique after Technique was used until Seproth ran out of items and had only 10 hp left and 50 mp. Victory seemed certain but you know he won't be killed because that's what the previous choice said. Kinda takes away the suspence if ya aask me but.... sorry.

It's over now. I realize I can't beat you now but soon I will be powerful enough. I'll use the rest of my mp and sacrifice half my health to activate my third most powerful spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeproth cuts a huge gash on chest but instead of blood, dark magic spheres came out shooting forth with lightning speed, ensnaring the two heroes and himself. Sith is forced out of Tifa in whatever way you want to imagine. The dark energies restored him to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeproth: As a team you are strong, Tifa and Cloud, But that Sith.... He is a wild card. He always seems to show up to ruin my plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSith: What are you talking about I never met you before today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeproth: You fool. Now just as I have done before I will restore all your memory and take it away again just so I can see the look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark light ning flashes to Siths temple. For a second he just stares as wave after wave of memories flashed before his eyes.Then his face contorts into a mask of rage and undisputed hatred towards Seproth. Seproth just laughs. Tifa whispers Sith's name under her breath scared at his expression. She yelled it again when another dark bolt hit him and he passed out. Cloud looks on sadly as he witnessed this atrocity then he was hit by a bolt. Tifa sobbed loudly as she saw three large vortexes open. Cloud and herself drifted towards the first one while Sith went for the second and Seproth the third. He smiles at her, a dark evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeproth: Don't worry. You will see him again. I can send people through time and space. He is just going to another storyline, another dimension if you will, for now. He'll probably be eaten there too. Surprising, how many times it happens to him. You will meet him again my dear, you just won't remember him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa saw a black bolt coming for her, then saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeproth saw Tifa crumple to the bottom of her dark energy sphere. We will meet again he thought and next time , I'll win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four sphere entered the portals and with a flash that lit the sky, then the night was dark once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you know how Sith gets around.<br>\r\nTo continue the Story Of Sith choose another storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no chance at all for her to strike back or to get an advantage again. Her life was now in my hands. To my surprise, Lucia didn\u00b4t beg for mercy.

What I did to her was terrible and incredibly cruel, perhaps I can never redeem my deeds.\"<br>\r\n\"Don\u00b4t worry, Lucia. I forgive you.\"<br>\r\nWe both were surprised when we heard Tifa\u00b4s voice. So it appears that she could hear everything going on in her head, just like our dialogue.<br>\r\n\"Tifa! Do you...really forgive me?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course. What you did is wrong, and you know that yourself. But you did it because you were in love...I can understand that.

It\u00b4s just...well, now you finally got out of my body, and you can\u00b4t imagine how glad I am to see you again. I don\u00b4t want you to disappear again.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, I won\u00b4t be long. And no harm will come to me!\"<br>\r\n\"Promise?\"<br>\r\n\"Promise!\"<br>\r\nWith these words, she held her little finger before me, and I touched it as some sign of trust between us.</span></div></div>",

In front of us, a strange picture appeared, as if it was on a TV-screen. A scary looking person could be seen there, or at least his upper body, covered in clothes resembling the ones Sephiroth wore.<br>\r\n\"What the---?! Seproth!\"<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Sith. Long time no see.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"Is that all you have to say about our reunion? Hahaha!

And Tifa\u00b4s body is the key.\"<br>\r\n\"My...body?\"<br>\r\n\"When Sephiroth hit you with his sword in Nibelheim back then, you were infected with Jenova cells.\"<br>\r\n\"I...I have Jenova\u00b4s cells in my body?!\" Tifa said almost in tears.<br>\r\n\"Mwahaha! These cells can provide one with incredible power, but one has to awaken their powers first.\"<br>\r\n\"So...you used Lucia and the parasites to gain Jenova\u00b4s power.\"<br>\r\n\"Clever, huh? Destroy the parasites, if you want. They\u00b4re no longer of any use. They already awakened the power within Tifa. All I have to do now is to gain control over Tifa\u00b4s body, and I\u00b4ll be able to destroy Cloud. Imagine, Tifa. You\u00b4ll kill your childhood friend with your own hands! Mwahahaha!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop mocking us, you bastard!\"<br>\r\nSeproth kept laughing maniacally for a few seconds until he could calm down.<br>\r\n\"Stay right where you are, Seproth!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you wanna stop me and save Tifa? Hm, sounds like fun. I\u00b4ll be waiting inside Tifa. Au revoir, mon amie!\"<br>\r\nThe picture of Seproth disappeared, just as quickly as it appeared.<br>\r\n\"Tifa, we have to hurry!

Tifa could play the piano masterfully, and it was a joy to listen to her.<br>\r\nNext to her bed, there was the dollhouse she spoke of. She removed the roof of the house and placed me next to a bed. I looked around only to see that it was an ordinary room I was in. Yet it was a bit disturbing to see that even a doll-bed was too big for me. I even had problems to get onto the bed due to my size.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m sorry, but I don\u00b4t have a smaller bed.\"<br>\r\n\"Don\u00b4t worry, it\u00b4s okay for me.

Well, some might say it\u00b4s disgusting, but I somehow feel great in there: listening to the rythm of the heartbeat, the rythm of life is a wonderful thing, and being near to the girl you love is a great feeling as well.

Everything\u00b4s all right.\"<br>\r\n\"Whew...I\u00b4m relieved.\"<br>\r\n\"Sith, if you\u00b4ll excuse me, I\u00b4ll take a short walk through Tifa\u00b4s innards.

Of course about her growth, but also about other things. Like her natural beauty (I\u00b4m sure she reddened when I told her how stunningly gorgeous and natural she actually is); she just replied that she doesn\u00b4t like to put on things like make-up or nail polish, so that might be a reason for her great look. I also teased her a bit from time to time by tickling her stomach walls, which caused her to laugh loud and her stomach walls to shake. After quite some time, she was getting tired.<br>\r\n\"Uh...good night, Sith. Sleep well.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tifa. Good night.\"<br>\r\nWhen I was sitting there, listening to how Tifa was breathing, I thought about what would happen next...and by the way, Lucia was late. Was she still in Tifa\u00b4s innards?

Also for Yuffie Kisaragi. She has been a materia hunter since she was only 14 years old, and now that she has defeated the threat through Sephiroth together with her friends, she could go after her bussiness again. And indeed, there was something which gained Yuffie\u00b4s interest. She heard about a rare materia with unknown yet unbelievable powers. Yuffie knew that she had to find this materia, even if her village didn\u00b4t need her stealing-abilities anymore.<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u00b4t take her long to find it. She is an experienced materia hunter, so she knows exactly where to look for materia, and she also got some valid information about its location: somewhere near Junon. So she hopped onboard of some ship for Junon. Thankfully, Junon wasn\u00b4t far away from the Wutai-continent, so the trip on the ship lasted only about a day. Yuffie was glad when the voyage ended; her stomach can\u00b4t take voyages on sea as well as voyages with airships. In Junon harbor, shortly after she left the ship, something unexpected happened. A rather old man with a long white beard and a grey cape with a hood - almost looking like a wizard - appeared in front of Yuffie.<br>\r\n\"Miss Kisaragi, I assume.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?!\"<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s not important. I guess you\u00b4re searching for this?\"<br>\r\nHe held a green materia in his right hand, and Yuffie realized that it had to be the materia she\u00b4s been looking for.<br>\r\n\"Well, I want you to take the materia.\"<br>\r\n\"What?! But why?!\"<br>\r\n\"Let\u00b4s just say that...I\u00b4m an admirer of your skills.\"<br>\r\nHe gave Yuffie the materia with a grandfather-like smile.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"<br>\r\n\"But be careful. Its usage could cause you a lot of trouble.\"<br>\r\nAfter these words, the man walked away. Yuffie looked at the materia in her hand, still surprised that the man donated the materia just like that.</span></div></div>",

Tifa had moved in with Cloud also.  Cait Sith returned to the Golden Saucer to be a fortune teller.  Red XIII lived in Cosmo Canyon.  Barret had moved into Midgar, since he wasn't welcomed back in his old hometown.  Vincent had disappeared...Yuffie didn't know where Vincent went.

Before they were crushed by Yuffie, they ran out of the hotel and tried to alert everyone in Junon. Nearly everyone in Junon left his or her house, trying to get out of the city. Of course, Yuffie didn\u00b4t notice anything since she was still sleeping, dreaming of that huge materia. After the complete evacuation of the city, hundreds of people watched from a safe distance this terrible mess: the whole city was soon covered under Yuffie\u00b4s monstrous body. The (former) inhabitants of Junon looked at each other in shock. Their home was gone, destroyed by a sleeping, growing giantess. Minutes later, Yuffie\u00b4s growth stopped. According to the calculations of one of the inhabitants (obviously a scientist), the girl must have been over 500 feet tall, between 800 and 1000 feet. The question was now what to do. Wake the girl up? Call someone for help? But who? Shinra couldn\u00b4t help anymore, it was gone, so who else could help? The sight of a (indeed cute) giantess tossing about in the ruins of the once glorious city of Junon during her sleep was enough to tell the people: there is no help.</span></div></div>",

She once again managed to get herself into quite a predicament by carelessly using a materia she didn\u00b4t know much about. Vincent himself heard about a certain growth materia before, but he would have never imagined to see it in action or its results. Approaching the gigantic cute girl, Vincent also realized how monstrously huge Yuffie now was. How ironic that she still was sleeping, not realizing what happened to her and the whole city of Junon.<br>\r\nVincent knew that he had to get in contact with Yuffie. She first had to realize her situation and to be aware of her size. And standing before Yuffie\u00b4s vast belly, which was in a horizontal position due to the fact she was still lying there, he decided to climb onto her belly first. Normally it would take some time, but Vincent managed to accomplish the climb in under a minute, which was quite impressive due to the sheer size of Yuffie. Now he was standing on a vast field of skin, Yuffie\u00b4s bare belly. It almost seemed like some vast wasteland of skin, with Yuffie\u00b4s head slightly visible in the distance. Vincent also realized that Yuffie\u00b4s skin was quite soft, and that she was quite cute herself, but he didn\u00b4t care about that. He didn\u00b4t care about women since the loss of his dear Lucrecia.<br>\r\nHe walked over her belly fast, and after quite some time he reached Yuffie\u00b4s breasts, which weren\u00b4t that big, thus not that difficult to pass. After having passed her breasts, he managed to jump onto Yuffie\u00b4s throat, which was quite a long tube, then he walked along her soft throat until he reached her chin. Climbing it, he finally arrived on her face, which was also in a horizontal position. There he noticed something strange on Yuffie\u00b4s huge lips. At the edge of her upper lip, there seemed to be a materia, almost in the small gap between her lower and upper lip. That must have been the growth materia. Vincent knew that he could take the materia and try out a reverse spell on Yuffie. But he also knew that it would be dangerous. Once he was on Yuffie\u00b4s lips and she accidentally opened her mouth...he knew the consequences.</span></div></div>",

Today I want to tell you the ultimate vore story with Yuna. It was long before I met Rikku, even before Sin was destroyed. Anyway, I used to live in a Micronian-village (I won\u00b4t tell where) together with my small sister, Ellie. She was only 15 years back then (me: 18), and after our parent\u00b4s death (when we were still small children), I had to take care for her. I really love my sister as much as a brother can possibly do, as we only have ourselves. One day, we decided to leave our village, as it was getting boring (and my sister was hoping that she could find the love of her live, but there weren\u00b4t that many Micronians out there). We both wanted to go on some adventures, yet we knew it could be dangerous for 2 people whit a height of 1/8 of an inch; so small that we almost weren\u00b4t visible for normal inhabitants of Spira.<br>\r\nAnyway, we started our trip around Spira and went to Besaid Island, a peaceful place, but dangerous for us. My sister an me were swimming in a small lake (lake for us), as I left the water.<br>\r\n\"Sith, I\u00b4ll swimm a little longer, alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ellie, but be careful.\"<br>\r\nI went away from the lake a few steps, just when I felt an earthquake. Well, not quite an earthquake, but it was an incredibly huge girl that was coming: summoner Yuna! She bowed down in front of the lake and put her hands into the water in order to drink.<br>\r\n\"Ellie!\"<br>\r\n\"Sith, help me!\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Yuna drank the water along with my sister. That was grave, as she wasn\u00b4t able to survive inside someone\u00b4s stomach; only male Micronians can do that. So I had to go after her into Yuna\u00b4s body. I saw that Yuna was going back into her house, and I quickly followed her. She went into the kitchen, so did I, and there I saw a glass of water.<br>\r\n\"If I go into the glass, then...\" you get the point, my vorephile friends. And a fantastic voyage was about to start; a voyage throughout Yuna\u00b4s whole body, searching for my sister.</span></div></div>",

The ring opened and I was pushed into her stomach with a plop. I was now swimming inside the water Yuna swallowed, and I immediately began to search for Ellie.<br>\r\n\"ELLIE! ELLIE, WHERE ARE YOU?!\" I shouted several times, but I didn\u00b4t get any answer. And I couldn\u00b4t see her inside Yuna\u00b4s vast stomach. Had she been...digested? No, it couldn\u00b4t be. Although Ellie couldn\u00b4t resist acids, I tought her many useful skills, and she was an intelligent girl, so she might have found a way to survive. Suddenly, everything begant to shake.

I looked down her throat and I could clearly see a tube next to the esophagus: her windpipe.<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\"<br>\r\nAnd I boldly dived down her throat and into her windpipe, from where a short flight through the grey tube followed. Moments later I arrived in her lungs, and before getting out of control under her breathing process, I reached for the grey walls of her lungs. I successfully hold onto a small part of her lungs not far away from the entrance to the next stop: her nose. There would be a way to her brain from there. For a few moments, the large chamber of her lung began to shake a bit as Yuna was coughing. Must have been my doing. She surely had no idea of her microscopic passenger.<br>\r\nAt last I started my climb up to her nose. It wasn\u00b4t easy since the air Yuna was breathing pressed me either up or down, but I didn\u00b4t lose my grip. Only a few minutes later I reached a hole that lead into a long tube, her nose. I took a last look at Yuna\u00b4s truly beautiful lung (the contracting grey walls and the steady breathing sure had something calming), before I began to climb into her nose.</span></div></div>",

These hairs normally are there to prevent foreign bodies from entering the human body - and you could say that I happened to be a foreign body inside Yuna\u00b4s nose. The deeper I walked into Yuna\u00b4s nose and the nearer I got to her brain, the weaker the stream of air passing me got. I was really grateful, since it sure was annoying that whenever Yuna breathed in and out through her nose, this damn stream of air was threatening me to loose my balance. Anyway, after walking through the large tunnel of Yuna\u00b4s nose, I finally reached a strange looking, organic hole above me. I wasted no time, so I entered the \"door\". And you know what? I was inside an incredibly huge chamber, with gray fleshy folds everywhere, with synapses transporting informations throughout Yuna\u00b4s head - yes, I was inside Yuna\u00b4s brain. From my position, I could even see Yuna\u00b4s eyes from the inside, allowing me to take a look outside her body. And from what I could see - and hear - Yuna was still coughing slightly, pounding with her fist against her chest.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Yuna whispered, obviously puzzled.<br>\r\nThen Yuna started to walk, with the inside of her brain shaking slightly whenever she took a step.

A Micronian is about 1/8 of an inch tall, so it\u00b4s no surprise we\u00b4re almost gone. Most of Spira\u00b4s people don\u00b4t even know we exist, until the day I was found by Rikku, a cute young Al-Bhed (shortly after Sin was defeated). I thought this might be my end, but she seemed to like me and brought me to her home. We became friends soon, and lived together from now on. It wasn\u00b4t always easy, but since I am also a powerful sorcerer (hey, Micronians should have special-abilities as well, huh?), many problems can be solved quickly. Oh, I forgot, Rikku and me live alone in a nice house somewhere near to Bevelle.<br>\r\nAnd now it\u00b4s going to be exciting. One day...</span></div></div>",

You might know already, it looked like Anakin\u00b4s mech-arm in Episode III. Several days later, Lucia and me said good-bye to Rikku, Yuna and the others. Even though I like Rikku a lot, we wanted to return to our world. And I wanted to see Tifa again.<br>\r\n\"Good bye, Sith, Lucia! Thanks for everything!

I\u00b4ll miss you.\"<br>\r\nAfter that, I activated Seproth\u00b4s materia, and we both were sucked into a glowing light, that brought us directly to Nibelheim.<br>\r\n\"We\u00b4re home.\" Lucia said.<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are!\" a familiar voice said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Drez, it\u00b4s you again.

She took the cup, which causes you to slosh around in it.<br>\r\n\"You know, I\u00b4m somehow thirsty.\" she said as she brought the cup nearer and nearer to her lips. It just was not your week. First you shrunk to 1/4 of an inch, then you got swallowed by Hitomi, and now again? You were not able to scream because of fear and ice tea sloshing all over you as Hitomi\u00b4s mouth opened wide and the current of the cup began to enter the cavernous mouth of your girlfriend, and you sucked into as well.</span></div></div>",

Huge drops of saliva splashed against his face on the way down the pitch dark tunnel. He wasn't even sure if he could believe what was happening. One moment he was hanging on to her giant lip, outside with a cool wind blowing on him. Now he was sliding down to his doom, moving so fast he couldn't even think. He was heading right for her stomach when he suddenly found himself stuck inside a small pocket in the back of her throat. The pocket led a little deeper into the throat, but he didn't dare go look for himself. His clothes were thoroughly drenched with saliva. He tried feeling his way through the thick darkness, but everywhere felt the same. Hot, slick, and slimy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mario looked down below him and could just make out the entrance to Peach's stomach. Strange yellow fluids swished throughout and a foul odor from the stomach wafted up towards him. He wiped the sweat and the saliva from his forehead and thought about what to do. He was trapped in an infinitely black pit with seemingly no hope of ever getting out. He had to do something, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Now and then, the fluids from the stomach would rise up the throat slightly. Every time they did, Mario thought Peach was about to vomit. But after a few moments, they subsided and returned to the stomach, but that gave him an idea. He thought about the situation and narrowed his escape to two options. He could try to climb up the throat, which he didn't think was possible seeing how slimy it was. Or, he could try to make Peach puke him out. He thought about how big Peach was compared to him and the distance from her mouth to the ground. He was frightened by these being his only two options, but they were his only way out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peach now knew what was going on, but she still had no idea how to solve her height problem.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should ask a toad-doctor?\"<br>\r\nSaid and done. After a few minutes the toad doctor from the destroyed castle arrived and tried to find out how to help peach. And he quickly found out what happened.<br>\r\n\"Well, it appears that our princess has this, uhm, height problem because of that mushroom she ate. Unfortunately, she already digested the mushroom, and her body absorbed its parts that are responsible for the growth. The only way to help the princess would be this brilliant plan: someone must get into the princess\u00b4 body and destroy the parts of the mushroom I mentioned. They are inside her stomach, her lungs, her heart and her brain. Once all the parts are destroyed, our volunteer must get out of her body quickly, before she grows to normal again. He can get out with this warp-flute. Well, and I guess our volunteer will be...Mario!\"<br>\r\nMario quickly nodded. Of course he would do everything to save Peach.<br>\r\n\"But you are still not small enough. If you want to enter her bloodstream, then you must become a bit more small. Luigi!\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, Luigi arrived with a hammer. He hit Mario with that hammer on the head, making him even smaller.<br>\r\n\"That will do.\"</span></div></div>",

Once they entered Peach's room the duo gazed in awe at what had happened to the prinncess. The to spoke nonscensical gibberish to eachother as always with the odd jump or hand gesture. The Toads just figure that they were planning on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mario and Luigi grabbed her left foot and yanked with as much might as the pair could muster up. With a bizzare popping noise Peach's head slid out.However, there was still the matter of the Princess being huge, so the Mario bros started to ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in thought the Mario duo stood, silent as though they were alone in the room. The Toads watched in anticipation to what creative idea the Mario bros came up with, after a while Mario said somthing to Luigi, who nodded agreeably.<br>\r\n\"What's that you say, get it out from inside her\" Interuppted a Toad Gaurd<br>\r\nMario nodded an sign of agreement to the Toad who looked back shuddering all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you positive that's the only way?\"<br>\r\nSpoke another Toad<br>\r\nLuigi mumbled a bunch of gibberish which was made out by the Toads to be a \"Yes\" in a manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue it was a strange thought allthough it seemed mildy sound so to say. Allthough it was a tad risky one had to stay outside to hang on to a rope unless they were really considering freestyling, which seemed insane even by their standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowvever, it was unanimus, Mario would be going alone, Luigi still hadn't full recovered from the time he and Mario were inside Bowser. So the Toads from as if out of nowhere handed the two some rope, Mario thought it only fair that they leave who was going in to chance, he still remembered their little expeiriedce in Bowser and thought a friendly game of Rock, Paper, Scisors could be his ticket to a nice afternoon in bed rather than in the shower washing off Peach's bodily juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas Mario had lost. Mario tried to convince everone that this was a bad idea, despite the fact that it was his idea in then first place. Luigi had finished strapping the rope around Mario's waist smirking the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach hoisted Mario off of the ground with her thumb and forefinger and brought him level to her face, Mario let out a small yelp as the Princess's lips parted before him. Just before he was popped into her mouth he could have sworn he saw Luigi wiping his forhead as though he'd escaped a terrible accusment of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario whimpered a little as he felt his ankles being pulled downwards with a little effort Mario's entire waist was pulled into Peach's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Luigi was calmly lowering Mario in paying no attention to Mario's cries for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after his waist was pulled in, his chest was pulled along with it. He could feel the muscles having there way with him, pulling him down to her awaiting stomach.<br>\r\nWhen Mario could feel his legs kicking he knew he was about ready to enter her stomach. Whith a slashing sound Mario fell flat on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere a light gleemed upon his skin; a sort of reddish color. He cautously walked over to it.</span></div></div>",

But why on earth is everything so big? What on earth happened? Hm...Ah, now I remember. That Maderas-brother jerk casted a spell on me, I shrunk, and then he said something about Etna destroying me.

That means...I\u00b4ll have to get outta here! The hell out!\"<br>\r\nBut it was too late.

He was spooned up with some of the smaller lumps by Etna, and she brought the spoon near her yawning mouth. He could see an enormous, pink cave, her mouth, coming nearer and nearer. The spoon was passing her teeth, and after a few seconds he fell on her wet, fleshy tongue. He looked around and realized how small he truly was. A tooth of Etna was house-sized compared to him, or even bigger. Her mouth was still open, so he ran towards her teeth and tried to climb out of her mouth, only to see Etna drinking something. He couldn\u00b4t resist the masses of water, and he was about to be washed down Etna\u00b4s throat.<br>\r\n\"Damn! This can\u00b4t be!

His fall lasted for what seemed like forever. Finally, he could see a hole, and seconds later he was sucked into it. Of course he knew what it was: that hole lead into Etna\u00b4s stomach. Laharl landed in a pool of water and chewed zombie-flesh. He realized immediately that the rising digestive juices were no threat to him. After all, he was the Overlord, so stomach acids were not a problem. He looked around in that pink, wet cave, and he could barely see the other side of her stomach. Her stomach walls were pulsating and somehow scary.<br>\r\n\"Sheesh! Why is it that I don\u00b4t have any luck with vassals?! Either they let me down or they swallow me whole! Alright.

There he would make a cut into her intestines\u00b4 walls in order to enter her bloodstream. But the way through her stomach was loooong.

Well, and after quite some time, he found an interesting item in a nearby cave. It was a stone with strange carvings on it. Lloyd had no idea what this stone was for, but he was curious. He went back to Iselia and wanted to show the item to his girlfriend Colette; he knocked on her door, and she opened it immediately.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lloyd!\"<br>\r\n\"Hi, Colette. Mind me coming inside?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Come in!\"<br>\r\nThey went into the living room, where he saw a table with some food on it. Looks like Colette was eating.<br>\r\n\"Well, what brings you here, Lloyd?\"<br>\r\n\"I wanted to show you something. This stone.\"<br>\r\nHe gave her the stone.<br>\r\n\"Wow, it looks beautiful!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...\"<br>\r\n\"Oops!\"<br>\r\nJust typical. Colette dropped the stone, and it fell on the ground. Lloyd was covered in a strange light, and he was beginning to shrink down to 1/2 of an inch! Lloyd was slowly getting unconscious, but he could tell that Colette didn\u00b4t notice him, as he was so small.<br>\r\n\"Lloyd! Where are you?!\" Colette shouted.<br>\r\nLloyd could feel that he fell onto soft ground, perhaps Colette\u00b4s food. Then he passed out.</span></div></div>",

Sheena and Lloyd glared at him as he spoke. \"Well then Sheena lets get things started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja took a battle position and awaited Sheena's move. \"Good luck Sheena and I'll be cheering for you.\" said Lloyd as he took a position to watch over the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena nodded at Lloyd and focused on Kochinawa.

She thought over how little Hyrule had expanded in her lifetime. She wanted to see her kingdom's borders grow into a vast empire...And she wanted to be it's supreme ruler. She wanted badly to take the throne from her father, but there was no reason to. But she wanted to secure power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter days of careful planning, she finally had a solution how. She'd heard many tales from Link about his adventures when he left Hyrule. One particular quest caught her attention. She immediately made arrangements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milady,\" a guard said approaching her lounging couch in her peaceful rotunda. \"There is a man here to see you. He claims that you sent for him and that he has a parcel for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda perked out of her deep thoughts and immediately stood up. \"Send him downstairs and tell him I will meet him shortly,\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would advise against that Madame,\" the guard said. \"The man could be an assassin. We should immediately examine the package to make sure it is not dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you; it is not,\" she said. \"I did send for this man. The parcel he carries, I told him expressly to bring to me when he received it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Princess, regardless; I cannot authorize a stranger allowed in the interior of the castle,\" the guard argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an Order,\" Zelda snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes your Highness,\" the Guard said, moving away in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess was soon escorted down a dark stone staircase, led by a guard. The orange glow from the Guard's torch was the only light she had. They soon came to the bottom area. It almost looked like this place would lead to the dungeons or something far worse even. Standing at the other end waiting for them, was another guard and another man. The guard escorting Zelda used his torch to light the empty torches on the walls. Zelda smiled seeing the man there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave us,\" she ordered the guards. They nodded and marched up the staircase, leaving her alone with the stranger. The man had a bald head and wore sunglasses. He had a resemblance to the man who ran the Fishing Pond at Lake Hylia; from their clothes, down to their pot-bellies. He was even caught scratching himself from time to time. Under his right arm was a parcel wrapped in brown cloths and tied with string. \"You have it...Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty,\" the man said. \"I am not comfortable about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I offered you a fortune for that,\" Zelda said stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" the man said stepping back. \"But you see...this particular item...Well it belonged to someone I know. That Green-Hat boy...he...he not only saved my best friend and helped us out of a jam...but he also saved our entire land from complete destruction. I feel bad about giving you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't steal it...It came to you through the usual channels,\" Zelda said. \"From what I've heard...when something in your town is stolen, it eventually finds its way to you...And then you sell it to whoever is willing to buy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...But it still belongs to him,\" the man said. \"...I can't let you have this...for less than double.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled; the man was trying to negotiate with her. \"Done,\" she said. \"You can pick up the rupees shortly. Now hand it over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the man said handing her the package. Zelda took it, earnestly. She untied the string and pulled the cloths back. \"Yes...you did well,\" she told him. In her hands was a grey mask made from some sort of metal. It was a rather important mask. According to Link's stories, this was the Giants' Mask...It's powers were most intriguing. When needed, the mask allowed Link to grow to gigantic size and face the Monsters Twinmold in combat. And now, it was all hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paid the man double what she offered him, just to make him leave. For days she studied the mask. It required the wearer to bear magical powers...There were few in Hyrule to rival her mastery of magic. But more confounding, it's powers seemed to be limited to the secret room where Twinmold was hiding. Zelda attributed this to the markings across the side of the Mask; an incantation binding the mask to the one room. But the magic was definitely inside...She just had to unleash it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the mask to the Royal Smith to have him melt the metal down. She suggested the designs on the mold would be Hylian Texts describing a new incantation. The smith took the order without question. He melted down the magical metal of the mask. Per Zelda's orders, the molds he crafted were to be of a medallion to be worn around the neck and two wrist bracelets to go with it. After days of waiting, the Smith delivered Zelda's new accessories to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incantation read that she would be allowed to use it's powers anywhere she chose; all she need do was to wear all three of them at the same time. Smiling, Zelda readied herself for her quest of power. She slipped the bracelets on first. She could feel something inside was preparing to spring to life. She slowly put the necklace on.</span></div></div>",

The toads, Zits, Pimple, and Rash had foiled many of the dark queen's evil plans, first when she kidnapped Pimple and his girlfriend, Alicia, as well as the time when she went after the double dragon team, along with many other evil schemes that she came up with.  Now, before we move deeper into the plot, who do you wish to be?  Be the dark queen or one of her cronies or do you want to be one of the good guys?  Oh, one other thing is that although this is a GTS story, male characters can become giants as well, if you want them to, which could make things very interesting, especially if they go up against a giant dark queen.

After several years of exile, in outerspace, she decided to set up a base on the moon, after getting ideas from the movie, Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged me, though her base was much bigger than the predecesor with the Moon's core being converted into the main reactor of the base.  Anyways, after escaping from the toads, with a touch of a button, her drilling machine turns into a space ship, and she flys off to the moon and once there, she gathers her minions with her and gives them a briefing of her evil scheme.  \"Listen up, my friends.  Over the last several years, all of my diabolical schemes have been thwarted by the Battletoads, along with their Coach and other friends.  However I have just a plan that just might work.\"  Big Blarg and General Slaughter bring in a big item with a cloth covering into the room.  The Dark Queen continues, \"I have been reading various GTS stories on the internet along with watching the movie,'Honey! I shrunk the Kids', and though amusing, they have giving me this idea.\"  The minions ask, \"what do you plan to do?\"  The Queen gives out a cackle, \"simple, I plan to make myself grow into a giantess and grow all of you guys as well, and with our massive sizes, we will destroy civilization and kill all who oppose us, and in its runes, I will build a new evil kingdom, in which I will rule it all, with an iron fist, that is.\"  There is some laughing in the crowd, and the Dark Queen sneers, \"silence, I will show you how I will grow myself.\"  She beckons for General Slaughter to prepare to unveil her weapon that is clothed in the room.  \"As I told you all, one of the shows that I have been watching is 'Honey, I shrunk the kids', and with the expertise from both General Slaughter and Robo Manis, I built a weapon that is identical to Wayne Lewinksi's size altering machine.  General Slaughter, reveal our new weapon.\"  With that, General Slaughter takes off the veil, and a huge laser gun, much like the one from \"Honey I shrunk the kids\" is displayed.  \"Ahhh!\" the audience says.  The Dark Queen says, \"this weapon has not been used yet, but I stole someone's cat, which I named, Sylvester while I was retriving magma to fuel my weapon on earth.\"  She goes to the ship and brings out a cute looking cat and puts it in the range of the laser gun.  \"I will test this machine's capibility to both shrink and grow things that it shoots on this cat (who seems nervous)\".  General Slaughter had put a small fense within the laser's range so that the cat would not run away before the test is complete and Big Blarg was using the operating mechanisms of the laser, and the Dark Queen continues, \"Big Blarg, go ahead and pour magma into the laser's fuel tank and prepare to fire at the cat.\"  Big Blarg says, \"aye, madam\", and he pours some magma that the dark queen acquired for the size changing laser.  The Dark Queen giggles to herself as she gives the command for Big Blarg to fire the laser, \"set the machine to 'shrink' with the setting at 3 inches and fire at the cat\".  With that, Big Blarg sets the size changing laser to \"shrink\", and fires the laser at the cat.  After a short \"poof\", the cat has shrunk to 3 inches.  The evil organization all marvel at the Dark Queen's latest weapon.  The Queen continues, \"now that the shrinking laser works, we will test the growth laser.  Big Blarg, set the laser to 'grow to...10 feet tall', and fire at the cat again.\"  At that, the big rat (Big Blarg) sets the laser to 'grow' with the size setting at 10 feet, and fires at the cat again.  As with the first test, the second one was successful and there is a big shreek among some of the queen's smaller minions. The cat was now a huge beast.  The cat manages to pounce at one of the onlookers and instinctively devours him, before Big Blarg shrinks the cat back down to normal size.  The dark queen muses at the sight.  \"Excellent, every thing is going as planned.  General Slaughter, get me the president of the United States of America, so that I can threaten the world leaders\".

It feels good to be back home, though it is hot out here in the desert.\"  The other toads agree and enter the base.  The Coach greets them, \"welcome back, how was your trip to the beach in California?\"  Pimple replies, \"it was nice, however the Dark Queen is at it again.\"  The Coach is suprised, \"are you sure?  Since you guys defeated her when she went after the double dragon team, she seems to have disappeared.\"  Zits replies, \"Pimple is right, we saw her with our on eyes, and not only did she send Big Blarg and Robo Manus at us, she was talking about getting magma to fuel some kind of ray gun.  Do you know what she might be up to?\"  Now, the Coach had been interested in the growing/shrinking phenomenon and have seen some of GTS websites while the 'toads were away, and says, \"just as I feared, she might be planning to build a laser gun that either shrinks or grows anything that the laser hits.  Luckily for us, since the Dark Queen went back into exile, we hired a man by the name, Borris to spy on her, and so we can check with him to see what he has seen.\"  With that, they go to a room with a bunch of video cameras and TV screens that enable the team to communicate with eachother via TV screen.  The 'toads and Borris have watches with a built in video camera, small TV screen and a built in microphone and sound system.  The Coach says, \"let's get him on screen.\"  The screen comes on, and a nerdy Russian with glasses was on screen (much like the person in the movie Goldeneye).  He committed espionage during the briefing that the Dark Queen put on and went into a private room in the base when the battletoads used the comlink to reach him.  \"Yeah, what do you want?\"  Borris asked.  The battletoads reply, \"a while back, we sent you to spy on the Dark Queen, and we encountered her while vacationing on one of the beaches in California.  Have you noticed anything unusual yet?\"  Borris replies, \"yes, in fact, I spied on her meeting today with her minions and found out that the Dark Queen has built a size changing laser gun that is the replica of the one that was used in the movie, \"Honey, I shrunk the kids\".  It was scary, first, she was elaborating on a plan to make herself along with her cronies grow into giants and wreak havoc on the Earth, and eventually build a new kingdom in which she would rule as the Evil Queen.  What should I do?\"  The coach says, \"thanks, try to sabatoge the size-changing laser since you are there.\"  Borris happens to have a remote bomb that can sabatoge weapons, and so he says, \"this might be tricky, but I will give it a try.\"  Unfortunatly, little did Borris know, Big Blarg was spying on him from a hidden video camera in the room that Borris was in, and he sent some of the Rat Guards to arrest him, and they started to proceed towards Borris's room.  The Coach cuts the transmission, and says to the 'toads, \"just as I have feared, the Dark Queen is planning to make herself a giantess along with her cronies, and wreak havoc into the earth's cities so that she can take over the world in its ruins.  Luckily I have seen how giants and giantess work in their schemes to destroy things and kill people, and since I have had a feeling that the Dark Queen might try that someday, I have built a bunch of devices and equipment do deal with such a possibility if that were to become real.  Come with me to my lab so I can show you our new gadgets and discuss how  to stop the evil Dark Queen this time.\"  The 'toads agree, \"let's go and stop the Dark Queen once again\".  And as they start to head out, Borris causes the TV phone to chirp, and they answer it, \"come in Coach, Pimple,...\".  The Pimple answers as rat guards enter the room, accompanied by Big Blarg and Robo Manus, that Borris is in.  \"What is it?\"  Borris replies as the guards prepare to arrest him, \"I have been caught, don't worry about me, you must stop the Dark Queen.  Her headquarters is underground on the Moon, you must stop her before-\".  Big Blarg interupts, \"Ah!  Shut up, you spy, Battletoads, I dare you to try an save him, we have set up a sophisticated security system so that not even you can get to him before he is executed, HA HA HA\".  With that the communication gets severed, and the screen goes blank.  The coach gasps, \"uh oh!  They got Borris.  Hang in there, we will try to rescue you.\"  However, they realise that by the time they get to the moon, he would likely have been executed for espionage by the time they get there, so they prepare to come up with a plan to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

George Bush had been watching and asked, \"what do you plan to do with that poor man?\"  The Dark Queen replies, \"I have built a size changing laser gun and I will give you a little demonstration of my weapon of mass destruction as you call it.\"  Bush was puzzled, \"you have built a weapon of mass destruction?  I will send my military to stop  you.\"  The Dark Queen replies, \"stop me eh!  I will allow you to see the execution arena.\"  With that, she brought her communication device with her to the arena.

Do you know what the penalty is for espionage?\"  Borris asks, \"what?  Even if you can kill me, I already told the 'toads what you are planning to do.\"  The Queen smiles, \"that is exactly what I am planning to do, and you have a special case.  Normally, I execute my enemies by a firing squad with my Boss Walker and Robo Manus doing the shooting, but I want to test out this size changing laser on myself.\"  Borris gets nervous, but the Dark Queen is in a hurry to demonstrate her wicked plan.  She gets the president back on screen, and says, \"Mr. President, allow me to show you the effects of this weapon.  Robo Manus, fire the laser!\"  Robo Manus repies, \"yes ma'am\" and fires the laser at the Dark Queen, and she grows to 64 feet.  The president looks in awe and says, \"what do you plan to do with Borris?\"  The Dark Queen replies, \"sentencing him to death for espionage.\"  The president tries to persuade her to reconsider, but she ignores him and with that she picks up Borris and eats him.  He struggles a bit, but he passes out from the lack of air, and later on he dies in her stomach (I won't get into details since is a Rated 13 story, but you get the picture).  The President gets angry at the Queen, \"you sadistic lady, I am going to send people to stop you before you harm anyone else.\"  Robo Manus returns the Dark Queen back to her normal size and she replies, \"try to stop me eh!  Unless if you and the other world leaders relinquish your powers over to me, I will make myself grow into a giantess, along with some of my cronies and I will destroy one metropolitian area a day with my imense size starting with the large cities first until everything on earth is in ruins, and with you all gone, I will build a new evil kingdom in which I rule it all.  For now, me and my men have declared war on you and every single nation unless if you surrender or we obliverate the entire planet!  Ha ha ha!\".

Big Blarg asks, \"what should we do now?\"  The Dark Queen gives an evil smile, \"our planning has ended, it is time to move to phase 2 of our evil plan.  Get Robo Manus, General Slaughter, Boss Walker, and many of my other cronies.  We will make ourselves grow and start wreaking havock on Earth.\"  Big Blag replies, \"with pleasure.\"  Afterwards, she and most of her army, using the laser gun make themselves grow into 100 feet tall giants and prepare to strike earth.  Also little did Borris know, she had built a teleportation system so that she and her army can go places without having to use spaceships or other transportation devices, and she had equipped everyone with watch-like teleportation devices (much like those in the show, Power Rangers) and they prepared to teleport to the first city that we strike.  General Slaughter asks, \"where should we strike first?\"  The Dark Queen replies, \"perhaps we should give the president a little more time to consider my threat before attacking the US directly.  We will attack London first.  Prepare to teleport.  For the rest of you who have not grown, I too have a spy hidden at the Battletoad headquarters, whose name is Carmen Sandiego and she has given me the location of their base, I am sending the rest of you there to kill them.  The 'toads are my biggest obstacle to this scheme, and if you can kill 'em that will make me proud as then there would be no other credible heros to stand in my way, ha ha ha\".  With that, the Dark Queen and all of those who have grown prepare to teleport to London, and the others prepare to teleport to Las Vegas, Nevada (to attack the battletoads).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as the Dark Queen and some of her cronies begin to invade Europe, back at the base, the Battletoads debate how they will stop the evil Dark Queen.  The Coach leads the toads to his labratory that has all of the useful gadgets for battletoad missions.  The Coach says to the toads, \"we do not have much time before the queen attacks, but before you go out to stop her, I will equip you with equipment that will be necessary to stop her\".  Pimple asks, \"how are we going to deal with an evil giant woman planning to wreak havoc on earth?\"  The Coach responds, \"I have been studying the giantess phenonmenon, and suspected that the Dark Queen may try to do something like that some day, luckily I have created devices that will help you beat the dark queen.\"  He starts presenting equipment.  The equipment includes:<br>\r\n1. A vehicle projection device that calls up any of the battletoad vehicles, including jet turbos, jet boards, speed cycles, battle mechs, clinger wingers, tanks, cars, and more, each armed with machine gunes and missiles.  The Coach explains, \"you will need these to get around and they are armed with weapons to eliminate obstacles and enemies that get in your way\".<br>\r\n2. A smaller replica of the Dark Queen's growth changer device, though it is sized more like that of a small calculator, in case if the toads need to grow or shrink.<br>\r\n3. Gastro protection suits, that come as a belt with a button that activates a breatheable suit that protects its users from digestive juices indefinately.  The Coach explains, \"you will need this incase if the Dark Queen or any of her minions decide to eat you alive.  I have seen how giant women will sometimes swallow their victims alive an whole, and let their victims slowly (and often painfully) digest to death, but with this device, should any of you get eaten, you will not die in their digestive systems.\"<br>\r\n3. Comlinks with small tv screens to communicate with the base and other toads'.  They are also equipped with miniture teleportation technology so that they can teleport out of hairy situations if needed.<br>\r\n4.  Light Sabers, to give the 'toads an edge in close combat.<br>\r\n5.  Bomb defusing devices in case if any bombs are planted<br>\r\n6.  Spike balls that are capable of pricking living beings even the size of Elephants, to slow down the Dark Queen and Her minons even as giants.<br>\r\n7.  Laser blasters to shot distant targets<br>\r\n8.  ropes for climbing and rapeling on various surfaces<br>\r\n9.  James Bond style cutting lasers to get out of various situations, including flesh, metal, wire, etc.<br>\r\n10. Miscellaneous items<br>\r\nThe toads awe at the Coach's inventions and thank him for the devices that he gave them and they put them in their packs.  Now, just as they prepare to go after the Dark Queen, the news comes.  \"This is ABC news, I am Sara Pratt,\" the reporter begins.  The 'toads and the Coach go to the news room to see what the report is about, \"I wonder what this is about?\"  They ask.  The reporter continues, \"today, we have reports of a giant woman as well as giant rats, robots, pigs, and rhinos all wreaking havoc in London.  I have sent a journalist, Amber Johnson to investigate.\" The news switches to the scene showing the Dark Queen and her minions going on a rampage in the city, going around destroying buildings, stepping on citizens below, taking Tony Blair hostage, eating Queen Elizabeth as well as other victims and more.  A blonde hair lady comes on the scene, \"hi, this is Amber and I am witnessing a giant woman and a bunch of other giant creatures going around England and terrorizing civilians.  I have never heard of this kind of catastrophe.  In addition, I have recieved word that apparently Tony Blair was taken hostage, and the Queen had been eaten by a large rhino creature that has devoured lots of othe civilians.\"  Amber sees the Dark Queen heading towards her beckoning for her to turn off the TV camera.  Amber tries to run, but the giant woman steps on her and the video camera and the screen goes blank.  The battletoad crew turns off the TV screen before it goes back to Sarah.  Pimple says, \"it looks like the Dark Queen has already started her invasion, lets prepare to stop her.\"  Just as they prepare to get the jet turbos ready to fly, a gang of large rats, pigs, and several other of the Dark Queen's minions enter the headquarters, lead by a large rat with eyeglasses named, Spazz (who was defeated by the Toads when he tried to blow up the dark queen's ship when she kidnapped Pimple and Angelica back in the day).  Spazz says to the 'toads, \"going somewhere?\"  The 'toads look in shock, \"how did you know where to find us?\"  A lady dressed in red with a red hat met up with the 'toads.  She says to the 'toads, \"just as you had sent a spy to the dark queen's base, the Dark Queen sent me to spy on you as well.  I simply gave the Queen your whereabouts, and that is how they came into the base.  I will enjoy killing you all.\"  Rash says, \"why you traitorous scum, I was supicious of you since you were first here.\"  Spazz cuts off the conversation with a sneer, \"as you know, the Dark Queen is off to wreak havoc in the world with the intention of world domination as we speak, a fortune you will not live to see.  If you manage to escape from us, you will lose your base, and if you fight us, London falls.\"  The battletoads are faced with a tough decision, save London or save their hides?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Men/Women attack!\"  The battle begins as Rash slices one of the rats with his saber.  Spazz knocks down Zitz, but Zitz retaliates with a super kick.  Carmen Sandiego (the lady dressed in red with a red hat) tries to attack Pimple, but he slashes her with his lightsaber and she quickly dies.  Soon the battletoads get the upperhand, and Spazz fearing his life decides to escape.  \"I see that you have all grown strong, since our last encounter\"  Spazz says as he heads out, \"I will be back to settle the score.  This battle was merely a distraction for you so that the Dark Queen can begin wreaking havok starting in Europe, and you have lost the first battle. HA HA HA!\".  With that, Spazz and the rest of his men teleport out of the base.  Then the 'toads prepare to head towards london.  \"Rats, that battle was merely a destraction,\"  Pimple says, \"we must go and stop the evil Dark Queen before she wreaks any more havoc.

But, I know that the toads will try to stop me, so lets split up.  I will head towards the United States, Big Blarg, you take out the rest of West Europe as well as North Africa, Robo Manus, you go after Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, General Slaughter, you go after the Middle East and Africa, and man-eating/headbutting rhinos, go after the people in asia.  We will meet up again once the world has been obliberated-.\"  The battletoads arrive to the scene as her minons head out to their assigned targets.  \"Not so fast, Dark Queen,\"  Pimple says, from an intercom in his jet turbo.\"  The Queen replies sarcastically, \"ah, battletoads, we meet again at last.\"  Zitz says, \"you're terror ends here, battletoads prepare to stop her.\"  Zitz starts to shoot at her, but she laughs and says, \"at my immense size, do you really plan to defeat me at your puny size like that?  Take this.\"  With that she slaps Zit's plane and he crashes.  She scoops upt Zitz and says, \"I you will make a nice meal for me along with the the others.\"  She puts him in her mouth and swallows, and sucks the other 2 jet turbos into her mouth and swallows them as well.  But before she could digest them, the toads activate their gastro protection devices and are unaffected by the acids, also Queen Elizabeth is still alive, though unconcious, and so the toads teleport them to the battletoad headquarters.  \"Wha?\"  The dark queen asks, \"how are you not dying?  No matter, I will swallow bricks that will smash you.\"  However, as she prepares to get some bricks from the remaining buildings, the toads teleport out of her body and use the growth device to make themselves grow as well to the size of the Dark Queen.  The Dark Queen says, \"so you have managed to mimick my technology, your comrad Borris was a good espionage artis, but now I will kill you the old fashion way, by a fist fight.\"  With that, she lashes out at the Toads, and they give her a super punch which knocks her back.  Then she morphs into a tornado and knocks them down.  But they get up and use a powerful kick on her. The battle rages on between the Battletoads and the dark queen.  Who wins the first encounter?  You decide.</span></div></div>",

Just go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rpgworldcomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://rpgworldcomic.com/</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood times, Good times. Now hurry make a story.<br>\r\nYou know you want to.<br>\r\n\"Search your feelings, you know it to be true\"</span></div></div>",

Now, please focus on mild vore (even if it\u00b4s only one chapter, and the next one is a \"normal\" GTS chapter again).<br>\r\n1. Keep it (rather) serious and interesting! Above all, there must be good reasons for the events (why is the girl growing? Why is the man shrinking?)<br>\r\n2. Most importantly, keep it clean! No sexual content or adult language! The stories have to be serious somehow, so please follow my advice.<br>\r\n3. Although the story is, ahem, serious, that doesn\u00b4t mean there can\u00b4t be funny events, as long as you keep it interesting.<br>\r\n4. As the title says, mild vore only. No chewing and no digestion.<br>\r\n5. And don\u00b4t end the stories with the main character dying!<br>\r\n6. Most important question: which girls? What game should they come from? Well, everything goes, as long as they\u00b4re from a CONSOLE game. I propose: girls from Final Fantasy, Dead or Alive, Virtua Fighter, Star Ocean, Ridge Racer and so on. But of course, there are more possibilities.<br>\r\nSo, that\u00b4s it. These are the rules. If you are a video game and gts fan, then PLEASE add! I\u00b4m looking forward to reading your chapters!<br>\r\nUpdate! Over 11 000 views and 437 chapters. Not bad. Thanks for adding, reading and rating!</td>",
