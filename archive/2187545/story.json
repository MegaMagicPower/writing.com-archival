Somewhere in the suburbs of Tokyo, a group of friends and family, some of which originating from another galaxy, get themselves involved in regular but exciting hi-jinks. These hi-jinks usually come from the alien frogs, AKA the Keroro Platoon, trying in vain to conquer Earth or Pekopon as they call it. This time, however, things will be different... maybe. Where should we begin to start off the insanity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose a Character: Exactly as it says. Pick someone to be a main protagonist for the story. This selection doubles as a space for anyone who has anyone more ideas of what kind of scenario will be involved once a character is selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Invasion Scheme: The incompetent Sergeant Keroro comes up with a new plan to invade Pekopon. Considering how his plans usually work in needlessly complicated ways, there is a lot of room for something far-fetched to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying with Inventions: The Sergeant Major Kururu, being a mad genius and troll, has made a series of inventions over time that are capable of a wide variety of things. For this type of story, someone has taken one of said inventions for their own purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Mysterious Threat: Every now and then, an occult force will arrive, whether from the stars or in Pekopon itself, to cause trouble or for other reasons. Like the other options, their powers are widely varied and have the ability to tamper with the status-quo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's Go Somewhere: Sometimes, the aliens and their human friends will go to a different setting from their homes to obtain something or just to have fun and relax. Even in another place, they are not safe from the forces of chaos.</span></div></div>",

He is always ready for a battle, even using this as an analogy for scenarios that don't call for it. Despite his willingness to get the job done, he too is as incompetent as the others due to his infatuation for Natsumi getting in the way as well as his unwilling butt-monkey status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three frogs are in the next chapter.</span></div></div>",

On top of having an insatiable craving for sweets, he has an unstable emotional state that leads him vulnerable to having two personalities, especially when his jealousy for Mois is provoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant Major Kururu: The mischievous and mad scientist of the platoon. Despite actually being of a higher rank than Keroro, he contently accepts his position in life and how almost everyone around him is intimidated of his presence. With only Mois' innocent stare and him purposefully complicating Keroro's plans to keep him from going too far, he enjoys being able to do whatever he wants, especially bathing in curry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance Corporal Dororo: The former assassin and reformed ninja of the platoon. Despite his competency as a fighter, there are two things that hinder his ability as an invader. The first problem is that is he is unwilling to go along with any invasion plans that don't involve peaceful and environmentally-friendly means. The second problem is his low aura of presence that makes him really easy to ignore or outright forget, which leads him into a miserable traumatic state mourning how his childhood was no different. </span></div></div>",

She is among Natsumi's best friends if not her very best friend and is more than willing to show her admiration towards her, especially in ways that would expose her out-bringing and lack of experience in normal human society. Seemingly have no parents of her own, she currently lives alonside Dororo in a peaceful cottage out in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngol Mois: She is a girl who is supposedly 2000 years old by our standards who was once prophesied by Nostradamus to be responsible for the apocalypse. She has slept for around 500 years on the planet's orbit in preparation for the big event. However, some convincing from her love interest Keroro, who has looked after her as a child, gets her to delay the whole thing. Being surprisingly kind and approachable, she gets along very well with the humans she befriends to the point they see her as one of them, which is helped from her having at least two humanoid appearances. However, she does regularly help Keroro with his plans and will sometimes even have her \"planet destroyer\" side shine through.</span></div></div>",

Of course, Mois agreed, figuring that it would help her Uncle with the invasion or, at least, give her something to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe joins him to his domain and laboratory deep in the Keroro Platoon's base. In the center of the otherwise empty room is a metal operating table clearly meant for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sit down right here. Kukuku.\" Kururu chuckles and points to the table. For a normal person, being alone with the mad scientist, on top of him speaking in an unusually polite tone, would raise a couple of red flags. However, Mois takes it in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you.\" Mois takes a seat. She crosses her legs to make herself more comfortable on the cold metallic surface. \"So, what neat new invention do you need my help with testing? You could say, crash test dummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKururu chuckles some more. \"Well, actually, I need your help with ___.\"</span></div></div>",

Her unique strength, her light, the Will of the Cosmos, etc. feels stripped out of her. It's almost like she's... Desperate to not think too hard about that, she tries changing into her other form just to be sure. But... it never came. Everything that made Mois an Angolian was left in her old body left in storage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I a Pekopon-jin?!\" She uses the alien word for 'human'. Checking further, it seems that her new body wasn't cloned off of her per-say, but rather Asami, the human she had chosen to model herself after. No matter what she tries, her tan skin and blonde hair is no longer a facade but rather her real body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for the deception, Mois-dono, but it needed to be done,\" a familiar voice calls out to her. From the shadows steps out Keroro, solemn from guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle!\" Mois' hearts tears from the betrayal. She tries to express herself with her powers, but like the rest, that was gone too. From there, she is left to simply bawl into tears. The fact that she didn't have powers anymore, presumably unable to even use her Lucifer Spear, doesn't bother her nearly as much as the fact that her beloved has stripped her of her cherished heritage. Her parents would never have approved of their old friend doing this, would they? \"You did this? But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have a choice,\" Keroro looks away from her tearful eyes. \"The Keron military and intergalactic police force can no longer tolerate a planet destroyer roaming around Pekopon. It was either I had Kururu separate you from your powers or we would have to get rid of you. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see,\" Mois, forced to have a clearer head, thinks it over while wiping away her tears. With the explanation given, this was probably the best choice for her. With her old body in storage and under Kururu's expert care, she can expect that her former identity would remain safe and sound. That and the fact she can still be with her friends is enough to give her some form of calm. However, she still does shed some more tears. Being a planet destroyer is what gave her a lot of passions and hobbies and now she'll have to rebuild herself anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you're one of them now,\" Keroro assures her. \"You're still more than welcome in my Platoon.\" He gives her a small hug. Mois, moved by his kind words, hugs him back with forgiveness in her heart. At least she still has him to give her meaning, but what about the other little details?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Uncle. So...what now?\" she asks her amphibious mentor, to which they quickly come to the conclusion of ___.</span></div></div>",

She could just say 'no, thanks' and forget about it, but she is not quite sure.

Also, yes; you are free to add in ideas that weren't used throughout the franchise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I Could Do My Life Over\" Gun: An infamous large blue blaster that has been used many times to age regress whoever gets hit back in their youth. It must be used again to turn someone back, but that can tricky if it breaks, is low on power, you don't how much younger the victim has become, or, in some cases, the victim has been left younger for more than three hours. Whether the victim retains their memories or not depends on the episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step Onto The Stage Of Adults\" Gun: A pink counterpart of the previous invention. It has been used many times to age progress whoever gets hit. However, unlike the age regression ray, there are never any altered memories, the clothes do not change with the body, and the effects are always temporary, usually wearing off at the most awkward time. That's not to say that you can't use some liberties, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We Can Make Everyone Alive\" Gun: A ray gun that looks a lot like a Bellsprout from Pokemon. It has the power to turn any animals, including the frogs... err Keronians, into humans... err Pekoponians. The effects are usually temporary, but don't let that stop you if you want to write the contrary. Also, there is nothing that suggests that it can't be used for the opposite effect, so go ahead and use this on the hu- Pekoponians too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soul Diver\": It's not a blaster this time. Instead, it is device that allows multiple people to enter another's mind. The person in question is left unconscious in a chamber, leaving their mind vulnerable to be be seen and even altered. It would not be a stretch if anything life changing or threatening happens to the others while in someone's mind.</span></div></div>",

She didn't remember what it was like when she was a baby, at least, not for certain, but she guessed that it was a more innocent and care free time. She wanted to be a bit more care free now that she had some time off. Besides, she felt this could be an inspiring experience for her manga work. So once she fixed the settings and fired upon herself, she began to get much smaller, though from her perspective, it seemed the world got much bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gun did its work, time seemed to rewind as her adult shape reverted to a much younger state, adult curves giving way to baby fat, and her arms and legs getting shorter and chubbier. Eventually, Aki found herself sitting with her clothing pooled around her, but that too started to shrink down, changing to fit with her new age. What was once a beautiful woman now sat an adorable baby girl, wearing a cute little green dress, a tiny ponytail and a diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly adult Aki held her hands up to her face and was surprised to find them small and chubby rather than slender. And as she looked down at her feet, she couldn't help but find them rather fascinating. She started wiggling her toes and then playing with them. She started rocking back and forth on her little tush as she held onto her little feet, before she leaned backwards too far and then fell onto her back. While she was momentarily startled by this, she wasn't hurt. Instead, she giggled as her legs kicked the air. Something about this all felt so fun to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aki sat back up, she managed to find a mirror that was down to her level and crawled over to it. She stared at the strange figure looking back at her for a bit. It resembled a baby girl with a cute green dress, a little ponytail, and a diaper, like what she was wearing. She began playing around with her hair a little, almost as if some of her adulthood still remained somewhere, and the strange figure did the same. She then looked at the figure curiously while holding a finger to her mouth, and the strange figure did the same. She sat up a little, leaned closer, then placed her hands on the mirror, and the strange figure did the same. <i>Her hands feel like glass</i>, thought Aki. Then she suddenly realized something. The figure in the mirror... was her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki fell onto her back giggling again, before getting up and looking back at her reflection. She couldn't believe just how cute she now was. It had been quite some time since she saw some pictures of herself like this, and as she posed and looked herself over, it was quite hypnotizing to see herself like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered, she wanted to be able to enjoy this more youthful state while she could, and she didn't want to waste all her time in front of a mirror. The world awaited for her! Well, as much of the world as she could reach in her tiny grasp, that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do now?</span></div></div>",

But first, she had to see if she was still capable of walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Aki began to slowly lift herself up on shaky legs. She stood up for a bit before losing her balance and falling on her padded rear. Aki was surprised to find that standing was a little more difficult at this age than she thought. Still, she tried again. The second time, when she attempted to move forward after standing up, she fell onto her tummy. She could feel tears forming in her eyes, but she quickly dried them off with her arm and put on a brave face. Finally, after sitting back up, she pulled herself up to a standing position using the leg of a nearby table. She held onto the leg for a bit before letting go. After finding her balance, Aki took a step forward. Then another. And another. She finally went quite a distance before falling again. Undeterred, she quickly got back up and stayed up. From there, she was wondering if she could explore the house and see what it was like from a toddler's perspective, or if she could go outside and see if she could find something fun there, even if she was unsupervised. It sounded quite daring, but then again, the former sounded nice, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

Save for the mad scientist Kururu, whom agrees to work together with Tamama for his own amusement, Tamama keeps his intentions hidden. After getting the happy-go-lucky girl inside the device, he musters up the courage to go inside her mind in hopes of nullifying her as a romantic rival.</span></div></div>",

Here are some canonical locations if you are interested in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkina Hinata's Home: The home of Aki's mother and, by extension, Natsumi and Fuyuki's grandmother. Taking place in a serene secluded area in the forest, her family and their alien friends would often go out of their way to visit her. However, even there, there is room for insanity to appear in the form of reappearing memories, forest spirits, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien Street: An underground shopping district hidden beneath Inner Tokyo. Solely populated with aliens, and the few humans allowed to enter as long as they are under disguise, it is a reliable place for the alien characters to be themselves and collect supplies. Some services, food, and artifacts there may be a bit too much for human comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoinaka Beach: Every summer, the cast would hang out at the beach to enjoy the water or relax under the sun. As long as there is an adult to supervise or one of the human characters gets age progressed, Aki does not mind if her children and their friends go off on their own. At the same time, everyone who goes to the beach are invited to participate in heavily publicized contests to win special prizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissho Academy: Usually, while the aliens have the Hinata Household all to themselves, the younger human characters would be at junior high. Usually, Natsumi can count on being at school to allow herself a break from dealing with the frogs and their hi-jinks; however, luck is often not on her side. She, her brother Fuyuki, and their friends would have to be extra diligent to keep themselves from seeming suspicious in cases where the frogs do arrive to cause trouble.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just asking what should happen next seems like lazy writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Do not make any chapters that end the interactive. If someone can keep the story going, then let them keep it going. If a narrative concludes in a \"beginning to middle to end\" fashion, then simply allow people to make a sequel or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) The entries you make can be concise, but they must get to the point as soon as all necessary questions are answered. There are too many chapters in other interactives that would have characters getting age regressed and then ask what specific age they will become instead of what whether they are turned into a baby or a little kid or whatever. As soon as the characters, setting, and circumstance has been established, I want everyone involved to get right into the story instead of wasting good chapter space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Don't be intimidated from the content rating. I simply made it this way to allow more artistic freedom. That said, I will apply some standards regarding said rating. If I find anything I deem inappropriate or get notified for anything that is deemed as such, I will have to take necessary action in order to remedy the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) By adding content to this interactive, you consent that I have the right to edit or delete your work if it breaks any of the other rules or if the grammar is just that bad. I will not penalize people for grammar and spelling mistakes and will leave minor errors alone unless you wish to request me to fix your own content for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, as usual, please feel free to contribute and enjoy.</td>",
