He looked around, trying to see if anyone other than his wife and daughter were home, expanding his senses to see if someone was playing a prank on him.  He frowned, sensing no one, not even the slightest trace of his faster friends' ki.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stared at the small black box with the cookie-shaped button on it.  \"Weird...\"  Krillian said.  The short, black-haired, seemingly noseless young man was tired of weird.  After fighting in a tournament for the fate of the multiverse and almost immediately after that helping fight and reform yet ANOTHER of Dr. Gero's insane creations, he wanted to be done with weird.  But nooo, weird just kept coming to him.  He debated calling in his wife, the tall, gloriously sexy battle goddess Android 18 (real name Lazuli, but she had long since decided to go by 18.  He'd made a joke about that being her age forever as well as her name.  She'd patted him on the head and complimented him on being so easy to train).  But she was more of a fighter, so she probably wouldn't know what to do about the strange button either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained,\" he said, pressing the button, which clicked.  A chocolate chip cookie appeared next to it.  \"Huh,\" he said after a long moment, taking the cookie and eating it.  \"Tasty!  Reminds me of that dream Goku told me about, where he found a button that made muffins...\"  He chuckled.  \"I must have found a cookie button!\"  He pressed it again, making another cookie and eating it.  </span></div></div>",

Managing a bar and restaurant on the living island that was now the home for all Mutantkind, Krakoa, he got to make friends with everyone, including people who he fought before.  It was shocking, and oh so amusing to see people like Wolverine talking with Apocalypse like they were long-lost friends.  He was glad that the mutant in-fighting seemed to be over.  The last time he participated in a mutant battle he got locked away in an alternate reality that forbade relationships beyond casual friendship and forbade sex as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor a hedonist like himself, it was blasphemy.  Although he did start a relationship with Psylocke, a sexy British telepath, while in that world.  It hadn't continued once they were free, but Fred cloudn't help but notice that Psylocke was a lot nicer to him than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had come to expect the unexpected on this island, so finding the strange box with the cookie-shaped button on it didn't rattle him much.  Curious, he pressed it, a chocolate chip cookie popping out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Huh,\" he said after a moment, daintly picking the cookie in his fat fingers and tossing it into his mouth.  \"Pretty good.\"  He made a few more cookies for himself, and went to open the restaurant for the day.  His first customers were Wolverine, Storm, and Psylocke, who was wearing her Captain Britain uniform and looking VERY uncomfortable in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hey Freddy,\" Wolverine said, guiding the two women over to the bar.  \"Three of your special loaded omelettes, and a bottle of the good stuff for me.\"  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tFred chuckled.  \"What, you're double-dipping now?  I thought you, Jean, and Scotty had a threesome thing going on,\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStorm, ever dignified, just smirked, while Psylocke giggled.  Wolverine rolled his eyes.  \"C'mon.  A guy can't take two of his female friends out for breakfast without it being a date?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFred chuckled, giving Wolverine his beer and going to work on the omelettes.  \"We ain't allowed to fight each other anymore, so I gotta get my jabs in somehow.  I still got claw marks on my butt I owe you for,\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWolverine snorted.  \"Never change, fatso,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStorm noticed the button first.  \"What's that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Magic cookie button,\" Fred said.  \"Figured one of the geniuses invented it or something and just left it here.  Maybe Apocalypse, he was in here yesterday... Anyway.  You click the button and it makes cookies appear.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStorm frowned as Psylocke brought the button over.  \"It is unwise to just randomly press buttons, Frederick,\" the weather-controlling mutant said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I had a few cookies,\" Blob said.  \"No ill effects, and I could tell if they were poisoned.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCurious, but still worried, Wolverine pressed the button a few times.  He took one of the cookies and ate it.  After a moment, he shook his head.  \"He's right.  They're damn good, but that's it.  I don't feel my healing factor reacting to anything.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStorm and Psylocke traded looks, and shrugged, trying the cookies.  He was right, they were good.</span></div></div>",

To say that it was at the ass end of nowhere would also be an understatement.  The small unit of troopers, all belonging to the international terrorist organization known as Cobra, wondered why they were there.  The ones who were especially wondering were the high ranking officers, which included a Scottish laird who ran an arms supplier, a beautiful woman with black hair who was also the world's greatest spy, a mad scientist in a black cloak and purple pants, and a pair of twins in lightly armored suits, one bearing a scar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDestro, Baroness, Dr. Mindbender, and the Crimson Twins, Tomax and Xamaot, all stared at their organization's leader, the madman known as Cobra Commander.  They weren't used to him being this confident, this calm.  Normally, he was stomping about, screaming about the lack of progress they were making in taking over the world, none of it his own fault.  It was something they were all used to.  Something they all found funny.  A way of making the defeats go down easier, as the Commander's histrionics were always entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut lately, he had been calm.  Quiet and composed.  He made ploys against G.I. Joe, the elite anti-terrorism unit created to fight them, but they felt more like distractions than anything else.  He used his own funds, not drawing on the funds Cobra used to keep their operations moving, to research his little project.  And now he had completed it.  He had invited along his most frequent allies, the ones who worked with him the most.  He wanted them to see the fruits of his labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA black plastic toy that had a button in the shape of a cookie on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...\"  Baroness was the first to stop staring, removing her glasses and rubbing the bridge of her nose in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So let us get this straight,\" Tomax said.  \"You brought us out here.  To the middle of nowhere.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tXamot, the scarred brother, took up where his brother left off, waving away a mosquito.  \"In a jungle filled with mosquitos and malaria.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"To look at something,\" Tomax continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That you could have found,\" Xamot added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"IN A MCDONALD'S HAPPY MEAL,\" the brothers finished in unison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDestro decided to be diplomatic.  \"...Sir, perhaps you have been tricked?  That someone else has already been here and stolen the actual artifact?\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No,\" Cobra Commander said, unfazed by their anger.  \"This is what I was supposed to find here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Mindbender sighed.  \"And what, may I ask, is that supposed to be?\" he asked.  He was willing to accept a lot, but he did have limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The key to our domination of the world... and to destroying it if need be,\" Cobra Commander said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDestro rolled his eyes.  \"We are leaving,\" he said.  \"This is stupid.  I have had more than enough...\" He and the others, soldiers and officers alike, all trailed off as they turned around.  The door to the temple had closed.  Except there hadn't BEEN a door before.  Slowly, the nervous Cobras all turned back to the Commander, who's smile was visible even through the faceless helmet he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Do you recognize these statues?\" he said, gesturing around at the gathering of giant busts, each one a different platform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...No, Commander,\" Baroness said.  She wanted to threaten the Commander and get him to let them go, but a sudden bout of survival instinct hitting both her and the other gathered soldiers was keeping her from drawing her weapon.  \"Do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It took me forever to find out their names,\" Cobra Commander said, starting to walk around the temple.  He paused at the first bust, an image of an older man with a hand raised, looking away as if denying something.  \"This one is Holobore, the Spirit of Asceticism.\"  He moved to the next, an image of a man with a wide opened mouth.  \"Vomitrax, the spirit of Decadence.\"  The next bust was of a reptilian head, razor-fanged mouth open in a roar.  \"Godzamok, the Spirit of Ruin.\"  The next was an almost clown-like face, sporting a long nose.  \"Cyclius, the Spirit of Ages.\"  The next bust was of a plump-faced man blowing a party favor.  At first glance it had looked like a tongue. \"Selebrak, the Spirit of Festivities.\"  The next was a gemstone eye inside a floating ring.  \"Dotjeiess, the Spirit of Creation.\"  A sinister-looking statue was next, looking almost like a worm and a gorgon mixed together.  \"Skruula, the Spirit of Scorn.\"  Next was a owl's head with two rods behind it.  \"Muridal, the Spirit of Labor.\"  Next was a widely smiling cow's head, larger than all the others.  For some reason, Baroness felt her breasts ache when she looked at it.  \"Mokalsium, the Mother Spirit.\"  After the cow was a gear, Cobra Commander pausing.  \"...This one I'm not sure of the translation on.  I think it's... Jarami?  Jeremy?  Something to that effect.  This one is the Spirit of Industry.\" The final one was an older man with a deep from on his face.  \"And finally, Rigidel, the Spirit of Order.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander turned to the others.  \"This device?  Its called the Cookie Clicker,\" he said.  He waited for the snarky responses, but other than expressions of confused disbelief, they said nothing.  The doors closing on them had made them cautious.  He smiled at that.  \"These cookies that the clicker can produce, and the number WILL go up the more it is used, are delicious beyond compare.  So good, they're ridiculously addictive without need of drugs or brainwashing.  We can use this to enslave the world to Cobra.  We just need to be careful of the hazards of using it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What...\" Tomax asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Hazards?\" Xamot finished, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The workers.  You'll know when you see them,\" Cobra Commander said.  \"I'll explain as things escalate.  But for now, I'll do most of it on my own.\"  He chuckled, looking up at the statues.  \"I wonder...\" he said softly.  \"I wonder if past wielders of the Clicker knew what they were getting into.\"  He held it up, as if offering it in tribute to the gathered gods.  \"I wonder if they've ever had someone WANT to take the risk.  Who WANTED to unless the clicker's power on the world.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTo the fright of the gathered Cobras save the Commander, the statues all turned to look at the Commander, their eyes glowing.  Cobra Commander laughed.  \"That's right.  I knew what I was getting into.  I know about the dangers of the workers.  I know what this will do to the world.  And I.  Don't.  CARE.  Either I rule, or the world dies.  Nothing else is acceptable.  And finally, <i>finally</i>, I have the means to get what I want.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe statues of the gods smiled.  And the doors to the temple disappeared, the Cobras too enraptured by what they were seeing to notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander chuckled, holding out his hand.  \"With a single click, I seal our destiny.  Let Cobra's Cookie Corner open for business.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>Click.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ah well, no harm done.\"  He clicked it a few more times and removed his faceplate.  \"Anyone want cookies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Didn't you say-\" Dr. Mindbender started to say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Addictive?  Yes.  But only if you let them be.  Same as any drug.  You're all reasonably intelligent people,\" he said, shocking everyone at the compliment.  \"So I think you'll be fine.\"  He popped a cookie into his mouth and ate it, smiling.  \"Mmmm, that's tasty.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReluctantly, Baroness, Destro, Tomax, Xamot, and Mindbender all took a cookie from the pile in the Commander's hand.  They tried them... and admitted that they were quite tasty.  Baroness fidgeted, adjusting her top slightly, her breasts becoming oddly uncomfortable.

May I have another?\" Mindbender said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Certainly,\" the Commander said.  He created some more cookies, everyone taking another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCrunching on their cookies, Tomax and Xamot quietly talked to one another in that mysterious way twins have.  After a moment, Xamot spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"An interesting idea, Commander.  We're clearly dealing with magic, yes, but how do you intend to create enough cookies to meet the growing demand you anticipate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"In addition,\" Tomax added, \"Where will you store the cookies once you have a substantial amount?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Plus there is variety to consider,\" Xamot chimed in.  \"Chocolate chip is all well and good, but customers enjoy variety.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The device has a function that will create facilities to make cookies, workers to sell and craft cookies, and something to automatically click for me, the facilities increasing the mount of cookies created per second and per click,\" the Commander said.  \"In addition, my research states that the more the device is used, the greater the variety of cookie will appear.  As for storage excess?  Supposedly, once enough cookies are made, they will all be contained in a bank with infinite storage capacity, which can be withdrawn from at will.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTomax and Xamot traded looks.  \"It... could work...\" Xamot said hesitantly.  \"I find myself wanting another cookie, several other cookies, even though I know I shouldn't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTomax nodded.  \"Cookies are a legitimate operation, so G.I. Joe would have no reason to suspect it... We could still call it Cobra's Cookie Corner in our files, but we'd need a less obvious name.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMindbender smacked his lips, still tasting the chocolate.  \"...I want to interview these workers when you summon them,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander nodded.  \"I'm sure they'll be glad to meet someone like you.  Just be respectful.  There's warning related to them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMindbender snorted.  \"Isn't there always?\" he asked, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDestro noticed Baroness fidgeting with her top.  \"Something wrong, my dear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBaroness frowned, shaking her head.  \"I don't know...\" she said, not noticing the look of amusement Cobra Commander gave her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Is... Is that really it?\" said a Viper.  Cobra Commander stared at the one who spokes, his comrades stepping back away from him in anticipation of his grisly death.  The other officers just glared disdainfully at the upstart Viper as he stepped forward.  \"We came all the way out here... for a cookie scheme?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This business,\" Tomax said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Costs money,\" Xamot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's unusual,\" Tomax said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"But this scheme,\" Xamot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Looks like it will bring profit that we need,\" the brothers finished in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"But its COOKIES!

The Viper's stomach rapidly inflated, the frightened soldier falling to his back in agony as more and more cookies appeared in his stomach.  The Viper's belly grew like a balloon, skin audibly stretching, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i><b>SPLORCH</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCookies, blood, and bits of stomach and intenstine flew out of the Viper's stomach as he exploded, Destro, Baroness, Xamot and Tomax stepping back to avoid the blood spray.  The Viper died instantly, slumping over and collapsing as he bled out, the cookies in his stomach covered in red.  The other Vipers all stared in horror, while Dr. Mindbender, not caring about the blood on his boots, stepped forward to look the corpse over, fascinated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hmph,\" Xamot said.  \"Dumb enough to confront his Commander.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"He's lucky to have gotten off,\" Tomax added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So easily,\" the brothers finished in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hm...\" Destro said, stroking his metal-armored chin.  \"A weapon that can teleport something directly into the body of a target...\"  He began to draft designs in his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander chuckled.  \"Anyone else think cookies are stupid now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"SIR NO SIR!\" the terrified Vipers chorused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can we leave now?\" Baroness asked.  \"I feel strange here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander nodded.  \"Yeah,\" he said.  \"This place smells like mold.  Let's go home, everyone.  We have plans to make.\"  He looked to the dead Viper.  \"Leave him.  Take his wallet and his gear.  The jungle can have him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Mindbender, dusting himself, stood up, he and the other officers immediately forgetting about the dead Viper as he bled over the cookies in his stomach.

It had taken her a few minutes to lose the tail Destro had placed on her, but she was the best at her job for a reason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe had chosen the chief Medi-Viper, Scalpel, to be the one to examine her.  He generally went on missions with the Commander due to his skills as a doctor, being extraordinarily talented in almost every field of medicine.  He lacked anything resembling mercy or bedside manner (which worked well for him when Dr. Mindbender requested his help), but he did have a survival instinct, so he knew when to be respectful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shivered as she sat, topless, in Scalpel's lab.  Her breasts itched, and felt bloated.  Ever since that damn temple, her boobs had been feeling strange.   \"You are lucky, doctor.  Not many get the privilege to see my naked breasts,\" she said, sneering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, believe me, I'm enjoying the show,\" Scalpel said, chuckling as she growled at him.  \"But let's get down to business.  I know why your breasts feel off.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And why is that?\" Baroness demanded.  Why were all doctors offices cold?  Plus her nipples were starting to feel tingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're lactating.  Heavily,\" Scalpel said.  At Baroness's shocked look, he nodded.  \"I say heavily because your breasts are getting bigger.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This... This cannot be possible,\" Baroness said.  \"I am not pregnant!\"  She hesitated, and asked, \"Am I?  Destro and I have talked about it, but we agreed that it wasn't the right time, that we should wait until things have calmed down...  We've been active, but we've been careful...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScalpel shook his head.  \"That was the first thing I checked for, and no, you don't have a little metalhead on the way,\" he said, ignoring Baroness's glare.  \"I'm a little stumped, as there are few triggers that could cause this much lactation in such a short time.  What happened today?  Why are we even at this Terrordrome?  What did the Commander want in this jungle?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBaroness scowled, slumping a little, wincing as her heavy breasts jiggled.  She tried to tell herself that it was her imagination that they were getting larger as she watched them.  \"...Cobra Commander had heard legends of a magical device which could make cookies at will.  One with apparently catastrophic potential.  He wants to use it to take over the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sounds zany enough for the Commander.  He's the only one I know who'd try to turn cookies into a doomsday device.  But I'm guessing there's more to it,\" Scalpel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The device was in a temple,\" Baroness said.  \"Filled with busts of gods I'd never heard of.  The magic was definitely real, because the statues LOOKED at the Commander as he ranted.  One of them, a cow-headed goddess named Mokalsium... I swear it was looking at me as we left...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScalpel blinked.  \"A cow-headed goddess... named Mokalsium.\"  He looked down at his charts for a moment, looking at Baroness's biometrics.  \"A Mother spirit, I'm guessing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's how the Commander described her.  Why?\" Baroness asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Say that name slowly.  Separate the first syllable from the rest of the name,\" Scalpel suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBaroness frowned.  \"Mo kalsium,\" she said.  \"I don't see how... wait-\" She then realized the pun in the name.  \"MORE CALCIUM?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, I think Mokalsium may have given you a bit of a blessing,\" Scalpel said.  \"And possibly more.  Looking at your biometrics, I can tell that your reproductive system is in VERY fine shape, your ovaries producing eggs by the cartonload.  You may also find yourself becoming more easily aroused.  And... uh... well, have you heard of the concept of avatars?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...\" Baroness's heart was racing.  She did NOT like where this was going.  \"Where someone channels the spirit and form of a mythological being, yes.  You are suggesting that I may have been chosen as Mokalsium's avatar?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'd start checking your head for horn growths,\" Scalpel said, trying to hide his growing amusement.  \"And, I know this seems indelicate, but I REALLY suggest you start milking yourself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"HOW!?\" Baroness demanded, suddenly very aware of how jiggly and large her breasts were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There are breast pumps,\" Scalpel said.  \"I have them in stock for mothers at all our bases.  In addition, you could just stand over the sink and squeeze your boobs like an udder.\"  He dodged the medical tool Baroness threw at him.  \"As for Destro... whether or not you tell him is up to you.  I'm not a romantic in the slightest, but I'd think he'd prefer to know BEFORE his beloved starts <i>mooing</i>.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"MOOING!?\" Baroness shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Cow-headed goddess.  Plus your currently milky funbags,\" Scalpel said, leaning up against a wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBaroness staggered, clutching her head in confusion and fear.  She shook her head angrily, getting dressed and punching Scalpel in the shoulder as she stormed out.  She ignored the doctor's mocking call of \"You're welcome!\"  She didn't bother threatening him to stay quiet, as that survival instinct of his would make him fold at the slightest hint of torture.  She REALLY didn't want to tell this to Destro, as it was both embarrassing and frightening, but she knew he'd find out eventually.  She was scared.  She felt helpless, powerless.  These feelings made her MAD.  And she knew who's fault it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Cobra Commander...\" she snarled, ignoring everyone she came across.</span></div></div>",

Every bounce, every slosh of her enlarging breasts made her angrier and angrier.  A pair of Crimson Guardsmen tried to stop her as she approached.  She put the first one's head through a wall, his helmet the only thing keeping him from getting killed instantly (he would later give the armorer a huge tip after his concussion healed), and the second she used as a battering ram to smash open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was when she saw the old lady that she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Baroness here to see you, Commander,\" the Crimson Guardsman said dazedly from where he lay on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander nodded.  \"So I noticed.  Permission to pass out granted.\"  He mainly allowed it because it looked like he was about to faint anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Thank you, sir,\" the Guardsman said as he slumped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old lady in the Cobra Trooper uniform giggled.  \"Fun stuff,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Who... who is this?\" Baroness said, staring at the old woman.  She seemed normal enough, but there was something oddly 'off' about her.  She looked vaguely like Betty White, but not quite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This?\" Cobra Commander said, gesturing to the old woman.  \"This is one of the 'workers' I mentioned.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...The workers are old women?\" Baroness asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander nodded.  \"Yeah.  She just appeared in this outfit, but the rest will have other clothes.  Since she's first, she'll be the coordinator.  Adorable little old ladies who will bake and sell our cookies.  They call themselves Grandmas, but that's not what they are,\" he said.  For some reason, that particular phrasing filled her with dread.  \"I presume you have good reason for bursting into my private quarters unannounced?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want to talk about what happened at the temple today,\" Baroness said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's probably because the goddess Mokalsium chose her as her avatar,\" the old woman said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander blinked.  \"...Wait, what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBaroness blushed brightly.  \"THAT is what I want to talk about.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old woman snickered.  \"It's actually quite an honor.  Mokalsium hasn't chosen an avatar in generations,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I do not CARE,\" Baroness said.  \"I am turning into a MILK COW!  I will be useless as a spy if my breasts get too big and I grow horns!  There has to be a way to fix this!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sorry,\" the old lady said.  \"No going back from this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There has to be a way!\" Baroness demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old lady, who looked more and more amused, chuckled, shaking her head.  \"Nope.  Plus side to this, though?  You'll get worshipped once the temples start getting built,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBaroness snarled angrily, looking ready to murder someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander, to his credit, looked embarrassed, despite the audible amusement in his tone.  \"Yeah, I didn't see this coming... Um... You'll get paid time off until we can figure out something to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBaroness decked him, storming off.  The old lady stood up, looking at Cobra Commander's prone form, the metal mask dented from the force of the punch.  \"You do realize you deserved that, don't you?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCobra Commander removed his mask and chuckled.  \"Oh, I deserve much worse,\" he said.</span></div></div>",

A master detective who was just recently starting to appreciate her feminine side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey had saved the world.  Through their powers, the mystical abilities known as Personas, they had discovered the truth behind a series of murders and prevented the world from disappearing forever into fog.  Working with others, they had defeated a fire god who wanted to burn everything.  And they stopped a goddess with a fundamental misunderstanding of bonds from enslaving their town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey were completely at a loss as to what to think about the mysterious button that had appeared on Yu's nightstand the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...I can't detect anything anomalous about it,\" Rise said, mildly disturbed that she could use her Persona on it.  \"Granted, there's the fact that I could summon Kouzeon in the first place...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Examining the mechanics suggests that it's just a button that will make a clicking noise when you press it,\" Naoto said, the shortstack detective having taken the machine apart and put it back together without incident.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why a cookie for a button, though?\" Yosuke asked.  \"It's just weird.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What do you think, Naoto?\" Chie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't know,\" Naoto said.  At the look on Yosuke and Chie's face, Naoto frowned.  \"I don't know, okay?  I need more evidence before I can make a conclusion.  I can't just go 'abracaboop' and get an answer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYu pressed the button.  It made an oddly satisfying clicking sound.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then a chocolate chip cookie appeared next to the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...The fuck?\" Kanji said.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tYukiko began giggling.  \"'Abracaboop,'\" she said, her gigglefit turning into full on laughter as she started to double over, falling onto the couch.  \"Abracaboop, and a cookie appears!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNaoto rolled her eyes.  Yosuke just stared.  \"Huh... Magic cookie button,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A clicker that makes cookies,\" Chie said.  \"A Cookie Clicker.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYu picked up the cookie.  \"...\" He stared at it thoughtfully for a long moment, waiting for Yukiko's gigglefit to calm down.  ...And then he ate the cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone watched him, worried.  Yu chewed the cookie slowly, and swallowed.  After a moment, he shrugged.  \"It's a cookie.  It's tasty,\" he said.  He clicks it a few more times, making a cookie for everyone.  Reluctantly, the gathered young people ate their cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlmost immediately, they fell in love.  \"Mmm!\" Yosuke said.  \"That's pretty damn good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nice!  Reminds me of my ma's,\" Kanji said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Beary tasty!\" Teddie proclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYukiko licked crumbs off of fingers.  \"That's amazing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"These are so great!\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYu nodded.  \"Pretty good, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNaoto smiled.  \"Well, it's interesting.  I'd like to study the device a bit more, though,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYu nodded, and handed the clicker to Naoto.  As soon as Yu's hand left the device, though, the Clicker reappeared in front of Yu, disappearing from Naoto's hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Well, that's ominous,\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYu frowned.  \"Maybe it only works for me?  Everyone press it, see what happens,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne by one, Yu's friends pressed the button, a chocolate chip cookie appearing next to the device.  Teddie was the last to press the button... and it sprayed cookie crumbs in his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...\" Teddie blinked, brushing the crumbs out of his face.  \"...Must have been a glitch.  Everyone go again.\"  Again, everyone got a cookie except Teddie, who got a spray of crumbs in his face.  \"...I don't think it likes me,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYosuke laughed.  \"Finally, I'm not the butt of the joke for once,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Easy for you to say!\" Teddie grumbled, flailing.  \"You got cookies and I didn't.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYu chuckled, and clicked the button a couple times.  \"Here,\" he said, handing the bear spirit the cookies.  \"Enjoy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"At least senpai cares,\" Teddie said, teary-eyed with happiness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNaoto ate one of her cookies, resolving to keep the other one for study.  Although she finds herself oddly hungry...  \"For now, let's just keep this to ourselves.  Yu, try seeing if the clicker can create other kinds of cookies.  And if there's anything else odd about it.  Talk to Marie and see if it has any connection to the Velvet Room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYu nodded, looking at the Clicker in a mix of curiosity and worry.  \"Right,\" he said.  The group went their separate ways, having other things to do today.  But Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Teddie, Kanji, Rise, and Naoto found themselves unable to stop thinking about the Clicker's cookies.  </span></div></div>",

They technically weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone participating in the Battle Royale lived on a vast, ever-growing artificial island, with special territories in place for certain competitors.  They would get into pods and have their bodies broadcasted to the battle island, which existed in a constant state of flux, allowing people to use special 'pickaxes' to 'harvest' building materials, a strange storm constantly looping in over the island over the course of a day's battle to serve as an incentive for moving inward.  They could also 'consume' items like food and healing measures by miming an action of drinking/eating/using the medical supplies to make them affect their avatars.  The bodies could feel pleasure like normal human bodies (there were rumors that some people had sex while competing in their avatars), but not pain.  Which meant that a bullet to the brain was just annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe avatars were used for the smaller party island as well.

He sat next to a woman in a pink, furry suit with a pink bear mascot head with googly eyes.  The Baker flexed his fingers, amazed at how real his avatar felt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bear-masked woman chuckled.  \"First time?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah,\" the Baker said, shaking the head she offered.  \"Didn't know things were this realistic.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You'll get the hang of it,\" the woman said.  \"The name's Cuddle Team Leader.  I've been in the Battle Royale almost since it started.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nice,\" the Baker said.  \"I'm going by Cookie Man.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCuddle Team Leader looked him over, noticing the prominent cookie motif in his outfit and gear.  \"Appropriate,\" she said, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Baker grinned.  He was silently glad that the Clicker had manifested with his avatar, so he could test it safely in the storm.  He imagined Cuddle Team Leader's buxom, athletic form bloated with fat, her mind broken by need for cookies... No.  Time for that later.  He was getting ahead of himself.  \"Anyway.  Anything I need to know about?  I've been briefed on healing items and guns.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCuddle Team Leader nodded.  \"Yeah.  Most of the cars and trucks around the island are drivable. There's also boats and helicopters too.  Boats have a missile launcher, but helicopters are unarmed.  There's been a bit of a war between two spy factions, a guy named Midas flooding the island in an attempt to control the storm.  Water's drained, but Midas lost almost all his territory on the game island, reduced to nothing but the Fortilla.\"  She called up a hologram of the game island map from her wrist device.  \"Chaos Agent and his faction control most of the island now from this center place.  The Authority.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Baker nodded.  \"Chaos Agent's that black blob thing in the suit, right?  He's creepy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, best to stay away from him,\" Cuddle Team Leader said, shivering.  \"Anyway.  There's holographic NPCs on the island, called Henchmen, in three different places, ruled over by a Boss NPC that's based on one of the competitors.  Ocean, one of Midas's people, runs the Fortilla, and commands GHOST henchmen.  Jules, who I THINK is connected to Midas despite being one of Chaos Agent's people, runs the Authority, and commands SHADOW henchmen.  And finally, Kit, who's just friggin' cute, runs Catty Corner, and has henchmen based on Sparkplug.\"  She pointed to a robot with a toaster for a head sitting a couple seats ahead of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Kit's that kitten on the robot body, right?\" the Baker asked.  \"What's his story?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCuddle Team Leader giggled.  \"He's actually the son of one of Midas's people.  An anthropomorphic cat named Meowscles.  He's pretty much the brain to his father's brawn,\" she said.  She briefly turned serious.  \"Don't ask me who the mother is.  I don't know and I'm trying not to think about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Baker chuckled.  \"No worries.  So, just avoid those areas, then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You can knock down the henchman and use them to open chests and doors that have a seal on them.  Also?  The bosses have REALLY great gear,\" Cuddle Team Leader said.  \"Two weapons instead of one like before the flood.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh yeah?  What do they have?\" the Baker said.  The bus, after looping around when it took off from the 'lobby' island, started towards the battle island itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ocean's boss version has got this enhanced Burst AR, plus a chug jug that refills itself automatically,\" Cuddlte Team Leader said.  \"I like to try for that one, personally.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Endless free heals?  Definitely a good deal,\" the Baker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The Jules boss has a tommy gun, like the Midas boss did, but she also has a grappler pistol with infinite charges that automatically summons a glider for you after you launch,\" Cuddle Team Leader said.  \"Word of warning, that one is EXTREMELY popular.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I can imagine why,\" the Baker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The Kit boss has a souped-up charge shotgun and a grenade launcher that shoots shockwave grenades,\" Cuddle Team Leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I read about those.  Shame the launcher's the only source of them now,\" the Baker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Amen, brother,\" Cuddle Team Leader said.  \"Anyway.  The boss NPCs also drop a keycard to a nearby vault with a ton of ammo and gear in it.  So its worth going after them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Baker nodded.  \"Hm... For my first game, though, I don't think I'll try for any of them,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fair enough,\" Cuddle Team Leader said, standing up as they approached the island.  \"I'm gonna get off here.  I keep forgetting Coral Castle is there now and I wanna give it a look.  Remember to watch the storm on your wrist gear, and get into the safe zones.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Got it,\" the Baker said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And watch out for Marauders, these teams of roving bandits.  They vanish like NPCs when they die, but the guys who made the containers our real bodies are in say they aren't supposed to be there,\" Cuddle Team Leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Wonderful...\" the Baker said.  Wait, he thought.  IF she's been here since the beginning...  \"Hey... are the rumors I've heard true?  Did the universe reset thanks to something that happened on the island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCuddle Team Leader laughed.  \"Oh man.  That's a long story and a half.  Catch me after the match if you're still interested!\" she said.  \"Thanks for the lift, bus driver!\" she called out to the unseen driver as she dove out of the back of the bus.  Others followed, all of them thanking the driver.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Baker thought about it for a moment, and then got up.  He decided to conduct his test at the Rickety Rig area.  He knew it had once been part of another area before Midas's flood swarmed the island.  He wondered if Midas was still alive.  He had to have been on the battle island proper if he was trying to control the Storm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThanking the bus driver, he dove out of the back of the bus.  It was actually quite thrilling, flying through the air, knowing he was in no real danger.  He grinned, fighting the urge to hold onto his hat, which was staying on his avatar as he dove towards the wreckage of the rig.  Once he was close enough to the ground, he found his avatar reacting automatically, releasing his glider, which was resembled the standard glider, save for the giant inflatable cookie replacing the tarp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHolding onto the glider, he landed on a small island made out of junk, pulling out his 'pickaxe,' which was designed to look like a toy plastic hand holding a giant chocolate chip cookie, as his glider disappeared, its contained form reappearing in his pocket.  He checked to see if the Clicker was in his avatar's pocket still, and nodded.  \"Okay.  Just gotta hide out here until...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDAKKADAKKADAKKADAKKA<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Baker sat up in his pod quite suddenly as it opened, the words 'You placed 94th' on the monitor.  He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the light... and chuckled.  \"...I forgot to check to see if anyone landed with me,\" he said, idly fingering the Clicker in his pocket.  \"Okay.  No harm done beyond a little embarrassment.  I'll just try again later.\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tTo call Wario a disgusting greedy bastard would be... well, greatly understating things, honestly.  A fat, vicious oaf who's only concern was profit and self-gratification, he wanted nothing more than to be rich and live a lavish lifestyle.  He'd raided tombs, sided with evil warlords, and even beat up an army of pirates led by the sleek, sexy Captain Maple Syrup, and stole all of her loot.  He'd saved the day a few times, but he did so only in the name of profit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis first mission involved hiring (GIVING away money physically hurt Wario) an alien mercenary named Tatanga to invade a neighboring kingdom and capture the Princess that Mario's brother, Luigi, was dating.  Luigi was hurt while trying to stop Tatanga, Mario heading to stop him.  Which left Wario free to take over the private island Mario had been given by Princess Peach.  Mario had eventually taken back the island, but Wario wasn't deterred.  He kept coming back, making Mario's life miserable.  He even acquired a partner in crime, Waluigi, whom he sometimes worked with.  The sneaky bastard was better at planning than Wario, which he could appreciate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWario had eventually started his own company, making a small fortune selling games that were actually a compilation of several short, five second minigames.  But it was never enough.  He always wanted more glory, more treasure, more power, more garlic... What?  He liked garlic.  He could even get superpowers by eating a special, ultra-fermented garlic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRight now, wearing his belly-exposing biker outfit, a blue shirt, violet pants, a denim vest, yellow fingerless gloves and a yellow helmet with goggles, he was riding towards a new treasure.  Something called a 'cookie clicker,' which was said to look innocuous but hold the key to ruling the world.  The fat, evil gasbag chuckled to himself as he imagined himself swimming in a sea of gold coins.  Eventually he came to where the cookie clicker was supposed to be, stopping his bike at the entrance to the temple.  He found himself met at the door by a tall, withered-looking man in a brown robe dotted with black spots, which made Wario think of chocolate chip cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"HOLD!\" the monk said.  \"You are not welcome here!  I sense the evil intent in your heart!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're a good judge of character, then,\" Wario cackled, playing with his long, lightning bolt-shaped mustache.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You come seeking the cookie clicker.  You seek the riches its cookies can bring,\" the monk intoned.  \"But you know not the destruction it can bring, too!  What is money to the lives of others?  What are cookies to other foods?  You cannot know the... are you picking your nose?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIndeed, one finger was buried deep in Wario's nose, the brute twisting it around in his big beak.  \"Hm?\" he said, withdrawing his finger and flicking away whatever was on it.  \"I'm sorry, were you speaking?  I tend to zone out when losers talk about stuff I don't care about!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"FIEND!\" the monk declared.  \"You won't stop me!  I am the guardian of the temple!  I will never let you-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWario held up his hand.  \"I'mma let you finish, but I got a question first.  Are you the ONLY guardian of the temple?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes,\" the monk said, realizing his mistake too late.  \"I mean NO!  My entire order is here, and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Right,\" Wario said, amused.  He turned his back to the monk and bent over, sticking his butt in the air.  Before the monk could figure out what was going on, a noxious, thunderously loud fart ripped from Wario's ass, engulfing the monk in a toxic green cloud.  Choking, coughing, he fell to his knees, barely able to stand up even with his staff.  Wario, flipping him off, rode right by him, cackling madly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The traps...\" the monk coughed.  \"Sure the traps will stop him...\" He staggered back to the temple, the fumes from Wario's fart making him ill.  \"Good lord, what does that man eat?\"  It took him a half-hour to get back to the temple.  But by then it was too late.  He saw Wario riding towards him, holding up the cookie clicker triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Should have hid it in a bigger temple, loser!  WAHAHAHAHA!\" Wario cackled, running the man over with his bike and driving off into the distance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe monk just lay there, tire-track across his chest, all hope gone.  \"It... is over... the world is doomed...\" </span></div></div>",

All of them were older Mobian women, clad in bright, shining armor and empowered by the Chaos Emeralds.  They had come up with a plan, not to kill Eggman, no.  Because killing Eggman would simply bring something worse in his place.  Their plan was to purge him of all the evil in his heart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe heroes were reluctant to believe it.  They wanted Eggman's threat ended.  But most of them weren't against the idea of him reforming.  The Great Order pointed out the threats that were kept in check out of fear of Eggman, pointing out that even a reformed Eggman could keep them in check simply by existing.  And finally, everyone gave in.  And now the final battle was taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn Casinopolis, home of Breeze Media, where the news services owned by trillionare media mogul Breezie the Hedgehog would capture everything on camera, so that the whole world saw it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic led the attack, with Tails and Knuckles right behind him as they charged Eggman, accompanied by the Great Order.  The Chaotix, Vector, Espio, and Charmy, with their comrades Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel, fought off Egg Pawns and Badniks to keep them from aiding the Egg Bosses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRoyal knights Antoine D'Coolette and his cybernetic wife Bunnie dueled with two of Eggman's Egg Bosses, the dreaded ninja lynx Conquering Storm and the vicious Eggman worshipper, Thunderbolt the Chinchilla.  Whisper the Wolf, from her rooftop position, took potshots at Nephthys the Vulture, the flying Egg Boss occasionally swooping in with an attack that forced her to change positions.  Tangle the Lemur... chased Mordred Hood around the battlefield, laughing like a lunatic as she picked on the non-combatant Egg Boss, his hypnotic powers useless against the energetic heroine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrom above, the AI entity Nicole the Lynx controlled the skies in the Sky Patrol, dueling with the Battlebird Armada, led by the vicious Grand Battle Kukku and his son Speedy.  Sally Acorn, heir to the throne of the Royal House of Acorn, and would-be paramour to Sonic, Amy Rose, fought the sister pronghorns Clove and Cassia.  Rotor the Walrus dueled with his evil father, Tundra, the technician just barely keeping ahead of his father's icy blasts.  Silver the Hedgehog and the bloodthirsty Akhlut the Orca had a psychic duel, each one trying to overpower the other with their mental prowess.  Maw found himself facing off against Rouge the Bat, the amoral scientist finding himself prevented from using his void attack by the constant kicks from the beautiful thief... and finding himself vaguely distracted by her bouncing 'assets.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOmega was proving to be a one robot anti-marine weapon, driving off the forces of Abyss the Squid while Abyss herself just barely managed to hold her ground against the murder machine.  Blaze the Cat was proving to be more than a match for Wendy Naugus and her Witchcarters, the Witchcarters little more than fodder while Wendy was just barely holding her own against the powerful heroine.  Shadow the Hedgehog, meanwhile, was developing a grudging respect for Axel the Water Buffalo, the biker able to keep him from destroying his bike while keeping him at bay with his chains.  It made Shadow wish he had brought his own bike, wanting to race Axel with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman desperately fought back.  He had heard why the Order was coming after him, and regretted firing Doctor Starline.  He could have used his portal gem right about now.  \"STAY AWAY!  METAL, PROTECT DADDY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMetal Sonic rocketed forward, claws extended, ready to gut Sonic and the Knights.  But as he charged, the machine found himself piled upon by Tails and Knuckles.  Metal Sonic flew about wildly, trying to throw them off, while Sonic and the Knights tore through his Badniks.  \"NO!\" Eggman screamed.  \"I won't let you poison me with goodness!  STAY AWAY!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe abandoned the war machine he was in and turned to flee, pumping his Eggmobile's jets to the max.  But Sonic used the power of the Chaos Emeralds the Great Order held to turn into Super Sonic, catching up to him easily.  \"It's over, Eggman.  No more evil for you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"DAMN YOU!\" Eggman screamed.  \"I HATE YOU!  THAT WON'T EVER CHANGE, SONIC!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hate me all you want, Eggman,\" Sonic said.  \"Just so long as you don't hurt anyone else.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Egg Bosses all noticed that their boss was in danger.  As much as some of them would have loved to let him get destroyed, they all ran to help him, the heroes doing their best to keep them from interfering.  Metal Sonic let out a scream that sounded like pure rage, and flew directly at Eggman, despite Tails and Knuckles' best efforts to make him turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Be cleansed by the light of chaos!\" the Great Order all chanted as one.  \"Lose not the fire that made you a genius, but let the darkness of evil be purged from your soul for all time!\"  From the Chaos Emeralds, a great rainbow shot up into the air.  \"No!  NONONONONONO!!!\" Eggman screamed.  \"I HATE THAT HEDEGHOOOOOOOOOOOGGGGG!!!\" The light slammed down on Dr. Eggman.  The mad doctor let out a blood-curdling scream of agony, a massive wave of darkness erupting from him and evaporating in the light of the rainbow.  Finally, the light stopped, a smoldering Eggman slumping over in his Eggmobile.  Everyone watched, stunned, unsure of what to do as Eggman groaned, picking himself up and removing his glasses.  They were all shocked at how TIRED he looked, even his bushy red mustache drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...You win, Sonic,\" Eggman said finally, loud enough for the cameras to hear, but in a tired, defeated tone of voice.  \"I'm not letting you capture me, but... I'm done.  I can't do this anymore.  Years of fighting, years of going nowhere...\"  He shook his head.  \"No more.  Mobius never has to worry about me again.\"  He typed a bit on his console, and the Egg Bosses and other cyborg minions all convulsed briefly, a single part of their cybernetics smoldering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What... What did you do to us?!\" Akhlut demanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I freed you all from my control,\" Eggman said.  \"I destroyed the failsafes I used to control you.  Do as you will.  Clove, I'll send you a year's supply of the medicine I use to treat Cassia's condition.  You can probably bargain for more if you cooperate with the heroes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClove just stared, shocked.  \"T-Thank you...\" she said.  <i>Free</i>, she thought.  <i>We're free..</i>.  She had given up hope that she'd ever be free of Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman sighed, rubbing his eyes tiredly, and turned to Sonic, glaring at him.  \"I meant what I said, Sonic.  I'll always hate you,\" he snarled, calming down quickly.  \"But I'm done fighting you...  I'm done fighting everyone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...What will you do?\" Sonic asked, powering down from his Super form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't know... bake cookies or something,\" Eggman said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe helmets of the 'Great Order' did a fine job of hiding the evil grins they suddenly gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Metal Sonic,\" Eggman ordered.  \"We're leaving.  Let's get back to the Death Egg.\"  Metal Sonic threw off Tails and Knuckles, the two putting up little fight now that the battle was over.  Eggman floated away, as the crowd began to cheer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Doctor?\" Thunderbolt said softly, the Eggman loyalist feeling betrayed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's over...\" Sonic said.  \"IT'S OVER!  FOR GOOD THIS TIME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe crowd began to cheer.  Abyss ordered her fleet to retreat, Grand Battle Kukku ordering the Battlebird Armada to do the same.  Conquering Storm disappeared into the shadows, Mordred Hood trying to flee but getting caught by the Chaotix fairly easily.  Clove and Cassia immediately surrendered, as did Nephthys.  Thunderbolt fled, using her tiny size to her advantage to get away, while Akhlut retreated as well, using his telepathy to make people not notice him.  Axel gave Shadow a nod of respect and drove off, Shadow letting him leave, Maw catching a ride with the biker.  Wendy grabbed her minions and teleported away, cursing Eggman's name.  Rotor and Tundra gave each other one last look before Tundra shook his head sadly and leaped into the water of the nearby docks, creating an ice bridge to flee on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic landed near Amy, not resisting when she gave him a hug.  \"How's that for a win, eh?\" Sonic said teasingly to Sally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We'll have to keep an eye on things,\" Sally Acorn said, grinning.  \"But if he's released all his Egg Bosses and cybernetic soldiers at once, then its very likely we really have scored a win here.\"  The crowd cheered again, Sonic deciding to give both Amy and the cameras a thrill, scooping her into a deep, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You have all done well,\" the leader of the Great Order said, the matronly older fox smiling warmly as she removed her helmet.  \"The threat of Eggman is gone, without removing the good he can do for the world.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Thanks again for helping us,\" Sonic said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It was our pleasure,\" the Great Order leader said.  \"Now if you'll excuse us, we must return the Chaos Emeralds to their hiding places.\"  She put her helmet back on.  Each of the seven Order members raised their Chaos Emerald to the sky, vanishing in a swirl of colorful energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wonder if we'll ever see them again,\" Amy said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You never know,\" Sonic said, smiling.  \"But I've got a feeling that we might...\" </span></div></div>",

Eggman's minions, Orbot and Cubot, just stared at their master in mute shock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You... are you really reformed?\" Orbot asked, unsure of what to think.  Metal Sonic was similarly uneasy.  If his father had reformed, then his purpose in life, to be a superior Sonic, may be taken from him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman said nothing.  He got out of his Eggmobile and walked into his private quarters... where the seven members of the Great Order of Chaos Knights all stood, unmasked, smirking wickedly as they held the Chaos Emeralds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOrbot and Cubot hugged each other in fright, while Metal Sonic readied for battle.  \"Calm down,\" Eggman said disdainfully, smirking and walking over to the 'Great Order.'  \"How was that, ladies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"An award worthy performance,\" said one of the 'Great Order,' a Mobian cat.  She and the other members of the 'Order' set the Chaos Emeralds down on the nearby table and bowed to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, come now,\" Eggman said, grinning wickedly.  \"I couldn't have pulled it off without your help.\"  The old women all giggled evilly, as Eggman turned to Orbot and Cubot.  \"You two, take these and mount them on my special throne.  They'll be the power source of the Death Egg from now on.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCubot and Orbot had no clue what was going on.  But they were relieved that their boss hadn't ACTUALLY reformed.  \"Sure thing, boss!\" Cubot said, the two small robots gathering up the Emeralds and leaving with them.  Metal Sonic just stared, completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I didn't lie,\" Eggman said to Metal Sonic.  \"I am going to bake cookies.  I am going to stop fighting Sonic.  Just to keep him on his toes, you're going to 'rebel,' as I will be 'unable to fully remove your hatred of Sonic from your programming.'  You'll be my spy in the field, feeding me information and occassionally going to one of the bases no one else knows about for repairs if need be.  We both know you'd never be happy in a passive role.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMetal Sonic partially understood.  He would be allowed to fight Sonic still, both to appease his own needs and to serve his master.  But... cookies? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman grinned.  \"Trust me,\" he said.  \"With the help of these old ladies, and the cookies we're going to make, we're going to rule the world.\"  He held up a small plastic device with a button in the shape of a cookie on top.  \"And possibly the universe as well...\"  </span></div></div>",

She wear a brown bomber jacket and yellow gloves, brown boots, and bluejeans that fit so well they looked painted on.  Her long, fluffy tail flicked about in frustration and her long bluenette hair was bound in a ponytail as she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"DAMN IT!\" swore Inspector Carmelita Montoya Fox.  \"He got away!  If he was here at all... I could have sworn...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer partner, a gorgeous, lavender-furred, purple-striped tigress with a smaller, but still impressive bust and a larger butt, sauntered in.  Her long, black hair was hidden by a red-colored, Muslim headscarf, a gold circlet with a purple gem on her head.  She wore a blue tank top, booty shorts, and boots, carrying a whip instead of a shock pistol like her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Your instincts are good,\" Inspector Neyla said, \"especially when it comes to Cooper.  Most likely he heard us coming.\"  She smirked.  \"Or heard YOU at least.  You have all the subtley of a thunderstorm, partner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita chuckled, long used to her partner's jabs.  \"Yeah, well, you can be pretty unsubtle yourself at times,\" she said.  \"Or have you forgotten the dance at Rajan's palace.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're just jealous that I got to dance with your criminal boyfriend first,\" Neyla teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Maybe a little,\" Carmelita said quietly, Neyla laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNeyla shook her head.  She was honestly glad she didn't have to stop working with Carmelita.  Now that she'd loosened up, she was much more fun to work with.  After Neyla's real allies, the KLAAW Gang, had been too slow in stopping Sly from destroying the Hate Chip (and subsequentely, all the Clockwerk parts at once), her mentor, Arpeggio, had ordered her to remain in Interpol for the time being.  Which meant more time near that handsome raccoon Sly.  And while she would have loved to win him for herself, she was professional enough to admit that Carmelita was closer to his heart.  Which was fine, as the fox was a sexy beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita's feelings for Sly had become known in the office, although they believed her when she said she still planned to arrest him despite how much she cared for him.  It had made their partnership interesting.  And Carmelita's honest joy for Neyla when she got promoted to Inspector made Neyla fond of her too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe would back down if Sly and Carmelita got together.  But she had been subtly encouraging both of them towards a threesome relationship with her.  No reason not to get some for herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the meantime, though, they had to deal with this.  As the owner, a nebbishy, frightened-looking old otter in a dark suit tottered in, Neyla wandered over to the table where the cookies were and ate one.  Carmelita heard her snacking and turned to have some as well.  As the two women ate the cookies and the old otter walked in, they noticed the safe, and the Cooper calling card inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn,\" Carmelita said.  \"Well, looks like Sly was here, Mr. Vanderbaken.  He took whatever was in your safe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So I see,\" Mr. Vanderbaken said, gulping hard.  \"Where did you get those cookies?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"They were on the table,\" Neyla said, frowning.  \"I'm sorry, were they yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"They're really good, if it helps any,\" Carmelita said around a mouthful of cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...No, it's fine,\" Mr. Vanderbaken said, smiling sadly.  \"You just enjoy them...\" Quietly, so neither woman could hear, he said, \"It's too late for both of you anyway...\" </span></div></div>",

They did smell great... But he couldn't escape his growing unease.  \"...I'm sorry, Sly, but I think I shouldn't.\"  He looked over at Sly, who was munching on a peanut butter cookie.  \"You should probably cut back, if you don't want to get as big as Murray.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I like being as big as Murray!\" Murray declared proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly laughed.  \"I'll burn it off in the next heist,\" he said.  \"You sure you don't want any cookies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBentley shook his head.  \"No.  Not any from the clicker, at any rate.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly shrugged.  \"Suit yourself,\" he said, going back to join Murray in the kitchen, leaving Bentley alone with his thoughts.  </span></div></div>",

Grumbling, she sat down and spread her legs, reaching under the bed for one of her toys.  She turned in on, feeling it buzz as it started to vibrate, and gently pressed it into her warm, wet womanhood.  \"Aaaah, that's the stuff,\" she said, shivering in pleasure, slowly swirling it around her labia before plunging it in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she masturbated, her phone rang.  Rolling her eyes and not stopping what she was doing, she picked up her phone.  \"This better be good this early in the morning,\" she said, looking to see that it was 7AM.  <i>Hmm, not that bad</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ironsides?
