He decided to build a machine to make Sonic a little smaller than himself so he could find out what it was like to be the big brother.\"Hey, Sonic, do you mind testing something out for me?\" he asked as Sonic dashed into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, lil' bro.\" Sonic replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails picked his device up. \"After this, we'll see who's little.\" he said to himself quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sonic asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.On the count of 3. 1...2...3!!\" Tails announced, then fired the machine. Sonic shrank to about 3 to 4 inches tall. \"Hee Hee Hee. Not so little now, am I, Sonic?\" Tails asked darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic took frightened steps back as Tails walked towards him. \"T-Tails, wh-what's g-g-goin on?!\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh. I just shrank you.\" Tails said, then grabbed at the blue hedgehog. Sonic fled to the couch. \"Hey, get back here!!!\" Tails demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why's he doing this? Did I do something wrong? Is he mad at me for something?\" Sonic thought. \"Tails, what's happened to you? I thought we were friends.\" Sonic whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sick of being the little one. So, I thought maybe I should change that up.\" Tails replied in a dark, wicked tone. \"Now get out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do that was so bad?\" Sonic thought as he curled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tails then threw Sonic across the room. Sonic weakly forced himself onto his feet, then fled and found somewhere to hide. He crawled under the door and hid under the bed in the room. He could hear Tails's footsteps in the hallway. \"He's coming!! He's going to kill me!!\" Sonic thought in panic. The footsteps stopped outside the door. \"I'm going to die!!!!!!!\" Sonic's thoughts screamed in his ears. The footsteps continued down the hall, but Sonic was in such a panic he didn't notice. \"He's gonna come in any second!!!!!!!!\" And with that, he began screaming and rocking back and forth, hugging his knees tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Found you.\" Tails thought, then opened the door to the room Sonic was in. Sonic managed to hear the door open. His heart beat accelerated to the point that, if he wasn't able to move as fast, he would have died right then. But his heart could beat a lot faster before it would stop.Tails lunged and grabbed Sonic. At this point, Sonic was crying and was unable to breathe. The fear was overwhelming. Tails noticed that Sonic was crying and unable to breathe.</span></div></div>",

A few minutes passed before Sonic came to. He looked up in fear, seeing who or what was in front of him. \"Sonic, I-\" Tails began, but the very second he moved his hand, Sonic shrieked and ran back to his hiding place, his hands gripping the sides of his head and tears streaming down his cheeks as he rocked back and forth, traumatized. Tails hung his head, feeling awful. \"Sonic, please, I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean any of it. Please, forgive me.\" Tails pleaded urgently. Sonic wouldn't answer, as he fainted again. Tails's eyes widened. \"Oh no. What have I done to him?!\" he thought as he pulled Sonic out from under the bed with shaking hands. He checked Sonic's heartbeat. It was fast. Even faster then Sonic could run. \"No. No, this can't be happening. I-I didn't mean to. I-I almost killed him.\" Tails thought in horror. He gently put Sonic back under the bed, then curled up in a fetal position, hands covering his face as he began to cry. About 15 minutes later, Sonic woke up to find Tails sobbing.</span></div></div>",

Tails sniffled harder, then completely broke down. He began crying even harder. \"Tails\u2026\" Sonic whimpered, now feeling even worse. Tails pulled away from his older brother, trying not to show how upset he was. Sonic began crying softly. He ran up to Tails and hugged his \u2018big\u2019 brother as best he could. He had practically buried himself in Tails's fur by the time Tails had calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked down at Sonic, gently picked the blue hedgehog up, and hugged him. \"I'm sorry, Sonic. I was just really upset. Don't worry. I feel better now. A lot better. Don't cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked up at Tails, then rubbed his face against Tails's chest, effectively wiping his tears away. \"Um\u2026Tails\u2026you know that being the big brother means that you have to be the older one and look after your little brother, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So, I'd have to make you younger so I could be the big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! I have something for that!\" Tails said excitedly, then practically abandoned Sonic in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I won't make it easy for you, Tails. Not after how you acted earlier. I gotta make sure you can handle it right. And I'm gonna make sure you get how hard it is.\" Sonic thought, then leaned up against the wall. Tails returned after a few minutes with two machines. The first one made Sonic grow to about 5 feet tall. The second, on the other hand, made Sonic become 4 years old and 1 foot tall. Tails then used the second machine to become 16 years old. He was now about 4 feet tall. \"This is so cool!\" Sonic said, then ran around in circles, causing a tornado to form. \"Oopsies.\" Sonic giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails quickly reversed the tornado, thus getting rid of it. \"Be careful, Sonic.\" Tails sighed, patting his now little brother's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Sonic replied. He hugged Tails's leg. Tails laughed slightly at this. </span></div></div>",

Sonic looked over at Tails, his eyes full of urgency.  \"Okay. I'm on it. You didn't have to scream.\" Tails huffed, giving Sonic a frustrated look. He had been having troubles with Sonic for a while now. After making a bowl of cereal for Sonic, he noticed something brown in the corner. \"Sonic\u2026what did you do?\" Tails asked in an irritated growl. Sonic just blushed slightly, looking a bit embarrassed, which he definitely should have been. \"Great! Thanks a lot!\" Tails snapped, then stormed back to his room and slammed the door shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic grinned. \"I made a uh-oh.\" Sonic giggled. His mentality was slipping into a toddler's state, but he also knew what he was doing. He ate his cereal, then jumped down, but accidentally knocked the bowl off the table. It landed on his head and shattered, leaving severe cuts in Sonic's back, shoulders, and head. He began screaming and crying from pain. Tails angrily stomped out of his room, until Sonic's crying suddenly stopped, followed by a small thud. Tails stormed back to where he had left Sonic. To his absolute terror, Sonic was lying motionless on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood. There were pieces of the bowl scattered across the floor. Tails quickly ran to the first aid kit and made sure to bandage Sonic's injuries well enough to keep the poor, little hedgehog alive. Tails then ran to his plane, Sonic in his arms, and flew them both to the nearest hospital. In a matter of minutes, Tails was stuck watching as doctors began trying extremely hard to take care of Sonic. </span></div></div>",

Sonic looked around, his fears of being all alone in a room that he can't leave all taking violent forms. He began to tremble, hallucinations caused by his fear making every shadow, light, and tool take a dangerous and terrifying form. As he continued to tremble, he began going into a panic and trying to get out of the bed. He knocked a tray into the bed, causing the tools on it to go flying all over the bed. Several of the landed on Sonic, most recognizably a needle, a few needles to be quite honest. And a scalpel, and a few other sharp ones as well. More blood began pouring out of the little hedgehog. Sonic began to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails's ears picked up the sound and he ran back to the room to find what Sonic had accidentally done. \"Oh man. I gotta get a doctor now!\" Tails thought as he ran to the front desk. \"Ma'am, my little brother flipped the tray over! All the tools fell off it and he's bleeding very badly! Please, you have to help him!!\" Tails pleaded. The woman gave him a horrified and bewildered look. She quickly sent the doctors and nurse that had been taking care of Sonic earlier to go check to see if Tails was correct, which he was. Tails ran back to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he get into something like that while you were here?!\" the nurse asked in an accusing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't in here! He was waking up, I thought he might be hungry so I headed out to the snack machine to get him something and almost 3 minutes after I left the room I heard him screaming and crying like he had when he hurt himself in the first place so I ran back to check on him and I found him like this!!\" Tails flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, I hurt!\" Sonic whimpered loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails rushed to Sonic's side. \"Shhh. It's gonna be alright. They're gonna make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I so scared. And I hurt so much.\" Sonic whispered, then passed out. Tails immediately checked the monitor. Sonic appeared to have simply fainted. Tails looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, maybe you should get something for him now. He won't know you're gone.\" the nurse said softly.</span></div></div>",

I just haven't slept well for a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sniffled, nuzzled into Tails's fur, and began falling asleep. \"I\u2026sorry\u2026Tails\u2026\" Sonic said softly. </span></div></div>",

He looked over at the kitchen and ran over to it. He clambered up onto the countertop. He noticed a window, opened it, and escaped. \"Bye, Tails. Sorry I make you so angry. I leave before you hate me.\" Sonic sighed, then wandered off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Tails had noticed that Sonic had given up /WAY/ to quickly. \"Sonic?\" Tails asked, opening the door. The little hedgehog wasn't in the hallway. Tails thought of what he had said to Sonic, then his eyes widened. \"Uh-oh.\" He rushed into the living room, no hedgehogs there, then he turned to the kitchen.

His imagination played tricks on him and terrified him. He began to cry, curled up and trembling against the tree he had found. He heard crunching and snapping noises that were rapidly closing in on him. He began to sweat, rock back and forth, and hyperventilate.

Sonic huffed and knocked a few cups out of the way, the got on the counter. He flinched at the loud, shattering sound the cups made upon impact. Tails stirred. Sonic gave a weary-hearted laugh and tried to squeeze through the abundance of dishes. A few fell off, scaring Sonic half to death as they completely smashed apart when they hit the ground. He continued his way to a few container of pudding. Then, he heard a door open. \"Uh-oh.\" Sonic thought. He looked at the pudding, at the hallway, and at the floor. He rushed over to the pudding and opened one, the just about tried to stick his entire head in it since he wasn't about to turn back and get a spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails walked into the kitchen and did a triple take.

And thus, I take it you are very upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sighed. \"My big brother keeps getting mad at me. I try to be good, but he mad at me in the morning. He mad in the evening.

Her hand was red, black, or a purplish-brown color all over it with scars all running through each color. Sonic stared wide-eyed at her hand, awed with horror. \"My father did that to me.

To his horror, it was the carpet on the floor of his and Tails's house. Suddenly, the ground began shaking. Sonic looked around in panic. There were now loud thudding sounds coming from behind him. Timidly, he turned to look, and was greeted by a pair of enormous, red and white shoes. He trembled as two walls of orange-yellow came down in front of him. He didn't dare look up. He took several steps back until a loud yet familiar voice greeted his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had found Sonic shrunken and unconscious an hour after Sonic had been knocked out. He had come to Eggman's base to join up with Sonic. He had taken Sonic home and set him on the floor for while he made something for Sonic to eat. He had been waiting for Sonic to wake up for a long time now. \"Don't be scared, Sonic. It's alright. It's just me.\" Tails attempted as he slowly reached out to grab the tiny hedgehog. Sonic took a few more steps back. \"Sonic, please, don't be afraid of me. It's me, Tails. I just wanna help.\" Tails pleaded, worried that Sonic might run off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Sonic freeze in place. He risked a glance, and recognized the figure, even though Tails was practically a tower to him. \"Tails\u2026\" Sonic thought. Then he noticed the hand closing in on him slowly. He fled to Tails. Tails cocked his head a bit. The hand wrapped around Sonic's waist, making him go into a panic and start trying to get loose. Tails yelped in pain as Sonic's quills now dug into his hand. \"Tails, help me!!! I can't move!!!!!\" Sonic cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my hand!\" Tails whimpered, doing his best to hold back the pained tears Sonic's quills were inducing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's quills retracted from Tails's hand. Sonic noticed that Tails's hand was bleeding, which made him feel terrible. \"Tails, a-are you okay?\" Sonic asked worriedly. Tails didn't answer. Sonic was placed on the kitchen table, which made him feel a lot worse. Tails rushed into the bathroom. \"I hurt him. I didn't even know it was him. I hurt him and I made him bleed and-\" Sonic could no longer stand it.</span></div></div>",

He wriggled under the door, ran the wall of the bathroom, and used his whole body to open the door where he kept the bandaids. \"Wh-whoa!\" he yelped as he fell into the drawer. \"Oww\u2026 man\u2026\" Sonic whined, holding his arm. He noticed the box of bandaids and grabbed a few, since the box itself was too heavy for him. He limped slightly from where he had landed on a comb after opening the drawer. He opened one, climbed up, and applied it to the spot where his quills had injured Tails. He then climbed back down and applied the rest until he had bandaged all the small cuts/stab wounds. Then he made a running jump over to the toilet where the tissues were sitting. He grabbed a few tissues and jumped back over, but hit his chest against the corner off the counter. For a second, he could hardly breathe, then he began slipping. \"Uh oh.\" he thought as he began urgently trying to squirm back onto the counter, which he barely managed to do. He then walked back to in front of Tails. \"Hey, buddy, I-I'm really sorry about that. I didn't mean to.\" he said gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sniffled and looked in the direction of the voice, only to find Sonic looking like he had just barely managed to escape being beaten to death. Bruises were already forming all over Sonic's body. Sonic raised the tissues up. Tails took them, but didn't even know what to respond with. Then he realized that his hand had bandaids on it already. He immediately put together why Sonic looked so battered. \"Sonic, you shouldn't have done that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also should't've hurt you. And I'm still really sorry, bud. Now I'm gonna get back to the table.\" Sonic said as he walked to the edge of the table. He jumped off. Tails caught him. \"Whoa!\" Sonic yelped, recoiling and nearly falling off anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic, be careful! You already look like you got hit by a truck or something!\" Tails scolded the tiny hedgehog. Sonic flinched. \"Sonic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, keep your voice down.

He dove under the couch in the living room and curled up. He didn't know what to do or say or think. He felt almost paralyzed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails opened the bathroom door. \"Sonic, wait a second! I didn't mean to scare you like that! Come on!\" Tails called out gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic began hyperventilating, his mind chanting, \"He's coming\" over and over. He trembled helplessly. \"I was only trying to help.\" Sonic whimpered, holding the sides of his head.</span></div></div>",

He silently dropped to all fours and began quietly crawling down the hallway. His ears picked up quiet, rapid, heavy breaths coming from the living room. He silently went that way, keeping his head close to the ground so he could search under everything along the way. When he saw Sonic under the couch, he could hardly believe his eyes. Sonic was a complete wreck. Bruises just about covering his entire body, knee swollen, shaking like a leaf, and breathing like he couldn't find air. \"Sonic\u2026?\" Tails asked gently. Sonic's quills shot up as he visibly flinched. He curled into a tight ball. Then he screamed. \"S-Sonic, I-I didn't mean to scare you! Please don't be afraid! I won't hurt you! I promise!\" Tails said in a fluster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-p-p-pr-pr-promise?\" Sonic asked through his rapid breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, I won't hurt you. You're worry me, Sonic. Please, don't be so scared. You're my big bro no matter how tiny you are. Please don't hide.\" Tails said softly. Sonic hesitantly approached. Tails noticed that Sonic was trying to walk without putting any pressure whatsoever on his knee. \"Sonic, would you like to try using an ice cube to relieve the swelling in your leg?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-y-yes.\" Sonic whimpered, continuing to limp forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails got up and went to the freezer. He opened it and noticed that, despite the ice tray being in there, it was empty. He took it out. \"Sonic, how many times do I have to tell you that when you take the last ice cube, you refill the tray!?\" Tails snapped. Sonic dove under the couch with a shriek that was a mix of pain and terror. Tails's eyes widened and he immediately rushed over to make sure Sonic was alright. Sonic was once again having a panic attack. Tails quickly got up and refilled the tray, then stuck it in the freezer. He returned to the couch and very carefully grabbed Sonic and pulled him into a hug. Sonic shrieked and hurt himself even more trying to escape. \"Shhhhh\u2026\" Tails hushed Sonic. Sonic's ears flattened against the sides of his head, but he remained in a panic nonetheless. \"Sonic, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Normally, you make a joke or distract me. I wasn't expecting you to completely freak out on me. Please, don't be scared. I'm not gonna hurt you.\" Tails said gently.</span></div></div>",

Sonic curled up and his his face, trembling and whimpering in a mix of fear and pain. \"There's nothing I can do\u2026 He's too scared of me\u2026\" Tails thought, setting Sonic back down. He stood up, walked down the hallway, and into his bedroom. He shut the door, sat on his bed, and buried his face in his hand as he began to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's ear pricked up, hearing Tails crying now. \"Stupid stupid stupid!!\" he scolded himself, pounding his fist against his head, wincing and whimpering each time. \"I've gotta cheer him up. It's all my fault all over again\u2026\" he thought, spirits sinking. \"He was only trying to help\u2026so why did I freak out on him?\" he muttered. \"Stupid stupid stupid!!!\" he repeated, hitting himself as hard as he could. \"OW!!!!!!!\" he shrieked. \"I'm so sore. But I've gotta make it up to him.\" he told himself. He, despite how much it hurt, limped down the hallway. Once he got to the bedroom door, he carefully got on his stomach and crawled under the door, biting his lip to keep from screaming. Once on the other side, he looked across the room at Tails, who was crying harder than ever now. Or at least harder than it sounded before he went under the door. He limped over to Tails's leg, hoping to be seen when he was close enough. But Tails didn't see him. Sonic frowned, then sighed. \"Hey, Tails?\" he attempted, but Tails didn't hear him either. \"It's okay. You don't need to look or anything.\" he muttered. Then he shook his head and tried a different approach. He stroked Tails's leg. Tails sniffled and looked down at Sonic. Sonic continued trying to make Tails feel better. Tails bent down and picked Sonic up gently, then pulled him in close as he continued to cry. \"Tails, please don't cry. I didn't mean to panic on you like that earlier, and I'm really sorry.\"</span></div></div>",

Tails gently lifted Sonic off the table and, to his relief, found Sonic unharmed. But that relief was short-lived. Sonic's face was blood-red now, starting to turn purple. \"Sonic, c-calm down!

And the harder he tried, the worse it got. Finally, he accepted defeat and cried extremely hard, burying his head in Tails's fur. By the time he felt better, the fur he had buried himself in was soaked. He looked up at Tails, swallowed hard, and crawled closer to Tails's face. \"Tails, wake up. Tails!\" Sonic attempted, but Tails didn't react. He began poking Tails's cheek, rather frustratedly. Tails still didn't wake up. \"Wake up already!!!!\" he demanded, then gave Tails's nose an airborne kick. Tails sneezed and rolled over, thus sending Sonic flying into a wall and causing Tails to fall off the couch.

Tails, fortunately, was too worried that Sonic might be extremely close, so he wasn't moving an inch. Sonic had a five minute crawl just to get over to the couch. He then used his good arm to hold on to Tails's shoe and pull himself up. \"Tails!

Sonic gasped for air and started coughing and panting. \u00a0Eggman took a jar from a shelf and dangled Sonic over it and let go and placed a lid on top of the jar. Sonic hit the bottom of the jar face first with a thud. Sonic got up on his shaky legs. He was exhausted but wasn't about to let Eggman win. \u00a0Sonic stared to spin dash the walls of the jar but he was too small to even make a small crack. Eggman gave the jar a quick shake, causing Sonic to fall over ending his escape attempt. \"Give it up hedgehog your not going anywhere\" Eggman said while putting the jar on a shelf \"heheheh say goodbye to your freedom Sonic, you belong to me now.\" Eggman laughed leaving the trapped hedgehog alone.

He looked at the wall hoping to see a break, but their was nothing. He got back up and charged at it again, and just fell back again with no break. Sonic was getting frustrated and started punching and kicking the wall, but failed at breaking it. \u00a0Sonic slumped down to his knees and panted. Sonic heard footsteps and a door opening, and started shaking again. He looked up to see Eggman approaching him. Sonic heart pounded. Him stumbled to his feet and backed up to the back of the jar as quick as he could. \u00a0Eggman picked the jar up and looked in on Sonic, and noticed Sonic was nervous. \" heh scared are we?\" Eggman teased. Eggman carried the jar to a table and placed it down. \"Time for a little testing hedgehog\" Eggman laughed. \"T-testing?\" Sonic whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Eggman plaining with the testing?\u00a0</span></div></div>",

Sonic finally found a small crack in the wall but it was too small for even him. Sonic spin dashed the wall trying to break off whatever he could, when suddenly a legionnaire grabbed Sonic. \"Hey! L-let me go!\" Sonic cried. The legionnaire started carring Sonic away. When the legionnaire made it around the corner Sonic raised his quills and dug it into the legionnaire's hand drawing blood. The legionnaire screamed and let go. Sonic ran back to the crack in the wall and stared spin dashing at it again. Eggman ran by the legionnaire who was holding his bleeding hand.

His heart began pounding and he started shaking again. \"You have 3 seconds to get back out here hedgehog. 1.....2........3!\" Eggman yelled. Sonic didn't budge. Eggman put his foot in front of the crack so Sonic couldn't get out. \"You, go get me some tweezers now!\" Eggman yelled at the legionnaire that found Sonic. The legionnaire left and came back with tweezers, and handed them to Eggman. Eggman laid down to become eye level with the crack in the wall, and started putting the tweezers in. Sonic quickly ducked under the tweezers and ran out. Unfortunately Eggman expected this and quickly caught Sonic with the net. Sonic tried spin dashing his way out but the netting was reinforced and he just ended up tangled up. \"Let me go! I don't belong to you!\" Sonic yelled.

Sonic slowly got up on his shaking legs and limped over to the the bowl of water and took a large\u00a0gulp of water. Sonic hadn't had anything to drink since he was captured. Sonic jumped hearing a loud noise. He looked over and saw Eggman sleeping in a bed, snoring loudly. Sonic was in Eggman's sleeping quarters on a night stand right next to Eggman's bed, making Sonic feel uneasy. Sonic noticed a note in the cage. Sonic limped over to it and and read it.\u00a0<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>Sonic,\u00a0<br>\r\nAs you've probably notice your chained. <u>If</u> you behave yourself I might unchain you tomorrow and let you run around your cage. Don't try anything funny. Remember I can and will beat you if you disobey me.<br>\r\nYour Master, Dr. Eggman\u00a0</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was enraged by Eggman's note. He was sick of Eggman talking to him like he was his pet. Sonic spin dashed though Eggman's note a few times tearing it to shreds. Still angry Sonic tried spin dashing though the chain and the cage but failed. Sonic started kicking and punching the walls, then slumped down and started crying. Thoughts flooded Sonic's head. \"What am I going to do? How am I going to escape? Can I even escape? How am I going to get back to my normal size? What's Eggman going to do to me next? Why did I have to fall for his trap? Do my friends know where I am? Are they safe? Are they hurt? Are they captured? Please let them be ok. Someone, anyone please help me.\" Sonic felt his sprit break as all these thoughts flooded his head making him shake and cry. Sonic's crying woke up Eggman. Eggman punched the cage making Sonic scream and run to the other side of the cage until the chain stopped him. \"Get back to bed now!\" Eggman yelled. Sonic laid down and curled up shaking and whimpering. Eggman glared at Sonic, terrifying him. \"I better not hear another peep out of you, Got it?\" Eggman scrolled and went back to sleep. Sonic pushed the paper around, making himself a bed, and curled up on it. It was hard and uncomfortable, it wasn't much better than sleeping in the jar. Sleep didn't come easy. He was still in a lot pain from his beating, and the cuff around his neck was very uncomfortable and hurt.\u00a0He was scared and worried, tears still flowed down his mussel. His stomach \u00a0growled reminding him that he hadn't eaten all day and of the painful memory of being force feed.

Eggman's hand was much softer and warmer than his cage. Sonic started falling asleep again. Eggman noticed Sonic didn't look so good. He brought Sonic close to his face and lifted his head up with finger. Sonic opened his eyes a bit and Eggman saw that his eyes were red and glassy, and he had bags under his eyes. Eggman also saw little bit of blood around his neck were the cuff was. Eggman realized that the cuff was too tight and wasn't going to work out if he wanted to keep Sonic alive. Eggman grabbed a collar that he made for Sonic just incase he needed it. He fastened it around Sonic's neck. \"Wha...?\" Sonic groaned.<br>\r\n\"It's a multi purpose collar. If you try to escape\u00a0again, I'll activate a special feature on it, that I promise you won't like. For now it's an obedience collar. The cuff that was around your neck last night was making you bleed, so I have to use this instead.\" Eggman said. Sonic kept trying to rest his eyes before Eggman had his way with him. Eggman was going to run some tests on Sonic, but saw that he was in no condition for experimentation at the moment. \"I'm going to let you sleep for a few more hours.\" Eggman said, then lifted Sonic over the cage and dropped him in. Sonic groaned as Eggman attached the chain to his collar. Sonic crawled over to his makeshift bed, and curled up trying to get comfortable. Eggman saw Sonic struggling to get comfortable. Eggman took some tissue paper and dropped it on the opposite side of were Sonic was trying to sleep. Sonic noticed but didn't go for it. He just looked up at Eggman afraid that it was some kind of test. Eggman realized Sonic wasn't going to fall asleep until he left, so he walked out of the room. Sonic struggled to his feet and walked over to the tissue and dragged it back to his make shift bed. He folded it a few times and placed it on top of his bed then laid down on it then pulled some of the tissue over his body. Sonic was a little more comfortable then he was before. His bed was softer now and the collar was better than the cuff but it was still uncomfortable. He tugged on his collar hoping to pull it off but it wouldn't budge.

Eggman took Sonic over to the sink and washed the plaster off him before it dried. The water pressure was too high for Sonic at his size, and it pounded against his sore body. Eggman dried Sonic and changed the gauze on his open wounds. He placed Sonic back on the table and started wrapping gauze around his leg, then took off the glove on Sonic's left arm and did the same. Eggman figured if Sonic's injures didn't show improvement\u00a0after a while he would un-shrink him long enough to make casts for him. \"Put your shoe and glove back on\" Eggman said while putting things away. Sonic obeyed, carefully putting his shoe and glove back on over the gauze, then sat there, nervously waiting for Eggman's next move. Eggman walked over to the opposite side of where Sonic was sitting and put his index finger down on the table. \"Come.\" Eggman ordered. Sonic only looked up at Eggman shacking. \"Walk over here now!\" Eggman ordered again. Sonic still didn't move and He didn't want to obey Eggman at all, especially when Eggman talked to him like a pet. \"Do you want to be beaten again?\" Eggman yelled. With that Sonic struggled to get up on his feet and slowly limped over to Eggman's finger. Eggman was trying to see if Sonic had enough energy for any testing. He didn't. As soon as Sonic got to Eggman's finger he collapsed to his knees, panting and shacking. Eggman picked up Sonic by his quills again and held him in front of his face. Sonic looked into Eggman dark eyes and cried. \"P-please Eggman...I-I want to go h-home. You had your fun with m-me. P-please l-let me go.\" Sonic pleaded.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"I already told you your not going home. Ever. Don't make me remind you again!\" Eggman growled and carried Sonic back to his cage. Eggman gently placed Sonic on his make shift bed trying to prevent any more damage to his injures. Eggman chained Sonic back up then left. Shortly after Sonic passed out...</span></div></div>",

He was worried he'd never taste freedom again, that he was doomed to be Eggman's pet for the rest of his life. Even if he somehow managed to get out of his chains and cage, he wouldn't be able to run with is leg sprained, and if Eggman found out, the base would be put on lock down and Sonic would be beaten. Sonic stomach growled reminding him that he went another day with out food. He clenched his stomach in pain and curled up in a fetal position. He was too afraid to even ask for food. He didn't know how Eggman would react and he really didn't want to go through the pain and embarrassment of being force feed again. Sonic\u00a0started shacking. He felt so helpless and scared.

Sonic recognized the voices \"Wait a minute. Orbot? Cubot?\" he thought. The tissue was lifted off of Sonic and he was picked up by a cold metallic hand. \"Oh my look how small he is.\" Orbot said holding Sonic up to his face \"Aw ain't he cute, let me hold em.\" Cubot said. Orbot sighed and held Sonic over Cubot's hand \"Fine, but we must head back to the doctor he wanted us to retrieve Sonic for him.\" Orbot said then dropped Sonic onto Cubot's hand. Sonic grunted hitting Cubot's hand. Cubot held Sonic by his wast with is his thumb and index finger. \"Hey there little fella.\" Cubot said petting Sonic's head with his finger. Sonic was getting annoyed, he tried to do spin dash but Cubot was holding him too tight. He cringed every time Cubot pet him. He was petting him too hard and his head was being pulled back. Sonic's stomach growled again and he groaned. Cubot's auditory processors picked up Sonic's stomach growling and stopped petting him.\"Uhh, I recon their's something wrong with him.\" Cubot said then held Sonic by his quills in front of Orbot. Sonic's stomach growled again and he clenched his stomach. \"I think his hungry.\" said Orbot.<br>\r\n\"No duh.\" Sonic thought. Orbot picked up a radio and channeled Eggman. \"Sir?\" Orbot said into the radio.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"What do you want? Where's Sonic? I told you to bring him to me!\" Eggman yelled.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"We are sir but his stomach is growling. I think he's hungry.

As the two badniks took Sonic down the halls to Eggman, he squirmed trying get free and even tried biting and trying to stab them with his quills. He knew biting and stabbing won't work but he tried it anyways. He was terrified of facing Eggman again, crying just thinking of what Eggman might want at the moment.

After a few minutes Sonic started hearing music. Orbot opened the door to a large room, full of badniks and legionnaires. Most that saw Sonic come in looked at him with wicked grins. Sonic panicked and desperately tried to get free. Orbot and Cubot went to the largest table in the room and dropped Sonic in front of Eggman. Sonic looked up at Eggman shaking. \"Well if it isn't our little <i> guest of honor.</i> Oh ho ho ho!\" Eggman laughed reaching out to pick up Sonic. Sonic bolted, ignoring the pain from his sprained leg and ran from Eggman. Eggman took out the controller for Sonic's collar and activated the special feature on Sonic's collar. As soon as it activated Sonic tripped and skidded of the table. The legionnaire Lien-Da, who was sitting next to Eggman, grabbed Sonic before he hit the ground and slammed him on the table in front of Eggman. Eggman picked up Sonic and held him in front of his face. Sonic was wheezing and shaking. \"Looks like you gave me no chose hedgehog. Remember that special feature I told you about on your collar? Well I activated while you tried to escape, it neutralized your speed.\" Eggman growled.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"What!?!

Fortunately a service robot came and placed a plate of food in front of each person.\"You got lucky this time hedgehog.\" \u00a0Eggman scolded then took a unused whine cup and placed it over Sonic. Eggman took a burger off his plate and ripped into it. \u00a0Sonic stomach growled watching Eggman eat. He started drooling. He wanted something to eat just to ease the pain in his stomach, even if it was the crap he was feed the first night he was captured, he but knew no matter how much he begged, Eggman probably wasn't going to let him eat. Sonic clenched his stomach and tears rolled down his mussel. He leaned against the glass and sat down. Eggman noticed Sonic clenching his stomach, and decided to tease him a bit. Eggman picked up the whine glass, causing Sonic to fall over. Eggman held his burger in front of Sonic. Sonic tried backing up but Eggman stabbed a fork down into the table right behind Sonic nearly stabbing him and prevented him from backing up anymore. Eggman moved the burger closer to Sonic. \"You want this don't you hedgehog?\"Eggman teased. Sonic looked up at Eggman,\u00a0sorrowfully. \"Don't you.\" Eggman laughed, and pushed Sonic with his burger then went back to eating it. Eggman saw Sonic was covered with greece, ketchup, mustered, and mayo, after he shoved the burger into him, and got a wicked idea for a punishment. Sonic started to wipe the gunk off his fur and quills, but was grabbed by Eggman and held up to his face. Eggman grinned wickedly at Sonic sending a chill down Sonic's spine. Eggman opened his mouth and threw Sonic in then closed his mouth. Eggman stared to suck the greece and condiments off of Sonic. Sonic let out a horrible scream of agony and terror, and squirmed. After a minute Eggman spit Sonic out into a napkin and shook Sonic off and he fell to the table. Sonic curled up into a \u00a0fetal position\u00a0with wide eyes and stared hyperventilating, trembling and crying. He was horribly traumatized. He never felt so violated in his entire life. Eggman reached out to grab the horrified Sonic. Sonic screamed and tried to crawl away.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Eggman's reaction? \u00a0</span></div></div>",

Eggman really didn't expect to see Sonic freak out so much. \"Sonic calm down.\" Eggman ordered then nudged Sonic. That just made Sonic panic even more. Eggman pointed to a random\u00a0legionnaire. \"You, take Sonic and go wash him off, and don't lose him.\" Eggman ordered. Eggman was hoping if the saliva was washed off of Sonic's body he would calm down a bit. He picked Sonic up, despite his screaming, and handed him to the legionnaire. The legionnaire walked out of the party and headed for the bathroom. Sonic struggled to get free still hyperventilating. The legionnaire opened the door to the bathroom and walked over to the sink. He put the stopper in the drain, took Sonic's shoes and gloves off, placed Sonic in the sink, and turned the faucet on. Sonic's hydrophobia took hold of him. He desperately tried to climb out, over and over again, but he kept slipping. The legionnaire turned off the water. The water level only came up to Sonic's chest but he was still nervous about it. The legionnaire dunked Sonic's head under the water. Sonic squirmed and kicked trying to get his head back above the water. The legionnaire let go and Sonic pushed himself above the water. Sonic coughed and burped. He accidentally swallowed water when he was struggling. The legionnaire picked up Sonic and took soap and lathered it into his quills and fur, then dunked him back in the water. Sonic managed to kick himself out of the legionnaire's hand and he tried to climb up the walls of the sink. \"Your just making harder for yourself and me Sonic.\" the legionnaire said and grabbed Sonic and soaped and rinsed him off agian. After the legionnaire finished cleaning Sonic, he took a wash cloth and dried Sonic off. Sonic calmed down a bit after been dried, but it wasn't enough. Images of being trapped in Eggman's mouth played in his head. Sonic was shaking with a blank, shocked look on his face until the legionnaire threw Sonic's shoes and gloves at him. Sonic looked up at the legionnaire and put his gloves and shoes back on. The legionnaire grabbed Sonic and walked out of the bathroom.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does the legionnaire bring him?</span></div></div>",

Sonic curled back up into a fetal \u00a0position and started shaking. \"How'd you like your bath hedgehog?\" Eggman laughed and poked him. Sonic whimpered and covered his head. Sonic wasn't hyperventilating as bad as he was before his bath but he was still breathing heavy because of fear. \"Hedgehog calm down.\" Eggman ordered and poked him again. Sonic only shook and whimpered more. Sonic stomach growled again, and he clenched it in pain. Eggman pinched piece off from some bread and placed it in front of Sonic. Sonic looked at the bread and up at Eggman. He was afraid that it was a trap, since Eggman said he wasn't aloud to eat today. Eggman pushed the bread closer to Sonic. Sonic looked back at Eggman. \"Eat it.\" Eggman ordered. Once Sonic felt like it was safe, he slowly reached for the bread shaking. Sonic picked up the bread and sniffed it to make sure their was no poison on it and stuffed it in his mouth.

Sonic cried out in pain and held his sprained \u00a0leg. \"Looks like someone still needs to learn his place.\" Lien-Da growled. Lien-Da dropped Sonic to the ground and kicked him to a crowd of badniks and legionnaires. Sonic groaned, lifted himself up, and backed away from a bunch of badniks and legionnaires, but was grabbed from behind by a legionnaire. \"Where do you think your going?\" the legionnaire said and dropped him. Sonic looked up at the badniks and legionnaires, shivering. \"Hehe look how scared he is.\" \u00a0<br>\r\n\"What's wrong hedgehog scared?\"<br>\r\n\"Some hero he his. He can't even save himself.\"<br>\r\n\"Your not a hero.\"<br>\r\n\"You worthless twerp.\" the badniks and legionnaires teased Sonic. \"STOP!\" Sonic cried, with a little bit of tears forming in is eyes.

Sonic was lying on the ground violently shaking, with staggered and shaky breaths, struggling to breath. Tears fell down his face, his eyes were squeezed shut hoping for the beating to be over. Lien-Da bent down and picked up Sonic. \"n-no.....\" Sonic weakly wheezed. Lien-Da examined the poor hedgehog. Sonic was horribly bloody and\u00a0bruised, fading in and out\u00a0of consciousness. Lien-Da placed Sonic on a napkin in front of Eggman. Sonic slightly opened one of his swollen eyes and looked up at Eggman. \u00a0Eggman cheeks were rosy, he was laughing at him, and Sonic could smell alcohol on his breath. Eggman became drunk celebrating Sonic's capture, frighting Sonic. Sonic had never been around Eggman while he was drunk and didn't know how Eggman was going to act. Eggman lifted his fist over Sonic about to pound him. Sonic's ears flattened and he squeezed his eyes shut and shivered in fear and pain. Lien-Da stopped Eggman before he hit Sonic. \"Sir wait.\" Lien-Da said. Eggman looked down at Sonic. He passed out before Eggman \u00a0had the chance to pound him. Despite being drunk, Eggman gently picked up Sonic and checked if he was alive. Sonic's heart was pounding hard from all the stress and abuse and he was still struggling to breath. Eggman placed Sonic back on the napkin and let him rest. Throughout the night Eggman occasionally checked on Sonic until his heart beat and breathing went back to normal.....</span></div></div>",

Sonic, on the other hand, was not so happy. \"Wh-what's going on here?!?! Tails, help me out here!!! Hurry!!!!\" Sonic pleaded as he helplessly watched everything get smaller and smaller. Tails quickly realized that Sonic was growing much too fast. Sonic's body pressed up against the back of the lab. \"TAILS!!!!!!!\" Sonic cried urgently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic, calm down. It's just fine.\" Tails said, trying to calm Sonic down. Sonic was beginning to outgrow the lab. \"Uh-oh.\" Tails muttered as he took several steps back. He fled the lab, then watched as the lab didn't collapse, but Sonic rammed out the back of it. Sonic landed face-first on the ground. Tails rushed to Sonic's side. \"Sonic, are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic moaned softly and pushed himself up. He looked down at Tails in shock. \"T-Tails?\" Sonic asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're puny!\" Sonic stated in awe, grabbing and picking Tails up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tight, please.\" Tails grunted uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic loosened his grip on Tails a little. \"You're so cute at that size, Tails.\" Sonic giggled, jerking his sibling into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic, c-can you please put me down?\" Tails asked.</span></div></div>",

Sonic didn't respond. \"Sonic?\" Tails asked worriedly. Sonic hugged his knees and rested his chin in the shelter formed by his arms. \"Sonic, say something!!\" Tails flustered. Sonic shook his head weakly, looking more than a little depressed. \"Sonic\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go back inside. I\u2026I just need to think.\" Sonic mumbled. Tails sighed and walked back in. Sonic sat there for several minutes, then curled up on his side as he began feeling very upset. He began crying softly, causing Tails to come back out to check on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails felt deeply troubled to see his older brother crying. \"Sonic, are you alright?\" Tails asked gently. Sonic began reaching out for Tails, only for Tails to take several steps back. Sonic began sobbing, curling back up and beginning to quiver. \"S-Sonic!\" Tails yelped, rushing over to Sonic to try to calm him down. Sonic started to reach back out, but pulled back and began getting even worse. \"H-he really wants to hold me, doesn't he?\" Tails thought. \"And he doesn't seem to be feeling any better. So I might as well just let him.\" Tails sucked in a breath. \"Sonic, if you really wanna hold me, you can. I just needed a little time to adjust.\" Tails said comfortingly. Sonic uncurled, grabbed Tails, and yanked him into a hug. \"Whoa!\" Tails yelped. Sonic got a little worse. \"Sonic, it's just fine. Look at me. You just went too fast. You gotta be gentle with the little people, okay?\" Tails murmured, reaching up and wiping a few of Sonic's tears away.</span></div></div>",

Then, a loud variety of noises came from behind him. Tails whipped around, only to find Sonic curled up and crying. \"Sonic! S-Sonic, what's wrong?!?! A-are you okay!?!?\" Tails yelped as he rushed to his brother's side. Sonic now began trembling. Tails gently placed a hand on Sonic's leg. \"Sonic, what's the matter? I'm okay, and you know I'm not mad at you, so did something-\" Tails was stopped as Sonic literally wrapped his arms around Tails and cried into his shoulder. \"Sonic\u2026calm down. Please. It's just because you're really big. Don't worry. You just have to be gentle with the little people.\" Tails murmured, hugging Sonic back. Sonic sniffled, beginning to calm down. Tails stroked Sonic's cheek, hushing his older brother's slight whimpers. Eventually, Sonic calmed back down. Sonic let Tails go, so Tails went back inside.

Tails had originally thought of making himself grow, but Knuckles was able to punch through mountains, so he was definitely going to be able to break a few bones no matter how big Tails was, so Tails asked Sonic to be his test subject. Sonic noticed Knuckles and hid, worried he might hurt Knuckles like he had nearly hugged Tails to death. Knuckles punched down the door of the lab/house, grabbed Tails, and tossed him roughly outside. Tails yelped in pain. Sonic looked at the two, mentally debating whether or not to fight Knuckles off, rescue Tails, or stay hidden. Knuckles turned and stormed back to Tails. \"I told you to stop taking things behind my back.\" Knuckles growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you since last time you knocked me out the second I got you up.\" Tails whimpered timidly. Knuckles punched Tails, not too hard, but hard enough to make Tails scream. \"Knuckles, please, stop.\" Tails coughed. Sonic noticed that Knuckles was beyond ticked off, and immediately realized that if he stayed in hiding, Tails would definitely wind up in the hospital. He stood and snuck up behind the house, avoiding either male's view. </span></div></div>",

I'll handle him.\" Tails sniffled and nodded, then went inside. \"Thinks he can do that to Tails, huh? Well it's about time he figured out who he shouldn't be messing with.\" Sonic growled softly. He got back up and walked towards Knuckles. Knuckles looked up and cautiously inched back. \"That is NOT okay with me!!!!\" Sonic snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Knuckles asked in alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You punching my lil' bro. Not okay. Got it?\" Sonic snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Knuckles realized who it was. \"This is not the day to pick a fight with me!\" he spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then ya' shouldn't've picked one with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never stopping picking fights with people, do you!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hurt Tails, you've messed with the wrong little brother. You wanna back out and go now, fine with me. But it's a better idea than sticking around.\" And with that, Sonic folded his arms and scowled down at the red echidna. Knuckles just growled and headed toward where Tails was. Sonic grabbed Knuckles and lifted him off the ground. \"I warned you, you took your chances, now I think it's time to make sure you go.\" Sonic growled, then dropped Knuckles. As Knuckles was gliding, Sonic performed his 'Blue Tornado' and then, as Knuckles was now caught in the vortex, Sonic kicked the echidna, earning Knuckles an immediate need for hospitalization. But Sonic wasn't finished. Not as long as Knuckles was still conscious. Or, at least as long as Sonic /thought/ he was conscious. Knuckles was fading in and out, trying desperately to remain awake. Tails had come outside, having seen Sonic kick the tornado. He saw Sonic about to step on Knuckles's head, and he knew Sonic wasn't even truly aware of the fact that Knuckles couldn't even move. But he wasn't sure of what he should do.</span></div></div>",

It was insane. It only took two or three seconds to bang his head on the ceiling. Tails was awestruck. Sonic noticed that Tails was trapped, and he didn't have a nanosecond to waste. He quickly hunkered down over Tails to protect his younger sibling. He knew he didn't have time to even /try/ to evacuate Tails. Tails whimpered in fear, unsure of WHAT was happening at this point. He could hear Sonic grunting and whimpering. He didn't know what to do about it either. Sonic outgrew the lab. He peeked in at Tails, then noticed that Tails was just as frightened as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth stopped. Sonic sat up, Tails in his cupped hands, and peeked in at Tails. \"YOU OKAY?!!!!!!!\" Sonic's voice boomed. Tails yelped and shielded his ears. \"S-Sorry!!!\" Sonic said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails could recognize the voice, but this was too unreal.

It was almost like a scale or quill from an animal that had most likely gone extinct. After all, it was very beautiful and most beautiful objects that came from animals were taken through either skinning it or taking it out forcefully. He had contemplated these thoughts for a while before finally deciding to use it\u2026or at least figure out what it was and what it did, if it did anything at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does something like this even still exist? It couldn't have been kept safe for this long. But what if there's more of these somewhere? Maybe on a different continent or something. Oh well. I'm not gonna find anything out like this. I'll just analyze it and see what I can find out.\" Tails sighed, taking the scale over to a nearby machine. After a few minutes, the machine gave him the analysis. \"It would be impossible to use for decoration. But it's an excellent component for a lazer. But it seems to be unable to hurt anything. Hmm\u2026\" Tails then built the lazer gun and added the scale to make the actual lazer beam. \"Alright. Time to test it out!\" he thought.

Tails grabbed a small mouse to experiment on and used the beam on it. It practically evaporated, as far as they could tell. Sonic looked at where it had been to find that it was now /very/ small. \"Wow!\" Sonic gawked, picking the small rodent up. \"Look at it, Tails!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails came closer to see the shrunken mouse. \"So that's why the material is considered harmless. It can't hurt anything on its own.\" Tails mumbled, looking deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic tightened his grip a little bit, fearful that he might drop the tiny mouse, only to wind up crushing it. \"Oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't mean to kill it. I-I just didn't wanna drop it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You killed the mouse?\" Sonic nodded. \"Well, it was too small to have survived either way, so I don't think it actually matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sighed, walked by the laser gun that Tails had set down, and then stopped. The temptation was incredible. He couldn't even try to look away. Tails heard the gun move and looked to see that Sonic was holding it.

He fled until he found himself in a corner. He felt trapped. Then, the ground shook, very very slightly at first, but slowly increased in magnitude. Tails peeked out to see if he could figure out what it was, then saw red out of the corner of his eye. \"Something's coming. Something evil. But I can't move. My body won't let let me get up.\" Tails thought in panic. Suddenly, something huge came down nearby. A voice came from the 'monster' that was closing in. Tails screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic felt awful inside. The guilt was ripping his insides apart. And, worse than anything, Tails was scared of him. \"T-Tails?\" Sonic asked, moving a little closer. Tails now screamed. \"Tails!\" Sonic yipped, dropping to both knees to make sure Tails was alright. Tails fainted. Sonic's eyes widened. \"Tails?\" he whimpered, gingerly lifting Tails off the floor. He then cradled the fox in his arms and headed to their house. (considering they are brothers even though adopted I believe they share a house.)

I'm sorry I did this to you. Just please don't be mad. And please be okay.\" Sonic thought, his stomach aching as the guilt churned it wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails slowly awoke. His eyes opened but he couldn't figure out what was going on. He could feel the ground shift beneath him and it felt warm\u2026and sort of soft. He couldn't figure out what it was. There was something holding him in place. \"Where am I? Am I still on Mobius? Is this even real?\" Tails wondered. Then, a slight bit of light shone in, allowing him to see out and most of what was surrounding him. The thing he was stuck lying down on was peach-colored and seemed to expand and contract. The thing holding him down was white. Everything else seemed to be blue. \"What is that? Is that a hand? I think so. It's wearing some sort of material.

Tails saw something like water fill the giant, green eyes. Then, his view of said eyes was gone. He was set on a table, forced to watch as his older brother curled up on the couch and began crying. Tails could only see Sonic's back side, but the entire figure shuddered and he could hear Sonic's irregular breathing pattern. \"He's scared of me. I didn't mean for anything like this to happen. It's all my fault.\" Sonic's thoughts echoed in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic?\" Tails asked, but Sonic didn't answer. \"Sonic, are you alright?!\" Tails asked. Sonic still didn't respond. Tails froze, now putting his memories of before he had collapsed and now together. \"He's crying because he shrank me. He must have just gotten too excited about it, and not realized what he had done. But now how do I get him to feel better? I guess I should just try to calm him down first.

I could attack Eggman's base as revenge to all of Eggman's attempts to conquer the world.\" He then walked towards Eggman's base.

Tails then decided to destroy a part of Eggman's base,but before that,he said \"This shall be your lesson for trying constantly to conquer the world.\" He then destroyed a part of the base.

After that,he said \"Wow Tails,it's as if I've been shrunk!\" Tails chuckled. He also felt as if he shrunk Sonic. Tails then heard on the radio \"WARNING!

Anything new?\" Sonic said happily. \"Not much,except that i recently created a size changing machine which malfunctioned and fired at me. But nothing happened,strangely.\" Tails said.

Tails was trying his best to help out, but Sonic kept having to get him out of the way. \"Tails, maybe you should sit out for this one, okay? You're gonna get hurt.\" Sonic sighed, setting Tails down behind a few piles of scrap metal, broken robots, and things of the like. He ducked, evading another laser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna help!\" Tails protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, bud. I know. But I got it. Just keep safe, alright? Besides, while I'm doin' all this, you can go looting, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you can keep it. I know you wanna help, but it's a little too dangerous for you. So, since you wanna help so bad, you can take the time to go shopping. And you can keep whatever you get.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\u2026\" Tails sighed, knowing that this would be a once in a lifetime opportunity. Sonic ruffled Tails's bangs and took off. \"Guess I'd better get lookin'.\" he muttered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was having a hard time handling the robot, even though he wasn't willing to say that to Tails, but he wasn't about to risk his best friend's safety. Tails, meanwhile, was rooting through the piles of metal and stuff nearby. He had found several scraps that he could use. Then, he found some sort of gun. \"I wonder if this still works.\" Tails thought as he picked the gun up. He fired at a small wheel he had found earlier. It grew to about his size. \"No way. That's so cool!\" Tails thought excitedly. \"Now let's see if it works on living things.\" And with that, he fired it on himself. \"AAAHHH!!!!!\" he shrieked, a burning pain coursing throughout his entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails!\" Sonic thought, turning to look at where he had left Tails. \"AH!!!!!\" he cried in pain, having just been shot in the back. \"I'm sorry, Tails.\" Sonic thought as his vision faded out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had just managed to shake off the pain and look around. He saw Sonic being fired at by the large robot. \"Dang it. I'm still too small to help him. But this\u2026heehee\u2026oh yes. Being small won't be a problem much longer.\" he thought, then upped the voltage a bit. He fired again. He began growing much more rapidly. In a matter of mere minutes, he was many times the size of the machine that had knocked Sonic out. \"Yoohoo! Oh Doctor Eggman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked at Tails and literally wet his pants. \"The hedgehog's little friend, f-found the growth ray!?\" he thought in alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stepped in front of the machine, nearly stepping on Sonic in the process. \"Hee hee. You look kinda scared to see me. Well, I woulda played nice\u2026if you hadn't shot my big brother. So, how's about we try a little something out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Eggman asked, urgently trying to hide his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna see how much stronger I got.\" Tails snickered. And with that, he punched the robot, thus causing it to exploded and sending Eggman flying into a wall. Tails then looked down at Sonic with worried eyes. \"Hey, Sonic, can you hear me? If you can, try to talk. Don't worry, it's safe now. And I'm alright. So please, wake up.\" </span></div></div>",

I'm not gonna hurt you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic swallowed hard, staring wide-eyed at his enormous, younger brother. He shivered a bit whenever Tails moved. Tails sighed and put Sonic back down. Sonic took a few, startled steps back, then fell. Tails looked greatly upset by this. He sniffled, sat down, hugged his knees, and rested his chin in the shelter formed by his arms, and rubbed his nose with his finger. Sonic paused, looking up at Tails with timid eyes. He noticed how upset Tails appeared to be.</span></div></div>",

So, ya' just gotta bear with me. I'm used to you being smaller than me. And next thing I know, you're holding me, like, 10 feet off the ground! That's something I can't honestly say I'll ever be ready for!\" Sonic flustered. Tails didn't answer. Sonic noticed that Tails seemed to be crying at this point. His ears went down. \"Tails, please. Don't get upset. I'm sorry. \u2026whenever you're feeling better, meet me back at the house, okay? I\u2026I just don't wanna risk making you feel any worse.\" he sighed, turning to head out. \"And thanks for helping me out earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails realized that him being upset was making Sonic feel upset too. \"I can't let him feel as bad as I already do. I gotta stop him.\" he thought. He grabbed Sonic and pulled him into a hug. \"Please, don't leave. I don't wanna be all alone.\" Tails sniffled. Sonic looked down. Tails noticed that he hadn't quite said that in a\u2026comforting way. After all, Sonic was trying to make him feel better, and he had just made it sound like Sonic was about to make it worse. \"I-I didn't mean it like that!\" Tails yipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Sonic whimpered, burying his face in Tails's fur. Tails sighed softly, stood up, picked up the piles he had been looting, picked up his pile, and headed home. </span></div></div>",

Knuckles was struggling to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic leaned back comfortably. \"That should keep him from making me do something worse. And keep his mouth shut for now.\" Sonic thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles was having extreme difficulty breathing, so he began using every bit of strength he could muster in an attempt to escape.</span></div></div>",

Sonic felt movement and leaned away from it, not realizing that the movement was Knuckles. Knuckles crawled out, unable to see straight or maintain his balance. Sonic mentally cursed himself for letting Knuckles escape\u2026until Knuckles went limp. Sonic jumped, startled by Knuckles's sudden cease in motion. \"Kn-Knux?\" Sonic asked worriedly, gently picking Knuckles up. Knuckles didn't respond, but Sonic was able to tell that Knuckles was breathing, though it was quite heavy. \"Knuckles\u2026I\u2026I didn't\u2026mean anything\u2026by it\u2026\" Sonic said weakly. His ears went down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed. Knuckles sat up. \"Oh, my head\u2026\" he groaned, examining his surroundings. He noticed Sonic staring at him. \"Get away from me!!!! You dirty, annoying, arrogant, back-stabbing jerk!!!!\" Knuckles snapped. Sonic stood up and set Knuckles on the couch. \"Oh ***. Please, not again.\" Knuckles whimpered, but his only replies were several sniffles as Sonic trudged out of the room. \"Sonic? Hey!! Wait a minute!!!!!\" Knuckles called after the blue giant, but Sonic was already gone. All of the sudden, he heard sobbing. It wasn't female, and it wasn't a kid, so Knuckles decided to go find out what the sound was. He wound up following the sound to the room Sonic had disappeared into. He looked around, following the sound of crying. To his shock, he found Sonic in a fetal position, crying extremely hard, and quivering. \"Hey, Sonic, you alright?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I-I didn't\u2026m-mean\u2026a-anything\u2026by it\u2026I was\u2026just so\u2026h-hurt inside\u2026I-I\u2026I'm sorry, Kn-Knuckles.\" Sonic whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles hung his head and shook it. \"I can't believe I did this to him.\" he thought as he came close and gently put a hand on Sonic's back. \"Sonic, I'm sorry for what I said. Just calm down.\"</span></div></div>",

But I feel like you just wanna shove me off a cliff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles sighed. \"Alright, I'll stop\u2026 as soon as you stop being a *******.\" Sonic looked down, honestly very hurt by how Knuckles kept treating him. Knuckles shook his head. \"He's really shaken up. Good grief. I never knew anything could do this to him. \u2026I have to help him.\" Knuckles thought. \"Sonic, come on. I didn't mean it. It's just, we normally fight, and I'm not really sure what's going on, or if I can trust you since right now I can't really defend myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic took a deep breath to calm himself down. \"That's not true, Knuckles.

He had already finished the actual fight, now he was just chasing Eggman. Eggman reached a window. \"You haven't seen the last of me, hedgehog!\" Eggman stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sneered at this. \"I know that, Egghead.\" Sonic snickered, his eyes giving off an almost evil glare. He put the whole base on lockdown, thus preventing Eggman's escape. \"I know you won't escape. 'Cuz I'm not done with you yet.\" Eggman looked frightened, scared, maybe even terrified. \"Ya' see, Tails made this.\" Sonic began, pulling out a laser gun. \"Wanted me to find something\u2026organic\u2026to test it on. I thought of testing it on your robots, but that just didn't feel right. Sure it worked\u2026but we both know your little machines aren't really alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-why d-d-don't y-you t-t-test it on s-s-somebody else?\" Eggman stuttered, feeling very frightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nobody else I'd rather use it on than you. You should feel flattered. I don't say stuff like that to a lot of people, Eggy. So, if you don't want me to use it on your corpse, I suggest you hold still and let me use it on you. Otherwise, I might just have to make sure you never move again. Once I'm done, I'll show you to Tails, and he can fix you. But if you tell him that I gave you the choice between being the test subject and death, I'll still kill you. Do you understand?\" Sonic asked as he stepped closer, like a beast closes in for the kill. Eggman could only nod. \"Just know that, if you dodge this, I'll kill you.\" Sonic fired the laser.</span></div></div>",

He tucked the weapon into his \u2018pocket\u2019 and leaned in the machine. Inside, he found Eggman trembling at only a few inches tall. He grinned slightly, trying to make Eggman feel a little better, but it didn't work. \"Jeez'. He looks like he's gonna have a heart attack. I hope he won't\u2026I hope he's not too scared.\" Sonic thought in concern. He reached down and gently picked the shrunken human up. Eggman looked like he would die at any given moment. \"Poor guy. I gotta do something. I just hope I didn't give him too big a scare earlier.\" Sonic thought as he set Eggman down on a nearby desk. He sat down in the chair. \"Hey, Eggman, it's gonna be okay. Deep breaths. In and out, in and out. I'm not really gonna hurt ya'. I just wanted to make sure you wouldn't try to run. It's alright.\" Sonic murmured, gently tapping the man's back. Eggman calmed down tremendously, putting Sonic at ease. \"Now come on. We gotta get ya' to Tails.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman looked up, and, to his horror, he was met by an enormous pair of eyes. \"S-S-Sonic, is th-that you!?\" he asked in alarm, stumbling backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come on.\" Sonic attempted, reaching down to grab the doctor. \"Eggman!\" Sonic yipped as the human toppled over. He immediately grabbed Eggman and used his sensitive ears to check if the man was still breathing and check his heart rate. He was breathing and his heartbeat was still steady. Sonic gave a sigh of relief, undid the lockdown, and ran out of the base.</span></div></div>",

But now what do I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman moaned, coming around. The first thing he noticed was that he was trapped against something warm and\u2026actually rather comfortable. The thing above him was warm and smooth while the thing under him was constantly moving but was very soft, almost like a blanket or a good pillow. \"What is this?\" he wondered aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feelin' any better, Eggy?\" Sonic's voice came from outside. \"I-I'm really sorry 'bout how I acted earlier. I needed somebody to test it on, and you have no idea how many times I missed the rabbits and whatever else I could find. So I hope you're not mad about it. And please don't be scared.

So just try to keep calm.\" Sonic replied gently. Eggman felt a part of the object that had been holding him still wrap around his waist. An almost blinding light surrounded him as Sonic moved him onto the coffee table. As he was released, he struggled to find his feet. Once able to stand up, he looked around, his back to Sonic at the moment. Everything was huge. Sonic cautiously slipped off the couch and got on both knees in front of Eggman, who still had his back to the blue hedgehog. Sonic rested his arms on the table and rested his chin on them, waiting to see what Eggman's response would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman could hardly believe what he saw. Everything was practically the size of a house to him. Then, as he continued turning, he saw something that put everything else to shame. He had just seen Sonic. \"S-Sonic!\" he yelped, falling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, Eggy. I won't hurt ya'. It's alright.\" Sonic hushed the human.

Eggman shivered with fright. Suddenly, he found himself plummeting into the hedgehog's mouth. He landed on Sonic's tongue, which rubbed against him a few times. Then, a tidal wave forced the doctor down into the depths of Sonic's stomach. Before he landed, Sonic ate the cure, thus Eggman was once again his normal size. Sonic let out a loud belch and rubbed his huge belly. \"Ahhh\u2026 That's better.\" Sonic sighed contently. Tails entered the room to check on Sonic. \"Hey, Tails. Maybe next time we should let you get the good part.\" Sonic yawned. Tails sat down on his bed. This feels /SO/ good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, Sonic.\" Tails sighed. Sonic let out another loud belch as Eggman now began trying to get out. \"Wow. He's really in trouble now, isn't he?\" Tails giggled.
