            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having just gotten home from a long day at work, I was hoping to have a quiet evening with my daughter.  But those hopes were shattered when I saw the all too familiar car of Olivia\u2019s boyfriend.  I\u2019d told her dozens of times that she couldn\u2019t have people over while I wasn\u2019t home; least of all her obnoxious 17-year-old boyfriend Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking the car in the garage, I walked into the house; only to find it empty.  I began to wonder where they could be when I heard a thump come from upstairs.  <i>Of course, why am I not surprised.</i>  Placing my gun and police badge on the counter, I walked upstairs to find Olivia\u2019s bedroom door closed.  I reached out to open it; only to stop when I heard what I thought was moaning coming through the door.  <i>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, I found Olivia lying topless on her bed with Kyle on top of her; the two of them making out with each other.  Making my presence known, I said, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a chorus of cursing as Kyle and Olivia scrambled to get out of bed.  Olivia quickly put her shirt back on; turning to me with an embarrassed look in her eyes.  \u201cDad, I-I thought you were working late tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got off work early; thought we could spend some time together before you start school again.\u201d Turning to Kyle, I said, \u201cBut I see you\u2019ve already made plans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never particularly liked Kyle Johnson; he was your stereotypical jock, thinking he was better than everyone else.  My opinion of him was reinforced when he said, \u201cListen, man, we were just...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you were doing, Kyle.\u201d Getting annoyed, I said, \u201cYou were getting a little personal with my 15-year-old daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should clarify something right now; Olivia isn\u2019t my biological daughter.  I started dating her mother shortly after she was born; her biological father wasn\u2019t in the picture, so I was the only father she knew.  After my wife died in a car crash a few years back, it became just the two of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Olivia said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re overreacting; it\u2019s not like we were having sex or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so because you weren\u2019t having sex that makes everything alright?\u201d turning to Olivia, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that he\u2019s an 18-year-old dating a minor; if I wanted to, I could have him arrested right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout acknowledging what I said, Kyle turned to Olivia and said, \u201cCome on babe, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia hesitated for a moment; torn between listening to me and going off with her boyfriend.  Looking at Kyle, she said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know, maybe you should leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d scoffing, Kyle said, \u201cCome on babe, you\u2019re always complaining about how overprotective your Dad is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Kyle started to retrieve his and Olivia\u2019s things.  I knew enough to figure out what he was planning.  Moving in front of the doorway, I said, \u201cKyle, if you leave here with my daughter I\u2019ll have you charged with kidnapping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my years as a deputy even I was surprised by what happened next; Kyle took a swing and punched me in the nose.  As I stumbled back, Olivia ran towards me, \u201cDaddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could get to me, Kyle grabbed her arm and pulled her out of the room.  \u201cCome on, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I regained my senses, I ran downstairs after them; as Olivia screamed at Kyle to let her go.  Retrieving my gun, I ran out of the house just as Kyle peeled off down the street.  Running to my car, I got in and started after them.  Driving down the street, my lights flashing, I grabbed my police scanner and said, \u201cThis is Officer Sheppard; be on the lookout for a 2016 silver F150, license plate 327-XDC.\u201d Turning onto the main road, I said, \u201cDriver has assaulted an officer and taken a minor against her will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued driving down the road, I had no idea that things were about to get weird.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost 20 minutes had gone by since I started chasing after Kyle and Olivia; despite the best efforts of myself and the other officers, we hadn\u2019t found them yet.  I was driving through some residential streets, hoping in vain to spot the truck, when I heard my cell phone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing it, I was relieved when I saw it was Olivia.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cOlivia, honey, where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy, I-I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you, Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe-We\u2019re on the access road leading to the dam.\u201d Pausing, Olivia said, \u201cDaddy, there\u2019s something here that you need to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything else, Olivia ended the call.  Putting the phone back on the seat, I spun the car around and started towards the dam on the outskirts of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a 10 minute drive to the dam.  After driving for about \u00bd a mile, I spotted Olivia waving at me from the side of the road.  Stopping the car, I got out and ran over to her.  Crying, Olivia came over and hugged me, \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie,\u201d kissing her head, I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-We found something in a clearing.\u201d Pointing towards a dull glow in the distance, Olivia said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter retrieving my gun from the car, I followed Olivia towards the clearing.  We arrived to find Kyle standing outside of...well, I don\u2019t know what it was.  Whatever it was, it was shaped like an oval and was probably around 12 feet tall.  A quick glance around the clearing showed some downed branches; whatever this thing was, it fell from the sky.  Remembering why I was here, I turned my attention to Kyle.  Going up to him, I grabbed him by the shirt collar and said, \u201cI ought to beat the shit out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook man, I just wanted to be with your daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop calling me man; you can call me Officer Sheppard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kyle could respond, we were interrupted by the loud humming noise.  The noise got louder until an opening into the object appeared behind us.  Looking at the opening, Kyle said, \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; but I\u2019m calling this in.\u201d grabbing my radio, I was about to speak when I saw Kyle walking into the opening.  \u201cDon\u2019t go inside, you idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn\u2019t stop him from entering.  Olivia stood behind me and called out to him, \u201cKyle, come back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud noise from inside the object; almost if something had slammed shut.  After a moment, Olivia and I heard banging and what sounded like Kyle calling for help.  Olivia started towards the opening, but I stopped her and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Olivia stayed outside, I went through the opening and found myself in the strangest place I\u2019d ever been in.  There were several consoles and what looked like pipes, all leading to a hollow tube in the middle of the room \u2013 with Kyle inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked over to the tube, I could hear Kyle\u2019s muffled attempts to speak.  \u201cGet me out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d Turning towards the tube, I said, \u201cNext time how about you don\u2019t go inside the strange object.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around the room for anything that would open the tube; but I there wasn\u2019t anything useful that I could see.  Looking at the consoles, I saw strange writing on them.  What the hell is this place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued looking around when I heard footsteps behind me.  Turning around, I saw Olivia standing in front of the tube.  \u201cKyle, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; just get me out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the room filled with the sound of distant rumbling.  Olivia and I could only watch as some strange gas started seeping into the chamber; followed by Kyle suddenly doubling over in pain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olivia and I were momentarily confused as to what was going on.  Suddenly my urge to beat the crap out of Kyle was replaced with the urge to get him out of the tube.  While I looked around for anything to break the chamber, I turned to Olivia, \u201cHoney, find something to break the glass.  We have to get him out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn\u2019t move; instead, she just stood there in front of the tube, mesmerized but what was happening inside.  Whatever the gas was that was entering the chamber, it was having a shocking effect on Kyle \u2013 it was changing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first notable change that we saw was his skin changing from its normal white color to dark green.  It wasn\u2019t that the skin color was changing; the skin itself was also changing, as scales appeared on his body.  Slamming a hand on the glass, struggling to fight the pain, Kyle said, \u201cG-Get m-me out o-of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to searching for anything that I could use to break the chamber, but there was nothing that was useful.  Meanwhile, Olivia was trying to keep Kyle\u2019s spirits up, \u201cDon\u2019t worry babe, we\u2019ll get you out of there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time almost 90% of Kyle\u2019s body was covered in scales; with the changes now progressing to his face.  The changes reminded me of those cheesy transformation scenes in old movies; as Kyle\u2019s face slowly changed to resemble a canine snout.  Another shocking change was the sudden appearance of a second, slightly smaller, set of eyes.  I gave up searching as I was too engrossed by what was happening in the tube.  By this point, Kyle\u2019s screams of pain had turned into guttural, almost primal, growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kyle fell to his knees, as a series of cracking noises escaped the chamber.  I watched in silent horror as Kyle\u2019s legs bent themselves into an impossible position.  While this was happening, Kyle\u2019s feet and hands changed into paws; each with 3 sharp claws protruding from them.  I quickly realized that, by this point, the Kyle we knew no longer existed \u2013 having been replaced by a large, scaly, quadrupedal creature.  Unfortunately, the changes didn\u2019t stop there; the creature\u2019s back started to bubble up; as a series of sharp spines burst out of its skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was left of the gas soon dissipated and we were left with a clear image of the creature inside the chamber.  It looked to be about the size of a large bulldog; with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth.  It must\u2019ve sensed that we were in the room because suddenly it started growling and clawing at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, without warning, the chamber door opened.  Before I could stop her, Olivia stepped closer to the creature.  Reaching her hand out, she said, \u201cK-Kyle, are you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia got an answer, just not the one she wanted, when the creature lunged at her.  Before she knew what was happening, the creature had latched onto Olivia\u2019s arm.  Seeing my daughter in danger, I snapped back to reality and went to save her.  Coming from behind the creature, I grabbed it and tried to pull it off of Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made it angry, as it released its grip on Olivia and turned its attention to me.  In my attempt to dodge it, I caught one of its spines on my side.  I was soon on the ground, lying on my back, trying to keep the creature from biting me.  The room was suddenly filled with the sound of gunfire; followed by the creature\u2019s pained cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around I saw Olivia holding my gun, which I must\u2019ve lost in the scuffle.  In pain, but still able to fight, the creature lunged towards Olivia; only for her to finally kill it with a shot to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the floor, I made my way to Olivia; who collapsed to the floor in shock.  I quickly removed my shirt and made a tourniquet around Olivia\u2019s badly mangled arm.  Once that was taken care of, we both just stared at the creature lying in a pool of blood on the floor \u2013 wondering what could have turned a human being into something like that.</span></div></div>",

While the area was cordoned off, the EMTs tended to the injuries that Olivia and I had sustained.  After examining the extensive damage to Olivia\u2019s arm, the EMT said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to get you to the hospital.\u201d Looking at her, he said, \u201cWho knows what kind of bacteria that...thing was carrying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a little respect?\u201d turning to face him, I said, \u201cThat thing, as you called it, used to be my daughter\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I'll be more respectful sir.\u201d Sighing, the EMT said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take her to the ER now, you should come along as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch up later, I want to stay here for a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ambulance left the scene, I walked down to the clearing just as the creature was being removed from the object.  Getting closer, I heard one of the coroners say, \u201cWhat the hell is this thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother coroner, a young woman, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know; but whatever it is, it\u2019s creepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them both, I said, \u201cAs strange as it sounds, something inside that object turned my daughter\u2019s boyfriend into that\u2026thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, I said, \u201cDoes this seem like something I\u2019d make up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the clearing was awash with light; as a series of helicopters suddenly appeared overhead.  Before I could even ask myself what was going on, I saw half a dozen soldiers come out of the woods and into the clearing.  They made their way over to where everyone was standing.  One of the soldiers, an older man, said, \u201cI\u2019m Colonel Jackson; I have to ask that you all leave the area immediately.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cThis is now a government operation, your presence is not required.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to argue with the man but thought better of it.  Turning to my guys, I said, \u201cYou heard the man, everyone leave the area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I followed my people out of the clearing, I saw the helicopters landing as the troops cordoned off the area.  But I couldn\u2019t worry about that now, I had to get to the hospital to check on Olivia.</span></div></div>",

I promised her that no matter what, I'd keep Olivia safe.  As I drove into town, I feared tonight would be the time I failed that promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was starting to rain when I arrived at the hospital.  After parking my car, I ran into the ER and went right to the desk.  \"My daughter, Olivia Sheppard, was just brought in.  Can you tell me what room she's in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse behind the counter, a young man, went to work on the computer.   After what seemed like an eternity, he said, \"She's down the hall in Triage 1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way down the hall, I walked into the room to find a nurse applying some bandages to Olivia's arm.  The nurse must've sensed I was in the room, because she looked up at me and said, \"Sir, you can't be in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell I can't, that's my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies sir.\" Standing up, she said, \"I'm all finished here; the doctor will be in shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the nurse left the room, closing the door behind her, I went over to Olivia's bedside.  \"Olivia, honey, it's dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey must've given her some powerful painkillers, because she seemed pretty out of it.  Turning to me, slowly, she said, \"Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright honey, I'm here.\" Taking her uninjured hand in mine, I said, \"I'm so happy you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Where's Kyle?\" Slurring a little bit, Olivia said, \"I-Is he alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her current condition I didn't have the heart to tell her the truth.  Sighing, I lied and said, \"He's down the hall, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment the doctor walked into the room.  \"Hello, I'm Doctor Samson.\" Closing the door, he said, \"I understand your daughter was attacked by an animal?  Do you know what kind it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't.\" Pausing, not sure I should go into much detail, I said, \"I've never seen anything like it in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the creature was, it caused massive damage to your daughter's arm.  It's a miracle she didn't bleed out.\" Looking at the clipboard, he said, \"Her bloodwork shows that she's fighting an infection; which we're combating with antibiotics.  We should know in the morning if it's successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, sir.\" Getting up, he said, \"In the meantime, we're going to move Olivia to a room in the ICU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point Olivia had slipped into unconsciousness.  I waited by her bedside until a nurse came to bring her upstairs.  Before I left to follow, I squeezed her hand and kissed her forehead. \"I love you, sweetie.\"</span></div></div>",

I spent most of my waking hours making sure Olivia was alright.  There were a few times where her breathing got shallow that I feared she wasn\u2019t breathing, but thankfully it was nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve fallen asleep at some point, because I was startled awake when Dr. Samson entered the room.  \u201cGood morning, Mr. Sheppard; I trust you slept well last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly, doc.\u201d Sighing, I got out of the chair, \u201cHow\u2019s Olivia doing this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems to be improving; her fever is down, which is a good thing.\u201d Checking Olivia\u2019s vitals, he said, \u201cThe lab still hasn\u2019t been able to identify the bacteria samples taken from the wounds.  It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s not from this world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea, doc.  \u201cSo is she out of the woods?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell for sure; but I\u2019d say her prognosis is pretty good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound of footsteps filled the room; as half a dozen people ran past in the direction of the nurses\u2019 station.  Both Dr. Samson and I shared the same confused expression; looking at him, I said, \u201cI wonder what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Olivia alone in the room, Dr. Samson and I made our way down the hall to the nurses\u2019 station; where everyone was focused on a TV on the wall.  Getting closer, I saw a young female reporter in some unfamiliar town.  Behind her, I saw something similar to the object which changed Kyle.  \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered me; they were too focused on the TV.  Turning my attention back, I listened to the reporter as she started to speak. \u201cThis is Elena Rojas; reporting live from downtown Hartland.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cAs you can see behind me, the police have cordoned off a strange object which was dropped by an unknown flying craft only moments ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was briefly overpowered by the sound of what could only be the unknown craft; followed by several loud thumps in the distance.  It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that they were other objects hitting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been able to gather; there are strange markings on the side of the object.  No one has been able to decipher what they mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was suddenly interrupted by an all too familiar sound.  I could only watch as gas started venting from holes in the side of the object.  Those that were closest to the object were affected first; as they doubled over in pain.  There was one big difference this time; the changes were much quicker.  Within almost 20 seconds of exposure, those affected had been transformed into the same dog-like creature as Kyle.  I also noticed some were transformed into something else; a tall reptilian-like bipedal creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, everyone was screaming in fear; as both creatures started attacking.  The dog-like creatures started attacking people indiscriminately; children, adults, all were targeted.  Meanwhile, the bipedal creatures were grabbing anyone they could and pulling them towards the gas; creating more of the creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a strange craft landed next to the pod; the bipedal creatures started grabbing women and pulling them towards it.  It was then that I noticed something \u2013 they were only grabbing pregnant women.  What\u2019s going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Elena had moved to safety behind a nearby car; recording the carnage around her.  \u201cI can\u2019t explain what\u2019s going on here; I\u2019ve never seen anything...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena was suddenly interrupted when one of the bipedal creatures grabbed her and started pulling her towards the gas.  Her screams and kicking were ineffective; everyone in the room watched as the camera recorded her transformation into a dog-like creature.  Within seconds the camera had stopped transmitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the hall was frightened; wondering what we\u2019d just seen.  Before anyone could ask about what they\u2019d just seen, we were interrupted by a distant rumbling.  Whatever happened in Hartland, only 20 miles away, had just arrived here in Eastbourne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone, including Dr. Samson, panicked and fled the scene; I made my way back to Olivia's room, intent on keeping her safe no matter what.  Arriving back in the room, I walked into find Olivia awake in bed.  Looking at me, she said, \"Daddy, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, honey; but I'm going to find out.\" as a rumbling sound came from outside the building, I said, \"Stay here and keep quite, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly closed the door to Olivia's room and did what I could to barricade it.  Going down the hall, I found myself standing in the elevator lobby; looking out a window overlooking the hospital campus.  As it turned out, the rumbling noise was coming from a large alien craft landing across the green by the Maternity Ward.</span></div></div>",

Stopping around the corner from the entrance, I heard women screaming inside the ward.  Taking a quick glance around the corner, I spotted some of the bipedal aliens forcibly removing the pregnant patients.  I was surprised to find them also removing some of the males present in the ward; I figured they were probably the husbands or boyfriends of the expectant mothers.<br>\r\nGoing back around the corner, I thought aloud to myself, \u201cWhy are these...things so interested in pregnant women?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was torn from my thoughts when I heard a man screaming.  \u201cNo! Let her go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking around the corner again, I saw a man slightly older than myself trying to remove a young teenage girl from the grip of one of the aliens.  I realized I should do something to help, but there were too many of the creatures and I only had a pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one of the creatures came up and grabbed hold of the man; causing the young girl to start screaming, \u201cDaddy!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, helpless to do anything, as the creature pulled him back into one of the rooms; coming out before throwing a small canister into the room and closing the door.  I wondered what was going on; when, seconds later, the door burst open and one of the dog-like creatures came out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to cut my losses, I made my way to a nearby stairwell and went upstairs; starting the trek back to the ICU.  Stopping by a nearby window, I watched as the creatures led the captured people onto the ship.  As the ship took off, I dreaded whatever fate was to befall those poor people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time, but I managed to get back to the ICU unscathed.  Getting to Olivia\u2019s room, I unbarricaded the door and opened it; barely missed the glass being thrown at my head.  \u201cOlivia it\u2019s me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia must\u2019ve hidden in the bathroom; because she suddenly ran out of there and embraced me.  \u201cDaddy, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d looking up at me, she said, \u201cW-What are these things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her close, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, sweetie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

There was lots of screaming and gunfire.  The few times that I risked taking a peek, I saw that the streets below were in absolute chaos; with cops and bystanders attacking the fighting the creatures.  I saw several the dog-like creatures attacking people; leaving only bloody remains behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Olivia joined me at the window; bursting into tears when she saw the dog-like creatures below.  Collapsing to the floor, she said, \u201cDaddy, I-I can\u2019t stop thinking about Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, honey.\u201d Closing the shade, I knelt down on the floor next to Olivia.  Holding her, I said, \u201cI may not have liked him that much, if at all, but no one deserved to go through that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly considered telling Olivia about the soldiers cordoning off the clearing, but I decided against it.  I could only imagine what they were doing to the deceased creature that had been Kyle.  Wiping tears from her eyes, Olivia said, \u201cW-What are we going to do now, Daddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, honey; there are too many of those things out there.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t make it 20 feet before we were killed, or worse...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia didn\u2019t need to ask what I meant; chances were good that if we tried to escape, we\u2019d end up being turned into one of those creatures down there.  Leaning against my shoulder, she closed her eyes and tried to ignore the sounds outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stayed like that for a while; jumping occasionally when a loud noise outside startled us.  After what I figured was about an hour, we suddenly heard a noise from out in the hallway.  Gesturing for Olivia to be quite, I quietly made my way to the door.

Stepping out of the room, my hand on my gun, I said, \u201cStop right there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve got help us!\u201d looking at me, a panicked girl in her mid-20s said, \u201cThose things are everywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked around the room at the panicked people, I was torn between my oath as a cop and wanting to keep Olivia safe.  The people were in various states of panic; some of them wounded, one of them was missing the lower portion of his right arm.  Before I could make a decision, Olivia came out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the people, she said, \u201cDaddy, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese people were fleeing from those things outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be helping them?\u201d standing next to me, a concerned look on her face, Olivia said, \u201cI mean some of them look really messed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now my biggest concern is keeping you safe.\u201d Pulling Olivia aside, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m keeping 12 other people safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to figure something out because I\u2019m helping them.\u201d Grabbing some bandages from a nearby shelf, Olivia looked at me and said, \u201cIf Mom saw you right now, she\u2019d be so disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Olivia went to work; handing out bandages and helping out where she could.  Her words echoed in my head; and she was right, Amy would be disappointed in me.  Following in Olivia\u2019s footsteps, I grabbed some bandages and went to work on the man missing his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I feared, Olivia ended up overexerting herself; leading to her collapsing on the floor about 30 minutes after the survivors arrived.  It turned out that one of the survivors was a nurse from another hospital, so she stayed with Olivia while I continued working with the survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my best efforts, the man with the arm injury didn\u2019t survive; I guess he just lost too much blood.  Looking at the woman cradling his body, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I didn\u2019t even know him before today.\u201d Wiping tears from her eyes, she said, \u201cH-He saved me from one of those creatures, the ones with the 4 eyes.  That thing...it used to be my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to do at this moment, but my instincts told me to take the woman\u2019s hands.  \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t blame yourself for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-He died trying to save me.\u201d Looking at me, the woman said, \u201cYou know the worst part of this whole thing?  I wouldn\u2019t have been in this town had my girlfriend\u2019s car not gotten a flat tire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did my best to console the woman, but she was in too much shock.  After asking a young boy to stay with her, I walked down the hall to Olivia\u2019s room.  Seeing the nurse standing by her bedside, I said, \u201cIs she alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell for sure; her temperature is through the roof.\u201d Gesturing to Olivia\u2019s arm, she said, \u201cI can only assume she was attacked by one of those creatures out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe and her boyfriend encountered one of the pods by the dam last night.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cThe gas changed him into one of the <br>\r\n4-eyed creatures, and...it subsequently attacked her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithout knowing the treatments she was on, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctors were giving her antibiotics before they ran off.\u201d Walking to Olivia\u2019s bed, I said, \u201cThey weren\u2019t sure what kind of bacteria was in her system, but they thought antibiotics might do the trick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t find her medical file in the mess out there.\u201d Looking at me, the nurse said, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll do what I can to keep her alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margo, Margo Johnson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Margo.\" smiling, I said, \"My name's Eric and this is my daughter Olivia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you both; although I do wish it was under better circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both.\"</span></div></div>",

From my vantage point on the 4th floor, looking down the street, I saw burning vehicles and craters in the road.  I wondered what could\u2019ve caused the craters when I remembered hearing the occasional explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw bodies all over the road; mostly humans, but some were the creatures.  I found myself wondering what those people were thinking, in their last moments, as they were transformed against their will.  Pushing those thoughts from my head, I made my way back to the ICU; which we\u2019d managed to barricade using some shelves and gurneys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back inside the ward, I walked towards two of the other scouts; a teenage boy and a man slightly older than me.  \u201cDid you guys see anything out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw some of those four-legged things chewing on what I could assume was once a human body.\u201d Shuddering, the young boy said, \u201cOther than that, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw pillars of smoke all over town, and a few of those alien ships in the distance.\u201d Looking at me, the man said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to know what\u2019s going on here; is another country attacking us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI somehow doubt this is the work of another country.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cBased on what I saw in the pod last night, I think we\u2019re dealing with an alien species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAliens?\u201d scoffing, the man said, \u201cSurely you\u2019re joking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow else would you explain the strange creatures out there?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve never seen a four-eyed animal before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt just seems so impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could speak, we were interrupted by the return of the 4th scout.  As we went to let him through the barricade, I saw that he wasn\u2019t alone \u2013 he had the corpse of one of the bipedal creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the children into another room, we managed to drag the corpse into an empty nearby room.  Margo walked into the room, stopping in the doorway when she saw the creature lying on the bed.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found it searching through the Pediatrics wing; probably looking for survivors.\u201d Gesturing to the scratches on his arms, the man said, \u201cIt took some effort to kill it, but I managed to get it done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we please stop referring to this as it?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cNeed I remind you, this thing used to be a human being?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this any more than you do, Eric.\u201d Sighing, the older man said, \u201cBut that...thing on the table isn\u2019t human anymore.  We can\u2019t think of it that way anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine; just be careful about how you talk about them.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s a young woman out there, Grace, whose girlfriend was turned into one of the dog-things; just like my daughter\u2019s boyfriend last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone talked amongst themselves, I decided to get a closer look at the creature lying before me.  It looked to be around 6\u20195\u201d tall and covered in the same scales that I\u2019d seen on the dog-things.  The face was reminded me of the Gorn from Star Trek; the only noticeable difference that I saw being a row of spiked horns going up between the eyes from the nose.  The jaw looked like someone had squished together an alligator jaw; I saw several sharp teeth sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked further down the creature\u2019s body, I saw its hands had sharp claws instead of fingers; one could only assume the same could be said for the feet.  By that point, everyone had stopped talking and turned their attention to Margo.  Having returned with a tray of instruments, she said, \u201cIf we\u2019re to learn anything about these things, I\u2019ll have to perform an autopsy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Turning around again, I said, \u201cTry to remember that thing used to be human.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cWhatever it is now, it used to have a family and friends.  It used to be just like us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell you right now, it wasn\u2019t human when it died.\u201d Running a hand through her hair, Margo said, \u201cWhatever that gas is, it\u2019s able to completely rewrite an individual\u2019s DNA in a matter of seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlivia was bitten by one of those creatures; what if that bacteria in her system is trying to transform her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing to indicate that would happen.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cI compared a sample of Olivia\u2019s blood to that of the creature; aside from a high white blood cell count, Olivia\u2019s blood cells are still human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this gas is turning people into these creatures.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat can we do to stop it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure; I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any way to prevent the gas from affecting someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Margo and I were interrupted by a commotion outside in the hall.  Both of us walked outside to find a boy, no older than 17, holding one of the gas grenades I\u2019d seen earlier.  \u201cHey check this out, I found it out in the hallway.\u201d Tossing it up and down, the boy said, \u201cI think it might be a dud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering to myself how stupid a kid would have to be in order to play with something like that, I started walking towards him.  \u201cKid, you have to get rid of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, the grenade started making a noise.  Whatever the kid had done, he must\u2019ve accidently activated it.  I hated doing it, but I didn\u2019t want to risk the lives of everyone in the room.  So I made the painful choice of shoving the kid, and the grenade, into the makeshift autopsy room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed the door just as the gas was released; causing the kid to start banging on the door, begging to be let out.  Unfortunately, there was nothing I could do; as the changes had already started \u2013 first his face started changing and the horns started growing from his nasal ridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later the boy was gone; his screams transformed into a mixture of hisses and growls.  Everyone present bowed their heads in sorrow; mourning the loss of the young man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The creature inside the room had been pounding on the door for the last few minutes.  It didn\u2019t take a genius to know the door wasn\u2019t going to hold for long.  While everyone was still mourning the loss of the young man, I realized it wasn\u2019t safe for us to stay here any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up everyone; we need to leave now; before that door fails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t surprised when no one moved a muscle; many of them seemingly frozen in fear.  Margo was the only one who seemed to acknowledge what I was staying.  \u201cEric\u2019s right, we have to leave now or that thing will kill us all once it\u2019s free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we supposed to go?\u201d looking at me, a middle-aged woman said, \u201cThose things are everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we can go.\u201d Sighing, realizing that was a problem with my plan, I said, \u201cI just know we can\u2019t stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should we listen to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the man who\u2019d spoken, a man around my age holding two young children, I said, \u201cI\u2019m a Police officer sir, believe me when I say we need to go now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one moved an inch until the creature managed to shatter the small window in the door.  That was enough to get everyone moving.  While a few of the men worked to get the barricade down, Margo and I made our way to Olivia\u2019s room.  She must\u2019ve woken up from the commotion because she was lying in bed looking at us.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go, honey.\u201d Moving towards the bed, I said, \u201cOne of the young men accidentally activated a grenade; he was turned into one of the creatures and it\u2019ll break through the door very soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I went to make sure the coast was clear, Margo helped support Olivia as they left the room.  Rounding the corner, I saw everyone else had already left the area.  As we made our way past the autopsy room, the door burst open and the creature came out.  It quickly made its way towards Margo and Olivia; I tried to stop it but only ended up being slammed into a nearby wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the impact stunned me, and I was worried I may have broken something.  I could only watch as the creature continued advancing towards them.  Unable to do anything, I watched helplessly as the creature grabbed Margo and threw her into the nurses' station.  Worried that Margo was injured, I tried to find something to attack the creature with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Olivia, the creature advanced towards Margo\u2019s prone form.  Just as the creature was about to strike, I heard several gunshots; followed by the creature collapsing to the ground right in front of Margo.  Looking around for the source of the gunfire, I saw Olivia holding my gun; which I must\u2019ve lost when I was thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was satisfied the creature was dead, Olivia lowered the gun and ran over to me.  \u201cDaddy, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, honey.\u201d I was lying; I was actually in a fair amount of pain.  As I stood up, with Olivia\u2019s help, I said, \u201cGo check on Margo; I think she\u2019s hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia and I both turned to find Margo slowly getting to her feet.  Looking at her, shocked, I said, \u201cAre you sure?  That was a pretty strong throw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Groaning, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a couple of hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure I bought Margo's statement; it seemed a little strange that she was practically fine after sustaining that kind of injury.  I didn't have time to dwell on it; as several of the survivors came running into the room.  After seeing the state we were in, they helped us walk out of the room.  We met up with everyone else by the stairs.  As we slowly made our way downstairs, I could hear Margo say, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been properly introduced; my name is Margo Sullivan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around to see Olivia shaking Margo\u2019s outstretched hand.  \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, I\u2019m Olivia Sheppard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bottom floor, we exited into the lobby to find _____.</span></div></div>",

Some of them were from neighboring towns, but a few of them I recognized.  One of the unfamiliar cops pointed his gun at us; yelling, \u201cStop right there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the group, including myself, started to worry about what was going to happen next.  Did we just escape one of those creatures to be killed by a trigger happy officer?  Thankfully, before anything happened, a fellow officer stepped and lowered the gun.  \u201cLower that weapon, Corporal!  Can\u2019t you see these are just frightened civilians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly spotted one of my coworkers, Theo Gagnon, in the crowd.  Hobbling over to him, I said, \u201cTheo, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god you\u2019re alright, Eric; no one\u2019s heard from you since last night.\u201d Hugging me, Theo said, \u201cHow\u2019s Olivia, is she alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to my right, I found Olivia being helped onto a gurney.  Looking back at Theo, I said, \u201cOther than some unusual bacterial infection, she\u2019s doing fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d turning glum, Theo said, \u201cWe...We lost almost half the department; most of them were killed in the chaos, but a few of them were transformed into those creatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that explains the cops from other towns.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some buses running; we\u2019re taking everyone we can find and taking them to the prison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe prison?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWhy are we taking them there for god\u2019s sake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most secure place in the area.\u201d Sighing, Theo said, \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s not ideal; but it\u2019s our only option right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Theo and I finished talking, I made my way over to Olivia and Margo.  Holding Olivia\u2019s hand in her own, Margo looked at me and said, \u201cOlivia saved my life, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my baby girl; always willing to help others, even at her own expense.\u201d Looking at Margo, I said, \u201cAre you certain that you\u2019re alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assure you, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be sore for a while, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly we were interrupted by one of the other cops starting to talk.  \u201cOkay folks, we have some buses and one ambulance available to move everyone out of here.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t shove; there\u2019s room enough for everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and almost everyone was situated.  After checking on one of the buses, I made my way to the ambulance where I found Margo standing by the back door.  I watched as she climbed up on the bumper and said, \u201cThere\u2019s room for 4 more people in here; I repeat, there\u2019s room for 4 more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to chuckle a little bit; because despite saying there were 4 spots remaining, I saw Margo holding up 5 fingers.  I wanted to question it but realized it wasn\u2019t important.  Walking over to her, I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s already inside.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cI reserved a spot for you; I suggest you take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly agreed; having no intention of leaving Olivia by herself.  After helping a few more passengers into the ambulance, including the poor woman who\u2019d lost her girlfriend, I went to close everything up.  It was only then that I realize Margo wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen.  \u201cMargo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for a few moments, I spotted Margo walking out from behind a nearby dumpster; putting something into her pocket as she walked towards me.  \u201cSorry, I-I needed to check something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t run off like that; we could\u2019ve left without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, thank you for waiting for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Margo and I climbed into the ambulance.  The convoy of vehicles departed a moment later; heading out of town with about 3 dozen people in tow.</span></div></div>",

Almost 30 minutes had passed since we left the hospital, and we\u2019d only just reached the outskirts of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking in with the lead vehicle, I made my way to the back of the ambulance to check on everyone.  Seeing Margo checking on Olivia\u2019s vitals, I said, \u201cHow\u2019s my little girl doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems to be doing a little better.\u201d Taking the stethoscope out of her ears, Margo said, \u201cWith an infection like this, her chances of survival depend on when the treatment was started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know what kind of bacteria it was?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cHow could you possibly know the course of treatment for an infection like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo must\u2019ve realized I\u2019d caught her on something; because she quickly said, \u201cI, uh, I mean...with any kind of bacterial infection, it\u2019s always best to start treatment as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat along the wall, careful not to wake the sleeping child next to me, I turned to Margo and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been so helpful today; first with Olivia and then the autopsy.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI realize that I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to tell, really.\u201d Sitting down, Margo said, \u201cI was born in Seattle; after I got my nursing degree, I decided that <br>\r\nI wanted to work in a small-town hospital.  So I moved to Hartland about a month ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brought you here all the way from Hartland?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was on a blind date; one of my coworkers set me up with her sister.\u201d Seeing the surprised look on my face, Margo said, \u201cBig surprise, the cute nurse is a lesbian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be disrespectful.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThe date must not have gone very well; since you don\u2019t seem too worried about her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt started out well; I mean she was just as attractive as her sister made her out to be.\u201d With a chuckle, Margo said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened; it\u2019s just...we didn\u2019t click.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry the date didn\u2019t go well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find someone eventually.\u201d Smiling, Margo said, \u201cAfter all, the ocean is full of fish; right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean there\u2019s probably a girl out there for me, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s what you meant.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cThe phrase is actually \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my mistake.\u201d Pausing, Margo said, \u201cWith all that\u2019s happened, I guess I got a little confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, without warning, the ambulance came to a sudden stop.

I may not be her biological father, but I was in the delivery room when she was born.  I knew from the first moment I held her in my arms that I was going to do everything I could to keep her safe.  Turning to Margo, I said, \u201cYou have to do something, Margo; Olivia...she\u2019s all I have left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieving a large vial, full of a pale blue liquid, Margo said, \u201cI promise, Eric, that I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep her alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the seizing finally stopped, I watched Margo injected the blue liquid into Olivia\u2019s arm; causing the veins in her arm to temporally turn light blue.  I\u2019d never seen medication do anything like that, but so far Margo hadn\u2019t done anything to make me question my faith in her.  \u201cI have faith in you Margo; do what you have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping everyone into the ambulance, I went to get into the passenger seat.

I looked through the windshield just as an alien craft flew by.  I quickly realized it had fired something that destroyed the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it flew out of sight, I climbed out of the ambulance and made my way to the wreckage.  A quick glance at the wreckage told me there were no survivors; as best I could recall, I think there had been six children riding on this one bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see some people getting out of the other buses; many of them crying because of what just happened.  Walking over to them, I said, \u201cFolks, you have to get back in the buses right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy bother?\u201d A woman slightly older than me, appearing to be in shock, said, \u201cThose things clearly have technology that we don\u2019t; how can we possibly survive this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that you have misgivings; but if we stay here, we\u2019re most certainly going to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my best efforts, the woman had managed to rile up a few surrounding people.  Before I could do anything, they were all starting to panic.  Everyone suddenly went quiet when a series of loud noises surrounded us.  This caused everyone, including me, to become momentarily concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman and some of the people around her started moving away from the convoy.  \u201cW-We can\u2019t stay here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Theo and the other cops had arrived and tried their best to mediate the situation.  But they weren\u2019t having any of it; before anyone could stop them, a group of six people ran off into the woods in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile 3 cops stayed behind, armed with shotguns, I ran off after Theo as he and 2 other cops tried to stop the runners.  I caught up to the group in a clearing; with Theo and the others trying to calm everyone down.  I started towards them when I spotted, out of the corner of my eye, 5 of the bipedal aliens coming towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could anything to warn them, the creatures threw grenades into the crowd.  However, this time, instead of transforming everyone; they just knocked them out.  Desperate to save the group, I started shooting; injuring one of the creatures.  When it started chasing after me, I realized my mistake.  <i>Shit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started running back towards the road; looking back long enough to see the ship landing in the clearing, as the remaining creatures loaded the unconscious bodies into the ship.  Turning my attention back to running, I made my way back to the road to find the remaining cops pointing their guns in my direction.  I quickly realized they were aiming at the creature and not me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take much to bring the creature down.  As I collapsed to the ground, exhausted, I wondered what horrible fate would soon befall those who were captured.</span></div></div>",

After getting the survivors back onto the buses, we quickly left the area.  I sat in the back of the ambulance while Margo was bandaging up some wounds I\u2019d sustained while running from the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at me as she wrapped my arm, Margo said, \u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking about the people those things captured.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWhat use could those things possibly have for them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dwell on it, Eric.\u201d Grabbing some bandages for my head, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019d just focus on the living, and we can worry about the dead at another time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re dead, Margo.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe have to think positively; hopefully we can go rescue them.  That\u2019s what I hope would happen if I were them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention to a pack of antiseptic wipes, without looking at me, Margo said, \u201cIf I were one of them, I\u2019d want to die with dignity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at Margo for a moment; unsure of what to think about her.  She\u2019d been nothing but helpful taking care of Olivia, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she was hiding something.  \u201cAre you okay, Margo?  You seem a little...off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d looking at me, sighing, she said, \u201cI\u2019m just...today\u2019s been a hard day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019re all entitled to respond differently to situations like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d After placing the bandage on my forehead, Margo said, \u201cThat\u2019s it; you\u2019re all patched up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks; I promise to be more careful next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask.\u201d Glancing to Olivia, who\u2019d been unconscious since the seizures, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m already taking care of one <br>\r\nSheppard, I don\u2019t want to be taking care of another one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the ambulance stopped again.

Poking her head into the cab, Margo said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?  Are we under attack again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re at the prison.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re safe; at least for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe timing couldn\u2019t be better; I need to get Olivia and the rest of the injured to the infirmary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gates slowly started to open at that point; letting the vehicles enter the compound.  As we drove through, I saw at least 4 officers on each of the nearby guard towers; each armed with rifles.  I also 3 other buses parked in the far corner of the compound; realizing we must not have been the first group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything came to a stop, I climbed out of the ambulance and saw a familiar face approaching me \u2013 Chief Tom Hertle; my boss.  After hugging me, he said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you got here in one piece.\u201d Smiling, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve sent out four groups to search for survivors; only two of them have come back so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot everyone in our group made it, Chief.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cOne of those alien ships destroyed a bus carrying 6 children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Chief Hertle said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Theo?  I had him in charge of this group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter the bus was destroyed, several survivors panicked and ran into the woods.  Theo and 2 cops ran after them; only to be surrounded by the creatures.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cThe entire group was captured; I don\u2019t know for what purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Hertle\u2019s face turned sullen when I said that; Theo and he had been drinking buddies.  \u201cLet\u2019s get everyone settled; then we can figure out where our people were taken and get them back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Margo came over; with the injured behind her.  Without wasting time, she looked at Chief Hertle and said, \u201cI need you to take me to your infirmary; I have injured here that need treatment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Hertle ordered a nearby officer to bring Margo to the infirmary; I watched as a Prison Guard followed behind them.  \u201cWhat\u2019s with the escort, Chief?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of the prisons aren\u2019t being very cooperative.\u201d Sighing, Chief said, \u201cI hope they come to their senses soon; because I have a feeling we\u2019re all going to be here for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had wondered about that myself; whether the civilians would be able to live peacefully with the prisoners.  I didn\u2019t want to focus on that now; so after saying goodbye to Chief Hertle, I ran to catch up with Margo and the injured.</span></div></div>",

Walking through, I was bombarded with screams from the inmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I eventually got to the infirmary, which was rudimentary at best, I that Margo had things pretty much under control.  There didn\u2019t seem to be any doctors around but I did see a few orderlies mingling amongst the injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the room, I entered the ICU to find Margo standing by Olivia\u2019s bedside.  I watched as she injected another vial of the strange blue liquid into Olivia\u2019s arm; this time causing her skin to take on a slight blue tint.  Before I could ask what the liquid was, I felt something run into my leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, I saw a young boy no older than 6 years old.  \u201cHey mister, have you seen my grandparents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sad look appeared on the boy\u2019s face; he must\u2019ve been separated from his grandparents.  My answer clearly wasn\u2019t the one he wanted. \u201cOh, o-okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything else, Margo walked over with a toy truck in her hands.  Handing it to the boy, she said, \u201cDavid, sweetie, why don\u2019t you go play in the corner for a little while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, David walked over to the far corner and started playing with the toy truck.  Turning my attention to Margo, I said, \u201cAre you doubling as a babysitter now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sure feels like that.\u201d Leading me into another room, Margo said, \u201cHe was with the first group that arrived; he got separated from his grandparents in the initial chaos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt terrible when Margo said that; in all likelihood, David\u2019s grandparents were probably dead.  The situation brought back memories from when I had to tell Olivia that her mom had been killed in a car accident.  \u201cYou realize he'll have to find out eventually, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know; just not right now.\u201d Peeking around the corner, looking at David, Margo said, \u201cHe\u2019s just a little kid; he\u2019s not ready yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere any of us ready for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fair point.\u201d Checking a clock on the wall, Margo said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty late; how about you go get some rest.  I\u2019ll tell you if Olivia\u2019s condition changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same, I\u2019d like to stay close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI completely understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Margo turned to walk away, I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her back.  Before she could say anything, I embraced her.  <br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting over her initial shock, Margo reciprocated the hug and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat next to Olivia's bed, I watched as Margo went over to David.  I couldn't hear what she said, but the two of them walked out of the room.</span></div></div>",

As the night progressed, I started to notice some strange changes happening to Olivia; her skin was getting progressively bluer, while I noticed something was happening to her hands and feet as well \u2013 it was almost as if some of her fingers and toes were dissolving.  I started to question whether my faith in Margo had been misplaced; what if she was harming Olivia instead of helping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must\u2019ve been just after midnight when I started to doze off; only to be awakened when I heard Olivia start to stir.  Looking at her, I watched as she slowly opened her eyes and turned to me.  \u201cDaddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlivia!\u201d getting up, I immediately took her hand in mine.  \u201cSweetie, how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m scared, Daddy.\u201d Looking at me, fear in her eyes, she said, \u201cAm I going to die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, sweetie.\u201d Looking at her, trying to keep stay positive, I said, \u201cMargo says you\u2019re doing just fine; you\u2019ll be back on your feet in a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Daddy.\u201d Tearing up, Olivia said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was such a lousy daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you talk like that, Olivia.\u201d Squeezing her hand, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re the best daughter in the world; I\u2019m lucky to be your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I see Mom, I\u2019ll...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Olivia suddenly slipped into unconsciousness, I feared the worst.  \u201cN-No no, Olivia!\u201d after several attempts to wake her failed, I started panicking, \u201cMARGO!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo must\u2019ve been nearby because she was at Olivia\u2019s side within seconds.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-She was talking and suddenly lost consciousness.\u201d Worried, I said, \u201cIs she...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking Olivia\u2019s vitals, Margo said, \u201cShe\u2019s not dead, but she will be soon if we don\u2019t hurry.\u201d Retrieving another vial, Margo said, \u201cAnother dose of this should stabilize her for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Margo could inject Olivia, I grabbed her hand and said, \u201cI need you to tell me what the stuff is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric, we don\u2019t have time to discuss this.\u201d Trying to inject Olivia, Margo said, \u201cI have to inject Olivia now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you inject her until you tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Shoving Margo into the wall, I gestured to the changes to Olivia\u2019s body.  <br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that stuff turning her skin blue?  Why does it look like her fingers and toes are changing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI put my faith in you to save my little girl; so help me if you\u2019re...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t able to finish my sentence; because I was suddenly overwhelmed by the sound of something akin to a jet engine.  As the sound got closer, the room lit up as lights poured through the windows.  Forgetting about Margo for a moment, I made my way to the exercise yard just as a strange ship was landing there.  Fearing that it was the creatures, I quickly raised my weapon; as did all the officers present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the craft landed, and the searchlights had been pointed at it, I got my first glimpse of it.  I could tell that it wasn\u2019t one of the creature\u2019s ships, but it was still alien.  It almost resembled a manta ray in overall shape; with a raised section in the middle.  I watched as a door in the back opened, and several figures came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way to the back, I saw the newcomers for the first time; and they were most certainly not the creatures who attacked us.  These beings were shorter, almost about the height of the average human, and they had dark blue skin.  Before anyone could stop them, one of the aliens stepped forward and said, \u201cLower your weapons; we mean you no harm.\u201d</span></div></div>",

With the guards pointing their weapons at the aliens, Chief Hertle stepped forward until he was standing only a few feet from the alien craft.  \u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me; but how do we know you\u2019re not the aliens who attacked us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as one of the other aliens stepped forward, as if to say something; only to be stopped by the tallest one.  Turning back to Chief Hertle, he said, \u201cI believe you\u2019ll have to, what is the saying, take a leap of faith.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Hertle did nothing for a moment; clearly thinking over his options.  After a moment, he signaled for the guards to lower their weapons.  \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret this, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quickly becoming aware of a crowd forming in the yard; as word of the ship must\u2019ve been spreading.  I could hear some people murmuring; wondering if these aliens were the enemy.  Walking towards Chief Hertle, I said, \u201cChief; I think we should take this inside.  We\u2019re starting to get a crowd here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief?\u201d turning to Hertle, the alien said, \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m mistaken, but I thought your species moved past tribalism centuries ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started wondering how the aliens knew so much about us.  If Chief Hertle shared my concerns, he didn\u2019t show it.  With a smile, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s my rank; I\u2019m Chief of Police.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand now.\u201d Looking out at the crowd, the alien said, \u201cI am in agreement with your subordinate; it would be wise to move inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile several guards stayed behind to disperse the crowd and watch the ship, the rest of them followed us into the prison.  As we made our way to the Warden\u2019s office, avoiding the occupied areas, I took the opportunity to get a good look at the aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them varied in appearance and were approximately 5\u20198 to around 6\u20193\u201d in height. I was surprised to see that they only had fingers on each hand. I noticed their skulls were elongated; with two of them having blunt edges and the third having more rounded edges.  I also noticed a distinct lack of hair on their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer at their skulls, I wondered why their shapes were different.  That was until I noticed the shortest of the three had breasts \u2013 I quickly realized it must\u2019ve been a gender difference in their species.  Moving past that, I got a good look at their clothes as well \u2013 pretty similar to jogging suits in appearance; they appeared to be form-fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we arrived at the Warden\u2019s office; Chief Hertle and I went inside with the aliens while the guards waited outside.  We all stood around the desk in the middle of the room.  Once the door was closed, the lead alien said, \u201cI suppose now would be a good time for introductions.  My name is Borza Trogrik, Senior Overseer.\u201d Gesturing to his associates, he said, \u201cThese are my associates; my apprentice, Phiemu Crican and my pilot Dhelo Ros\u2019ath.  We are Maltorians.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Chief Hertle introduced me, he said, \u201cWhat brings you to Earth, Mr. Trogrik?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease call me Borza.\u201d Pausing, Borza said, \u201cWe received word that your world had been invaded by the Creelaxians.  We are here to help defeat them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can you tell us about these Creelaxians?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly that they\u2019re a menace to all life in the galaxy.\u201d The female alien, Dhelo, stepped forward and said, \u201cThey invaded our world 15 years ago; leaving only the 1500 survivors aboard our ship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel sympathy for these people; with only 1500 of their kind left.  \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry to hear that.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWith your help, hopefully, we can prevent that from happening here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Dhelo, Borza said, \u201cReturn to the shuttle and inform the command council of our progress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, and giving what I could only imagine was a military salute, Dhelo said, \u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dhelo left the room, Borza turned to the Chief and me.  \u201cI apologize for my pilot; she lost two of her siblings in the attack <br>\r\non Maltor Prime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for; I\u2019m sure we\u2019d react in much the same way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we could start talking again, we were interrupted by a commotion outside.  For the sound of it, the guards were arguing with someone.  \u201cMa\u2019am, you can\u2019t go in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can imagine my surprise when I heard Margo\u2019s voice respond, \u201cThe hell I can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later the door burst open and Margo entered the room; I swear I saw a look of relief on her face when she saw the two aliens in the room.  As the guards came in to remove her, Chief Hertle said, \u201cMa\u2019am, what is the meaning of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Eric\u2019s daughter; her infection is getting worse.\u201d Turning to me, Margo said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know how much longer we can keep her alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me, but is the nature of your child\u2019s injury?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer boyfriend was changed by the gas; it turned him into a four-legged creature.\u201d Turning to Borza, I said, \u201cIt bit my daughter and now she\u2019s fighting an infection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am familiar with the creatures you speak of.\u201d Looking at me, Borza said, \u201cTake me to your child, I might be able to help save her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Chief Hertel\u2019s permission, I led Borza and the others out of the room.  As we rushed to the infirmary, I looked back to find Margo speaking with Phiemu.  I couldn\u2019t tell what they were saying, but Phiemu nodded in agreement to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we reached the infirmary, which was thankfully empty, I made my way over to Olivia\u2019s bedside.  Her skin was bluer than it had been earlier, and I noticed a finger on her left hand was almost completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could inquire about what was happening, Margo came forward and said, \u201cShe was doing fine until just a few minutes ago; then her temperature spiked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Borza, on the verge of freaking out, I said, \u201cPlease do whatever you can to save her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s only one option left to us at this point.\u201d Looking at me, Borza said, \u201cBut I must warn you; doing so will come at great cost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What could be costlier than doing nothing?</i>  \u201cI don\u2019t care what it costs; just save my daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can sympathize with wanting to do anything to save one\u2019s offspring.\u201d Focusing on me, Borza said, \u201cIf we do this, there will be no going back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was starting to get worried; what would saving Olivia's life cost me. \u201cWhat exactly are you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn order to save your daughter, we\u2019ll have to turn her into a Maltorian.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Or, rather, we must complete the transformation that was begun by our observer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything started to fall into place once Borza said that.  Margo\u2019s confusion over common idioms; the way she held up five fingers when saying the number four to how much she knew about our invaders \u2013 the Creel-whatever.  Even the injections made sense now; especially how they were turning my daughter blue and causing a finger on each hand to wither.  Feeling betrayed, I turned to Margo and said, \u201cYou\u2019re one of them, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you have questions, Eric; once Olivia is safe, I promise that I\u2019ll answer all of them.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cBut right now your daughter is dying, and the only way to save her life is to completely rewrite her genetic code.  She will no longer be human, but she'll be alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not an easy decision to make, Eric Sheppard.\u201d Standing on the other side of Olivia\u2019s bed, Borza said, \u201cBut we must have an answer now; before it\u2019s too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at Olivia as she lay unconscious on the bed.  Could I really save her by taking away her humanity?  As I stood there, my thoughts turned to her mother and how quickly her cancer spread.  Had these Mal-things offered to save her life in the same way, would I have gone through with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized that was a stupid question; thus arriving at my answer.  Turning to Borza, I said, \u201cAlright, do it.  What happens now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe must bring her to our vessel to finish the procedure.\u201d Looking at me, Piemu said, \u201cYou are welcome to come with us if you\u2019d like.\u201d</span></div></div>",

On the way there, Borza called ahead to have Dhelo prep the ship.  Chief Hertel must\u2019ve come back to the yard after we left; because I saw him standing in the yard overlooking the ship.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time to explain, Chief.\u201d As we ran past, I said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to save Olivia\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of us went aboard the ship, Chief Hertel and the other officers started clearing the area.

From the looks they were giving each other, I figured they knew each other.  I didn\u2019t realize how well until Margo walked over and gave Dhelo a passionate kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they kissed for a moment, Margo looked at Dhelo and said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could say the same thing about you, Sorain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorain?

Is that your human name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Dhelo for a moment, Margo turned to me and said, \u201cI guess you could say Dhelo is my ex-girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo wait a minute; what you said about that blind date was real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew instantly, from the look on Dhelo\u2019s face, that she hadn\u2019t expected to hear that.  Looking at Margo, I said, \u201cHave you gone native, Sorain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging an annoyed look with me, Margo turned to Dhelo and said, \u201cI was sent here to understand these people, Dhelo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing, Dhelo said, \u201cI understand my ship pretty well; and I never thought about sleeping with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it became clear that Dhelo and Margo had some unfinished business, I was relieved when Borza stepped forward.  \u201cDhelo, need I remind you we\u2019re running short on time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry sir.\u201d Exchanging a look with Margo, Dhelo said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be airborne momentarily.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You and Olivia are one of the few humans that I genuinely cared for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t know us as well as you think.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIf you really cared about us, you wouldn\u2019t have lied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any idea what saving Olivia\u2019s life almost cost me?\u201d getting upset, Margo said, \u201cThose vials I was injecting her with?  <br>\r\nThey contained a serum that would\u2019ve returned me to my original form.  Had the Mothership not arrived when it did, I could\u2019ve easily been stuck as a human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo wait, you\u2019re actually human right now?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not just an elaborate disguise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the preparations for an observer assignment.\u201d Taking a breath, Margo said, \u201cThe members of my team, myself included, were transformed into humans prior to our assignment here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many people were on your team?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were eight of us in total; I haven\u2019t been able to contact any of them since the Creel arrived.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m the only survivor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shuttle shook again as we reached higher into the atmosphere.  Dhelo\u2019s voice came over the intercom, \u201cWe\u2019re 5 minutes from space; we\u2019ll be at the Mothership in 15 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like to know.\u201d Turning back to Margo, I said, \u201cIf those vials were meant for you, why did you use them on Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she saved me from that Uakari at the hospital \u2013 what used to be that foolish teenage boy.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cShe risked her life to save someone she barely knew; I knew I had to do the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you keep me in the dark about what you were doing?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think I deserved to know you were changing my daughter\u2019s species?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to take the chance that you\u2019d make me stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I ask you to stop doing something that was saving her life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Margo could respond, Dhelo called over the intercom.  \u201cWe\u2019re approaching the Mothership.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Margo was the first to enter the cockpit.  I guess I couldn\u2019t blame her; she hadn\u2019t seen her home in who knows how long.  Coming up behind her, I  got my first glimpse at the Maltorian\u2019s spaceship; in low orbit around the moon.  I was immediately reminded of the line from Contact, \u201cThey should have sent a poet.\u201d  There were no words to describe the sight before me.  The ship had to be at least 25 miles across and shaped almost like a manta-ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes your entire species live on that ship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct; all 1500 of us.\u201d Standing next to me, Margo said, \u201cI must say, it\u2019s good to be home again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood at the back of the cockpit as Borza piloted the shuttle towards the raised section in the middle of the hull.  As we got closer, I saw a hanger door open.  Within seconds the shuttle had flown inside and the doors closed again.</span></div></div>",

The corridors were circular in shape and were light blue in color.  As Margo and I followed Borza to their infirmary, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the looks I was getting from the Maltorians as I passed by.  I had to remind myself that I\u2019d reacted the same way when their shuttle landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we arrived at the infirmary some people dressed in what looked like scrubs came out and brought Olivia inside.  Turning to me, Borza said, \u201cYour daughter is in good hands, Eric Sheppard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Borza.\u201d Breathing a sigh of relief, I said, \u201cCan I go in with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Turning to Margo, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a medical unit waiting for you next door to implement the reversion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Overseer.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you once I\u2019m finished, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Borza walked off, I looked at Margo and said, \u201cIs this \u2018reversion\u2019 going to make you Maltorian again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Smiling, running a hand through her brunette hair, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to having this hair, but it\u2019ll be nice to see my true self in the mirror again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Margo turned to walk down the corridor, I pulled her into a hug.  Once we\u2019d hugged for a moment, I looked at her and said, <br>\r\n\u201cThank you Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo and I then parted ways; as I walked through the doorway into the infirmary.  I was in awe of what I saw inside; everything was so futuristic, almost like something out of Star Trek.  I spotted several Maltorians standing around a bed in the far corner; I walked over and found Olivia lying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a series of needles sticking into different parts of her body; her skin slowly changing from white to an azure color with a mix of green.  The more drastic physical changes had already started by the time I entered the room.  Olivia\u2019s hands and feet no longer resembled those of a human; she now had the same four toes and four fingers as every other Maltorian I\u2019d seen.<br>\r\nHer skin color had finished changing within 5 minutes; followed by her slowly losing her hair.  Next came the changes to her face; as her skull began to stretch out and take the shape of a Maltorian female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole process took only 20 minutes; when it was over, there was nothing human left of Olivia.  She was Maltorian now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a chair up to her bed, I took her hand in mine and said, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me for this, Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Maltorian female came over to Olivia\u2019s bed.  \u201cYour daughter will be asleep for at least eight of your hours, Eric Sheppard.\u201d <br>\r\nLooking at me, she said, \u201cOverseer Borza has provided you with temporary quarters if you\u2019d like to get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thank you.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI-Is there a place where I can sit down and think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course; follow me to the promenade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving Olivia a kiss on her forehead, I followed the Maltorian out into the corridor and down to what I could only assume was an elevator.  We entered and the Maltorian pressed a button with alien text on it - \u233f\u2340\u235c\u22d4\u27d2\u22cf\u23c3\u2385\u27d2.  Suddenly the elevator started moving; first vertically then horizontally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the lift stop and the door opened up onto a large open area at the front of the ship.  Stepping out of the lift, I found myself staring at a room filled with alien trees and plants; as well as several moderately sized ponds.  There were several large windows in the front; each with a view of the Moon and Earth.  Spotting a bench in the distance, I turned to the Maltorian and said, \u201cThank you for your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lift door closed again; I started walking towards the bench; stopping to admire the plant life on the way.  I was grateful to see that I was the only person in the area; which was good since I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be gawked at right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lost track of how long I\u2019d been sitting on the bench; looking out the window at the Lunar surface.  I knew I\u2019d made the right decision to save Olivia; I just found myself worrying that she wouldn\u2019t see it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pulled from my thoughts by the sound of approaching footsteps.  Great, just what I need.  Without turning to face the unwelcome guest, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to be alone right now; I\u2019d appreciate if you left me alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell okay then; I\u2019ll leave if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped to my feet when I heard that voice.  Turning around, I found a female Maltorian smiling at me.  Getting a look at her, I realized where I\u2019d seen that smile before.  \u201cMargo?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her outfit consisted of something akin to a short sleeve shirt, a vest, and some knee-length pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that phrase human\u2019s use - in the flesh?\u201d with a chuckle, gesturing to her body, Margo said, \u201cThis is what I looked like before I arrived on your world.  Not bad, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but think Margo looked appealing in her rightful form.  Trying to shake some images from my mind, I said, \u201cSo now that you\u2019re back, are you going to get back together with Dhelo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure; we had a nasty fight before I left for Earth.\u201d Placing her hands on her waist, with a sigh, Margo said, \u201cBut I can tell you that I\u2019m done with being undercover for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw the way she looked at you in the shuttle; she may have acting upset, but there\u2019s still something there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cMay I connect you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you meant to if you could join me.\u201d Gesturing to the bench, I said, \u201cHave a seat, I could use the company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we both sat down, Margo said, \u201cYour species\u2019 verbal expressions are very confusing.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure I would be treading on hot water by the time my mission had been completed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took that to mean she was worried about being found out but didn\u2019t want to press her on it.  Sitting back on the bench, I said, \u201cIt still bugs me that you lied to me, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a police officer, Eric.\u201d Turning to me, Margo said, \u201cSurely you\u2019ve had to conceal information about yourself as part of your job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did participate in one undercover assignment when I was younger.  \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink of it this way; if the Creel had never discovered your world, would you expect me to reveal myself?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t going to lie, she had me there.  \u201cI guess you have a point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was on Earth for almost a year; during which time I observed your society quite closely.\u201d Taking a breath, Margo said, \u201cYour species\u2019 visions of contact with alien intelligence have a disturbing tendency to involve global conquest.  You see yourselves killing anyone who doesn\u2019t look like you; and yet you wonder why I don\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way; from Margo\u2019s perspective she was taking her life in her hands every day.  Here I was complaining that she didn\u2019t trust a man she hardly knew.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Eric; I forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us sat on the bench, watching the moon, for a while longer.  Eventually I stood up and said, \u201cI should probably turn in; I\u2019ve been running on fumes for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes; Borza told me he arranged for quarters for you.\u201d Standing up, Margo said, \u201cMy quarters on the way, I\u2019ll walk with you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Margo led me down a long corridor before stopping outside of a closed door.  Spotting something next to the door, I looked closer and saw the same alien writing from the elevator - \u2307\u235c\u2340\u23c3\u27df\u22cf \u260d\u27d2\u260d\u2390\u23c3\u27df.  Turning to Margo, I said, \u201cIs that your language or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Reaching towards a keypad, Margo said, \u201cIt\u2019s to identify these quarters as mine; it says Sorain Kekvai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Margo put in a 6 digit code, the door opened.  I followed Margo inside and found myself inside a modest-sized cabin.  There were some personal effects strewn around, but I mainly saw some furniture arranged around a small window looking out into space.  I also saw a small, bunk-style bed built into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted two more doors, one of which was closed, that likely led to other rooms.  Turning to Margo, who was standing just inside the door, I said, \u201cThis reminds me of the apartment I had in college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe units they give to the families are twice as big, but this suits my needs.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cI apologize for the clutter, I haven\u2019t been in here for almost a year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a few discarded pieces of clothing, I didn\u2019t see anything that amounted to clutter.  In fact, the place was immaculate when compared to Olivia\u2019s bedroom.  Looking at Margo, I said, \u201cThis is fine; you should see how messy Olivia\u2019s bedroom would get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt as if I had a lump in my throat at the mention of Olivia.  Walking over to the window, I stared out at the Earth in the distance.  It looked so tiny and insignificant from here.  Coming up behind me, Margo said, \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about Olivia, you should know that you made the right decision?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I though?\u201d turning to Margo, I said, \u201cI made a life-altering decision without discussing it with her; now she\u2019s going to wake up to find she\u2019s not even human anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe may be angry with you at first, but eventually she\u2019ll realize you did it to save her life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you feel if you woke up as a different...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped talking when I realized the absurdity of what I was about to say.  Looking at me, a smirk on her face, Margo said, \u201cHave you forgotten that I spent the last 11 months living as a human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I-I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d Sitting down on the couch, I said, \u201cI could use a drink, do you have anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a bottle of guciragus in the stasis unit, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good time for that.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cThis soon after the reversion, my digestive system isn\u2019t ready for Maltorian beverages yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for Maltorian beverages either.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhat else do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can synthesize a bottle of scotch if you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to ask what she meant by synthesizing, but I figured that could wait until later.  \u201cScotch sounds great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Margo went into the other room, I got up and looked around some more.  I spotted what appeared to be some old, yet cared for, items on a shelf near the bed.  Going closer, I saw what looked like a picture frame; with a young Maltorian standing in front of two adults.  I quickly realized the young Maltorian was Margo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo must\u2019ve walked back into the room while I wasn\u2019t looking; because she suddenly appeared next to me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only picture I have left of my parents; they were killed in the Creel invasion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Margo, I saw a pained look in her eyes.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry; it\u2019s not easy losing your parents, especially at a young age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s my fault they\u2019re dead.\"</span></div></div>",

Pouring some scotch into a glass, she drank it in one gulp before pouring another for her and one for me.  Taking the glass, I said, \u201cDo you want to explain how it was your fault?\u201d glancing at the photo, I said, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been older than 7 years old in that photo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Creelaxians attacked just days after my 7th birthday.\u201d Taking another sip of the whiskey, Margo said, \u201cEveryone was running for their lives; desperately trying to find a ship to get off-world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents and I were running through our housing complex; when we came across my best friend Tar'ad and her family.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cThe six of us ran through the streets towards the spaceport; only to be cut off when the bridge was destroyed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit it was interesting learning about an attack on another planet, but I made sure now to show it.  \u201cWe hid in a nearby shop; as the Creel captured or transformed anyone they could find.\u201d  Taking a breath, Margo said, \u201cSuddenly there was an explosion outside; I screamed and that brought the Uakari \u2013 the tall creatures from the hospital.  They captured all of us and brought us to a nearby building.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sympathy for Margo, I reached out to hold her hand as she continued.  \u201cThey were transforming people into Gemsbok \u2013 a creature used for breeding the next generation of Creelaxians.\u201d Fighting tears, Margo said, \u201cI-I watched as they transformed Tar\u2019ad into a Creelaxian child; I tried calling out to her as she was led past, but she just ignored me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMargo, if you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I-I want to do this; I-I haven\u2019t let myself think about this for a long time.\u201d Taking another sip, Margo said, \u201cAfter that, I watched as everyone else was transformed into Gemsbok.  As they were hooking her up to a machine, my mom tried her best to reassure me; only to scream in pain as she was forcibly changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember much after that; only that eventually some Maltorian soldiers raided the building and rescued myself along with the remaining prisoners.\u201d Putting the glass on the table, Margo started crying, as she said, \u201cI-If I hadn\u2019t screamed in fright; my parents and my best friend would be here today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMargo, that wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cYou were a frightened child; I would have screamed as well if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo leaned over and buried herself in my arms; crying as she did so.  I wrapped my arms around her, unsure of what else I could do in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she\u2019d had a good cry, Margo went to clean up.  Walking out of the bathroom, she looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that; it\u2019s just...seeing what happened on my world happening here; it\u2019s like opening old wounds again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize, Margo.\u201d As she sat back down on the couch, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, what happened after you were rescued?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe survivors were brought to the spaceport; where we boarded shuttles which brought us here.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cI was technically an orphan at that point, so I was taken in by another family.  I lived with them until I was 17; at which point I joined the Observer Corp as an Initiate.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Opening my eyes, I quickly realized that I was in Margo\u2019s bed; but couldn\u2019t find Margo.  That changes when I looked down to find her asleep next to me; her head resting on my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear God, I hope this isn\u2019t what it looks like.</i> Taking a peek under the covers, my fears were confirmed when I saw that we were both naked.  Suddenly the events of last night flashed before my eyes; Margo and I were drinking when she suddenly leaned over and kissed me.  I reciprocated the kiss and we soon moved things to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, I started shaking Margo to wake up.  \u201cMargo, wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of nothing, Margo started to stir.  \u201cW-What\u2019s going on?\u201d sitting up, she realized where she was.  \u201cEric, why are we in bed together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I remember is us kissing and moving to the bed; after that, everything\u2019s a blur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no memory of that at all.\u201d putting a hand on her forehead, Margo said, \u201cGod, my head is killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I found where my pants had ended up and put them on.  Turning to Margo, who had covered herself with the sheet, I said, \u201cWhat are we going to do about this, Margo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we can do.\u201d Climbing out of bed, the sheet wrapped around her, Margo said, \u201cThe chances of me getting pregnant after a reversion are almost zero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t even thought of that; what if, by some small chance, I ended up getting Margo pregnant.  What would a Maltorian-Human child look like?  \u201cI need to get cleaned up; I have to be there when Olivia wakes up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the closed door, Margo said, \u201cFollow me, I\u2019ll show you how to use the cleaning unit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cleaning unit, despite all the weird alien stuff, was nothing more than a glorified shower.  There was a touch panel on the wall to activate it.  Once I was finished, I walked out to the main room as Margo came out of the kitchen area.  \u201cThe cleaning unit is free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Putting on her pants, Margo said, \u201cMaltorians only wash themselves every other day; otherwise our skin dries out.\u201d\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to know something.\u201d Looking at Margo, I said, \u201cDoes what we did...change anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean does it change our...relationship?\u201d trying my best not to sound like a high schooler after his first kiss, I said, \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t care about you; especially after everything you did for Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI care about you too, Eric.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry; Maltorians sometimes have sex as a way to blow off steam.  What we did last night doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best not to be insulted by the notion that Margo had used me for stress relief.  \u201cI suppose I should go check up on Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that.\u201d Putting on her shoes, Margo said, \u201cThe infirmary called while you were in the other room; Olivia\u2019s awake and asking to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did they know I was...never mind.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m going to say to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better figure it out quickly.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cI could hear her in the background, and she didn\u2019t sound very happy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As I stood outside, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat would you <br>\r\nwant someone to say to you if you were in this position?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re her father, so probably something about how you\u2019ll still love her regardless of her species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that will work.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cDo you want to come in with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, but I have to meet with Overseer Borza.\u201d Pausing, Margo said, \u201cIt seems that I\u2019m the only one of my team who\u2019s <br>\r\nmade contact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, wish me luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I walked into the infirmary, I saw that there was no one else in the room except for Olivia.  They must\u2019ve gotten tired of her yelling at them.  As I walked closer, I realized that didn't have a ton of experience with Maltorians.  But I did have experience with Olivia; and from the look that she was giving me, she was probably wishing I was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting up in bed, staring daggers at me.  \u201cGood morning, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018good morning honey\u2019 me!\u201d gesturing to her blue appearance, Olivia said, \u201cI\u2019m a monster!  All these other monsters keep telling me that this was all your idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a monster, Olivia.\u201d Stepping a little closer, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re a Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what it\u2019s called, Daddy; I don\u2019t want to be one!\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cTell them to make me human again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that, sweetie; I did this to save your life.\u201d Reaching out to touch her, I said, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for this procedure, you would have died from that infection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her arm away from me, she said, \u201cYou took the word of the creatures that came to invade us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Maltorians didn\u2019t invade; they\u2019re here to stop the ones that did.\u201d Taking her hand in mine, I said, \u201cIf there was any other option to keep you both alive, and human, I would\u2019ve taken it.  I didn\u2019t want to lose you, Liv; it would\u2019ve been so much worse than losing your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to break through the intense anger that Olivia was feeling.  Reaching forward, she wrapped arms around me and started crying into my shoulder.  \u201cI\u2019m scared, Daddy; I don\u2019t even know what I am anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re my daughter, and I love you.\u201d Holding her close, I said, \u201cNo matter what, that will never change.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After thanking the boy for his help, I walked into the bay to find several more ships were present that hadn\u2019t been there the night before.  I also noticed a fair number of containers stacked on the hanger floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what all this is for.  Walking towards the shuttle, I saw Margo step out with Dhelo close behind.  As I got closer, I noticed Dhelo giving me a strange look \u2013 as if she was upset with me about something.  Once she walked off, I went over to Margo as she was surveying some of the containers.  \u201cWhat was with Dhelo\u2019s look just now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not very pleased that I slept with a human last night.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cShe thinks its just further proof that I\u2019ve gone native.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you tell Dhelo, of all people, that we slept together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaltorians aren\u2019t as close-minded as humans when it comes to sex.\u201d  Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cWe\u2019re not ashamed to tell others about our sexual encounters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you would\u2019ve talked with me first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe next time we sleep together, I promise to talk with you before I tell anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, that\u2019s all...wait, there\u2019s going to be a next time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t remember a whole lot, but I can tell you that I remember enjoying the experience.\u201d With a smile, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019d very much like to do it again sometime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to contain my excitement over the fact that Margo was considering sleeping with me again.  Taking a breath, I said, \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why you had to tell Dhelo.  I mean, she\u2019s your ex after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEx or not, she\u2019s still one of my closest friends.\u201d Pausing, Margo said, \u201cWe may have been a terrible couple, but we still care about each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew enough about people to realize Margo wasn\u2019t being entirely truthful with me.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDhelo informed me that she\u2019s bonded with another woman named Levan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBonded?  What\u2019s that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo put it in terms you\u2019d understand; she\u2019s engaged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I placed a hand on Margo\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it now.\u201d Sighing, Margo bent down to examine a container and said, \u201cIt certainly makes my decision to leave the Observer Corp that much easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving the Observer Corp?  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiven my experiences with your species, I figured my talents would be best used on Earth.\u201d Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cIf the Chief will allow it, I\u2019m hoping to be the Camp\u2019s doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the containers, some of which were being loaded onto the ships, I said, \u201cDo these containers have medical supplies in them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of them do, but not all.  Some of them have weapons and technology to fight the Creel.\u201d Gesturing to a large container, easily taller than myself, Margo said, \u201cThat one contains a fusion generator; so we can provide clean power to the Camp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 20 minutes for everything to loaded onto the four ships.  As Margo and I took our seats in the cockpit of one of the shuttles, behind the pilot, I looked to her and said, \u201cAssuming, of course, that Chief Hertel accepts your offer; how do you think people will feel about you being their doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be a period of adjustment, but I\u2019m sure everything will be fine.\u201d  Looking at me, Margo said, \u201cI know I\u2019ll have at least one friend down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make plenty of friends down there, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ships took off, Margo turned to me and said, \u201cI almost forgot; how did it go with Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was pretty angry with me, but I think she\u2019s getting past it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cSome guy named Vakzan wouldn\u2019t let me take her home; saying she has to learn what it means to be Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ships cleared the bay, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be home in a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cBefore I forget; one of the Maltorians who took Olivia said something about being a good role model.  What do you think he meant by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of experience, I knew when someone was trying to hide something. I could easily tell Margo was trying to hide something, but couldn't figure out what it was. Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt just means they\u2019ll do their best to ensure Olivia learns about Maltorian society.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was almost dusk when I walked back into the prison; having spent most of the afternoon chatting with some of the Maltorians.  I was becoming aware of some hostility towards the Maltorians; apparently the human predilection towards racism also applied to alien species.  There weren\u2019t any physical confrontations but some came close.  I started to worry about Olivia and how people might treat her when she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to get hungry as I walked inside; which gave me an idea to go check on Margo.  I walked through the halls, occasionally stepping aside to let some inmates pass, on my way to the infirmary.  Going inside I saw a woman in her early 20s applying a bandage to an inmate\u2019s arm.  Walking up to the nurse, I said, \u201cCould you tell me where Margo is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you looking for that blue freak?\u201d looking at me, the inmate said, \u201cHow do we know they\u2019re here to help us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond, the nurse turned to me and said, \u201cI think she set up shop in the Administrative Wing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Turning to the inmate, I said, \u201cBetter watch your tone, buddy; or you\u2019ll end up outside the prison walls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the infirmary, I took the stairs up to the Administrative Wing.  It took a moment to find her, but I soon found her in an office at the end of the hall.  I walked inside to find her covering David with a blanket as he slept on a cot.  Leaning against the wall, I said, \u201cI\u2019m guessing you two patched things up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe came by the infirmary a few hours ago; gave me a flower as his way of an apology.\u201d  Walking over to me, Margo said, \u201cAfter everything that\u2019s happened; between losing his grandparents and not knowing if his parents are alive, he was just shocked to see me like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sentiment seems to be going around; it seems there are already people tossing around derogatory terms about you and the Maltorians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed a little of that earlier, but I just shrugged it off.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve experienced that on this planet; and I\u2019m certain it\u2019s not going to be the last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at David, asleep in the corner, I said, \u201cWith everything going on, perhaps it would be best if I stayed here with you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d confused, Margo said, \u201cI can take care of myself, Eric; I survived on this planet for almost a year without your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m trying to say you shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d Taking her hand, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re in danger here, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in danger, Eric; so long as the Creel are interested in this planet.\u201d Removing her hand from mine, Margo said, \u201cWhy are you so focused on keeping me safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re my only connection to Olivia; you can help me understand what she\u2019s going through.\u201d  Looking at her, I said, \u201cPlus I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t care about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI care about you too, Eric.\u201d Gesturing to David, Margo said, \u201cBut I have to think about David now; people might not take too kindly about us being involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re both adults, Margo; who cares what other people think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo just stood in front of me for a moment; thinking things over in her head.  Before I could react, she wrapped her hands around my neck and kissed me.  I reciprocated the kiss and the two of us made out for a few moments; until I started to take off her shirt.  Breaking the kiss, Margo removed my hands from her shirt and said, \u201cAs much as I want to, I don\u2019t think we should do this with David in the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw an empty office across the hall; we could go in there if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a sleeping bag and some pillows, Margo said, \u201cLast one cleans a garlock sty with his tongue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Margo ran out of the room, I inferred the meaning of her phrase \u2013 last one there is a rotten egg.  Going out after her, the two of us went into the empty office and closed the door.  It wasn\u2019t long before we were both naked and making love inside the sleeping bag.</span></div></div>",

With everything that\u2019s happened, I still found it hard to imagine that I was sharing a bed with an alien female.  I was brought back to reality as Margo turned over so she was resting on my chest.  Looking at me, a smile on her face, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s the best I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d Running a hand down her back, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re actually the first woman I\u2019ve slept with since my wife died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, Margo said, \u201cThat certainly puts some pressure on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you were amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe lay there for a few more minutes until Margo climbed out of the sleeping bag.  \u201cI should probably go check on David; see if he wants to get some dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Margo got dressed, I said, \u201cHave you basically taking him in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I have.\u201d Putting her shirt on, Margo said, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to lose family to the Creel; I have to try and help him through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Margo and David through the prison to the mess hall; where we all got some looks, both good and bad, from the people in the room.  Once the three of us got our food, Margo made a bee-line towards a group of Maltorians sitting in the corner.  I went to join them despite my concerns about there being an armed guard with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just sat down to eat when a young man, wearing a corrections officer uniform, came into the room.  \u201cI\u2019m looking for Eric Sheppard, is he here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a look towards Margo, I quietly got up and walked over.  \u201cI\u2019m Eric Sheppard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief Hertle needs you in the prison yard; a patrol from town returned with some survivors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed the man to the prison yard where I noticed a group of people getting out of a bus.  I watched as Chief Hertle and some officers walked towards them.  I wanted to ask why I was called for this; until I saw a familiar face in the crowd.  \u201cEmily!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily Rogers was Olivia\u2019s best friend.
