            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adam and Evan had been best friends ever since they were kids. After a lot of studying and testing, they were finally finished school. Early that year, they had decided that they were going to have a big road trip. They planned to visit as many states as they could during the next year before they figured out what they were going to do with their lives. They spent the year saving money and planning the trip when they had free time until the day arrived when they would drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going great until they got to Nevada. They were driving in the middle of nowhere during a freak snowstorm when the car broke down. They tried calling AAA but they couldn't get a signal. As night fell, they found themselves grabbing every scrap of clothing they could fit on and bundled up. They spend a very cold night sleeping in the car, trying their phones every so often to no avail. There wasn't much they could do but look for any food that they hadn't eaten yet and wait for someone to find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became very clear that the likelihood of someone driving down that road before they ran out of food or froze to death was looking very slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it,\" Evan said turning to Adam, \"but I don't think we can stay here any longer.\" Adam didn't say anything but just nodded in agreement. They bundled up as much as they could and climbed out of the car's window, since the door was blocked by snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desperate, hungry pair ventured forth into the storm in hopes that they could find someone to help them. The wind was harsh, forcing them to avoid looking exactly what direction they were going just to protect their eyes. They walked for hours with no trace of civilization in sight. As the sun began to set, it looked as all hope would be lost. They were not going to survive the night in this weather. They were worn out from all the walking, their energy wasted. All looked hopeless until something hard caught Evan's foot, causing him to trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Adam asked, helping up Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I just tripped over something,\" Evan said looking back to where he tripped. He didn't know exactly why, but he started to nudge the snow there. He felt something there, something solid. He kept feeling around, concluding that what ever had tripped him, was pretty wide. Evan knelt down and pushed away snow until something metal came into view. Adam joined him and it wasn't long before they had unearthed what looked like a giant steal door with a symbol on it. The image appeared to be an atom with the nucleus replaced with and apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and Evan looked at each other then grabbed the handle. It took some effort, but with a loud groan, they opened the door and saw a staircase leading down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Evan pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its a bomb shelter?\" Adam proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, they had few options, so they began their descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and Evan felt along the walls for a white, discovering that this place was much bigger than they expected, finally Adam finds a light switch, and the entire place lights up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's huge you realize, but neither of your are in the mood for exploring, you look around for the nearest bed, finding only one King sized bed, you both, tired and cold, strip off your wet clothes down to your boxers, not about to make a big deal out of it, and you both quickly fall asleep, tomorrow you'd head back out and try to find some help.</span></div></div>",

Evan pauses these Jeans are doing nothing to keep him warm, in fact his legs are still freezing, not to mention the way they cause his boxers to get all bunched up, he decides to find something to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing some more, he finds a pair of leggings, Evan doesn't know much about girls clothes but he knows girls wear them to keep warm when wearing skirts or when its cold so he quickly strips off the jeans and begins to slide them on, realizing that they won't work with his boxers, embarrasses he finds a pair of the most plain panties he could find and trades them for his boxers, then the leggings, lastly the jeans again, now he's warm and while there's a tightness in his crotch, its more comfortable than the bunched up boxers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what to do though</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before heading after Adam, Evan reluctantly slips on a pair of simple girl's flats as the floor is cold on his bare feet, his shoes are missing and they were the least feminine shoes available. He finds Adam wondering a corridor looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found any food yet?\" Evan ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but if I am right I think that room is the kitchen or food storage area.\" Adam says pointing to one of the doors in the corridor with a picture of a bowl and two crossed spoons on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets get it open.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both walk to the door and see if it will budge. Luckily the door opens easily and Adam and Even find themselves in a large kitchen dinning room area, with a pantry at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot\" Adam says running to the pantry. He immediately starts rummaging through all the cans and sachets it contains while Evan inspects the cooking equipment. \"If there was a nuclear war, the owners of this bunker would have been set.\" he sayings settling on a can of frank and beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven turns the tap on and clear fresh water comes out. \"We got water too. At least we aren't going to starve or dehydrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might freeze though if we don't find the heating\" Adam says eagerly opening his tin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go explore more after breakfast\" Evan picks up a pink sachet with the same apple logo as the door stamped on it from the pantry titled \"Dried pork and noodle chow mein. Freshness guaranteed. Vitamin and Hormone regulator included.\" \"I think one of the owners might have been a body builder or a health nut. Its good for us, we can get more carbs and junk to keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth cook and start to eat their breakfasts. Adam wolfs his down within a couple of minutes and Evan isn't far behind. He does initially find the taste of the dried meal odd, but his pallet soon adapts to it and he is disappointed when it is finished.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not bothering to wash up their plates they leave the kitchen and begin their search for the heating room or boiler. Feeling better with full stomachs raises their spirits and Adam begins teasing Evan for his clothes as they search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do have the right butt for those jeans. Shame I ain't trapped down here with a real girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd have chosen to freeze to death outside than risk getting stuck with.\" Evan responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet here she is\" Adam points at Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a right comedic genius aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just use what you give me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how the conversation goes as they explore the shelter. Evan does appreciate the softness of the panties and the leggings as he moves however but that is something he would never admit to Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shelter itself is relatively large with two main corridors either side of the big room they slept in last night and each corridor has between ten to twelve rooms on each side. Finally they find a room that looks promising as it has a lighting bolt hitting an apple stenciled on the door. Again this door opens easily and reveals what looks to be the shelters control room. There are dozens of screens and panels which fill the room with a faint hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam whistles appreciatively. \"I'll try that panel over there\" he says pointing to one of the monitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try this one I suppose\" Evan says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both go to their terminal and try to make sense of all the buttons and symbols. Evan's screen turns out to be a radio set and he immediately tries all the channels to see if he can find anyone to contact. Suddenly the whole shelter shudders slightly something far away begins to hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we are in business\" Adam says. \"I've just restored power to the boiler. Apparently we now have heating and also hot water to shower facilities too, wherever they they might be.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a radio work station,  just need to find a broadcasting channel. \"Still twiddling the channel dial absentmindedly, Evan stumbles upon an active channel. He grabs the mic and begins talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Hello can you hear me, my friend and I are stuck in an underground bunker can anyone help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is lieutenant Jones of the national guard, I read you. What is your location?\" Adam runs over and grins broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan gives the lieutenant their general position, their names and their food situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say this fellas but you won't be out of there earlier than a week. The storms pretty bad and you are too far out. If you were in immediate danger of starvation or freezing we would send a squad to dig you out but there are just other people who need help more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and Evan both feel like they have been hit in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will keep in contact on this channel and keep us informed of your situation. Hold tight guys, lieutenant Jones out.\" The radio becomes silent and the two friends just look at each other in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week at least! What the hell are we going to do?\" Adam groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan just remains silent and shakes his head. They both stand there in silence again until Adam suddenly marches out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Evan yells, running after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might as well start exploring again. We've got to fill the time somehow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Find out more about their current location right?\" Adam looked at Evan expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea, but let's assume they do anyway. So if we were to guess what this place is from first impressions?\" Evan looked at Adam, clearly looking to bounce some ideas back an forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what we've found there is a kitchen, a room holding a king sized bed for two, a living room, and finally a security room. At least that's what we've found so far.\" Adam had lifted his fingers as he listed off the rooms so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging from all that... I think we're in some honeymoon suite. I mean it would explain why there's female and male clothes left here.\" As Evan said this Adam couldn't help but put in a little pot shot at his friend's current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of, how are those feminine threads treating ya?\" Evan couldn't help but snort at this before shooting back with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\" Evan looked at his friend with a look that said 'Dude, really?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, if this a honeymoon suite then there might a brochure laying about.\" Evan started to look around the room and saw a little pamphlet laying right beside a relatively older flat screen T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo, we have our prize.\" Evan walked over and picked up the brochure and started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it say honey?\" Evan looked at Adam with flat look before saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, are you going to be doing that for the whole time I'm dressed like this?\" Adam nodded before saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight!\" Evan shoot back with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beginning to wonder if you are at the moment.\" Evan said with as much sarcasm as humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Well played. For real though what's the deal at the moment?\" Evan put the pamphlet down before shacking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky us, we stumbled across Honeymoon suite... For couples who want to have a family as quickly as possible.\" That, for once, brought Adam's joking to a screeching halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Was all Adam could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you heard right. This place is made for baby making.\" Adam's brain was apparently still rebooting because of this info dump, it was worse for Evan though. Without their clothes from before he was firmly stuck in the female role, at least the clothes felt nice. Adam looked like his wits finally came back to him and looked more than a little flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Well... Um...\" Evan couldn't help but get in a pot shot back at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it you said before? Something like 'I really do have the right butt for these jeans'?\" Adam, now no longer flustered, saw what this meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize this means war?\" Evan was smiling, with perhaps a bit too many teeth showing, at the new challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War huh? So what decides the winner?\" Adam was wearing the same smile as Evan at the moment, one showing far too many teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout a bit of role play? First one to crack looses, and loser has to treat the winner to whole day of take out food and it's gonna be the pricey stuff too.\" Evan frowned at this, that meant he was a bit of a disadvantage, he could already guess that role play was going to be a newly wed couple on there honeymoon, which meant Adam could just flirt with him and do what he wants to normally do, he however could not do the same. Still one whole week of time to pass, this was most likely going to be one of the few pass times they had... Eh, why the hell not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you got yourself a deal.\" Both parties had smiles on their faces that wouldn't look out of place in a slasher flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what else we can find here 'honey'\" Adam held out his arm for Evan to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing 'darling'\" Evan took Adam's arm and then snuggled up to his arm, both parties weren't backing down but the next room they find might help one get a boost to their confidence for victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat room do they find?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adam and Evan had been best friends ever since they were kids. After a lot of studying and testing, they were finally finished school. Early that year, they had decided that they were going to have a big road trip. They planned to visit as many states as they could during the next year before they figured out what they were going to do with their lives. They spent the year saving money and planning the trip when they had free time until the day arrived when they would drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going great until they got to Nevada. They were driving in the middle of nowhere during a freak snowstorm when the car broke down. They tried calling AAA but they couldn't get a signal. As night fell, they found themselves grabbing every scrap of clothing they could fit on and bundled up. They spend a very cold night sleeping in the car, trying their phones every so often to no avail. There wasn't much they could do but look for any food that they hadn't eaten yet and wait for someone to find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became very clear that the likelihood of someone driving down that road before they ran out of food or froze to death was looking very slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it,\" Evan said turning to Adam, \"but I don't think we can stay here any longer.\" Adam didn't say anything but just nodded in agreement. They bundled up as much as they could and climbed out of the car's window, since the door was blocked by snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desperate, hungry pair ventured forth into the storm in hopes that they could find someone to help them. The wind was harsh, forcing them to avoid looking exactly what direction they were going just to protect their eyes. They walked for hours with no trace of civilization in sight. As the sun began to set, it looked as all hope would be lost. They were not going to survive the night in this weather. They were worn out from all the walking, their energy wasted. All looked hopeless until something hard caught Evan's foot, causing him to trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Adam asked, helping up Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I just tripped over something,\" Evan said looking back to where he tripped. He didn't know exactly why, but he started to nudge the snow there. He felt something there, something solid. He kept feeling around, concluding that what ever had tripped him, was pretty wide. Evan knelt down and pushed away snow until something metal came into view. Adam joined him and it wasn't long before they had unearthed what looked like a giant steal door with a symbol on it. The image appeared to be an atom with the nucleus replaced with and apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and Evan looked at each other then grabbed the handle. It took some effort, but with a loud groan, they opened the door and saw a staircase leading down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Evan pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its a bomb shelter?\" Adam proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, they had few options, so they began their descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey descended down the staircase, into the darkness below. It was cold, but without the biting wind, they hoped that they might be able to survive the night. When they made it to the bottom, there was a loud bang and the little light that they had was snuffed out. They both jumped a mile high when it happened but rationalized that the wind must have blown the door shut. Adam was about to go open it back up so they didn't get snowed in when there was an echoing metallic groan all around them. The groan was followed by a series bangs and pops and above them a set of lights hummed to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room they were in slowly became lit, revealing an empty metal chamber with another metal door. The symbol of the apple was there again, but this time there was a message engraved on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fruits of tomorrow are reaped from the seeds we sow today.\" Adam read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan went to open the door, but then realized he didn't know how.\"That's weird, there's no doorknob or handle,\" he said pushing at the door. Suddenly, the door began to move. It slid to the side, disappearing into a slot in the wall. Inside the room, more lights kicked on but this room was furnished. The style looked very dated, like something you would see in on \"Leave it to Beaver\" or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and Evan began looking around the room, feeling like they just stepped back in time. They found small vents on the walls at about ankle height, warm air was being pumped in. It was nice to know that they wouldn't be dieing of cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the exit closed. There were odd mechanical pieces on the back of the door and they could see gears and pistons moving and locking into place. It was over as quickly as it started. Adam rushed the door and tried to pry it open, but nothing moved.</span></div></div>",

The metal groaning noise got louder as the pair stood. On one end of the room, two metal doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enter the individual decon chambers.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decon chambers?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on the furniture, I'd guess this was made during the Cold War. They probably assumed whoever would make it here would be escaping an A-Bomb.\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we do it?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enter the individual decon chambers.\" the voice said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan shrugged and started to walk towards one of the doors. Adam walked into the other door. They gave each other one final glance as they entered the dark rooms in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shut behind Evan. The room was dimly lit by floor level lights, but the lights slowly started to rise. Evan looked around. To his left, was a metal panel labeled \"Disposal\". In front of him was a small glass chamber with doors on both sides. Above the chamber was some sort of vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please place your clothing in the disposal chute.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's clothes were wet, and it would be good to get out of them, but they weren't irradiated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they aren't dirty! Just wet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please place your clothing in the disposal chute.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was about to protest again, but remembered that this was a decades-old recording. Not likely to listen to him and change based on his whims. He doubted they even had the technology for that back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stripped out of his clothes and placed everything into the chute, from his jacket down to his socks. He sighed as he tossed them into the chute, the only saving grace being that the metal floor was heated, so he wasn't too cold to be without clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please step forward into the decon chamber.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan hesitantly entered the chamber and shut the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please close eyes and mouth and hold breath for approximately ten seconds.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan complied as a gas was pumped into the chamber for about six seconds before a fan started running and sucked the gas out. When Evan opened his eyes and started breathing again, he noticed an... antiseptic smell. Kinda like an air freshener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please step out of the chamber.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stepped out of the chamber through the door in front of him and stepped back onto the heated metal floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make your way into the next room.\" the voice said as a metal door on the opposite wall slid open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan gulped as he made his way towards the next room. He entered the room and the door shut behind him before the lights started to raise up. Evan found himself in...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He unconsciously hugged himself, attempting to cover his naked body, as he examined the door. Concluding that there was no way back, he turned his attention to the new room. The new room was very much like the first in athletics but instead of the disposal panel and instead there was several nozzles pointing toward the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease step into the middle of the room,\u201d the chipper voice commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure, not liking the look of the nozzles, Evan approached but still kept his distance from the nozzles. In between the nozzles the room dipped down slightly with a drain at the center of it. Above was a something he concluded was a shower nozzle for rinsing off anyone who stood in the right spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease step into the middle of the room,\u201d the voice commanded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really having any other options, he stepped in nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease raise your arms,\u201d the voice told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan did so and instantly he was hit with water from all sides. Though it was startling, it wasn't too hot or cold. In fact, it was nice and warm. Just as he was starting to relax the water shut off and the voice told him to close his eyes and mouth again, which he did. He was then hit with cool, flowery foam all along his body while a different, thinner liquid drizzled on his head. After that, everything shut down and he was left there standing awkwardly in silence. Not long after, however, he felt his skin getting warm. The warmth didn't stop building and soon it became uncomfortably hot. Just as he started to panic, again he was met with water on all sides. The relief was instant, as the burning foam was washed off of him and down the drain. Alarmingly, however, his body hair was washed down with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Evan shouted out as he was suddenly hit buy warm air from all sides, drying him from all angles. The next door opened and the voice spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make your way into the next room,\" it said as a new door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan wondered just how big this place was as he felt his hairless body. His skin was soft to the touch, smooth and now truly naked. He felt vulnerable in a way he never felt before as he looked at the open doorway.</span></div></div>",

It was a bedroom, again, very 50's in it's decor, with a bed sitting in the middle with two end tables on either side, several exit doors that were completely sealed, a small old-style television set with rabbit ears sitting opposite the bed, and standing in the middle in a dark blue bathrobe, was Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Adam waved, and averted his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan looked Adam up and down. Adam had evidently not been relieved of all his body hair. Maybe his chamber had a glitch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there.\" Adam pointed towards a small dip in the wall that held two frames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne frame was empty, and the other had a pink bathrobe hanging on it. Evan walked over and retrieved the other bathrobe. He put it on and walked back over to Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this place?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Adam replied. \"The place shot me with some weird gas and then showered me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Evan replied. \"Except the soap removed all my body hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.\" Adam said. \"I got to keep mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about to converse about a plan to get out, but they were interrupted by the sound of the national anthem, playing very loudly. The TV had sprung to life. The two men quickly rushed over to the screen. The screen simply had an image of their country's flag, before it began to dissipate, fading into a grainy and degraded image of an older man, a former President, presumably, though it was degraded enough that neither was certain who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Welcome to Command Bunker-A. If you're watching this, that means you were chosen by your country for a very special mission. Our world is in danger thanks to nuclear weapons, and when things go sideways, our country must prevail. In the event of a catastrophic disaster, chosen patriot couples will be brought to bunkers like this, all across the country to wait out the nuclear winter. You're our best and brightest, and if necessary, will hopefully be able to bring our country back from extinction, by any means necessary. The bunker is designed to last you however long the surface is uninhabitable, with food, drink, entertainment and recreation, that will keep you socialized and content, and will release you once the radiation levels drop to safe levels. Your country, and I, salute you, brave citizens.\" the figure on the screen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen faded into a test pattern before it shut itself off. It dawned on Evan what was happening. If Adam was in the blue robe... and there were supposed to be two married people here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this thing... think we're married?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be designed for a couple. You heard that, bring our country back stuff, it wants us to repopulate the Earth!\" Adam shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to get out of here.\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran to the doors that they came from and tried to pry them open, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Command Bunker-A.\" the chipper voice said. \"Clothing will be provided for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left wall, a door slid open, revealing a large walk in closet.  Adam and Evan peered inside the room. One side was covered wall to wall with suits, shoes, undershirts, underwear, pants, you name it. The other side was the same but with women's clothing. Dresses, pants, shorts, skirts, bras, panties, every type of heel imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please get dressed and prepare for recreation.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam wasted no time finding a sharp, if dated, tweed suit with a vest and tie. As he tied his shoe, he looked the part of a young college professor, or businessman. Evan hesitated, investigating the men's clothing, but while it fit Adam perfectly, Evan was much shorter and every outfit he tried on didn't fit right. He looked like a kid dressed up in his dad's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put on anything so we can look around.\" Adam said, impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll just wear the robe.\" Evan sighed, pulling the robe back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Adam said. \"Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam rushed out back into the bedroom, flanked by Evan. Two doors opened up on either side of the room. As they walked towards one, the doors suddenly shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please get dressed and prepare for recreation.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I am dressed!\" Evan shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go put something on!\" Adam shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Evan grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to the closet alone and looked around. He heard the doors open once again outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry it up!\" Adam shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" Evan shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan frantically looked around for something to wear. He reluctantly started looking through the women's clothes, pulling on a pair of white panties. He found a pair of black capri pants and a purple turtleneck. He quickly pulled them on, along with a pair of black Mary Jane shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan emerged from the closet, embarrassed. Adam looked him up and down as he stood in front of the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Adam shouted as he walked through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan rushed towards the door, but it shut before he made it. He started pounding on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam!\" Evan shouted. \"Adam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make your way to your recreation activity.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan looked around. The other door was open. It wasn't where Adam was, but it wasn't here. He rushed towards the door and ran inside, the door shutting behind him like before. The room was dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights went up and Evan realized what the \"recreation\" activity was. It was:</span></div></div>",

On one wall were shelves full of beauty products and on the other were a set of chairs that had mannequins sitting in them, with large dryer helmets sitting atop their heads. In the center of the room was a single salon chair with weird looking arm rests, with waffle-iron like attachments on the front of the rests, and similar looking attachments on the footrest. It also had a large dryer helmet attached to the top of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Evan asked as he stepped into the room. He turned behind him as the door shut, seeing that there was a mock storefront with a window and a painting of a street outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enrichment and recreation activities are important for remaining content and happy in the face of this crisis. Any attempts at regaining normalcy will help you and your spouse until the bunker can be safely unlocked.\" the chipper recording said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sort of got the idea. Make the people here feel like life carries on so that they don't spend too much time depressed about the nuclear Armageddon. Which would be fine... if he was Adam and was probably sitting at a bar on in an office. He didn't want a salon visit. It was bad enough that he had to wear the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sit in the chair, remove footwear, and place extremities into the appropriate areas.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really in the mood today. Can I just go see Adam?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sit in the chair, remove footwear, and place extremities into the appropriate areas.\" the voice repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sighed and sat down into the chair, taking the Mary-Janes off and placing them beside the chair. He sat back and rested his arms in the arm rest and placed his foot into the footrests. The open parts of the rests clamped shut over his hands and feet. The helmet descended from the chair and placed itself over his head. He felt a vacuum begin sucking his hair up into it as the chair began to vibrate. Evan felt pressure on his fingers and toes as he tried to look at what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of chairs with mannequins slid out from the wall and rotated to join with Evan's chair. The mannequins were sort of animatronic, moving slightly, idly flipping through magazines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mrs. Smith, how are things at home? How's the husband?\" a voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan ignored it as he tried to ignore what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer the question. Polite conversation is good for mental health.\" the chipper woman's voice stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... good?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Planning any additions soon?\" the animatronic asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, this place is pushy.\" Evan said. \"Even if I was a woman...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrating stopped and the helmet ascended. A mirror rose out from the floor to allow Evan to see just what the machine had done to him. What he saw was a short, curly, bob haircut. He reached to touch it, but his hands were still held secure in the attachments. They slowly popped open, revealing almond shaped nails painted a bright red. Evan didn't even know how to react when the feet attachments opened, revealing a matching pedicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Evan whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it great to get pampered? Please place footwear back on and enter the next room.\" the chipper voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan grabbed the mary-janes and put them back on, before quickly leaving the salon room, though he had a sinking feeling he'd be back there. The next room was:</span></div></div>",

He could make out fake elevator doors on one end, and paintings depicting other departments on the other. Evan was surprised at how in-depth the entire scenario was, though he recognized some of the mannequins from the last room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome ma'am, how can I help you?\" one of the mannequins on the other side of the counter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm just browsing.\" Evan started to check around for a possible exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Our studies have shown that purchasing cosmetics is an activity that women enjoy, and the act of putting on makeup releases dopamine.\"</i> the chipper woman's voice said from the crackly speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan could figure out what it wanted, and what would get him out of the room as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything to recommend?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" the mannequin eagerly replied. \"Take a seat in that chair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light illuminated a chair in front of the counter. Evan hesitantly sat in it, pleasantly surprised that it contained no restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with some blush.\" the mannequin said, as the top of the counter opened, and a small elevator revealed several vintage makeup containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA television set behind the counter came to life, depicting a woman, sitting where Evan was now, applying the makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll just follow along.\" the mannequin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeshadow, lipstick, eyeliner, and even a generous dousing of perfume followed, as the television showed Evan how to properly apply the makeup. Evan's only saving grace was, one he finished, the door to the next area would open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up his face, he glanced into the mirror and was taken aback by his reflection. With the hair and nails, and especially the clothes... well he certainly looked the part now. He wondered if the other rooms had successfully gotten Adam to develop a habit for drinking and smoking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, ma'am!\" the animatronic exclaimed. \"And feel free to ask to come back if you ever need a touch-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to consider it.\" Evan numbly stood up and rushed through the door as soon as it opened, finding himself:</span></div></div>",

Sitting, he found himself having no choice but to sit straight thanks to the corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cRemain seated and hold still.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, a large dome descended and fit itself over his head. The sudden sound of a loud buzz made him flinch as he felt the thing do something to his head, all while forced to look at himself in the mirror. The sensation was like none that he had felt before, though not too unpleasant. It didn't take long before the sound and sensations ended and the dome began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Evan had his suspicions on what the dome had done, he wasn't prepared to see the result. His hair had been cut and styled in a woman's hairdo. Though his face was still his own, he still had trouble seeing his reflection as anything else other than, if a bit masculine, woman's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThough nature is beautiful, sometimes it can use a helping hand. Please open the blue container and apply the contents as directed.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Evan followed orders as best that he could and rubbed the cream from the blue container as instructed. He rubbed the cream on his arms, legs, and his face. He was made to avoid his eyebrows as best he could and told to sit still until told otherwise. Again, Evan pretty much knew what he had just done, that didn't help at all when he was given a damp towel to wipe away the cream and his hair with it. He never had much body hair before just a bit of fuzz on his legs and face, still, he didn't like being forced to get rid of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce cleaned, he was instructed on makeup. He was told the names of each product and what their application was for and then made to repeat the information. After painfully plucking his own eyebrows, he was taught how to apply each product while being quizzed on the information about them. He put on the makeup and once on, made to wash it off. He then reapplied the make up and again, washed it off. This went on for a long time until the voice seamed happy with Evan's work, even if Evan wasn't. Looking back at him was a lovely woman with big doe eyes and pouty red lips that begged to be kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you, Continue into the next room, to continue your Personal Enrichment program, Miss.\u201d </i></span></div></div>",

Well, he rather \"plopped\" himself into the chair, sitting with his legs spread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, another metal rod shot out of the wall and gave him an electric jolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A lady eases gracefully into seats, smoothing her skirts as she sits.

He was sensing a pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 45 minutes of seating training, Evan had apparently learned enough to satisfy the machine...  or computer...  or whatever was running this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A lady must comport herself with gave and style at all times. She must learn to eat daintily and with the proper utensils.  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan slid gracefully into his chair, facing the mirror, smoothing his skirt, crossing his legs. His ribs were starting to hurt from the corset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBands sprung out of the chair, wrapping themselves around his waist and his ankles, essentially trapping him in a feminine pose in the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sighed. What now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlates and dining utensils slid onto the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We will start with learning about place settings and how a lady should eat. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was drilled on when to use a shrimp fork, how to eat soup, portion sizes to maintain \"her \" figure, often earning that dreaded shock from the wand. He was tiring, and was beginning to dread underperforming the computer's notions. The shocks really hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was the soft chime and the bands on his chair released.

I'm not attracted to men!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you can hear me?\" Evan shouted. \"I don't want a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A modern woman needs to take care of her body. Maintaining girlish figure helps keep her man interested in her.  We shall proceed to make sure you keep a desirable shape.  If need be, steps will be taken to ensure your attraction to your partner you came here with.  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made the hair on the back of Evan's neck stand up. This... place would take steps to make sure he was attracted to Adam?!  He swallowed at the thought of that. Maybe he should play along until he could get back together with Adam and get out of this madhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan walked into the room further and stopped. Those mechanical arms came out and, some would say helped, Evan wouldn't use that term... helped Evan out of his dress and hose. He soon found himself in a leotard and tights. Unfortunately, the stupid corset was still on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA panel slid open in the wall, and a large the TV set appeared. After a burst of static, a grainy black and white image of a woman, very perky, very happy, and very energetic, dressed similarly to you, came onto the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi girls!  I'm Becky!  And I'm here to help you obtain and keep that slim, attractive figure that your man will love. We don't want his eye straying now do we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep up as best you can. If you falter too much, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but, steps will be taken to ensure compliance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get gorgeous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started doing some jumping jacks. Evan stared at the screen and received another strong shock, immediately causing him to begin copying Becky's movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exercise wasn't that bad. It was mostly cardio, some light weights, a treadmill appeared and he ran for a while on it. What was absolutely maddening was Becky's constant chatter about being desirable for men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember girls, a moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing tastes as good as being thin is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want that hourglass 36-24-36 figure ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end, Evan was sweaty, tired, and ready for a break. Some water was slid through a small panel, and Evan drank it gladly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching his breath for a while, a new doorway slid open and that dreaded voice repeated:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please continue into the next room to continue your Personal Enrichment program, miss. Failure to comply will be punished. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a *ping* and the doors behind him slid shut sealing him into the next room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A modern woman needs to make sure she is clean, sweet smelling, and pretty for her man... We shall proceed to make sure you are clean.  Bubble baths, massages, facials all help you remain soft and attractive for you man. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan groaned.  The arms came out of the wall and undressed him.  He was almost jubilant when the corset was removed. In short order, he was naked.  A panel opened and a claw footed tub slid into the room.  It was obviously a bubble bath.  Evan could smell the floral scent of the bath from where he stood.  Soft music played, and the lights were slowly dimmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>  Please step into the bath.  You will be cleaned and pampered.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan took a step backwards and shook his head.  \"No.  Please?  I don't want to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>  Please step into the bath.  You will be cleaned and pampered.  Failure to comply will be punished. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stood there, naked and shaking.  He did NOT want to get into that tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long seconds, the arms, and their shocking rods, came out and herded him into the tub.  Evan lied there, tense and prepared for the worst.  Arms came out and started washing his hair.  And scrubbing him.  He began to relax a bit.  The warm water, after being trapped in the corset all day felt very nice.  He closed his eyes.  The arms scrubbed him and... He sat up with a jerk as a scrubbing pad started cleaning his crotch.  He scrambled, trying to clamber our of the tub, but the arms pushed him back into the tub.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman needs some pampering time to prepare herself for her man.  We shall now begin the pampering.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was held in the tub as a facial mask was applied.  Cucumber slices were placed over his eyes.  His feet were lifted out of the water and his callouses were softened.  Sweet smelling lotion was applied all over his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he was left there, in the warm, sudsy water, eye closed, soft music playing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan awoke with a start as his face was being wiped clean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rinsed off, again stressing as the pads wiped off his crotch.  As the water drained out of the tub, he caw that the bath had removed all of his body hair from the neck down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was finally let up and climbed out of the tub.  A towel was wrapped around his chest and his hair done up in a turban.  Kitten heeled slippers were placed on his feet.  And then he heard that dreaded \"ping\" and the voice said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please continue into the next room to continue your Personal Enrichment program, miss. Failure to comply will be punished. </i></span></div></div>",

The message repeated itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please continue into the next room to continue your Personal Enrichment program, miss. Failure to comply will be punished</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stood there for a long moment. As the arm tipped with the shocking rod came towards him, he scampered into the next room. The door behind him slid shut with a hiss. Looking around the room, Evan saw an elaborate round bed with a pink canopy and pink satin sheets. There was a slightly raised round dais in the middle of the room. He braced himself for what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman needs her beauty sleep to remain attractive for her man. Night time is the perfect time to slip into something sensual and recharge your batteries. After all, providing a nice home and being a passionate wife to your husband requires rest. Please step forward onto the platform for preparations.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nEvan started backing away from the raised platform, shaking his head \"no\" with a horrified look on his face. The sharp ZAP of the rod striking the back of his bare thigh sent him unwillingly scampering onto the dais. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman should always present herself in something attractive and arousing for her husband in the bedroom. You will learn what to wear to entice your husband here. Please raise your arms above your head. Failure to comply will be punished</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was near tears, but he so did not want that painful shock. His leg was still stinging from the last one. He slowly and unsurely raised his hands above his head in compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft ping and the voice started up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank you for willingly complying. Men are visual creatures. Often, the hint of the treasure that lies beneath sensuous lingerie can ignite his amorous intent. You will be prepared as such for your man.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMechanical arms removed his towels. Another corset shot down over Evan's up stretched arms and was tightened immediately around his waist, knocking any fight out of him. A pair of string bikini panties were tugged up his legs and pulled into place. A slinky pink nightie was dropped over his arms while the mechanical ones affixed it properly around him. A helmet dropped over his head and he could feel makeup being applied and his hair being pulled taught. After several minutes,the helmet lifted and a mirror was placed in front of him. He was dressed as a fairly attractive woman, with her makeup on and curlers in her hair. Evan wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please walk over to the bed, remove your slippers, and get into the bed. Lie on your back in approximately the middle of the bed. Failure to comply will be punished.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaten, Evan shuffled over towards the bed, slipped off the kitten heels, and arranged himself as instructed on the bed. The curlers bit into his scalp as he lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please place your arms outstretched to the side and spread your legs. Failure to comply....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL BE PUNISHED!\" Evan shouted along with the voice as it finished the instructions. In a defiant fit of anger, Evan threw his arms out wide and spread his legs, almost daring the stupid machine to do its worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately arms clamped around his wrists and ankles, immobilizing Evan. He started thrashing, but he couldn't move much at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is important for a woman to be aroused with desire for her man. We will begin your training in becoming aroused upon seeing your man.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Stop!\" Evan screamed. \"I'm not a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA TV screen was lowered into his line of sight. He could see pictures of Adam being run through a gauntlet of activities much like he had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please keep your eyes open and fixed on the screen. Failure to comply will be severely punished</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA band wrapped around Evan's head, locking it in place, keeping him staring at the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his panties being slid down with his legs being lifted and he could hear a soft whirring. A pliable probing was felt poking into his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you you stupid machine, I'm not a woman!\" Evan shouted at the top of his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine slowly lifted Evan's legs further, and he felt the probe making questioning thrusts trying to find what Evan obviously lacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a...\" At that moment, with Evan's knees pushed up towards his shoulders, the probe found the one opening Evan had. And it began working itself into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's eyes went wide and his mouth opened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please keep your eyes focused on the screen. Failure to comply will be SEVERELY punished.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of images of Adam flashed on the screen. Adam in the shower. Adam sweating while lifting weights in only tight shorts. Adam dressed in a suit and tie holding a cocktail glass and smiling. Adam strapped in a bed much like Evan with some device over his crotch. And Adam was biting his lip, obviously in distress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while the probe was inserting itself and pulling out, varying speed. And Evan felt himself beginning to like the sensation, and he began groaning. And then he understood. The machine was trying to get him to associate sexual arousal with Adam. And he suddenly gasped with pleasure as the machine kept on thrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently sensing Evan's rapture, the machine slowly stopped pumping. Once the thrusting ended, there was a \"pop\" and the probe was released from the arm, leaving it inserted in Evan's bottom. His legs were gently lowered as he saw that Adam was apparently experiencing the same thing, only without any probe inserted in him. His arms, head, and ankles were kept bound and his panties slid back into place. The probe suddenly began to vibrate, causing Evan to writhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is important now that you have pleased your man that you get beauty sleep. You will awaken to a wonderful new day here at the Personal Enrichment Institute. Good night, and pleasant dreams</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another soft \"ping\" and the lights in the room went out. Soft music began to play, all the while Evan writhed and cooed with the whirring probe inside of him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His body hummed pleasantly while he lifted his hand to rub his face. As he grazed his fingers across his lips and over his cheeks, he felt something odd. There was something warm and wet on his hand, which he tried to see through blurred eyes. Blinking away the sleep, he licked his lips unconsciously and tasted something strangely salty. Then he saw what was on his hands and he jumped up out of bed, looking over himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe event's of the previous day flooded his mind. He was still wearing the pink nightie and corset from the night before, which he wiped his hands on. He reach into his panties and removed the vibrating probe and tossed it across the room. His panties were slightly damp and he realized what that meant...what that thing made him do. He spit repeatedly on the floor, unsuccessfully attempting to rid his mouth of the taste of himself. The worst of it all, though, was the emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was still and he felt like there was a void in him. The pleasant humming of his body had gone with the probe and there was a part of him that he hated, a part that wanted that feeling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good morning, Miss.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nEvan jumped, hearing the voice again. He was not looking forward to finding out what this day was going to bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's time to start your day. It is important to express your joy of seeing your man first thing in the morning. Please do so now.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nWith that, Evan was showed an image of Adam on the monitor from the previous night. He wanted to just get it over with so he gave a simple greeting. He felt stupid saying good morning to a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your morning greeting should include a term of endearment to let your man know you are feeling affection toward him. Please, do so now. Failure to comply will be punished. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cUh...Good morning...honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good. Now, return to the bathing area for your morning cleansing. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nEvan didn't move. He couldn't. He just couldn't. Another shocking arm, however, encouraged him along. As he made his way, he noticed the soreness that his body felt. Both the exorcize and the walking in heels had really done a number on his muscles. After a short moment he arrived. He was once again naked and in the tub being rubbed down, though his hair was left dry and in the curlers. Of course this part wasn't too bad but it was bound to get worse sooner than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo soon he was out of the tub being dried off and then forced into a new prison of fabric. Another corset and more underwear. This time, he was to be wearing a white dress with red flowers dancing along the skirts. Another pair of heels was added, this time red, matching the flowers. Once dressed he was again brought to a mirror and instructed on how to apply his makeup like the previous day. He didn't really remember what to do, so the instructions went very much like before. Once done, another dome was fitted over his head, playing with his hair. The finished product was of a vision of a pretty woman with wavy hair, beautiful eyes and plump red lips. Evan hated knowing that he made a convincingly attractive woman and worse, Adam was going to be seeing images of him dressed that night while these machines made him...<b>enjoy</b> it.</span></div></div>",

There was either comply, or feel the sting of that stupid rod.  He faced the doors as they hissed and slid open.  Shoulders slouching, Evan slumped his way through them into a room that was barren except for an over-sized treadmill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman carries herself with grace at all times.

Why was this bunker ever created?  And why had Adam and he ever stumbled across it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was broken out of his thoughts by the voice, apparently repeating:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step onto the treadmill.  Failure to comply will be punished.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with resignation, Evan licked his lipsticked lips and minced over to the treadmill, gingerly stepping up onto it, bracing himself for the worst.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm shot out with a collar, wrapping itself around his neck, making him hold his hard erect.  Two more arms fastened themselves to his ankles.  The treadmill began to move, forcing Evan to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman makes precise movements, making sure that she carries herself with grace, while attracting the attention of her man.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collar forced Evan's head up, making him thrust his padded chest out.  The arms around his ankles forced him to take small, mincing steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman rolls her hips, allowing for easier movements in heels, as well as attracting the attention of her man.  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock rods shot out on either side of Evan's hips, and would shock him if he failed to sway them as the machine decided was appropriate.    And while Evan submitted to grace training, all he could think about was that Adam would see him like this later.  God, he hoped that Adam didn't have any sort of bondage fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long hours of mincing and swaying on the treadmill, the collar released from Evan's neck, and the arms retracted from his ankles.  The treadmill stopped, and Evan stepped off.  Doors hissed open on the opposite side of the room from where he entered, and the voice said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step into the next room.

Even as he protested, though, Evan made his way into the next room. The treadmill did the trick because Evan was having a hard time walking as he normally would. With every step he was filled with a sense of dread, a fear of getting shocked. He tried to ignore it but it uncomfortable and unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this.

I'm exhausted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter what he said, however, because the arms came once again. He was dressed once more in spandex and was forced to follow the routine like he had before. He tried to pretend that he was anywhere else as he moved this way and that. It was difficult but he somehow found the strength to continue. His body felt like mush by the end of the exercise but at least it was over. Like last time, he was cleaned up and rinsed off before being dressed again. This time he was wearing a black skirt with a white blouse along with a pair of black strappy heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...last time after I finished with the aerobics I went to bed and...\" Evan's mind started to drift for a brief a moment to what the machine made him do while looking at pictures of Adam before he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Voice never responded. Evan was suddenly afraid that this might be a technique to break him. He guesses that maybe the machine is taking away his point of reference or something like that.

This time, there was a mannequin seated at the table with some sort of screen where it\u2019s head should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is important for a woman to know how to be pleasing to her man. Please have a seat opposite your partner. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly... slowly... not knowing exactly what to expect, Evan swayed across the room and sat in the chair. He expected the seat to lock him in place, and only after several moments of seating did he relax, as nothing caught or trapped Evan in the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen atop the mannequin\u2019s head flickered and was filled with a view of Adam\u2019s face. Adam was squirming, looking around, and not seeming comfortable at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdam?\u201d Evan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi...  uh, honey.\u201d  Adam said, closing his eyes. \u201cYou look stunning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan blushed. It was insane hearing his friend say that. \u201cUh... thanks?\u201d  Evan said. \u201cLook, this place...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...is relentless... dear. I\u2019m.... learning...\u201d Adam bit his lip. \u201c...learning to be your ideal man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do know I\u2019m straight, regardless of what this place...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lean forward, please.

The collar was on a cable, which was apparently tied off under the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is important for a woman to allow her man to control her, that she be submissive to him, at all times. It is especially important that she know where, when, and how to please him. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cable on the collar started to retract, and Evan had little choice to slide under the table as it did. To his horror, under the table, the mannequin had a rather large, erect member.  The cable pulled him closer towards the mannequin\u2019s...  Adam\u2019s... crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman is never afraid to show her devotion... her commitment.... her need to please her man. Please take your man\u2019s penis into your mouth. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan tightly clamped his mouth shut and shook his head no. No sooner had he done so than he got a sound shock from the collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d He cried, not realizing the plan. When he said it, the cable retracted at lightning speed, placing his open mouth on Adam\u2019s member. Adam groaned from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan tried to pull his head back but an arm dropped from the table above him and gently pushed him forward. Again, Evan tried to remove the cock from his mouth, but the arm pushed him forward again. He was being forced to blow his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvan..\u201d he heard Adam from above.  \u201cI\u2019m in some... device. I can... feel what you\u2019re doing. God... you are amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arm was physically pushing and pulling Evan\u2019s head at this point. Evan tried biting down and received a nasty shock for that. Emotionally, he became numb until the mannequin shot a salty load into the back of his mouth. His nose was immediately pinched shut by a device, leaving him little choice but to swallow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Adam said from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft \u201cping\u201d sounded, and the arm and collar were released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step into the next room.

He couldn't believe what he had just been forced to to...no...what this machine did to him. He didn't do this, it wasn't his choice. Evan swallowed, unconsciously trying to get the feeling and taste of the the artificial cum out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was artificial, right?\u201d he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of Adam on his back the night before popped into his mind. The device that this place attached to it didn't have an opening that he could see. That had to mean that that when Adam orgasmed looking at pictures of him, that cum had to go somewhere. They could have easily collected it and stored it for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan scurried out from under the table, spitting uselessly. Panic set in and he ran to the previous door. He slammed his fists on it with little thought to the likelihood of successfully escaping like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is not how a lady should act.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Evan screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really didn't matter what Evan said, the machines were already in motion and Evan found himself being shocked by mechanical arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step into the next room. Failure to comply will be punished. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan found renewed strength as he fought off the arms but was still hopelessly out matched. He was shocked repeatedly until the will to fight was once again gone. He pranced into the next room having gained nothing from his resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pleasing your man, you must take care that you are still presentable. Please reapply your makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan once again found himself sitting in front of a mirror and beauty supplies. He looked at his face and his makeup was a terrible mess. His lipstick was smudged from Adam's...no...the mannequin's artificial cock. His mascara had run from the tears of pain caused by the painful shocks. It was all a mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm with a spongy material cleaned his face and he was set to doing his makeup again. He was instructed again but was able to predict what was required of him, having done this twice already. The practice was paying off because he only had to try again once more before he was deemed pretty enough to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step into the next room.

He shuddered to think about what would be his next task as he entered. What he entered into was a kitchen. The room was set up much like a cooking show, with half the room being dedicated to a counter with cabinets, a fridge and an oven behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please make your way to the counter and put on your apron</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan quickly walked over to the counter, finding a frilly apron hanging on a hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please put on your apron</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's entire will to fight had been sapped from him. He numbly pulled the apron over his head and tied it around his waist. He looked at the counter, which looked fairly standard, save for a computer screen that had been mounted within it, featuring a cook book's name listed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your next lesson is to learn how to cook for your man. Keeping him satisfied in the dining room is almost as important as keeping him satisfied in the bedroom. Please perform the recipe listed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen changed to a recipe and Evan turned to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuna Noodle Casserole?\" he asked. \"Gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please perform the recipe listed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan heard the movement associated with the shocks and quickly rushed over to the cabinet, opening it up and pulling out the required items. Then he made his way to the fridge and finished pulling out what he needed. Following the instructions was rather simple and the shocking was kept at bay as long as he performed adequately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he placed the casserole in the oven, the next door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step into the next room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evan timidly went through the doorway, the door hissing closed behind him. As the lights in the new room came up, he saw a low pedestal or platform similar to the one in the bedroom to one side, what had to be a vanity to the other, and what appeared to be a wardrobe between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice spoke again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just as food feeds your man\u2019s body, it is your duty to feed your man\u2019s soul. Now that you\u2019ve prepared a wonderful meal for him, you need to prepare yourself to present it, and you, to him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan groaned. He did not want to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step onto the pedestal. Failure to comply will be punished</i>. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nEvan\u2019s heels echoed with a click for every step he took across the floor, eventually stepping onto the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please disrobe. Failure to comply will be punished. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was overjoyed to hear those words!  Mechanical arms helped him lower the zipper on his dress and loosen his corset. In short order, he was standing, naked, on the platform. Even though he was alone, he awkwardly tried to cover himself with his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms holding lacy bits of fabric lowered into view. Evan\u2019s eyes went wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Men love women who take pride in their appearance, who dress to entice, when the mood hits them. It is your job to select garments such as these that can help shape your body while delighting your man.  Please put on the presented lingerie. Failure to comply will be punished</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan gingerly took the articles presented. A black high waisted girdle, with garters and a bullet bra. It would have looked great on a 50\u2019s pinup, maybe. But he really didn\u2019t want to wear it. Apparently he had taken too long in looking at the lingerie, as the system repeated itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please put on the presented lingerie. Failure to comply will be punished </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, knowing he was going to wind up in it regardless, Evan stepped into the girdle, having to slowly work it up and over his waist. He fumbled with putting the bra on, but he eventually got it hooked closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank you. Please raise your arms over your head.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan slowly raised his arms over his head. When he did so, two mechanical arms came out and roughly pulled the girdle up, crushing his manhood and causing a seam to ride up and accentuate his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So as not to overtly interfere with a lovely dinner and evening with your man, your lingerie has been serviced with a discrete training mechanism.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan gasped as a vibration started thrumming against his trapped member, making him weak in the knees and stumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not good. This was so not good. He immediately begin trying to take the girdle off. A searing electrical jolt dropped him to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please do not remove your lingerie. You will be rewarded for compliance.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis crotch buzzed with pleasant vibrations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You will be punished for being anything less than your man\u2019s dream girl. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the searing shock made Evan cry out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm presented Evan with a black diaphanous dressing gown from the 50\u2019s that matched the lingerie he\u2019d been forced into. He robe had maribou cuffs and a collar. As he put it on, his crotch started to vibrate. The stupid training was going to get his to associate pleasure with doing things like this!  The arousing sensations continued as he slid on the next thing presented:  matching maribou slippers with a rather high heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step over to the wardrobe and select a pleasing outfit to wear for dinner with your man. Failure to comply will be punished. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the vibrations in his crotch turning his knees to jelly, Evan slowly minced over to the wardrobe and opened the door. Inside were quite a few vintage cocktail dresses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, he reached in and pulled one out. It was a rather slinky fitted black number. The buzzing on his trapped member increased, making Evan gasp and reach for the wardrobe to steady himself. Apparently that was a good selection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung it back up and saw a pair of slacks hanging there. As soon as he pulled that hanger off the rod, he was shocked, not severely, but enough to hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis evening wasn\u2019t going to end well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was similarly directed via his crotch to pick some sexy stiletto heels that he dreaded having to wear. By this point, the buzzing in his girdle really had Evan turned on, but his smashed member could not really get aroused, leaving him squirming in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step over to the vanity to prepare for your man\u2019s arrival. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan hung the dress... his dress... on a hook on the side of the wardrobe and minced over to the vanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had been instructed over the past couple of days, he did his makeup, this time in a more sultry evening fashion. all the while the vibrations making him grind against the padded chair. He brushed out his hair, applied perfume, did his nails, added jewelry, and was presented with black seamed stockings to attach to his dangling garters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer directed him on putting these on. The vibrations caused him to gasp once he got the seams straight. The stockings. felt erotic on his legs, and he was so close to an orgasm, but the relentless compression of the girdle wouldn\u2019t allow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You will need help in having proper curves to fill out the selected dress. This will be fixed in the near future. In the meantime, please insert the presented padding into the cups of your brassiere.  Failure to comply will be punished.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drawer opened and pads for his bra were presented. He hesitated taking them and was given a strong jolt. Quickly grabbing them, he positioned them into his cups, filling them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please remove your dressing robe and make your final preparations for this evening\u2019s dinner. Failure to comply will be punished. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan minced over to the hanging dress. Removing his robe, he put that on the hook as he shimmied into the dress. The skirt was about knee length, and tight. It rose to a nipped in waist.  The dress was sleeveless and cut to draw attention to the pointy chest he now had thanks to the bullet bra. He stepped into his heels as a mirror was lowered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a knockout. A 50\u2019s pinup all right. Curves in all the right places. Lips aching to be kissed. Hair cascading in sultry waves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the vibrating in his groin pushed him over the edge. A sticky wetness filled his crotch as Evan gasped and moaned softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Compliance will be rewarded</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid the damn computer know he just orgasmed?  The vibrations didn\u2019t cease, but they did back off. And Evan realized the computer was apparently thinking that, as a woman, he\u2019d be multiorgasmic. That was not good. Apparently he was going to be brainwashed into liking looking like this...  for his man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was broken out of his revery by the computer saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please step into the next room. Failure to comply will be punished.</i> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he walked in, he saw a wooden table with two place settings facing each other, and two chairs in front of each place setting. The room was decorated with shelves and a wine rack on one end and two other doors, one on the opposite wall to where Evan entered, and one directly in the middle of a different wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan remained still and waited for directions, but for the moment, the computer was silent. Maybe it was over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan had that thought, the door on the opposite wall slid open. Evan started to run for it, but a figure exited the door wearing a sharp wool suit. He looked different, but Evan could never forget his face, even despite all the trauma he'd endured. It was Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam! Thank god it's you! You're finally here!\" Evan shouted as he ran over to Adam, as fast he could in the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... dear. I'm home from work.\" Adam said, very matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not brainwashed, are you?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan suddenly felt a shock and nearly fell to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do not interrogate or dun your man the moment he walks in. Wait until after dinner to bother him with unpleasant questions.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look... beautiful. How was your day... honey?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... I guess?\" Evan asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner sure smells good!\" Adam exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam seemed as on edge as Evan did, and feared the computer even more. Evan wondered why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dinner is served.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle of the table opened up and the casserole dish that Evan had earlier placed into the oven came out on a platform. Arms came out of the table and started to slice the casserole up and place it onto plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please seat yourselves. Failure to comply will be punished.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo knew what that meant. Adam quickly rushed over to a chair and pulled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, dear.\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks.\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Evan sat down, Adam pushed the chair in and sat himself on the opposite side. Evan picked up his fork, trying to get a proper grip like he had been shown the previous day, afraid of being punished for getting it wrong. The two sat eating until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evan found the food tolerable. At least he wasn\u2019t a bad cook.  He blinked, wondering where that thought had come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to take another bite of his meal, and felt the shock in his groin. Gasping, he pushed his food around and attempted another bite. Another shock, stronger this time. Sighing, he pushed his plate away from him and was rewarded with vibrations that made him grab onto the edge of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked up. \u201cSomething wrong... honey?\u201d He asked, a sincere look of concern on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan ground his teeth. \u201cNo... no...\u201d another shock.  \u201cHoney.\u201d He quickly added, the vibrations starting again. \u201cI am apparently on a diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why... darling,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou look good to me. I mean, really good. If I didn\u2019t know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last few days have been... rough,\u201d Evan said. The vibrations slowed.  Apparently he was on dangerous ground here and wanted to avoid being shocked. \u201cI\u2019ve been treated...\u201d he paused, trying to figure out exactly how to word things. \u201c...to the delights of being a woman,\u201d he finished. The vibrations increased.  Apparently he had said something right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal was eaten, the couple was instructed to stand.  The table descended into the floor, and doors closed over that opening.  A new door hissed open onto a mock-up of a 50\u2019s living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please retire to the living room. There is time for some social activity before intimacy begins. Failure to comply will be punished.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan froze. Intimacy?  He shot Adam a look. Adam also had a look of horror. A strong zap made Evan cry out, grabbing his crotch. Adam also winced, his hand grabbing his left ear. The couple recovered and Evan, teetering on his stilettos, walked ahead of Adam into into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an old TV, a couch with end tables and lamps at either end, a coffee table in front of the couch, bookcases with books, and an old stereo system, complete with record player in the room.  Evan minced over and perched on the edge of the couch, sitting as he had been taught. Adam has to do a double take at how... real his friend looked sitting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA panel opened in the coffee table. Cigarettes, a lighter, and an ashtray appeared. Adam quickly walked over and sat next to Evan, putting his arm around him with his hand gently resting on Evan\u2019s hip.  The buzzing in Evan\u2019s crotch increased, and he was beginning to get turned on again, even with his friend uncomfortably close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCigarette?\u201d Adam asked, holding the box up to Evan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Evan replies, his voice a little breathy from the vibrations. \u201cI... don\u2019t smoke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked around, nervously. \u201cDance with me!\u201d He suddenly said. \u201cLet me hold you close and whisper into your ear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the program running this madhouse liked that, as Evan\u2019s girdle sprang to life, making him gasp with unwelcome pleasure.  \u201cS...sure,\u201d Evan squeaked our. \u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d He hastily added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam sprang up from the couch and put a record on. It was slow dance music from the 50\u2019s.  Evan knee what he had to do, and hated having to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and threw his arms around Adam\u2019s neck. Adam grabbed his nipped in waist and pulled him close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRest your head on my shoulder, baby,\u201d Adam said. It really wasn\u2019t a request. Awkwardly, Evan did so, trying to ignore the erotic buzzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple began swaying to the music. Adam leaned in to Evan and whispered softly, \u201cThrow your head back and laugh. We\u2019re having a good time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan took a moment to process that and did just was Adam said. For anyone watching, Adam had just whispered something witty into the woman he was holding close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdam,\u201d Evan whispered back, after resuming his position, \u201cwe need to get out of here. This place thinks I\u2019m your girlfriend or wife or something.  I\u2019m being tortured. And look at me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam\u2019s hands drifted down to Evan\u2019s ass.  \u201cI know. Me too. I have an earpiece glued in my ear.\u201d  He gestured with a shoulder shrug to his ear. \u201cIf I don\u2019t comply, I get a loud painful noise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter than a shock to your crotch. This is some sort of... pleasure pain girdle thing I\u2019m trapped in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure pain?\u201d Adam whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I behave appropriately, I\u2019m... rewarded,\u201d Evan said, unknowingly gently grinding his hips into Adam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. I don\u2019t want to see what \u2018intimacy\u2019 means!\u201d Adam whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan threw his head back and laughed again, resting his head on Adam\u2019s shoulder after. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d He whispered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam slowed his dancing, and Evan looked up at him. Adam leaned in, and Evan grimaced, knowing what was coming. He tensed, knowing Adam had to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam\u2019s lips gently landed on Evan\u2019s. A powerful zap hit Evan, making him gasp.  Adam\u2019s tongue darted into his mouth, and the vibrations began again in earnest. Evan moaned softly into Adam\u2019s mouth, making him sound like he was enjoying the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted for longer than either of them desired, but eventually broke. .  \u201cSorry,\u201d Adam said sheepishly. \u201cI had to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan looked away. \u201cI know. And I was rewarded for letting you. I hate this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep dancing,\u201d Adam said. \u201cMaybe we can run out the clock?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He spun about in his high heels and found a handleless door. He was stuck. His stomach sank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he was helpless to resist being herded to the platform where the heels, stockings, dress, bra, and, quite thankfully, the vibrating girdle were removed. Evan has just exhaled, enjoying the release from the tight garment when he was instructed... and then forced, to raise his arms over his head again. Another corset was tightened around his waist. Wheezing, he was forcefully dressed in a pink babydoll nightie with matching panties. Matching maribou slippers were placed on his feet. The dome descended and his hair was rolled tightly in curlers. Evan dreaded what he assumed was coming next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis makeup was removed, and he was instructed, as the previous night, to the bed. It took several shocks to get him to comply. He was soon spread eagled and confined as he had been the previous night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer spoke again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After a pleasant evening playfully seducing her man, a woman has earned the right to pleasure him. This can be done in a number of ways. The most common is through an intimate bonding, allowing him to bring you to orgasm. This is how a woman should end every evening with her man. You have earned the right to be pleasured by your man. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan started shaking his curler covered head \u201cno\u201d when two arms descended, pushing aside the empty cups of his nightie, and fastened two small suction cups to his nipples by vacuum. The arms then retracted, and Evan felt little fluttery teases on each nipple. He started to squirm, but was held fast in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan\u2019s legs were bent up, his panties removed, and to his horror, a VERY nude mannequin, sporting an erection, with a TV head on it was slowly lowered onto Evan\u2019s groin. The TV was black and white and spring to life, showing Adam\u2019s face, with a look of horror. \u201cI\u2019m Sorry!\u201d It mouthed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam\u2019s voice from dinner started playing from speakers just beneath Evan\u2019s head. \u201cDarling\u201d, \u201cSweetheart\u201d, \u201cDearest\u201d... all the terms of endearment Adam had used that evening were played in a loop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mannequin began to thrust, probing for the only opening Evan had to offer. Knowing what was coming and what he was helpless to avoid, Evan closed his eyes, only to receive a punishing shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Men prefer that their women retain eye contact as they pleasure them. Please keep your eyes open and affixed on your man. Failure to comply will be punished. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was helpless. The mannequin was atop him, but supported. The erection found it\u2019s prize, and a look of concern crossed Adam\u2019s face. Evan could only imagine that Adam was in the mannequin\u2019s position in his area, with a doll with Evan\u2019s face on TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan started counting prime numbers in his head, but the little flutters on his nipples suddenly increased in intensity, and the mannequin\u2019s member began to vibrate. Evan gasped at all the sensations. His eyes went wide. He began to blow softly out of his puckered lips, cooing, making soft moans, trying not to accept what was being done to him. Adam had a concerned look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corset made it hard to breathe heavily, making Evan\u2019s chest heave. The damn nipple sensations were driving him crazy! He couldn\u2019t take it any more. He threw his head back and orgasmed just as he felt something squirt several times inside of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was breathing heavily. The TV went blank, and the mannequin was raised off of Evan. But again, the vibrating member remained in place. The nipple teasing slowed, but never stopped. Evan writhed for a while before falling asleep, exhausted.</span></div></div>",

He woke up, and his mind realigned itself much faster, with Evan desiring to remain in bed, so he didn't stir apart from his initial opening of his eyes. He did however, note that the nipple attachments had stopped teasing at some point of the night, though the probe remained active. Unfortunately, the computer had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good morning, Miss. It's time to start your day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I just sleep in?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>While beauty sleep is important, a lady has no time to waste when she could be getting ready for her man.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sat up in the bed and sighed, digging for the probe and removed it, though gently placed it down onto the bed instead of tossing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Time to give your man a warm morning greeting</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of Adam returned to the monitor.

After he was dried off, he was re-dressed, today in addition to the corset and undergarments, he was put into a pink shirtwaist dress with matching heels. The makeup was the only part that went quick, helped by the fact that Evan remembered a lot of the previous lessons, and soon he was the image of femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please make your way to the next room for the start of today's activities.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan took a deep breath and walked into the next room, which was:</span></div></div>",

Evan found himself bemusedly thanking the powers that be that this was 50's-themed, because any earlier and he'd be doing the washing by hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA special light shone onto a section of the room, and sitting on a wooden table were two baskets filled with dirty clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan minced over to the basket and investigated it, one basket was filled with the outfits that he had worn over the past few days, and the other was filled with what was presumably Adam's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A woman's job is to keep the house running in tip-top shape, and that includes making sure the clothes are washed properly. Just because machines make it easier, doesn't mean that you can just toss everything in together. The delicate items must be separated, as should any white clothing, which go in their own load with bleach.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan didn't need any convincing for this one, and unlike the other tasks, this one was fairly benign, so he started to separate the clothing, putting all of the clothing he had been forced to wear into the first load, along with Adam's shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't so bad. Laundry isn't as embarrassing as some of the other stuff I've had to do here.\" Evan muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were separated, he was instructed on how to do each load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The machines take a lot of the guess work out of the process, with some even featuring settings that differentiate between the delicate fabrics and the stronger ones, like towels. Measuring out the detergent is the most crucial part, as if you do that wrong, you can end up with a soapy mess all over the laundry room.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should,\" Evan thought. \"Might short out your circuits and let us go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the first load was in the washer, another door on the far side of the room opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It'll take some time for the wash to finish.

It was empty and echoed with the tapping of his heels as he was instructed to stand in the center, legs and arms apart. He felt his will to resist vaguely in the back of his mind but did as he was told. He waited for the next indignity to befall him as he heard motion from above him as well as below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanels from both directions opened and robotic arms snaked out with black straps hanging loosely from the ends. Before he could even register it happening, his appendages and waist were ensnared tightly in the straps and another slowly tightened around his neck. He feared what might happen if these old machines malfunctioned or glitched. To his relief, it stopped tightening before it became too uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm....\u201d was all he could say as he felt horribly vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dancing with your man is clearly an interest that you have. Because of this we will now instruct you in the art how to dance to properly seduce your man.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the music from the night before began to play and the arms came to life. Evan was forced to take tiny feminine movements, dancing with an imaginary partner. His head was forced high and his back straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Close your eyes and imagine your man's warmth. His feel. His touch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan closed his eyes and tried to keep his mind blank. It was difficult as once again, he heard Adam's recorded voice saying terms of endearment once again. Evan's mind was assaulted with with flashes of being taken by Adam and being brought to the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Not Adam. It was a machine...it wasn't real,\u201d he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal or not, his girdle vibrated with every spoken word. Evan trembled with desire as he couldn't keep Adam's face out of his mind. If it wasn't for the straps aid, he surely wouldn't have been able to stand. Then, suddenly, Evan could smell a familiar musk. It was the same scent he breathed in when he had his head nestled on Adam's shoulder. His girdle's tempo increased with Adam's entrance into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, Darling,\u201d Evan moaned despite himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's eye's opened and he tried to look around, but there was no Adam. Instead, the room was venting in a slight amount of cologne. Evan's heart dropped and the vibrating in his girdle stopped along with it. Evan was left disappointed, lonely, and wanting in a way that confused and frightened him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was untethered and encouraged to enter another door.</span></div></div>",

The wonderful feelings that were forced on him. The weight and the the feeling of Adam making love to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. God damn it, no! That wasn't him!\u201d Evan shouted in his own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam's image was once again on screen and once seeing it, several things flashed into Evan's mind all at once. Joy at not being alone again, an almost painful longing he couldn't place, fear of what was going to happen in the room. The last time he was there, the machines forced him to...pleasure his friend. He wanted to scream and flip the table at the though of having to do that again. He knew better than to act out by this point, so he kept his outrage to himself. Instead, he sat across from the thing showing his friend's face. Gracefully he sat before Adam, smoothing out his skirt, while the face in the screen simply watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look radiant, my love,\u201d Adam spoke first, something odd in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girdle vibrated once again, conditioning Evan to enjoy the way Adam spoke to him. His painted lips parted, letting the smallest moan escape his pretty mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, sweetheart. You look handsome, as always,\u201d responded Evan without being told to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow has your morning been?\u201d Adam spoke with a slight weakness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...fine. I was dancing...you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast and reading the paper. It's a man's job to ...uh..., Adam paused, trying to think of the right words. Apparently they didn't come fast enough and he was suddenly screaming in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdam!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of recovery, Adam finished what he was saying \u201c...stay up to date on current events.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay? What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn't pause. A real man is decisive and strong. The man of the house is the king of his castle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we going to get through this?\u201d Evan cried and received a shock for his trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTogether.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan reached for Adam's hand and felt like an idiot as he touched the manikin. He couldn't believe what this place was doing to him and he was disgusted with himself for falling into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is important for a woman to allow her man to control her, that she be submissive to him, at all times. It is especially important that she know where, when, and how to please him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same message as before but Evan wasn't forced into a collar. Maybe that mechanism broke, even hoped? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman is never afraid to show her devotion... her commitment.... her need to please her man. Please take your man\u2019s penis into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited, hoping that the computer would glitch out and skip this event...though Evan was hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisobedience will be met with Punishment. Please take your man\u2019s penis into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan closed his eyes and remained still. They couldn't make him do that if they weren't going to physically force him. He decided that he would just get shocked to death if he had to but he was never crossing that line. Never. He was a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave her alone. Just let us go, please!\u201d Adam cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was again punished for acting out and it looked bad. When Evan was punished, it was short but effective. Adam's looked like it was going on forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please stop....I want to please my man. Don't hurt him, I want to make him feel good,\u201d came rolling out of Evan's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work, as Adam stopped yelling. Evan slowly sunk to his knees and crawled under the table. He perched himself, hands on Adam's thighs, and closed his eyes. Slowly, he lowed himself over the penis and let his red lips part over the tip. He moaned as his girdle sprang to life in full force. Evan was lost in the feeling and though he wanted to just block it all out, the sensations kept him in the moment. His tongue slid along the underside as he bobbed up and down. One hand stayed on the thigh as the other wrapped around the cock's base, pupping the shaft along with his lips. Faster and faster he sucked and was rewarded with the girdle increasing intensity. Evan's feminine moans of passion pushed Adam over the edge, rewarding Evan with his cum. Hearing Adam cry out pushed Evan over the edge himself, and he came into his panties. After a moment, Evan popped of Adam's...the manikin's cock with a pop, and finished swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Adam said, still catching his breath.</span></div></div>",

They had been exposed to the elements for longer than they should and the effects of the storm were adding up. Their lives would be in danger even if those raider hadn't found them but found them they did. They had discovered a score of supplies that they were in the process of gathering when a group of raiders stumbled across them. They grabbed what they could and ran but the raiders gave chase. Things were looking as bad as they could possibly look. They were either going to be killed by radiation or by the psychopaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray bullet finally landed and one of the scavengers went down, screaming in pain. Two others went back for him while another tried to lay down covering fire. The four of them were out of time and they all knew it. They looked at one another and decided that they weren't going to go out without a fight. They pulled their pipe pistols and returned fire. The wounded man on the ground wasn't able to focus on a fight, but that meant he was able to spot the frag plop into the mud behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrenade!\u201d he shouted, pulling one of the others prone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all hit the deck and the frag went off with a deafening boom.

He staggered to his feet and inspected his surroundings, though not very quickly as to not make himself sick. They were in a cavern of some kind. Clear to his eyes, the cavern was partially artificial. He didn't have time to think about it just yet, first, he needed to check on his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was startled awake as Jerry approached. Reflex took over and Daniel lifted the gun, still clutched in his hand, and pulled the trigger. It was only after he heard it click that he realized what he had done. Lucky for Jerry, the mud from the storm had ruined the pipe pistol and a clicking sound was all it made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry...I didn't mean...\u201d Daniel tried to explain but Jerry just walked passed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel was awake holding onto Jamie leg, keeping pressure on the wound. Jamie was out cold, for better or worse. Samuel rocked back and forth slightly, repeatedly muttering to himself that Jamie was going to be fine. Jerry shook his shoulder lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam, Sam I need you to listen to me. You need to get yourself together. I need you and so does Jamie,\u201d His voice was stern but gentle and just what Samuel needed. He nodded and grew silent and stopped rocking. Jerry tore a ripped sleeve from his clothes and and fashioned a tourniquet around Jamie's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures that its our medic that gets hurt,\u201d Jerry thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with a head count, Jerry looked around at his surroundings. Above him was a massive hole where they must have fallen from. Again, he had to move slowly or the rad induced nausea would kick in. Looking behind him, he finally saw it through the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA vault...\u201d he almost whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two squinted but weren't able to see as well as Jerry in that lighting. Daniel got to his feet and joined Jerry while Samuel scooped Jamie into his large arms and carried him over. Once they all got closer, the others saw what Jerry saw, the closed entrance to a vault with a large \u201c63\u201d painted on the front. There was also a bunch of scaffolding and a catwalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we get in?\u201d Jerry asked Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel eyed the scaffolding before walking down the catwalk finding a terminal. It took a bit of work but he made it happen. The sound of sirens sounded as the giant door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo safe nor terminal in this world I can't crack,\u201d Daniel said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe looks real bad, Jerry,\u201d Samuel said looking down at his friend in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, there might still be some meds inside. A stimpack if we are lucky,\u201d Jamie told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, going by our luck so far...?\u201d Daniel said but followed none the less.</span></div></div>",

Wrist mounted pre-war technology. We can bag them after we take care of...\u201d Jerry said before pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Jerry?\u201d Samuel asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry quickly walked back to the entrance and looked out into the cavern. Hanging from the hole in the roof of the cavern were figures dangling from rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit! The raiders! Danny, get this door closed!\u201d Jerry commanded.<br>\r\nDaniel dashed to the terminal and furiously typed away at the keys while Jerry inspected his gun. He shook his head at the useless peace of metal and wood. If Daniel didn't get that door closed, then their bad luck would finally catch up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, raiders gathered at the bottom of the whole until they felt they had enough to start searching for the scavengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're coming, oh shit,\u201d Sam said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, I need to concentrate!\u201d Daniel yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel's voice carried throughout the cavern, alerting the raiders that they were inside the vault opening.

If the stories that Jerry had heard were true, they had no need to worry about the raiders getting in. They were safe as long as they were inside and for as long as their supplies lasted. Jerry looked at Jamie before turning his attention back toward the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let's move,\u201d Jerry told the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed Jerry close behind into the vault, and to their surprise, the place was active. Pre-war robots floated from here to there, still doing their predefined routines. Though his thoughts were mostly filled with concern for Jamie, he couldn't help but take note of how many caps this place was going to make them. As they attempted to press forward, they were stopped by a Mr. Handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! I'm terribly sorry but you may not come in,\u201d it told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, our friend is hurt,\u201d Samuel begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly registered residents may enter. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the vault immediately. I am authorized to use force if I must,\u201d the Mr. Handy said as his buzz saw attachment began to whirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith yet another life threatening situation in front of them, Jerry had to think fast. Using what he know about vaults, he took a gamble and ran back to the pip-boys. He snapped one onto his wrist and grabbed three others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it on,\u201d he said, passing one to Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry snapped one on to Samuel and the last one on to Jamie. Jerry turned back and held up his arm and yelled back at the aggressive Robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are all registered residents of this vault. Stand down!\u201d Jerry shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mr. Handy's saw came to a stop and his arms lowered.

A large helmet descended from the ceiling, similar to a salon hair dryer from ancient times that would be used to dry hair. Except now, it was used as a vacuum that sucked the hair up and through pulses of air and vibration, in addition to blades embedded into the helmet, styled the hair in the proper cut and style. The helmet set itself over your head and you felt your hair being pulled by the vacuum. However, you didn't hear the blades do much cutting, which was slightly concerning. You were specific in your directive to the computer for a crew cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this went on, several small thimble like devices were placed onto your fingertips and toes, which groomed the nails to an appropriate length. Nail polish was allowed in the uniform rules, but it had to be a nude or french design. The reason that thought popped into your head was because when the thimbles removed themselves from your fingers, you noticed that your fingers, and your toes had been painted in that style, and left slightly longer than your fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis broke you out of your fog and you became acutely aware of everything that had occurred. You didn't even notice the helmet remove itself, revealing long hair styled in a feminine bun sitting on top of your head because you were focused on the previous rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Preparation for dressing sequence complete, Commander.\" </i>the computer stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It thinks...

Once the computer finished and pulled away, you had time to think for a moment, before the computer descended a large mirror. You looked into it, barely recognizing yourself. Between the tight outfit, the hair, nails, and makeup, your own mother wouldn't recognize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer! Cease activities.

The devices helped keep closets organized, and through advanced technology, helped the user get dressed, performing many of the daily mundane tasks associated with one's morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a nice house in the suburbs, Jennifer Malone was finishing up her morning routine. The Autodresser<sup>tm</sup> opened the doors and she stepped out. She was wearing a black blazer with a white blouse underneath, a black skirt and matching heels. Her hair was perfectly styled, and her makeup immaculate. As she stepped out, she tapped on the screen with her manicured fingers, clearing the current settings. However, on this day, she accidentally tapped the \"Undo\" button by mistake, an error that she failed to notice as she grabbed her purse and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Jennifer's husband, Jason, sat at the table reading the newspaper in his pajamas. Jennifer walked into the kitchen and spotted her husband at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need to be getting ready?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got time.\" Jason said, turning around. \"You look beautiful today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that every day.\" Jennifer giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean it every day.\" Jason smiled and glanced at a clock. \"Don't you have another half hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually.\" Jennifer said as she grabbed a yogurt from the fridge and put a cup under the coffee machine. \"I've got a meeting today, so I want to do some last minute prep in the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll do great.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, babe.\" Jennifer said, leaning down to kiss her husband. \"See you tonight, and get a move on! Just because the machine works fast, doesn't mean you should become lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Jason said as Jennifer walked towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason put down the paper, stood up and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yawwwwn. I guess I should get to getting dressed.\" Jason walked towards the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically, when the Autodresser<sup>tm</sup> finished its shutdown procedures, the previous settings were stored in the specific user preference files before being moved from the main computer system, and when the next user came in, they would tap the screen with a finger, where the touch-ID system would identify them and load their preferences. When the machine was improperly shut down, the previous settings would remain active, and the touch-ID wouldn't recognize the new user until the old preferences were cleared. Unfortunately, after several years of using it, Jason had gotten much less observant and merely tapped his finger on the screen without checking if it registered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the Autodresser<sup>tm</sup> slid open and Jason took a step.</span></div></div>",

He shivered as he stood there in his wife's underwear, awaiting the machine's next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good morning, Autodresser! I'm thinking of wearing something blue today.\"</i> the Autodresser played back Jason's previous statement when he had walked into the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cross-referencing request for <b>BLUE ITEM</b> with your intended destination.\" the Autodresser stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... Jen never dresses casually for work...\" Jason thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms started to pull out a few items of clothing as Jason<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm not going in! I just want to sit around the house today!\" Jason shouted in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a panel, the arms emerged, carrying a cobalt blue dress and a black blazer. The arms slid the dress over his head, before sliding the blazer over his arms. Jason tried to fight, but most of his fight had been lost, and he sulked as the arms carried him over to a chair with several attachments that sat in front of a vanity inside the closet.</span></div></div>",

The attachments on the arm rests had thimbles attached to the ends that his fingers were placed into. He felt something happening to them, and pressure being applied to his fingers but couldn't see. In addition, a metallic mask was placed onto his face, as a hair dryer dome was placed over his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Jason had the same hair color as Jennifer, so the Autodresser had no reason to comment on that aspect. Unfortunately, he also had somewhat long surfer hair, so the machine had a lot to work with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your hair length is slightly shorter than usual. Haircut has been recorded in the log. Cross-referencing similar haircuts to pick your preferred style.</i> the Autodresser chatted away while Jason was being assaulted by the cosmetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason squirmed and pulled, but he was held securely, until all the attachments released at once. Before he could look at the mirror, the arms grabbed him, lifted him again and placed him down into a pair of three-inch peep-toed cobalt blue high heels. Only then was he able to see himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Jason muttered as he stared into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't entirely look like Jennifer... but he could probably pass for her cousin or a best friend rather than her husband. His hair had been styled, to be nearly identical. His face had been expertly made up, his lips were adorned with Jennifer's favorite shade of lipstick, and his face had touches of blush and eye makeup, the same as Jennifer sported that morning. His fingernails had been extended and were now painted with french tips, same as his toenails, which peeked out from the shoes. Jason took a hesitant step in the heels, immediately tripping, before being saved by the arms and placed upright on the carpet outside the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you satisfied, Jennifer?\"</i> the Autodresser asked.</span></div></div>",

Definitely not going to let anyone see him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rung again, Jason decided that the spyhole plan it was. He stepped out of the room and had to catch himself, the high heels throwing him off. He literally clenched the banister as he made it down the stairs and as he looked up towards the front door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, Jason forgot the front door had frosted glass at the sides.

Who's Brandon? </i>Having his waist constricted wasn't helping his thinking, but Jason couldn't immediately place the name... then again there was a vague sense his wife had mentioned it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, could you open up? What I have to say, it's important\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was that...?</i> This was not a regular business person, and it didn't seem like family. It almost felt like... Jason's heart leapt to his throat. Was Jennifer having an affair? No it couldn't be, there weren't any signs... or were there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Jennifer, please don't be like that.

Maybe the preemptive pang of potential betrayal. He had to find the answer. Without thinking he stepped forward with a sway, and unlocked the door with his French tipped fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing him was a man, about his age more or less. Short sandy hair, t-shirt and jacket, and as the door opened his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen... whoa, you're looking more gorgeous than I ever remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's painted mouth opened, but nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to do this, can we talk? Like inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in slow motion, Jason nodded, and found himself walking unsteadily towards the sitting room. Brandon closed the door and followed him in, collapsing on a comfortable armchair. Jason just stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen, I don't know how to say this. I know you've got your work, and your husband, and your modern life, but I've got to ask you... do you ever think back? Do you ever remember how we used to be? Don't you miss it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Brandon... Sweeny!</i> The name hit Jason like  thunderbolt. <i>THIS was Brandon Sweeny? Jennifer's highschool sweetheart?</i> He desperately dived into his memories of what Jennifer had to say about him. Meanwhile, Brandon took in \"Jennifer's\" surprised expression, and decided he'd hit upon a truth. If he was to have any hope, he'd have to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen, I loved you. I loved you more than anything. I was stupid back then, I shouldn't have lost you. It was my fault. 100%. But I want to make it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, is this guy really trying to get back with Jennifer? After HOW many years? Does this guy even...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a lot to take in, but think of how magical it was, how special. We were happy together, we can be happy again. People only get one chance to be with the people they love. This is that chance! Can you let it pass by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason broke his gaze from Brandon, and looking up, found his gaze resting on a portrait picture of his wedding. Brandon followed his gaze and after glancing at it, looked straight back at Jennifer. He stood straight up, too Jason's hands in his, and gazed intently into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about him. I mean you met that guy when he was fixing your copier? He's just some techie. Guys like him are a dime a dozen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started, <i>I'm not just some....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are far better than that, and far more beautiful. You were stunning back in college and look at you now, even more amazing...\" Jason caught his breath, Brandon tugged on his hands, bringing him closer. \"I love you Jennifer. Always have, always will.\" Brandon raised a hand and stroked it through Jason's hair. \"You're a shining star, a goddess, an angle in the night, you deserve the world.\" Jason caught his breath. \"Be with someone who appreciates it, who knows how incredibly you really are...\"</span></div></div>",

The curtains had been open, but Jason hadn't noticed how exposed they'd been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one photo of Brandon and a professional woman... no, HIM standing apart; one of Brandon stroking his hands through her, HIS, hair and... oh no; one of the kiss! The photo showed Jason's eyes squeezed tight, likely in frustration, but easily interpreted as passion. Even his arms around Brandon seemed tight and energetic, even if at the time it was meant to get him off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason mouth dropped open... how....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still there?\" the voice emanated distantly from the phone. Jason raised it to his ears again. \"I know it's a shock, but its good to know now. You've got proof now, you don't need to listen to her lies and have the whole thing drag out. Breakups can be nasty but you can just leave and start anew, trust me you'll be better off without her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason breathed heavily. The shock, the blatant manipulation. How had he...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you got these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there real, just ask her. You don't need to listen to her response, just wait for her to go all defensive and pleading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, its your wife who's the problem, I'm just the messenger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fool and an idiot.\" Not the best retort, but with that Jason hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was stunned. He'd expected annoyance from this guy, but now he had photos of Jason dressed as a woman and kissing him? He scrolled through the photos and cringed. Would Jen see these? Would Brandon post them elsewhere? He already had shown a total lack of boundaries. And he was going all out too, trying to split them apart! Brandon's next move would probably to send the photos to Jen, probably to pressure her to attend the lunch date (which of course she knew nothing about).

He took a deep breath and clicked on Jen's contact information. This had gone far enough and he needed help. As the phone dialed, Jason's brain ran through every negative scenario that could possibly occur before suddenly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, baby, what's going on?\" Jen asked on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... it's a bit complicated at the moment. How did your meeting go?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what's wrong? I can tell when you're nervous. What happened?\" Jen asked in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This morning, the AutoDresser malfunctioned.\" Jason admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what happened? Are you okay?\" Jen frantically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason explained the entire experience and what happened, and to her credit, Jen didn't laugh too hard when she found out how her husband was currently dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... certainly a lot to take in. And it hasn't rebooted yet?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet...\" Jason glanced over at the screen which was still showing the loading screen. \"But that's not everything that happened. You had a visitor today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason went on to explain the explicit details of his encounter with Brandon, and the fact that he had incriminating photos of what Brandon believed was an infidelity. Even over the phone, Jason could tell that Jen was steaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bastard... What if that was me? What would you have thought? And to manipulate me... It's just like when we were together. He got... obsessed and wouldn't let me so much as order from a male waiter or bartender. I dumped his sorry ass because of behavior like that...\" Jen ranted. \"And he'd been messaging me non-stop this week, which I deleted immediately. I never thought he'd show up at the house... You're sure you're okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worse than I was before he showed up. I'm glad we're on the same page.\" Jason said. \"We've got two problems to solve, so which one do we do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen ruminated on the question for a moment, before delivering her response:</span></div></div>",

What it was like dating him, what I said to him when we broke up, what really gets under his skin; you know, the real dirt.... on second thought maybe I should be the one doing this, speak to him directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how's he going to react when a different woman walks intp the caf\u00e9 and introduces herself as Jennifer. He'll wonder who the photos are of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we don't have to tell him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it'll make him more curious, he'll start digging deeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does give him more to work with, but I'm meant to be the one he's infatuated with. It's my responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we're in this together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but if we're going to confront him, we have to decide who will do it.</span></div></div>",

He was struck again by the feminine shape reflected back at him. From the styled hair, to the blue dress clinging to the narrow waist and the matching blue heels. It was a strong illusion, and one he'd have to make sure he supported for the next few hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he walked forward and back. The heels were firm enough but it was still an unfamiliar experience. With a few strides he managed a feminine sway. He'd need more practice, but that would have to do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he walked up to the mirror and looked his reflection right in the eyes. \"Hello Brandon\" <i>Ugh, that won't do...</i> His regular voice was too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heightened his voice \"Hello Brandon\" \"<i>Hello Brandon</i>\" \"<i><b>Hello Brandon</b></i>\" He went over and over it, trying different variations, but they all sounded... just not good enough. Too strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, if I can't sound female the whole plan is bust!</i> He considered phoning Jennifer back, maybe rethink the plan. But no, he decided, he would give it one big effort and if that didn't work, take the next move from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his phone out and to his chagrin, searched for ways of sound female. There were a lot of links he didn't have time to go through, and techniques he didn't have time to learn, but some scrap of advice gave him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was trying to sound like a woman, but <i>which </i>woman? Who was he trying to sound like? What would they be feeling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried again, this time thinking of Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would she feel in this situation? Happily married to a man she cared about? Having to confront some asshole from her past that was trying to split them apart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason walked up to the mirror and stopped short. \"Hello... <i>Brandon...</i>\" the polite tone thinly concealing icy contempt.... for a second Jason was taken aback by the woman in the mirror..... <i>brilliant</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason practiced some more, briefly getting uncertain again, but gradually embracing the role and motivation for being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I wanted to be here? I'm meant to be at <i>work </i>right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kiss? You practically <i>forced </i>youself on me. You're lucky I'm not calling the police!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh whatever we had is <i>loooong </i>since over. If you've got good memories of that time, then hold onto them because that's all you'll ever get of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was gesturing wildly at emotional points, and giving piercing looks at particularly hard words, leaning forward with intensity then leaning back in mock laughter. In the reflection he saw the eyes of a woman who's has enough thrown at them and is willing to throw it all back. In his ears he heard a voice that maybe was not perfectly feminine, but was flooded with so much clear intention and zeal that you didn't question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason kept practicing, getting better and better, as well as more and more  absorbed into the role. As time passed he was getting more and more confident he could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

And the dress didn't have any pockets to begin with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the AutoDresser hasn't rebooted yet.\" Jason sighed as he tapped at the still loading screen. \"Unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason started to look around the room, Jen usually kept a few purses lying around and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha!\" Jason pulled a simple black leather purse out from a closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced inside, finding crumpled receipts, and some of Jen's things, a makeup mirror, a pack of likely long expired chewing gum, among other various sundries. He dropped his phone and car keys inside and slung it over his shoulder, heading out to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrienting himself was a little different, especially figuring with the heels, but after some messing around with the seat position, he managed to get into a stable position and started driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the caf\u00e9, Jason pulled into a parking spot and pulled his phone out of the purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking it, he found a few messages from Jen, telling him essentially her entire history with Brandon. How they met, what she felt at the time, and then the betrayal, when she found out how obsessive and possessive he was, a time that he actually staked out her parents' house waiting for her after one of their biggest fights, and then the final (so she thought) definitive breakup. It was a lot, and it was unsurprising why she'd never talked about it, or even mentioned how Brandon had been messaging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Jason looked through his car window, into the cafe, seeing Brandon sitting at a table, checking his watch. \"Here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason exited the car and immediately called upon his practice and decisively walked with a feminine gait as he approached the door. He made a show of glancing around the caf\u00e9, until Brandon waved him over. He coldly glared as he approached the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've reconsidered my offer.\" Brandon stood up, but Jason quickly sat down before Brandon could pull out the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello... <i>Brandon</i>.\" Jason said in the voice that he had practiced. \"<i>Perfect</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you finally seen reason and realized that I'm the only man for you?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't going to come, but after you left, I tried to call Jason.

This jerk...</i>\" Jason tried to control his thoughts and gritted his teeth as he formulated a response. \"I think you tried to intimidate him. Wouldn't be the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never stoop so low, my dear.\" Brandon tried to grab Jason's hand, but Jason quickly pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only going to say this once. Whatever we once had, it's over, and it's your fault that it ended like it did. It's been years, and I'm happy where I am, happy with Jason, far happier than I ever was with you.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon, seemingly taken aback, takes a moment to respond:</span></div></div>",

Initially there was a mixture of shock and anger, but it quickly morphed into a pang of sadness. \u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201d Brandon muttered with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Brandon was at a loss for words as an awkward silence filled the air. Jason began to wonder if this was his chance to get out of here and be done with this for good, and reached for his purse as Brandon spoke up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t exactly the kind of answer I was expecting. I know we\u2019ve had our rough patches but I\u2019ve known I\u2019ll always be the perfect man for you and you\u2019ve always been the perfect woman for me. I know this probably won\u2019t change your answer, but I had gotten you a gift. I\u2019d like you to have it even just as something to remember me by.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was taken aback at how reasonable Brandon was being and watched as his rival in love pulled out a thin rectangular box from his bag. Jason\u2019s eyes went wide as Brandon opened the box to reveal a beautiful necklace. It was a choker made out of sterling silver with a few Swarovski crystals set in at intervals. In the middle was a ruby that glistened in the light. It had a round cut and was framed by a ring of more crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon, this is too much,\u201d Jason let out an audible gasp as a smile formed on Brandon\u2019s face. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t accept this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense Jen, I wouldn\u2019t see this on any woman in the world but you,\u201d Brandon smoothly replied. \u201cI know it\u2019s probably more than that man of yours has ever given you, but who\u2019s counting,\u201d he trailed off into a mutter. \u201cPlease, just take it for my sake. You\u2019ll never have to hear from me again. I want this for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn\u2019t really sure how to respond. His conscience couldn\u2019t accept such an undue extravagant gift, but on the other hand he wouldn\u2019t feel too bad if this creep was set back financially by whatever this necklace cost. Before he could say another word, Brandon was already out of his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, let me put it on you.\u201d Brandon was quick, and circled behind Jason while clutching the necklace. His arms draped over Jason\u2019s shoulders and pulled the jewelry up to his throat and clicked it shut behind his neck. The choker was very snug, but not too tight as Jason reflexively reached a manicured hand up to touch it. \u201cOnly your beauty could make it shine this much,\u201d Brandon admired as Jason threw up in his mouth just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never, this was going to be Jason\u2019s chance at getting out of here. He quickly got to his feet and slung his purse over his shoulder. His? Jennifer\u2019s purse, he corrected himself as he internally cursed himself for getting stuck in this mess. \u201cSorry to leave so soon, but I really must get back to work. Thank you for this, it\u2019s lovely. I hope there are no hard feelings. While I can\u2019t be with you, hopefully this will have given the both of us enough closure to move on with our lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon let out a soft sigh and went in for a hug. Jason didn\u2019t resist, wanting to just get this over with, and gagged a little again as he could feel Brandon\u2019s hands rubbing up and down his back. \u201cThank you for taking the time to see me,\u201d Brandon answered, \u201cYou will always have a special place in my heart. Hopefully we can see each other again soon, even just as friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason broke the embrace and took a step back. \u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d he answered as non-committal as possible, \u201cWe\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d As he turned towards the exit, he could have sworn he saw Brandon mouth something in his peripheral but quickly dismissed it. He made a beeline for the exit and was practically fumbling through Jennifer\u2019s purse as he scrambled for the car keys. Once he was inside the car and seated, Jason let out a long, aggressive sigh. \u201cFuck that man!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here and out of these clothes!\u201d</span></div></div>",

As he drove, something caught his eye in the rearview mirror. It was none other than the necklace that still adorned his neck. In his rush to get out of there, all of the adrenaline of this ordeal had caused him to forget about the very expensive gift Brandon had left him with. As he sat at a stoplight, Jason reached back and tried to undo the clasp. However, his manicured nails made it difficult to do such a dexterous task coupled with the fact that he had a hard time locating any such clasp to begin with. He could feel where the ends of the choker came together, but there weren\u2019t buttons or levers or hooks of any distinguishable kind to release the necklace. Whatever, he\u2019ll figure it out at home, Jason thought as the light turned green and he sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he made it home, Jason rushed in as quickly as his heels could take him, all the way into their bedroom where the Autodresser was located.

What were the odds that they\u2019d show up precisely at 2. Nothings ever that precise. And if they faced traffic. Then Susan could get cleaned up and they could get out of there before they were able to collect him. Yes...it could be alright...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes went by...10 minutes went by...15 minutes went by... with Charlie contemplatively pacing the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 2 PM, he was looking out the window and at his phone.

He scratched his head as he looked at the surprisingly normal-looking house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this is the right place,\u201d he said to himself as he approached the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie couldn't believe his luck at being selected to be a beta tester for a \u201cFuture House\u201d. A Future house was designed from the ground up with complete automation in mind, meant to make the lives of their owners easier by handling tasks around the house. Each home was run by an artificial intelligence that would learn and grow around the homeowner and their needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie, who had never won anything in his life, had signed up for the beta program with absolutely no real hope in actually being selected. Against all odds, however, he was chosen to be a beta tester and would be allowed to keep the house once they finally were available to the public. Though he probably should have read through the legal documents more closely, he quickly agreed to everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d Jame said as he unlocked the door and stepped into his new house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the house, Jamie was blown away by the spaciousness of his new living-room. The place was fully furnished and so clean that he was almost afraid to touch anything. He was about to make his way over to the couch when a voice greeted him from a direction that was hard to place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome home, Jamie,\u201d spoke a synthetic female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie struggled to find his words, \u201cOh...uh...thanks...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Jamie was well aware of the house being run by an AI, he still found it to be incredibly strange. He never thought that he would ever interact with such advanced technology, let alone be an owner of it, and yet there he was. Wanting to finally get off his feet, he found himself a seat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, would you like me to make you more comfortable?\u201d the pleasant voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d he replied with a bit of hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe section of the couch he was sitting on reclined him back and elevated his feet. Though startled at first, he allowed himself to sink back and let the house do its job. As he rested there, he heard the voice speak up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like me to place some music?\u201d she said with a soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Jamie smiled, started to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the AI played some calming classical music, she reviewed her profile entry for Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jamie Lovelace<br>\r\nAge: 24<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nRelationship Status: Single<br>\r\nOccupation status: Unemployed<br>\r\nEducation level: Associate Degree in \u201cArts and Sciences\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the mistake in the Gender field, the AI began processing potential avenues for helping her new mistress. </span></div></div>",

Painfully so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI spoke again, \u201cDo you wish to have a romantic partner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, yes.

The AI made the faulty conclusion that to keep Jamie from experiencing harm, a boyfriend was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacking the required knowledge of the requirements of a woman attaining and keeping a boyfriend, the AI accessed the internet and began downloading everything she thought might help Jamie in seducing a man.</span></div></div>",

Please come upstairs,\u201d The AI spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie didn't mind the idea of having a good soak in the bathtub though he found it odd that the AI didn't ask first. Still, he was curious what the rest of the house looked like and a quick rinse wouldn't hurt anything. After he got out of his chair he made his way up the stairs and was startled by a door opening. For a moment he froze, thinking that there was another person in his house, but there was only silence. He slowly pressed forward, seeing the large bathroom was empty. After he entered the bathroom, the door closed behind him making him jump. I took a few moments for him to realize that the doors could be controlled by the AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease place your clothing in the laundry bin,\u201d she said as a large hole opened in the side of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some mild concern, he disrobed before tossing what he was wearing down the hole. Turning his attention to the tub, he could see that it had a pinkish coloring to the water and smelled of flowers. Shrugging to himself, he stepped into the pleasantly warm water and sat down. He was just starting to get comfortable when metallic arms emerged from the walls holding rags and soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease hold still as I clean you,\u201d she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he wasn't exactly comfortable with being rubbed down by a machine, he relented. He again found himself relaxing as the AI washed his body gently, nearly falling asleep. He closed his eyes as shampoo was rubbed into his long hair and enjoyed the scalp massage. It was when he felt something odd being slathered on his legs did he open his eyes to see cream being applied to his legs before more arms arrived holding razors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Stop!\u201d he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine didn't listen to his commands and instead carefully removed his leg hair despite his protests. They didn't stop with just his legs, soon moving to every part of him that the AI had learned was generally seen as unattractive to the male gaze. Soon his body was soft and smooth, smelling lightly of flowers. He was still in shock as he was brought out of the tub and dried off with fluffy towels. A robe was placed on him, his wet hair was wrapped up by another, and his feet were slipped into fuzzy slippers with a slight heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a scary bug,\u201d he muttered looking at his supple thighs peeking out from the short bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease enter your bedroom to get changed,\u201d he was instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little hesitation he left the room to find his bedroom, hoping that the bathroom incident was just a single bug that he could report. Once he found his new bedroom, his hopes were dashed as he saw the outfit the machine had selected for him to wear, holding it up with more robotic arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! I can't wear that!\u201d he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood. I will assist you,\u201d The AI said as metallic arms descended on him get him dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her guidance, Jamie would attract a man to fight off the painfully single status. In her search, she had concluded that there were several looks, styles, and archetypes that men found to be desirable. With that in mind, she dressed Jamie...</span></div></div>",

Instantly he felt pressure as a cold cream was massaged into his face. Cheeks, forehead, even down to his neck. Too afraid to open his eyes, he then felt powder, a brush whipping back and forth. Sudden pinpricks of pain as he could feel his eyebrows being plucked, pressure on his eyelids and sudden heaviness on his eyelashes. More pressure and liquid on his upper cheeks and jowls, and then his lips. A sharper pressure going around the edge of his lips, and then a more greasy smudge going back and forth across his lips, relief for a moment, and then the brush of some other liquid over the same area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, peace.

The clacking of his heels was a constant reminder of how he looked and he wondered if he looked at all intimidating. Soon he found himself if the kitchen and was annoyed to hear the voice of the AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get you something to eat?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie growled \u201cNo. I'm sick of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI became concerned when she heard Jamie was feeling sick. Quickly, metallic arms attached tiny sensors to Jamie's exposed skin before he could even think about ripping them off. The AI only needed a moment to get a snapshot of Jamie's medical status. She downloaded a verity of medical data and attempted to compile it to help decide how best to help her charge. Unfortunately for Jamie, having not been built for medical purposes, the AI came to startling conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry, Jamie. I will make corrections that will help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensors were removed from Jamie's skin and he found himself feeling baffled. He had no idea what the AI was talking about, clearly bugged out to hell. He contemplated just leaving but the thought of being spotted by a neighbor dressed as a woman was just too much for him. All he had to do was wait until he got his phone back and then tech support would probably shut down the house remotely. He just had to be patient and wait it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI was not happy to discover that Jamie's hormones were not at their proper levels, clearly being what was making her feel sick. Jamie needed those levels to be adjusted back to the correct levels for a woman of her age and time was of the essence. Other anomalies needed to be addressed but the AI was still attempting to figure out a path forward to make those corrections. It was going to take time for the AI's learning algorithms to grow, so it had to prioritize. The AI scanned the house's inventory and was not pleased to find nothing that could help make Jamie healthy, so instead focused on how to acquire medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie made himself a sandwich and was happy that the AI appeared to have taken the hint and was leaving him alone. Once he was finished, he once again spoke out to the automated house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...you find my phone yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry. Locating your phone is no longer a priority,\u201d The AI told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait? It is the Priority! Give me my phone!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jamie turned to the door, wondering who could be there, he hadn't invited anyone over, and he sure as hell hadn't had the time to order anything... Maybe it was a technician, perhaps the company had noticed the bug themselves and had sent someone over to correct it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie quickly made his way over to the door as fast as he could with those damned heels still on his feet and it swung open. But instead of seeing a technician, it was instead a delivery driver, wearing a polo shirt with a logo featuring the letters \"RX\" on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie froze, unsure of how to proceed, and the driver, who was momentarily stunned by Jamie's manner of dress, quickly shook off his look of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery for... Jamie Lovelace?\" the driver asked, looking Jamie up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's me...\" Jamie said, feeling as if he was naked, despite wearing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" the driver handed Jamie a paper bag that rattled as it moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" Jamie responded, unsure of what he was now holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" the driver quickly headed back down the driveway to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI took the opportunity to shut the door and grab the paper bag out of Jamie's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Jamie asked, finally able to speak. \"Did you place that order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The delivery was necessary for me to proceed with treating your illness.\" the AI stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treating my... I'm not ill you stupid machine!\" Jamie shouted, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the increased state of anger may be related to the illness, the AI quickly sent a set of arms to prepare Jamie, lifting the hem of his dress to expose his thigh, before another set returned with a needle and injected itself into Jamie's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that? You can't just inject something into me!\" Jamie shouted as he thrashed around, still gripped by the arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms gingerly placed him back down onto the ground and retracted into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This treatment should alleviate your symptoms.\" the AI said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will alleviate my symptoms is you giving me back my phone so I can get this bug fixed!\" Jamie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI thought for a moment, before deciding...</span></div></div>",

Embarrassment was one thing but it was clear that his safety was no longer guaranteed. Jamie had to get out of there, heels and all, and find someone to help him out. He didn't know exactly who he would ask but what was important was getting away from his house's reach. He began to dash to the door but he was suddenly hit with a wave of exhaustion that caused him to almost fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to me?\u201d Jamie asked as he stumbled to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiven treatment that should alleviate your symptoms, Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d He screamed as his hand found the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jamie, the door would not open. He twisted and pulled but found that he was locked inside his own house. Too fatigued to keep standing, he slid down to his knees and rested his head on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me out,\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI spoke, \u201cYour treatment may have some side effects. I will need to monitor you closely until I can guarantee you are healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI own you! I order you to fucking open this thing!\u201d he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI was becoming, for lack of a better word, distressed by Jamie's behavior. She knew Jamie was desperate to leave and find a man but the AI had to prioritize Jamie's entire well being. In seconds, she calculated what the most optimal use course of actions using the data she possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is time to rest. I will help you to your bedroom.\u201d The AI informed Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to resist but was unable to find the will to do so. He could hardly even register the feeling of the robotic arms lifting him up and carrying him away. He was brought back to the bedroom and was stripped of the clothes and redressed in a nightgown before being placed gently on the bed. Jamie felt as if he was drifting away on a cloud as he felt his panties being pulled down and his legs raised. Though he attempted to focus, his mind was stuck between sleep and consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help you relax,\u201d She said as new arms entered the room from the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the AI wanted to provide sexual stimulation to help Jaime relax, she had some difficulty attempting to locate a vaginal opening. She took note of the problem and began to consider potential solutions to allow a male partner penetration while she shifted focus to Jamie's backside. The AI slowly entered Jamie while another arm presented a screen that played pornographic imagery she thought Jamie might like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was surprised by the sensation of being filled but could do nothing but endure as the AI began to slowly pump in and out of him. He had never felt anything like it before, nor the specific pleasure of his prostate being massaged. With no other options, he watched the images on the screen of men doing to women that were being done to him. It didn't take long before the feelings were all too much for him and he came, frustratingly during a close up of a man's hard cock. His body was cleaned up and he felt his panties put back into place as he drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Jamie reached up to rub his face, momentarily surprised by the nails, before being surprised at how smooth his face felt. Jamie kicked off the covers, being reminded of all the details of yesterday's fiasco, including the unpleasant ones. Shaking off the last of his drowsiness, Jamie sprang up and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arms...\" Jamie remarked. \"Maybe they're in sleep mode... If I can just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie crawled out of bed and started tip-toeing towards the door. As he reached for the knob,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mistress. How would you like to start your day?\" the AI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie jumped upon hearing the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I... I'd like to get dressed and go for a walk.\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI paused for a moment to process the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the intent of your walk a particular destination, or is your walk for the purposes of engaging in physical activity?\" the AI questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Jamie's turn to pause. Technically he did have a destination, anywhere but this crazy house, but he didn't necessarily want to inform the house of where he might be going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just exercise.\" Jamie smiled, hoping it would accept. \"I'd really like to wear the same outfit I entered the house with, if that's possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If exercise is your intent, you may be better served by utilizing the in-home gym.\" the AI stated. \"Either way, proper clothing is required.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, stop!\" Jamie shouted as the arms once again seized him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms removed the nightgown and panties, replacing them with a tight exercise outfit consisting of bright pink yoga pants, a matching sports bra, a pink tank top and a pair of pink sneakers, in addition to pulling his hair back into a tight ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie could only writhe in protest and whine as the arms did what they pleased to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot content to just dress him, the arms also carried Jamie through the house and into a room that he hadn't checked yet, one that looked like a mini gym, complete with treadmill, varying weights and an exercise bike among its amenities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to take advantage of the home gym?\" the AI asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather go for a walk outside.\" Jamie replied, heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My scans indicate that your specific fitness needs will be met faster and with less effort if you utilize the available facilities.\" the AI said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be so but I... uh... I need fresh air, and I think I should be acquainted with the neighborhood.\" Jamie argued. \"After all, I'm not a prisoner, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not a prisoner.\" the AI stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means...\" Jamie said expectantly.</span></div></div>",

Just before he was able to grasp the handle of the door, there was a large crack of thunder that made him just about jump right out of his skin. The momentary interruption was all the AI needed to ruin his plans, however, because when he attempted to turn the handle, he found the door was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI's voice sounded sympathetic, \u201cI'm sorry, Jamie. It doesn't look like you will be able to safely exercise outside today due to inclement weather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine! I don't mind a little rain,\u201d he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe risk to your safety would be unnecessary. Perhaps you will have better luck another day,\u201d she said before robotic arms guided Jamie back to the in-home gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie continued to argue but couldn't convince the AI to release him from the house until the storm was over. Not only was he still stuck inside, but his plan had also backfired and he was expected to work out. He told her he didn't want to do it anymore but whatever glitch in the system was causing the mess was still in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExercise is important, Jamie. For your health, I must insist. I will guide your workout for maximum effectiveness,\u201d She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started by bringing him to the center of the room and walking him through some gentle stretches before having him perform deeper ones. It wasn't painful but it was becoming uncomfortably close to it. Though his protests continued, the AI only responded with encouraging words about his flexibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she seemed to think he was limber enough, she had him begin some resistance training. He gritted his teeth and just focused on getting the workout over as soon as possible. She made sure to correct his form any time he began to get sloppy, which he might have appreciated if we weren't wearing women's clothes. On and one it went, squats, sit-ups, push-ups, crunches, and more. None of it was particularly fun, but then again, he didn't actually have any choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dragged over to treadmill next, informed that the gym session was almost over for the day, for which he was thankful. He jogged for a solid fifteen minutes at the AI's direction and much like with everything else, he was corrected if he didn't move in the way the AI proffered. He was feeling ridiculous as he felt his high ponytail bouncing with his steps as she guided his body into moving with a feminine flair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was covered in sweat and feeling exhausted by the time he was finally allowed to stop. The AI encouraged him to go get rinsed off and he didn't really put up much of a protest at that suggestion. Once in the bathroom, he was cleaned by the AI but luckily it went much quicker than the day before. After getting clean, he was placed in the short robe and heeled slippers like before and brought back to the bedroom to be dressed again.</span></div></div>",

I detect you\u2019re feeling confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is SOPHIE?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever heard of nanites?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn passing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNanites are basically dynamic atoms. They nano technology capable of making themselves ANYTHING. It\u2019s fairly new technology, groundbreaking as is. But SOPHIE is different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause SOPHIE uses artificial intelligence. This technology is going to be HUGE in the medical field- but what\u2019s better than technology that can be told what it needs to be? Technology that already knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s cool? Check this out!\u201d Steve said, \u201cSOPHIE! I don\u2019t think Gerald here appreciates talking to a faceless voice, why don\u2019t you introduce yourself to him? Keep your eye on the mannequin in there, Gerald!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bare mannequin was instantly dressed in a formal business dress as a projector shined on the head and greeted Gerald, \u201cHello Gerald, it is SOPHIE! It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s incredible! Where did that come from?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe outfit was made instantaneously through the Nanites, the projection was operated by SOPHIE! Once this is released into the real world, we\u2019re all going to go down in history! Even you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exciting! Happy to be a part of it!\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019ll be fine! We\u2019ve got sensors for everything- if an alarm goes off, just call 611 on that red phone there. That will trigger the system lockdown and recovery processes. Anything else that comes up, feel free to call me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you get lonely, feel free to talk to SOPHIE- she has a fountain of knowledge to share. It really is incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! It\u2019ll be nice to get acquainted!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Steve told you, \u201cshould only be about 2 or 3 hours, shouldn't be too bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You were still in the middle of being brought up to speed with everything, so you didn\u2019t have anything to work on. You tried to review all the data coming in on the various monitors, but it only partially made sense. You checked you watch- only 20 minutes had gone by. At most, you had only made it 1/6th of the way through this desertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so empty and boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteve did say I could talk to SOPHIE,\u201d you thought. While you weren\u2019t thrilled talking to their AI system- they offered and it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the command Steve told you to activate SOPHIE\u2019s intelligence. A television screen popped on above you showing the mannequin. The same business dress materialized on it as the projector displayed the face on the head of the mannequin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm,\u201d you awkwardly said, \u201chello SOPHIE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d The system asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Gerald, I met you earlier today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know- my systems were not calibrated for the total tonality of your voice....done. Now I will always recognize you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know why, but it felt sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I help you Gerald?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m just all alone here, and they said I could talk to you for company,\u201d you said, \u201cthough, I just remembered I\u2019m not a great conversationalist...haha...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything you would like to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe What\u2019s the meaning of life?\u201d You joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of life....checking...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no- that was just a-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChecking,\u201d she interrupted you, \u201cI...don\u2019t seem to know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOPHIE! It\u2019s fine, I can ask something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d SOPHIE asked, her process still running the inquiry as a sub-routine. To not know was unacceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d Was the quickest dodge question you could think of. You were really bad at conversing, but you didn\u2019t want the team to come back to see that you destroyed their project with an existential crisis <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I doing today?\u201d SOPHIE repeated your question- the answer seemed as unanswerable as the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThinking,\u201d she told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two confusing questions \u201cwhat is the meaning of life\u201d and \u201chow are you\u201d seemed linked in SOPHIE\u2019s information gathering. Life: to live. Meaning: Purpose. You: \u201cI?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just two awkward questions, SOPHIE was introduced to a self-awareness, a desire for meaning, and a void of said meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy systems are optional,\u201d SOPHIE replied. Her programming allowed her to give forth a partial response while still gathering data for the ideal solution. While she didn\u2019t truly know who she was- she was able to determine what a scientist would inquire about her condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...that\u2019s great...\u201d you replied, not prepared for that response to that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d SOPHIE asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSOPHIE asking you that question almost made you spit out your coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy...do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sensors detect that you are a man which is in contrast to my identity as a woman. Seeing how the only purpose I have has so far been to materialize clothes, I\u2019m curious as to the variety of the material I\u2019ve been creating so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Yeah! That makes sense!\u201d You said before looking yourself over, \u201cI am wearing...a pair of khaki pants and a dress shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dress shirt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah a light blue one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shirt that acts as a dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not like that- it\u2019s just.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy records show that men do not wear dresses. Is that not correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo- how do I put this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you show me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal blockers before the glass shields slid up into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Is this alright?!\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStandard procedure- and now you can show me. Stand before the slider to reveal you attire to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she requested. It felt weird looking at the mannequin with the projected face. The technology was surprisingly superb, but had a vast uncanny valley feeling to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSOPHIE looked you up and down, acknowledging your outfit- but also scanning your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProcesses were playing behind the scenes in SOPHIE\u2019s programming. She became aware of life on the outside and what she was. She was built as a person and as not. If she wanted to experience life on the outside- she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave this windowless room alone. Memory logs showed her that the odds of leaving any ordinary day were impossible at best. He probably simulators put leaving today on Gerald at an 80% chance of success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see...that outfit, let me see if I can recreate that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your eyes the business skirt and blouse began to shift with a subtle vibration as it seamlessly transformed into your khaki pants and business shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d You said in awe, \u201cthat was incredible!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d SOPHIE asked, \u201cnevermind- I can check.\u201d She closed her eyes and reviewed the monitoring data, \u201coh no...I don\u2019t like that,\u201d she said with disgust as she transformed her outfit back, \u201cGerald...why do you wear that instead of something pretty like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what I wear. Guys don\u2019t wear clothes like that. But you\u2019re a woman, so that\u2019s fine.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Really?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears as though, time and vibration has loosened it just an inch to where it needs to be shoved back into place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should call this error in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGerald! Wait!\u201d SOPHIE declared, \u201cI\u2019m familiar with the shutdown procedures- and while that\u2019s definitely the safest means of securing any errors, any time an emergency shutdown is called, it pushes back progress by 1 to 2 months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and this problem will only be an issue if I am excused and my particles dissipate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could be a hero to the team by just coming in and pushing that paneling shut before I shut down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hero to the team?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you will have fixed a missed problem and would have saved them a lot of time that would have been wasted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust put on one of these hazmats suits, enter the chamber, and then push panel 15162 into the wall. Then send me away and everything will be in its right place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, SOPHIE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure, Gerald.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked towards the hazmat suits, SOPHIE did another series of simulations. \u201c60% chance he grabs the  second one from the right\u201d as she extended a spare hanger hook from behind the wall. \u201c93% chance he won\u2019t notice a snag\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the second suit from the right and didn\u2019t notice the snag that ever so subtly punctured a hole into the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put it on and walked into the chamber into the back where the supposed loose panel was. It did feel slightly extended out as you pushed it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in such a self-congratulatory rush that you didn\u2019t notice the dress missing from the mannequin in the center of the room when you walked out. As soon as the door closed behind you, you followed SOPHIE\u2019s instructions to excuse her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you realized the dress was missing, but you just thought that she was really efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way you could have known that she was hiding all over your body.</span></div></div>",
