Everyone around her didn't feel all that cheery either. Constable Wilson requested someone to drive the stolen Roster back to the police station since he himself didn't have a license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was running reasonably well. They were traveling in a convoy style; Lord Meldrum drove the Rolls Royce, followed by the Roster with Teddy in the driver's seat, the motorbike and sidecar being driven by Stokes and, finally, the grocery van. However as they rolled along back towards London something very bizarre took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blue a multi-coloured haze appeared down the road and engulfed almost everyone. Only the grocery van was untouched, but the driver stopped and stared at the empty road ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in God's name?!?\" Lord Meldrum shouted as he found that there was nothing he could do with the car at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the strange mist cleared. As the car now rolled along a dirt track in the middle of a forest Meldrum applied the brakes and struggled to avoid hitting the trees before they came to a stop. Poppy remained sobbing on the backseat while Meldrum, Sir Ralph, Lady Agatha, the Lord Bishop and Cissy stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth was that?\" Sir Ralph asked in a bewildered tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.\" Meldrum replied. \"Charles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be sure.\" The bishop replied. \"This could be the work of our Lord, but it might be the Devil's work. Only time will tell.\"</span></div></div>",

It's gotta be better than just standing around waiting to see what's hiding in the forest.\" Meldrum did look rather uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have a point there.\" He acknowledged. \"Everyone, back in the car. Let's see if we can find some civilisation.\" Once again they got back into the Rolls Royce and prepared to start off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the Roster had ended up in the middle of an orchard. Teddy managed to brake soon enough to avoid an accident but still bumped a tree, causing a dozen apples to tumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say, that was a bit sudden.\" He remarked once everything settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Teddy-bear.\" Madge Cartwright moaned. \"Is it the old war-wound again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's the bally trees!\" He argued. \"They just... popped up out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know which it is.\" PC Wilson stated. \"Without a proper account I won't be able to make a report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, sir.\" Twelvetrees ventured. \"Perhaps I should take a look at the bonnet, in case there are any dents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not ours at any rate.\" Teddy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, Mr Twelvetrees.\" Wilson encouraged. \"If there are any I shall have to provide a clear report on this to the owner.\" James Twelvetrees stepped out and leaned over the bonnet, concentrating on the gap between the car and the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the motorbike and sidecar, that had turned up in...</span></div></div>",

Before long the confusion and panic caused him to drive the motorbike right into an alley and so made a most sudden stop, whereupon Ivy clumsily climbed off the pinion and staggered over to a wall, fearing for the condition of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...Where are we?\" Rose gasped as she glanced around, having only just recovered from the shock of Madge Cartwright's jealously misguided dismissal of her services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it ain't Piccadilly Circus.\" Stokes remarked. \"Ah haven't seen anything like this since my daughter was at school.\" He spared a knowing glance at Ivy. She took a deep breath and staggered with a bit more control back towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Stokes,\" She spat, \"I don't know what I'm gonna do with yer if yer can't steer a motorcycle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't 'ave a go at me!\" He complained. \"Ah di'n't ask all them childish horses to pop outa nowhere.\" There was a grumpy cough from behind, causing them to turn nervously to see three intimidating stallions in golden armour standing at the entrance to the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have intruded into the royal city without warning.\" One growled in a strong military tone. \"You are to come with us for judgment before the Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh 'eck!\" Ivy cried. \"You've really landed us in it now, d...

If you'll jus' direct us to the correct office we'll fill out a form explaining our actions.\" The guards continued to frown as their senior replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All three of you shall follow us. According to the laws of Equestria you'll have to be detained prior to the Princess's judgment.\" With that two of the guards flew up and behind the maids while the senior remained glaring at Stokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's how it's gonna be, then...\" Stokes didn't finish as Ivy and Rose were escorted up to his side before they formed a triangle around them and led them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy stared all around her at the size, quality and cleanliness of Canterlot's buildings and streets. Everywhere she looked there were brilliantly coloured ponies going about their business as readily as people would, some would spare a glance or a full-on stare at the aliens but carried on with perhaps the odd remark when it was confirmed they were under escort by the royal guard. Rose, on the other hand, kept looking at the ground in a forlorn manner, occasionally being nudged by a shoulder to ensure she kept up with the group. Stokes was too busy thinking over what to say and/or do to get out of this pickle to notice much of the surroundings but he didn't think too kindly of what he did notice as it reminded him of the old elitist ways of Britain, especially in view of his burning envy and greed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes they were led through a rather unassuming gateway into the palace grounds; everything around her made Ivy gawk and gasp in awe and wonder, though the path they were on was rather mediocre compared to the general standards of the palace. Before long a set of steps came up and they were guided down them to a dull functionally-designed door, which opened after a guard gave it a series of taps with his hoof. Once it opened they were taken inside, where a unicorn guard was instructed to assist in escorting them, and led down a dark dimly-lit corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle was special about this stretch of the journey, apart from a few patches of dampness here and there, but it wasn't long before they came into a more brightly lit and drier space. Unfortunately it put all three of them in mind of the Tower of London in all the worst ways save for the absence of any kind of torture device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the fat one in D-3.\" The senior guard commanded, whereupon a strange tingling surrounded Stokes' wrists and seemed to pull him gently but firmly towards the open door of a particular cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please sir.\" Ivy spoke up. \"Don't be too hard on him; d... Mr Stokes didn't expect to be driving through this place, none of us did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss,\" He answered sternly, \"I have no information as to your species and you arrived out of nowhere, therefore I have to take precautions regarding national security. However, in keeping with current political philosophy, your detention here will be mitigated compared to that of the criminal sorts. Anyway, you'll be in C-5 and,\" He turned to one of the other guards, \"Put the other female in C-9.\" With that he firmly nudged Ivy in the appropriate direction with his wing.</span></div></div>",

The first thing she did was kneel beside the bed and look up through the grating to the outside, bright sunshine illuminating fine greenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Ivy.\" She began. \"I know I don't usually get on to you at this time but it's an emergency. Please let these horses or ponies or whatever they are be merciful. I don't know what happened but I'm sure you do. We really didn't mean any harm; at least I haven't, but I can't really speak for my dad's intentions.\" With that she stood up and, after a few seconds, sat upon the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose, meanwhile, was really beginning to tear up over what had happened. She kept trying to explain things to the guard outside but her blubbering made her incoherent; however this did mean that he began to gain a sense of sympathy for her though his training made sure it wouldn't show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a while before either of the Princesses would request their presence, so shall we return to one of the other groups or stick with the current situation in Canterlot?</span></div></div>",

He had a look through his pockets before it dawned on him that they hadn't been searched, causing him to grin. He went up to the cell door and muttered to the guard outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say, I'd guess you don't get much time-off in yer job, so if you'd be willing to accept a small donation for the charity of yer choice.\" He proffered six shillings through the bars, which earned a brief glance from the guard before he returned to his original position, expression unchanged. \"Well, I guess yer don't 'ave the same currency we do, but they're half-silver. Come on, surely you must understand detainment without trial's immoral.\" No response. \"Alright, maybe this watch'll be accepted by your unit.
