A world of many races who shared these lands, though rarely in peace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the decades, many different outlooks and interpretations of this Time have been made, each belonging to its own Unique World.

Then before you begin, some background information.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough originally a Kull Antagonist, he was chosen over Thoth-Amon and proved to be a very capable counterpoint to Conan, with their wildly differing outlooks on life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Conan was one who believed in the Strength and Will of the Individual, Thulsa Doom saw people as  being weak-willed and easily shepherded for the most part, with not many truly strong, and himself as their shepherd.  His Strength derived from his legions of followers, all willing to serve him, and Die in his service.  All controlled by himself at his Stronghold, the Mountain of Power, a series of caverns and tunnels either formed naturally or dug out to serve as his Base of Operations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful Shamanic Sorcerer, with the ability to transform himself from Human to Snake at will was suggested in the movie, though its Novelisation indicated that he was a Serpent-Man (a human/snake hybrid) who could become a full snake if needed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the deviation from the Source Material it is in fact, quite possible, that he is simply one who has taken the Name of Thulsa Doom, making it his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, where this story might begin, and when, is to be decided.  </span></div></div>",

Slitted eyes running past his elongated snout to look from one end of the carnivorous hall to the other, where dozens of his devoted were lost to the haze of their own base desires - aided by the pungent smoke of the incense that rose and twisted their way throughout.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the entrances and exits were sealed, save for his own behind him that only he could permit passage through, the steaming cauldrons full of food set and waiting to fill the stomachs of those in attendance, pitchers of the finest wines ready to be drained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rare event, a very rare event, for Thulsa Doom to participate in this.  But with events firmly in his favour, he had allowed himself this night of indulgence, to allow himself some personal good time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main reason perhaps, why the black boots that rose to just below his knees, with the Eye of the Serpent set securely around his neck, comprised the entirety of his choice of attire here, the robe, waistband, headdress, and forearm guards set to the side as one leg rose to rest over the armrest, his scaled penis full of blood and tapping his abdomen, his forked purple tongue flicking out to taste the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his right, next to his booted foot, lay the Princess Yasmina.  Trapped in her own induced stupor and blind to the going-ons right next to her, which was fine by the Snake Lord.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily turning his head to look at her, for a human, she was a fine specimen.  Firm full breasts with more than good teats, slim, healthy enough for his liking.  In fact, the only question that bothered him, and even then not by much, was would he have his \u2018meal\u2019 right now, and then worry about having some personal entertainment either here or in his quarters?  Or would he prefer to have the fun now, and then eat?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions\u2026</div></span></div></div>",

The Primary Antagonist of the Animated Series on account of being the Primary Focus of Conan's Quest for Vengeance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Origin was a fairly odd one, beginning his life as an Ordinary Gila Monster who was kept as a Sniffer by the Army of Set.  Later, his immediate predecessor, Ram-Amon ran out of patience with Dregs (a Naga) whose perpetual incompetence and failure led him to use the Black Ring to reform Wrath-Amon from a lizard to a humanoid lizardman to serve as a far more capable Right-Hand 'Man', sparing no attribute in his creation.  It worked.  Too well.  Less than an hour later and Wrath-Amon had deposed him, claiming the Black Ring as his own, becoming the Chief Servant and Cleric of Set, gaining his name and a new almost-human form with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where might you begin his story?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>At the Beginning</b> - Perhaps something else occurred to him after his creation?  And even if not then, he was busy during the 200+ years before the Series itself actually began.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sometime in the Series</b> - Something may have happened that altered his course, or perhaps something that wasn't looked at.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Series End</b> - While he was reverted back into a humble lizard at the end, it might have only been temporary.

That could have a serious effect on what follows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Did not get the Black Ring</b>:  This would mean that he did not claim the Black Ring of Set, thus Ram-Amon remains High Priest, and Wrath-Amon must answer to him.  How would be cope in such an outcome?  What tasks would be be given to him?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Intervening Years</b>:  While the Series focused on one portion of his time, he had lived for over 200 years (made possible by the Black Ring).

In this battle, the Black Ring was prised from him, and combined with the Amulet of Vathelos, he was first forced back into a Lizardman, and then finally back to the mere lizard that he'd began his life as.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will you do here?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill someone have seen reason to bring him back?  If so, for what purpose?  How would the Former Chief Servant take this, most likely being on the Bottom Rung of the Ladder with far less chance of making his way back up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps he was able to escape.  Flee the Pyramid and restart his life elsewhere.  But with being forced to remain in Lizardman form as the most probable scenario here, how would he get by in the World?  One where his (one of a) kind is despised and the knowledge of all he had done by a select few who may be inclined to spread the word?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he might not have failed at all, he could have reversed his collapsing fortunes for a massive turnaround victory, snatched from the very jaws of his defeat.
