I walked into my office seeing files of public complaints on my desk against a remote area in one of the Tutelian states,my secretary sat at her desk typing memos and response to the compliants while I went through the files on my table,the government requested for a meeting woth me concerning the bringing of peace into Tutelia but as I have been warned before,the authoritative government cannot be trusted in anyway so I have to be extra cautious so as not to harm myself and the people I fight for,in a way,I am a hero,because I am a freedom fighter who works for a non-governmental organisation,this is seen as the beginning of peace by the Tutelian people who were not educated,the economy situation was so bad that the schools had to close down because there was no way for the government to be at war and at the same time support the sector,I rose from my desk and put on my suit,getting ready to meet with the government to discuss a new dawn for the Tutelian people.</span></div></div>",
