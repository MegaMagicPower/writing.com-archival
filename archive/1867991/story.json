The weather is absolutely gorgeous for you and your wife to spend outside. Because of your size, people fear you, but it doesn't matter because what are they going to do; you're a giant and there are two of you. Anyway, how do you want to spend the day?

Instead, they keep rebuilding their homes and you keep destroying them. When will they learn that a pair of married 500-foot tall giants need their space? Not that you mind plowing through them. It is good to occasionally reassert your dominance after all. Normally, you would take time out to cause as much destruction as possible, but there is always time for that later. <br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of walking through towns and countryside, you finally get to the Oceanside Beach.

This makes for a crowded ocean, thus more fun for the two of you. <br>\r\nThe best incentive, however, is the line of yachts on the horizon. They each seemed to have sails of different colors, loud engines, and fully-manned crews. To you, this could only mean one thing.<br>\r\n\"It looks like we stumbled on a race,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Let's give them a reason to race,\" Giselle said.<br>\r\nThe mere thought of all the mayhem you will cause between the racers and the swimmers in between is enough to make you hard.<br>\r\n\"Easy, Igor,\" she said. \"Save some of that for later.\"<br>\r\n\"How about we make this interesting?\" you ask. \"The first one out there gets the first pick of toys to do whatever they want with them.\"<br>\r\n\"You're on,\" she said. \"You're going down.\"<br>\r\nWith that, both of you hit the water at the same time. Your footfalls cause many of the slower swimmers to be caught under your feet, pushed under, and sunk deep into the sand. Even the faster reactors were caught in the wakes caused by the two of you, drifting into deeper water.<br>\r\nEvidently, the yachters saw the two of you coming for them. They promptly started their engines and tried to run for it. Despite this, the waves that were being created were starting to toss them like toys.<br>\r\nBetween all of this, you weren't even paying attention to who was winning your race. You notice soon enough, though.</span></div></div>",

Looking back, you see that she is about two steps behind you. You can't help but smirk at her.<br>\r\n\"Winner!\" you exclaim to her.<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she said, \"but at least I'm not the loser.\"<br>\r\nYou look at the yachts where she is pointing. You only laugh maniacally as you see that some of them have already capsized with some of the people trying to swim away in all directions. This only makes your erection harder as it bobs on the surface of the water. You look even closer and are pleased that it is not a complete sausage party. In fact, the proportion works in your favor. You can see that Giselle, now having caught up, is not entirely pleased with this development.<br>\r\n\"A deal is a deal,\" you remind her as you start plucking up bikini-clad women. First, you plucked from the swimmers, a relatively easy task. Then, you make the rounds of the standing boats. Once you pluck the women from them, you break up the boats in various ways: by lifting slightly and splitting them by hand, by lifting up a leg and slamming it down, even one or two by ramming your cock in them but not yet exploding. Once you were sure that you had all of them, you placed them on your cock.<br>\r\n\"Alright, ladies,\" you say commandingly, \"start rubbing or die trying.\"<br>\r\nAs the ladies start to rub (though the effort seems feeble at your size), you look over at Giselle, plucking up the leftovers. You see that she is merely crushing them one by one, clearly in a fit of jealous rage. You really don't get why she is so jealous, as she is the only one with whom you have regular contact that can even take you fully. Both of you merely see these morsels as toys, but she has never shaken it. However, you know just how to snap her out of it.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Giselle,\" you call out. \"I can't get anywhere with these shrimps. How about coming over here and showing them what a real woman can do?\"<br>\r\nThis always seems to snap her out of her jealous rages, and this time was no exception. She threw her current toy over her shoulder- having him land hard on the beach- and waded quickly your way, causing waves that occupied most of the width of the beach. Once there, she looked down upon your cock and the puny morsels upon it.<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that, girls?\" she sardonically asked. \"You sluts aren't good enough to handle this meat. Let me show you how it's done.\" You can't help but get giddy when she makes clear which job she will do.</span></div></div>",

However, she preferred this because it gave her a chance to kill off the competition one by one while pleasuring you at the same time.<br>\r\nOnce she got face to face with you, she kneeled down and guided your erection into her mouth. Once she got it all in there, she wasted no time in getting down to business. She started popping the tiny women with her tongue, swirling their corpses around on you. The feeling of the combination of blood, guts, and tongue never got old to you.<br>\r\nShe knew just what it took to get your maximum effect. She took her time popping the hapless women and smearing them. Once they were all dead, she would gather up whatever remained of them and put them between the top of her tongue and the bottom of your shaft. She would then rub them against you as her head pumped back and forth. It was slow initially, but it sped up once you came close to climax. The whole process would take a while, but it was always worth it. You would shoot hundreds of gallons of seed down her throat, sending the guts of the victims down with her. In exchange, she would get the satisfaction that he was all hers.<br>\r\nOnce you were dry, she got back on her feet, kissing you, exchanging anything that may have remained in her mouth.

Both of you can't help but giggle at the small ships looking upon you.<br>\r\n\"I guess they took the hint not to meet us full force,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I think they were getting tired of the fleet getting decimated,\" Giselle said.<br>\r\n\"That's unfortunate,\" you say. \"I was having fun playing that game.\"<br>\r\n\"We can still have some fun with these,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Let's,\" is all you need to say as the two of you start to wade their way. Unlike the yachts, they were unable to make any evasive movements before you scooped them up in your arms. Once the rudders were ripped off of them, both of you start to play with them like toys. Both of you move them into deeper water, pushing them while swimming at full speed. Once the water gets chest high, you start to shake yours violently, causing sailors to fall overboard.<br>\r\nAfter a while of doing this, however, both of you get bored. So, to end the game, both of you swim-sail your boats, ramming them head on at full speed. Naturally, this causes the boats to bust open. Both of you push down on them to hasten their sinking and to leave no survivors.<br>\r\nOnce the ships were safely on the bottom of the ocean, both of you lock in a long, passionate kiss. It has clearly been a fun day at the beach, but both of you felt that it was time to move on.</span></div></div>",

From past experience, you knew that there were cities within a relatively short distance from your path.<br>\r\n\"What do you say we go into the city for a while?\" you suggest.<br>\r\n\"Solid idea, Igor,\" Giselle said.<br>\r\n\"Lead the way,\" you say.<br>\r\nShe gladly obliges. She walks by you, intentionally popping her ass while she is walking. She knew this excited you, so she never passed up an opportunity to take the lead. As she walked away from you, she looked back to see you drooling over her physique.<br>\r\n\"Are you coming, big boy?\" she asked seductively, noticing your renewed erection.<br>\r\nYou can't help but follow her as she keeps walking close to the path you took earlier. You are so focused on her- and she on teasing you- that the two of you hardly notice the fresh path of destruction the two of you are causing. It seems to take a while, but you actually do catch up to her and grab it, pulling her into a bear hug. This causes her to lose her footing and you both fall down hard.<br>\r\nIt is finally at this point that both of you take a look around. You notice that you indeed are in a suburb of the city. You see the white picket fences dotting your immediate surroundings and the skyscrapers on the not-too-distant horizon. Everything about this area looks tantalizing.</span></div></div>",

This mattered little, though, as the two of you were easily able to block any exits by simply stomping on every exit you see. You then get on your hands and knees and start to grab handfuls of the puny morsels. You start to eat them ravenously. You are able to eat many of them at one time. Some get swallowed whole, but you are able to chew many, enjoying their salty taste.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Igor,\" you hear Giselle call out from behind. You turn around to see that she has many tiniest on her heaving bosoms. \"I think you may need something to drink with those.\"<br>\r\nYou get off of your hands and knees and walk to her. Bending over, you take one of her orbs and start to lick the smalls off of it. When they are all in your mouth, you start to bite down and suck on her nipple. In turn, she grabs the other one, licks the people off of it, and starts to suck on herself. The feeling sends pleasure through both of you.

The two of you decided to split up and cause havoc on the freeways flanking each side of the suburb that headed into the city.<br>\r\nKnowing the freeway she chose went to the shopping district, you decided to let her have her fun there and marched straight to the business district. You reveled in the feeling of the twisting metal and popping bodies under your feet. Occasionally, you would stray from the path and kick over some smaller apartment buildings.<br>\r\nYou are only somewhat disappointed at the ease it took to get downtown. Most of the buildings only got as high as your waist, but there were some that got taller, a few even being taller than you. You crouch down to get a better view into one of them, crushing another with your ass in the process. You reach in and grab a handful of people, but do little more than crush them with your hand. On your way up, you kick it down with ease. You then start to kick them at random, sometimes multiples at once.<br>\r\nThis goes on until you feel one hand go over your eyes and another over your junk. \"Guess who?\" was all Giselle said as though there were another option. Once she got her hands off of you, you looked around and saw that she caused about as much damage as you.<br>\r\n\"I want to have some fun with this,\" she said. \"Sit down,\" as she pushed you down on two yet undestroyed buildings. She has you facing the tallest of the skyscrapers, maybe 100 feet taller than you. She seductively looks back at you, grabs the top, and starts to twirl around on it, sometimes kicking some nearby skyscraper. She kept grinding on it and licking it, using the various pole dancing positions until the building gave in and toppled over. However, she got back up and started twerking in your face.<br>\r\nThis was too much for you. You got up, grabbed her, lifted her slightly, and bent her over the buildings you were just sitting on. You rammed your rod into her, mustering all of your control to not explode on impact. You rammed harder and harder, weakening the structures but pressuring her with each thrust. At the same time, you, her, and the buildings could take no more. Both of you came just as the buildings crashed down. Both of you fell to the ground, you on top of and still inside her as you made impact, caving in the surrounding ground, causing water mains to break and subways to collapse.<br>\r\nIt took a while, but you pulled your still hard cock out of her, turning over onto the rubble. You could tell it was just entering twilight. This has been a good day.</span></div></div>",

You never asked for a television, as most of their broadcasts cater to the little people, and you find it bard to sympathize with them. You don't have a refrigerator as you prefer to eat your people and trees fresh. In fact, the reason you have lights is because your little neighbors agreed to install them so you can spare their power plant.<br>\r\nAs the cave is coming within sight, both of you first stop, look around, and give one last look at the glowing world below and beneath you.

It will be just like old times.\"<br>\r\nAh, yes, the old times. You start to reminisce. In your culture, it was typical for a teenager on their 18th birthday to get a firsthand lesson on sex from the parent of the opposite gender. In particular, your experience with your mother was quite informative. She taught you lessons that most of your ilk still don't know at 25. In your culture, it is also customary to maintain a sexual relationship with the parent, even after getting married. It helped you that both of your women were very sexual creatures. It also helped that, even though Giselle had a jealous streak about as tall as her, she was also understanding. But that didn't mean she was a pushover with her mother-in-law, and everyone understood everyone else's boundaries.<br>\r\nEven Sophia was lime the old times as is. She may have been 45, but she didn't look a day over 30. She also had DD breasts and a bubble butt, with a toned physique to boot. If you didn't know any better, you would think she was Giselle's mother. Giselle knew all of this, but it didn't matter to her, since you were hers as she saw it.<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you,\" Sophia said, \"but I'm tired from walking all that way.\"<br>\r\nWith all this excitement, how were you feeling now?</span></div></div>",

You had just moved out of your mother's place, but you didn't yet have your own place. Then again, as a cocky 500-foot grown man, you don't think about things like that. You were thinking about long days at the beach, traveling wherever you wanted, creating as much havoc as possible, and finding as many little ladies as possible to use as you please. You weren't even looking for a relationship, content with the occasional one night stand with the few giantesses that crossed your path and regular sex with Sophia.<br>\r\nIt had been a day of rampaging, which you figured warranted a trip to the beach to bathe off the ruins of your latest city. You had gotten close to the beach when you noticed a crowd running away from it but toward you. You figured they were fleeing because it was reported that you were coming, but it made no sense to run toward the problem.<br>\r\nIt made more sense when you looked toward the beach and saw her. At the distance between you and her, Giselle looked little. This was until you saw the battleship headed straight toward her. You realized she was another giant when you saw her stand up to her full height and try to fight off the ship. Seeing that she was having trouble fighting it off, you start to run to her, ignoring but crushing the crowd that was fleeing. Once you got far enough into the water, you dove down and swam that way.<br>\r\nYou knew you had gotten there when you saw her shapely pair of legs reaching down to the floor. You then follow the silhouette of the ship to the other end. Realizing that they have not yet set off any depth charges, you surface as fast as you can, causing waves that almost toppled the ship.<br>\r\nSeeing that this got her attention, you use the most appropriate pick-up line that comes to you: \"Need a lift?\"<br>\r\n\"Gladly,\" she said. At this point, both of you pick up each end of the ship, which you do easily. You carry it onto the beach itself and simultaneously heave it as far as you can, into the nearby resort.<br>\r\n\"Some way to spend an 18th birthday,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"I fought off an armada on mine,\" you said. \"Happy birthday.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, stranger,\" she said. \"Not many giants around here.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you said, looking her up and down. \"I'm Igor.\"<br>\r\n\"Giselle,\" she said, also looking you up and down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know who my father is and my mother won't.\"<br>\r\nSeeing this as an opportunity, you then propose an idea: \"What if I teach you?\"<br>\r\n\"We just met,\" she said warily. \"How do I know you don't just want this?\" she asked as she turned back to you as she jiggled her breasts in her hands.<br>\r\n\"I'm 20, I live on my own, I love to cause mayhem, I'm as single as they come, and I'm an experienced teacher,\" you say. \"Besides, I can see you clearly want this,\" you add as you cup your crotch.<br>\r\nBiting her lower lip, she threw herself at you, French kissing you like no other before her.

This causes her to squeal loudly, shattering any glass left for two miles. It was a tight fit, but she still didn't explode. As you pump, you could tell there was something different about this woman. She would be more than another piece, another memory, another pupil. The mere thought of being in love with her caused you to orgasm like never before, not even when you were taught. Giselle finally took this point to let go herself, cumming like no one else before her.<br>\r\nBetween pants, you finally say, \"Successful lesson. We should do this again very soon.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" she panted.</span></div></div>",

Given that neither of you had steady homes at this point, you were rarely apart in this period. While you were teaching her in the art of sexuality, she taught you some things about seduction. It had been too easy to get some from Sophia, and Giselle, with her nimble moves and sensual and sexual nature, made things so much more fun. On top of that, both of you were starting to become more romantic overall. You discovered that taking her the occasional clump of trees and trailer full of people was a quick way to get laid.<br>\r\nThis night proved to be quite interesting. You two were on a date at the beach and you had just finished eating the marina, boats and all. As there was a city nearby, you decided to check out the nightlife. The first thing that caught your eye was the maze of neon as far as the two of you can see. Seeing that it was a party town, you decide to make a night of it here.<br>\r\nHowever, the next thing you saw was the shadowy outline of another giantess using a tower as a dildo. Over Giselle's protests, you decide to take a closer look. You don't get far before you recognize it. She also clearly saw you, for she yelled out, \"Hey, Igor.\"<br>\r\nThis was to be the first look you would get at Giselle's jealousy. Once she heard your name, she charged past you and tackled her to the ground. She punched her while on top of her. She kneed her in her sternum. They rolled around, not even thinking about what they were destroying around them.<br>\r\nIt was only when Giselle started to strangle her that it occurred to you to pick her up and lift her off.<br>\r\n\"How do you know this bitch?\" Giselle said.<br>\r\n\"That's my mother,\" you scream. This seems to be enough to calm her down enough for you to put her down only for her to collapse in regret.<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to Sophia, helping her up. Despite getting such a beating, she got right up and hardly looked like she was fighting.<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" was all you could say to her.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you introduce us?\" she asked you.<br>\r\nHearing this, you walked back over to Giselle, now sobbing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n\"Is this it?\" she asked, almost resigned to the fact that it would be it.<br>\r\n\"You didn't know,\" you say. \"Stand up and meet her.\" She does so right away.<br>\r\n\"Giselle, this is my mother,\" you say. \"Sophia, this is Giselle.\"<br>\r\nAs they hesitantly shake hands, Giselle apologized sincerely.

So does your wife, as you see her approach as well. Sophia then juts out her breasts as each of you start to suck on one. Among your kind, women's milk production never seemed to cease, partly out of necessity. Also, if a matriarch was still living with a married adult child, she was first to offer hers.<br>\r\nAs the milk started to come out of her nipple, she started to moan. Sophia always found it erotic to be suckled on, likely because it meant someone depended on her. The two of you only let go when she dried up, and you knew what was coming next.<br>\r\nAlso among your type, once the younger woman was fed, the older would drink hers, and Sophia alone latched onto one of hers. Giselle didn't find it erotic coming from her. She saw this as a necessity. Sure, she was glad to oblige, but it did nothing for her.<br>\r\nOnce Sophia was done feeding, both of them looked at you and your throbbing erection. This one was less a cultural thing then a personal understanding. For your own \"feeding\", Sophia, as matriarch and former teacher, would get to suck you off first. As she sucked, you couldn't help but looked at Giselle as she gave a mock pout. She looks so cure when pouting. This was actually enough to get you off, shooting long ropes of semen down your mother's throat until you were sucked dry.<br>\r\nOnce she pulled it out of her mouth and you regained your erection, Giselle knelt down and took you in her mouth without hesitation. Partly out of jealousy, she pumped hard. She always was able to take all of it in her mouth, and this was no different. Both of you kept your eyes on Sophia, but for different reasons. Knowing this, Giselle also started fluffing again. This combination finally caused you to go overboard, shooting out even more semen than you did with your mother. In fact, it seemed to be a constant stream. It never made her gag, though, as she kept pumping until you were again dry.</span></div></div>",

None of you care about the damage done as that was the general idea.<br>\r\nThe three of you quickly scramble to your feet and make a dash for the cluster of skyscrapers in the distance. At this point, it seems to be a three way tie with no clear path to individual victory.<br>\r\nWho does win?</span></div></div>",

It was an instant connection as you both had similar interests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned over and kissed Brittney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning babe.\" You said as you did and then your hand drifted down to play with her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" Brittney said yawning and then giggled as to upward at her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does my beautiful girl feel like doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down for whatever babe.\" Brittney said as she stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go for a walk somewhere. We could pay the nearby city a visit. I know how much you love rampaging around.\" You grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney smirked. You both didn't really care about how much destruction you caused or killing the tiny people. You were big and they were small. It happened. You both loved toying with the tiny people and both of you didn't care what happened to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds fun.

Brittney was a sweet girl but she could get very bitchy and bratty very quickly. You loved that about her as even though she was egotistical and a bit self centered, she was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both got out of your massive bed and walked through your large home. You were both naked, your bodies on full display as clothes just didn't really work at your size. You both walked out of the cave and stomped through the forest, the tiny trees crushed beneath your huge feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people in the city felt your approach before they saw you. The ground shook and buildings shook as you and Brittney stomped towards the city. The people were terrified. They had heard stories of a giant couple that loved to stomp around cities and toy with the tiny people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne giant was bad, but two? Well two Giants were basically unstoppable. You and Brittney arrived at the edge of the city and smiled. The city was packed with people and many were fleeing you. You both grinned. You loved causing as much destruction as possible and Brittney also did. Your first date with Brittney, you two stomped a village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this puny city thinks it care stand up to us.\" Brittney mused as she looked over the city. \"I think so babe. We'll see how long it lasts when we start our fun.\" You grinned. You both had already caused a bit of havoc and destruction as you had walked through the suburbs to get to the city, your feet having already crushed numerous cars, houses, and people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney began to walk, her massive tan feet crushing everything beneath them. You watched her cute ass as she began to stomp into the city. You gel your penis get a little bit hard as you stared at her perfect house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna help me or just stare at my ass all day?\" Brittney smirked as she had turned around and crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a real nice ass. It's actually distracting, babe.\" You said as Brittney giggled. You began to walk towards her, careful to step where she hadn't as you wanted to cause as much destruction as possible. You felt cars crumpling like paper under your feet and people being squashed without any resistance. It was a feeling you never got tired of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittney had turned her attention back to the city and was stomping through it, laughing as she did so. \"Hey babe. I bet I can cause more destruction than you.\" You grinned as you kicked a building to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't. I'm the more destructive one. You can't even hold a candle to me.\" Brittney said as she stomped on a few smaller buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I'm definitely the more destructive one.\" You said as you kicked at several other buildings one at a time and stomped on them as well as stomping on fleeing people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both were smiling and laughing as you stomped around and kicked at the buildings around you. The city was in pandemonium as you both delighted in the destruction you were causing. You felt your cock getting had as you crushed people under your feet. You stomped several smaller buildings and gripped your cock and began to stroke it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better run bugs! Cause I'm gonna stomp you if I catch you!\" You boomed before laughing. Brittney burst out laughing as she heard you. She began to stomp closer to you and grinned. \"You hear that, bugs? My boyfriend is a big mean giant! He'll crush you under his big feet when he gets you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I don't get you, my beautiful girlfriend here will! She's a big mean giant just like me! She loves crushing you under her sexy feet!\" You boomed as Brittney giggled. \"Yeah bugs! I'm a big mean giant too! Your puny city is no match for us!\" She bombed before stomping her foot to punctuate her point. You then turned your attention back to stomping the buildings and people at your feet. Brittney joined you and laughed aAs you both stomped over and over. Cars flattened, buildings were smashed, and people were crushed as you both rampaged through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you lifted your foot up and brought it down on a crowd of people. You felt them smash be began your foot and laughed. You turned and surveyed the city. Fires were raging in some parts and yours and Britney's footprints littered the city. You saw Brittney amongst some skyscrapers, stomping about and shoving the buildings over along with kicking them. She looked so beautiful giggling as she toppled buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned back around and spotted city hall. You began to walk towards it.</span></div></div>",

The weather was almost always wonderful where Jessica and you lived but it had been several weeks since you paid the beach a visit. The two of you loved the beach. Jessica loved just lying out working on her tan at the beach and you didn't mind lying next to her while she did. The two of you also loved to play around in the water, whether it was just swimming or toying with the tiny boats and people that were around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your wife left your cave and began the trek to the beach. Despite living somewhat inland, it didn't take long for two 1000ft giants to cover the distance. Your footsteps shook the countryside as the two of you stomped towards the beach. The two of you stomped a tiny village, uncaring as years of building and landscaping turned to rubble in seconds under you and your wife's massive bare feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you nor Jessica really cared about the tiny people. They were just toys, something to amuse yourselves with especially considering the were any size to you. The two of you often rampaged cities or through the countryside, both of your playful yet destructive natures on display whenever you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two soon neared the beach and as you got closer, you noticed the dots of color which you knew to be umbrellas and saw that the beach was packed. Apparently everyone had the same idea as the two of you. The two of you stomped through the coastal city and were soon on the beach, the sand warm under your giant feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the beach had at first felt the faint rumblings of the earth when you and Jessica had still been farther away. Nobody paid much mind until the shaking became stronger and louder and you and your wife's towering naked bodies had been spotted. It quickly became pandemonium on the beach and suddenly the feet of the giant and giantess were on the beach and numerous people had been crushed beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at Jessica who was surveying the tiny people fleeing from the two of you. You put an arm around her waist and as she turned towards you, planted a kiss on her lips. She giggled as she pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is a beautiful day for the beach. You don't mind if my wife and I join you all, do you?\" You boom as Jessica giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do babe? I know you probably want to work on your tan but I feel like going for a swim. We haven't gone swimming in a while.\" You say as you watch your wife lift her foot up and then point her big toe down, dragging it through the panicked crowd leaving trail of blood behind as her French tipped toes tear through the sand and crowd.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's go for a swim while all the boats are still out.\" Jessica says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love how you think.\" You say with a grin. In a single step, both of you are walking into the water, your feet crushing any unfortunate swimmers beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her wade deeper into the water causing large waves to push boats farther from you or even capsizing boats that are too close to your godly legs. You both waded deeper into the water, casually dragging your hands through the water creating waves to capsize boats and drown people. You watched Jessica's manicured fingers pluck up a tiny boat and squish it between her fingers. Her finger nails were painted white to match her pedicured toenails which were also painted white. Even a giantess wanted to look her best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both up to your mid thighs in water when you both spotted it at the same time. A massive cruise ship deeper in the water. You and Jessica shared a knowing grin. Without any hesitation you both dove into the start and began to swim towards it, your powerful kicks and strokes causing massive waves which demolished boats and drowned any people who survived your early escapades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship had increased to full speed but in no time both you and Jessica were upon the massive ship in water that only came up to your waists, barely covering your genitals. You both grinned down at the ship, watching terrified people clear the deck. The terrified people were greeted to the view of you and Jessica's taught, toned stomachs as you towered over the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say babe? Should we show this ship whose boss?\" Jessica giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course babe.\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica using her index finger began to crush people on the deck, bringing her monolith like finger down over and over on the deck, piercing it and crushing people by the tens. You smiled as you watched her do this. Jessica then casually swung her tan, toned leg over the ship, resting her naked form on the deck of the ship. She ground her hips to and fro on the ship, wrecking the deck and crushing hundreds under her sex. She the moved up to rest on the main structure of the ship, her clean shaven pussy on full display as she faced you. The ship sank deeper into the water due to the giantess straddling it. People ran from the front of the ship to back or deeper into the superstructure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gripped the base of your now semi erect cock and lifted it from water. To the people on deck, it looked like a submarine quickly surfacing. You grinned as you stepped forward and held it over the deck of the ship giving the people below a view of the underside of your massive shaft. You quickly slammed your massive member down on the deck crushing tons of people. You grinned as you lifted your cock and slammed it down again on the deck. It was quickly stiffening and Jessica giggled with glee in her eyes as she watched you. Again you slammed your cock onto the ship while people desperately tried to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another slam, you simply left your erect dick on the deck and gripping the base dragged it back and forth across the deck. You damaged the superstructure and either mashed or wiped every single person off the deck. You then lifted up your cock and walked around the ship to be behind Jessica. You lifted your leg up and straddled the ship as well so your massive sack rested on the deck. You rammed your erect penis into the ship, piercing several decks and doing a lot of damage. Jessica giggled as she saw this. You then stepped forward and now rested on top of the superstructure just like Jessica. The ship sank just deep enough that both yours and her feet found the ocean floor. You grinned as you slid yourself closer towards Jessica who lifted her ass up and her tits pressed into the ship as well as her blonde draped over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome fires had erupted on the ship and it was quite damaged from you and Jessica already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica draped herself across the ship as you entered her from behind. You pulled her hips close and she had her ass raised. Jessica began to moan as you fucked on the ship. It was amazing. It was even hotter knowing hundreds possibly thousands were trapped inside the ship while you two screwed on top of it. You rhythmically thrust as Jessica's legs crushed the cruise ship between them. You gripped her hips while she dug one hand in to the side of the ships structure while the other rested on top of the structure. Your balls were destroying the top of the superstructure as the dragged across it every time you pulled back and thrusted. As you two fucked, the ship was beginning to creak and crack. It wasn't made to have a giant couple fuck on it but it wasn't your problem. You rammed your cock deep into her over and over as she moaned and you panted while pumping your dick. You two continued fucking until you knew you were about to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about to cum!\" You groaned as you thrusted once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Me too! Just a little more!\" Jessica moaned as you continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica let out a loud moan and as you let out a loud groan, cumming as she did. You withdrew your spent dick from Jessica, excess cum raining down on the pulverized cruise liner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing.\" Jessica gasped trying to catch her breath as she laud down atop the ship. The ship however couldn't take it and begin to sink as Jessica's body laid on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship sank into the water and Jessica and you splashed each other and cleaned yourselves up.</span></div></div>",

Look.\" Jessica says, pointing a manicured finger behind you. You turn around and see numerous gray ships approaching you. You recognize them as Navy ships. Patrol boats, destroyers, cruisers, and even some battleships approaching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Those tinies must've called for help.\" You say as you smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica takes a step to stand next you. \"You think they saw the show?\" She says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but you think the Navy would've learned their lesson already about trying to stop us.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Navy just like the other branches of the military had tried to stop you numerous times. When you had been just a single giant, wrecking havoc and rampaging around, the military had been annoying but never a major threat. When you had met Jessica, the military turned from minor threat to toys. With their being two of you, you had twice the power. For the most part, the military have you two a wide berth but every once in a while, like today, the came for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, should we remind them of their place?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you took a few steps before diving into the water. You both stayed underwater as you swam closer. You see the hills of the ships and swim so you're under a cruiser. Without any warning both you and Jessica explode out of the water creating massive waves. Some of the  patrol boats, the smallest boats, capsize while the larger ships list. With the simple action of surfacing, the two of you have broken their formation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water is about mid stomach high for the both of you. You bring your fist down on to a destroyer, causing it to split in two. You then grab a cruiser up and crush it in your hands, ripping and tearing it apart. You look over and see Jessica is simply flipping the ships over, causing them to capsize and most likely drowning most of the crew. You and her both can't help but smile as shells and missiles have no effect on with of you. You spot a cruiser firing at Jessica and walk over to stand in front of it. You grab the front of it and simply lift the 567ft ship up so it's standing straight up in the air and let fall so that it is now upside down. Jessica smiles at you and then lifts a destroyer from the water. She squeezes the middle with her hands causing the ship to crack in two and fall into the water. Then grabbing each piece, she plunges them underwater and holds them there until they sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smash another cruiser with your fists and cause two more destroyers to capsize by pushing them over as you set your sights on the battleships. Jessica is smashing the smaller ships with her fists or ripping the ships apart or simply crushing them in her hands. You decide to let her have her fun with those ships as she seems to be enjoying her new toys. You wade over to the first battleship and begin to shake the massive ship. It is almost as long as you are tall. You watch as crew members are tossed from the ship into the water as you shake it. You begin to rip the turrets from the ship and slam your fist down on the ship, breaking through several decks. The battleship soon begins to burn but you're far from done with it. You begin smash the bridge and structure of the ship, your huge fists crashing into it over and over. You raise your fist up and swinging it like a hammer, cut the ship in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as explosions rock the ship as it sinks beneath the waves. You move on to the next battleship, slamming your huge fists down onto the turrets smashing them. You then rip the structure open on the ship and slam your fist into in causing it to crumble. You continue punching the ship until it is a burning wreck. Satisfied it is done for, you turn your attention to the next battleship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move towards the next battleship, you are preparing to take it down when suddenly a destroyer lands on it causing both ships to explode in massive fireballs which combine into one. You look over and spot a grinning Jessica moving towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice toss Jess.\" You say as you laugh. You're a little surprised she was able to throw the destroyer but figure she was actually pretty close so it probably didn't take much. Jessica wasn't weak by any means, as she was quite athletic and in great shape but you sometimes forgot just how powerful she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured you might need some help. Besides I broke all my toys.\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and noticed all of the patrol boats, destroyers, and cruisers were either burning, in pieces, or were almost completely sunk or completely sunk. She had been busy while you are wrecked the big battleships. \"Come on then, you can help me with the last few.\" You said as you both started towards the nearest one. You were quickly upon and you two wasted no time destroying it. You shakes to shake it to throw the crew off the ship while Jessica was sweeping crew after the deck into the water. The huge fists of both of you rained down upon the ship smashing and crushing it. You both ripped turrets off of it and tore parts of the ship off. Using both of your strength, you two forced the ship into the water and held until it sunk to the bottom of the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walked to the ends of the ship and together grabbed it up. You lifted it out of the water and shared a grin with Jessica who was holding the front. You both began to swing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1...2...3!\" You said and on 3 you both released sending the battleship flying into the last remaining battleship. When the ships collided they erupted in a massive explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two surveyed the destroyed Navy fleet. There were very few survivors, not even enough to warrant either of your attention. Jessica moved closer to you and you pulled her in for a long, passionate kiss. As you parted you both grinned at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully they learned their lesson. Don't mess with us!\" Jessica said as she slammed her hand into the water sending up a wave that enveloped several tiny survivors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they got the message. I think the Navy will back off for now, until they need another reminder that is.\" You said with a smirk. Jessica giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head back on land. I've had enough time in the water for one day.\" Jessica said as you then kissed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you both headed back to land.</span></div></div>",

Your wife Alice also had a bit of muscle, with perfect skin, slightly sun-kissed and with impressive bust. You both had fantasies about being giants standing over the city, the thought of power fuelled your love making, and now it\u2019s your reality, and how did this happen? One day you were in your home when a strange sound was coming from the front door, Alice stepped out to investigate and her 1st step caused your house to shake, you rushed to the window to take a look and saw a humongous foot in front of the house, totally blocking all view. Then you hear Alice called out to you \u201cHey come here, I have something to for you to see\u201d He found it hard to hear because as she spoke there was a deep incredibly loud sound coming from outside, you head to her because you\u2019re not sure what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice \u201cLook on the floor, it looks like a map of our city, strange right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to the giant foot and thought maybe it was Alice\u2019s?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201clets both investigate\u201d hoping what he thought and Alice thought was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you both stepped out, both of your clothes disappeared and the door (portal) behind you vanished, this was because Alice had accidently crushed your old neighbourhood while stepping back, your former home was crushed under fold in her pinkie toe. You both look back to see the portal was closed, they looked down and saw a grey mass, that looked like a map of their city, you both take a closer look and both look at each other and around, all you see is a tiny landscape, you and Alice look at each other again and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice \u201cIt really looks like we\u2019ve grown\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cIt does\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice then poked part of the city and dragged her finger back and up to her face, she took a glance down and damage her finger down and looked back up to you, she then put the finger in her mouth seductively, you smile back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice \u201cWe\u2019re Gods, look at how everything is below the height of my toes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201d Yes it\u2019s amazing, look at how fucking tiny everything is, we truly are gods, at the 1st thing we should do as gods is fuck\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice \u201cHey specks today is your lucky day, you get to watch us gods fuck, I hope you survive haha\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice then sat down laid back in her naked glory, her ass crushing a massive part of the city millions are already dead before you mount her. Now pumping away with your fully erect 10 mile cock causing a long and repeating earthquakes killing millions more you were going for 15 minutes Alice cummed twice and just before you were about to cum you pull out and release on the city, even the drops demolishing many buildings under the drops weight, they were so insignificant all it took was a drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this you go for a walk smiling and kissing your wife Alice, not caring where you stepped you were killing 1000s and not even aware. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice \u201cRound 2? How about\u2026.  You drag the end of your dick across part of the city and then I suck you off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and say ok. You go into a sort of push up position, grad your dick which is already erect again and pull the foreskin back and drag across the city, making sure there was a ring of stuck destruction on your dick, next to your Alice was already on her knees, you stood up with excitement and she grad your erect cock and she began sucking, licking off all the buildings and people who were stuck to your dick, tiny specks being sucked up by lips 1000s of feet thick, and mammoth young pulling them back to fall down miles upon miles of oesophagus into her stomach. You stood over looking down and your wife sucking your cock and looking at the city below and think about how much you love your new-found power. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Causing an earthquake for millions.

You look over and see Alice finger herself it looks like she was having fun, so you decide to wank yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people between your legs were trapped and running in a panic, some were bowing to you claiming you two were Gods because that\u2019s what you were to them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda yawned and stretched luxuriously. The glorious feeling of metal being crunched beneath her brought a soft giggle to her lips. She loved knowing her unlimited power without even opening her eyes. Slowly, they did. At first she only saw the clear blue sky, with a couple clouds and a plane scudding across. Then she looked down around her, at the former trailer park. Happy thoughts arose at the thoughts of last night. There was her first step into the camp, and the first trailer to meet her foot. That's where she had her dinner, and there was her game of hide-n-seek. There's where the police tried to stop her, and over there, about 600 feet away was where the crumpled SWAT van ended up. As for the troopers occupying it...<br>\r\nAmanda rubbed her stomach happily. The police hadn't ended up there, she respected them too much for that. The occupants of this particular trailer park had repeatedly voiced negative opinions of her existence, so the 20 year old giantess had decided to introduce herself and see if an awesome party changed their opinions. The smashed trailers beneath her butt had certainly been awesome for her. The occupants, well, she could care less about them now. Besides, their opinions wouldn't matter until the dead rose, and even then only if they could be undigested. Amanda continued along this train of thought, and would have if one police car that hadn't been pancaked by the partying giantess had let out a sudden squawk with its siren. She snapped back to reality, looking for more reinforcements. Then she laughed. The first few times she'd tangled with the authorities, she'd be fighting until there was no one left within a twenty-mile radius. After she'd proved several times she enjoyed squishfests (how she thought of encounters with her smaller relatives) and was more than capable of handling everything but the heaviest weaponry, tactics switched from attempts to kill her to evacuations and lesser attempts to kill her. Amanda didn't mind, and had some respect for those who stood up to her. They all inevitably ended the same way, as a smear on her gorgeous body, but they were a courageous smear.<br>\r\nBesides, Amanda tried to finish them in the ways she considered best. The thought of these ways made her southern regions tingle, and two fingers worked their way towards her pussy. At their touch, it quivered and she recalled the exact number of reinforcements the police had had, and exactly where they'd gone. Amanda laughed once again. Oh yes, she'd had a very good time. It was a little early in the morning, but she thought she could still have a pretty good time before moving on. There were always a stubborn few who refused to leave even in the face of the greatest dangers. On the other hand, the big guns would probably be showing up any minute. Not being a suicidal giantess, Amanda tried to meet with them as little as possible. She'd won in the few encounters they'd had, but narrowly. And she didn't believe in pushing her luck.<br>\r\nHer stomach realized the giant woman had awoken, and reminded her. The growling could probably be heard all over the state. Although she was content hunger-wise a few minutes ago, Amanda craved some sustenance once again. Looking east, a small little town dotted the horizon. Perhaps a little fast food before her departure?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda tucked her legs beneath her and rose to her full height, just over 100 feet. The ground beneath her was a tornado's wet dream, trailers mangled beyond recognition, lifted trucks and minivans scattered haphazardly about the campgrounds, and people in various states of disrepair lying wherever she had grown bored with them. Her eyes caught furtive movement among the wreckage and she licked her lips. Maybe she wouldn't have to make the trek into town for brunch. Amanda stood stock still, waiting for breakfast to make a move. Two shadows darted under a tattered awning and she struck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda lifted a leg and twirled on her toes, planting the other foot just to the left of the shelter. She tore the cloth from the trailer, revealing a pair of kids huddling beneath her gaze. She grinned down at them. Amanda didn't particularly mind when kids ended up on the menu, but these ones weren't even worth the energy needed to get them from the ground to her mouth. As they shook and stared up at her with wide eyes, her smiled broadened. With a pinky she tapped them gently on the heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow up big and strong now kids! Eat your vegetables and be tasty morsels just like mommy and daddy!\" Amanda said. The two burst into squalls and she stood up straight, job finished. Her activity had sent any other people around ducking for cover, so she decided to head for greener pastures. The park was big, requiring nearly five minutes for her to get to the edge. A pitiful chain link fence separated green fields of prairie grass from the brown, dusty earth of the trailer park. Crossing the border, Amanda sighed as her feet sank into the cool vegetation. A few steps brought her to where somebody's station wagon had landed, carving an ugly furrow in the ground. The crumpled front end showed where the vehicle had rammed the giantess' ankle. It had been one of the dumber ideas Amanda had seen, and the driver had been punished. Just seeing the dummy's car caused her mood to sour. Amanda stomped out of the grass and into the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paced angrily down the road, her belly aching a little more with each step. Amanda was eyeing the town now, estimating how much time she had before anyone bothered to wake up a pilot or armored detachment to come to the aid of a small rural town. A bunch of rednecks in sardine cans never merited more than a few highway patrolmen and maybe a few guys with assault rifles. For whatever reason though, Amanda found that if those same rednecks had rickety houses and a pitiful little town hall then they'd treat her like a goddamn Russian invasion. The unfairness truly galled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK!\" As if in answer to her question, two helicopters drifted upwards from somewhere within the town. A road sign by her feet named it \"Pleasant Valley\". Amanda considered walking off and finding somewhere else to top up. But by now she felt like the good citizens of pleasant valley were insulting her by trying not to get eaten. The helicopters turned in her direction and started towards her. They closed the distance fast, she wasn't more than ten miles away. Amanda seized a young tree growing just the other side of the road's drainage ditch. With a kick she shattered the trunk, pulling the top free from the roots. Taking a short build-up she launched the tree at the lead helicopter. A born athlete, her missile hit home and obliterated the front half of the vehicle. It crashed, burning cheerily into the road. The second helicopter's engine roared and it struggled to gain altitude. As it passed overhead, Amanda saw the white cross on red background painted beneath it. She stalked to the downed chopper, two crew staggering out of the wreckage supporting each other. They seemed too dazed to notice her approach and only yelled in horror when she was already on top of them. She tore one of them away and hauled him to face height. He was screaming and tearing at her fingers but she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT EVEN A GODDAMN ATTACK HELICOPTER?\" Amanda shouted into the man's face, punctuating each word with a stomp on his comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? HOW MANY PEOPLE I'VE KILLED? WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?\" The man on the ground was little more than a puddle at this point but Amanda kept going. The one in her hand babbled incoherently. \"ANSWER ME.\" She said. He continued to say what might have been answers, but Amanda was beyond listening. Disgusted, she thrust him in her mouth and crunched down. She chewed quickly, the salty warmth spreading over her tongue. She swallowed the torso and put the lower half in. When this slid down her throat her stomach let out a happy gurgle and Amands began to feel better. She looked down at the mess by her feet. She shook her head and sighed. \"Stupid.\" The brief temper tantrum, her pique at the readiness of their defenses and then the indignation at the lack of defenses melted away and she was her normal, bubbly self again. She walked on and saw the first barricade, two police cars with a few men staring at her in awe. Smiling, she waved to them. Off to the east end of town, she saw a few tents and medical trailers. Probably the refugees who hadn't wanted to party the night before. Amanda thought about where to start.</span></div></div>",

She stood with her legs planted on opposite sides of the road and tapped her chin, gently humming to herself. She was still a little hungry and the trailer park folk had a particularly rich flavor that she had enjoyed. On the other hand she hated being interrupted during her meals and if she left them alone the police were sure to bug her. Amanda accidentally made eye contact with one of the officers, a younger blond man whose eyes were stretched to the size of dinner plates. Stretching her lips tight and showing all her teeth to the police, she made her choice. She dusted herself off as best she could and wiped her gore-stained foot clean in the grass on the side of the road. Breathing deeply, she strode purposefully towards the blockade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" A voice called from far below. Amanda was only a step or two from the cars which were parked lengthwise across an intersection. Beyond them lay the town's main drag, mostly one or two story buildings that looked somewhat old but well-maintained. Paying the little men below her no mind she took another step. As her foot landed she watched them stagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt or we will fire at you,\" The cop announced again, his voice not wavering over the cruiser's loudspeaker. Amanda figured they knew how futile this would be but that they had to go through the motions. She understood that they had to at least try, and didn't take it personally. The colossal woman took another step, placing her on the other side of the cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit I said stop!\" Amanda smiled and froze mid-step. There was a moment of silence. She could make out some hurried talk between confused people below and behind her. \"Okay now-\" Amanda began to topple backwards. She rocketed downwards, a several dozen ton meteor streaking down on the hapless authorities. She landed top of the patrol cars' hoods, flattening the front halves with a satisfying crunch. She crossed her legs and looked down at her sides. She hadn't caught any of the cops under her butt, although one had taken a dive at the last second and avoided her by inches. The rest had been knocked to the ground by the impact. She snatched them up as they tried to struggle to their feet and deposited them between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys!\" She beamed down at them. They still wavered on their feet a bit but managed to stay upright. One unholstered his gun and fired three shots all hitting the underside of her breasts. Amanda plucked him up and tilted to the right. She tossed him beneath her left cheek and slowly came down. He screamed as her soft skin pressed down on him. Amanda gradually applied more force, making the noise coming from beneath her even more shrill until finally he was squeezed too tightly to breathe. After a second of silence she put the rest of her weight on him and popped the man like a grape. A small jet of gore sprayed from under her, painting the road next to the four surviving officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, but I really don't appreciate being shot at,\" she said, staring at each man below her in turn. They looked up at her colossal face, partially hidden behind two mountainous breasts. \"You can't hurt me with what you're packing, but it does get a little annoying. I guess I should have led off with that. Oh well, you learned this way too.\" Amanda tossed her hair over her shoulder. The street beyond them was deserted but she could see curtains in windows moving. The town seemed very much deserted. \"Where is everyone?\" She asked. None of the men answered. She leaned in closer and tried to make eye contact with one of them. \"Seriously, no one?\" Spotting her blond friend from earlier she grabbed him under the arms and lifted him to eye level. He beat against her finger a few times but gave it up as useless after two or three hits. \"Come on blondie, what's up? Where's the party?\" He squirmed a bit but said nothing. She watched him try to avoid looking down at her breasts, his mouth working like a fish out of water. She felt the warm spot on her bottom where she'd crushed his comrade and felt her nipples start to harden. Blondie's attempts to stay focused on the giant face before him wavered. Amanda sighed and tried again, smiling warmly at the little person. \"No need to be so shy, I don't bite! A town like this should have a whole lotta folks up and about this time of day. No way everyone ran off last night.\" Her victim still refused to talk, instead starting to claw at her fingers. Amanda squeezed tighter and forced a gasp out of him. He stopped struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda reached down and grabbed another cop. He started wailing the instant her fingers brushed against him and fought her all the way up. Looking at her blonde cop, she spoke. \"I've got such nice tits, don't you think?\" He lost control for a minute and looked down at the two fleshy mounds. Amanda giggled and put him face to face with a nipple. Placing her thumb on the back of his head she forced him against herself. She pressed the small man against her areola and rubbed him in a circle a few times. Then she pulled him back, watching him gasp for air. \"Now watch,\" she instructed. She pressed her elbows against the sides of her boobs and dropped the other officer into her cleavage. He almost completely disappeared between them, but Amanda fished him out and left about a third of him exposed. \"Are you watching blondie?\" Amanda asked, all trace of warmth gone. She squeezed her breasts and her captive started howling. \"He lives if you talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say something Burt! Please!\" The officer in her cleavage called. Amanda pushed him all the way down, completely burying him. She looked at Burt with a raised eyebrow but the young man was speechless. His mouth worked but nothing came out. She grunted. \"Useless.\" She finished the man between her breasts with a gentle squeeze and let his mangled body fall into her lap. The other two looked shocked for a moment. Then Amanda shifted herself forward and crushed them almost before they knew what was happening. Looking at Burt, Amanda smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Burt. I've decided I do bite.\" Amanda tossed the man into her open mouth. She felt him claw his way to the front her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't!\" He finally managed to scream. She laughed and sealed her lips, chewed Burt up and swallowed.</span></div></div>",

I prefer to refer to it as birthday present. I guess not many girls get to become as tall as a skyscraper on the day they turn 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the best thing that has ever happened to me. It even compensates having to stand Tim, the only other person in the world blessed with my size. I was so close to dumping him! One more day, we would have delivered the science project and after I had got my A he would have become another name in my long list of ex. Now I'm stuck with him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part is sex. He is so damned bad at it! Of course, I had not let him touch me too much while I was just pretending we were a couple, but now he's actually the only real option I have around, and this giant business makes me really horny. He was hesitant at first, since one of the only things we lack is privacy, but I'm way too hot and I know how to use my assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he made us like this, no matter how much of an accident he thinks this is, so I guess he has more than earned my eternal forgiveness for everything that's annoying about him. Which is a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt beats me how he still manages to wake up every day and work with a bunch of people that are hardly bigger than a fingernail in order to try to find a solution to \"our problem\". They are not even remotely close to it, so I'm not too concerned. Like all men, Tim really opens up during sex, so I'm well informed enough about the progress of their investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know the tinies have basically placed all their hopes on it. There's not too much more than they can do, actually. I know: they've tried. And since Tim could not man up it fell upon me to teach the cops and the army that we were upset about their reaction. They have not tried anything else so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim does not like what I do, but he has learned that there's nothing he can do to talk me out of it. Everyone else has learned that there is nothing they can do about it either. So, soon after waking up, I stretched, I told Tim that I was going for a walk and I ignored his protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm ignoring the protests of the people on the highway now. Part of the fun is to choose a random city every day. They cannot evacuate them all and I can move around pretty fast, so after two weeks I've learned about how to catch them by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath, let the sounds of horns and screams reach my ears and smile. I wonder what I'll do today.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Up the coast is Sea Isle City.  I haven't visited yet, and it has a number of art deco hotels that might reach my waist, as well as a few new casinos that might actually be taller than me.  Could be fun, and if it gets old, there's always the beach.  I haven't been there since I was a little girl, and the drive bored me, hours long.  Now, I should get there in minutes.  I probably should keep working out if I want to keep fit, anyway.  I start jogging down the road, or mostly down the road.  The road sometimes twists for no real reason, just to reach or avoid small towns, or maybe just to keep drivers awake.  I don't care about any of this, so I just jog straight towards the farthest point down the road that I can see.  Sometimes, this is directly on the road, if it's straight enough, but sometimes it takes me through (well, over) small towns or other things not worth my notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall towns around here aren't remotely solid enough to be fun.  I just ignore them.  My feet sometimes hit buildings in them, and they collapse like origami.  Boring.  And mostly, they are so fragile that the shockwave of my passage (because I am supersonic when I run) just shatters them completely.  But since I'm faster than my shockwave, I can only see that if I look back.  I don't like to do that because it doesn't show the proper level of disdain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slow down once I arrive at Sea Isle City, because while I've left a nice trail of destruction behind me, I don't want to demolish the whole place in like, five minutes.  I mean, sure I could do that, but what's the point?  I want to savor it!  I start by just walking down the streets.  My feet are almost three lanes wide, so I pretty much fill any street I take.  I like the feeling of tiny vehicles popping under my soles.  By now, everyone is running for cover, but what's safe from a girl like me?  Nothing, that's what.  I'm heavy enough to collapse anything underground, and nothing on the surface can resist me.  But I'm not that interested in the low buildings here, I step on a few, if they are in my way, but what I'm looking for are the taller hotels and office blocks.  I feel them now, against my thighs, getting a little taller, until finally, they reach my hips.  I slow myself way down, and do a slow, sexy sway down the street, that just happens to sway just enough to ensure that behind me, are only piles of rubble. My crotch is a little wet, as I think of my strength.  I see the mass of the big casino a few blocks ahead, but I keep walking there slowly.  My hip touches an art deco jewel, pushes just a little, and the concrete cracks, a little more, and the fa\u00e7ade falls in, and a little farther, and it collapses.   Another step and the other side of the street crunches.  Soon I'm standing in front of the first casino.  It isn't even so nice as the art deco that I've ruined for a few minutes of fun.  I stick my finger in the brutalist fa\u00e7ade.  The concrete gives as though I'm poking a sand castle.  This casino is ugly, and it annoys me that it's a head taller than me.  I push my massive tits into it, and it's like pushing into sand,.. except the sound of concrete and steel being crushed is a little different.  Once they are in as far as they'll go (which is a good 35 feet, my tits are big and perky!)  I slide myself down the side, and try to imagine what it must look like inside!  I notice that even my nipples are stronger than the building, they, too, are carving out their shape as I move.  Eventually I get to the corner, and have to continue my way down the next side.  The alley here is narrow, and my ass doesn't have clearance, though of course it can handle building modifications easily.  I get about halfway down, and then enough supports have been knocked out that the entire top of the casino tilts, and then falls, knocking everything down in a cloud of dust.  I decide to smash the hotel behind me too, with my behind.  I take a step back and then fall backwards, and that building too is rubble.  I lay back and touch myself, I feel so horny now.  My back arches, and I writhe around, and my massive body moving shakes things enough to knock down a few more buildings, and that's when I notice the lighthouse.  It looks just about the right size.  I walk over to it, and lower myself down on it, Perfect!  I cum, and my moans break any glass that remain in the city.  My pussy clenches, and I feel the lighthouse crush.  I'm just too much for everything, except Tim, and he's a little boring for me.  I feel a little dusty, but there's still the other big casino left.  I try to decide what to do next.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I can clean up later, right now I don't want to leave something half complete.  I walk straight over to the casino, through a tiny neighborhood that's almost entirely destroyed through my inattention.  This casino is enormous, and built in a ridiculous faux-Moorish style.  Its domes rise a little higher than me.  It's the tallest building on the whole coast, as far as I remember.  At least, for a few minutes more.  The whole structure is just in horrible, bad taste.  I peek through the windows.  Some of the rooms are empty, some contain people trying to dress or pack in a hurry.  One has a man, dressed, who is just watching.  Him, perhaps I can talk to.  I push my hand through the wall under his room, then curl up my fingers behind, once I feel them break through into the hallway.  I just pull his entire room physically out of the building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe falls down as I do.  \"Morning\" I say.  \"Can't look away from me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I don't think there's any point to running, really, so I thought I'd look my death in the face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's brave.  I wish you were bigger so you could be my boyfriend.  Why are you staying in such a monument to poor aesthetics?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Priceline\" he says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good answer!  I'll let you live, today.\"  I walk back to the juice-soaked ruins of the lighthouse and set him down there.  \"You should get a good view from here.\"  I walk off, blow him a kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what to do about the insult to good taste?  Good taste... That's it, I think.  I will just knock it down twerking.  My ass is almost as outsize as a my tits, and my workouts have left it shapely and round and, now, literally harder than steel.  I smile back at it one more time.  A steady stream of people are now pouring from the exits.  I could wait a few minutes for them to clear, but really, why?  I turn around, working my ass, and inch back towards it, until my ass starts impacting the building.  Sort of like twin wrecking balls.  But larger, and harder.  The casino stands even less a chance than the other one did against my tits.  I feel my ass touch a support, and I work it, shaking the whole place with my butt.  It seems so easy, moving thousands of tons with just my ass.  I wonder how much I could actually lift if I tried?  And what could I possibly find to challenge me, anyway?  I inch back more, twerking all the time, the casino shaking worse than any earthquake, and then I'm, as always, too much.  It collapses into a smoking pile of debris.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else is there still here that needs to be wrecked?  I look around, and see a couple mansions...  Those I remember from those trips when I was a little girl.  Always the low point of the trip, boring.   But I can change that.  They are neighbors to each other, both built around a hundred years ago by some famous architect.  I get on my knees, and let my tits hang over them.  They are spaced almost the same as my tits, and are even just about the same size.  But you know what the difference is?  When I drop down, two things deform and two are too firm to... And when it's my tits vs. mansions, well, tits win.  I lower myself slowly.  My nipples touch the roofs, and there's a great creak as old wood is strained, then breaks.  I keep going, and the entire roof falls in as my aureole touches it.  I keep lowering, and the outer walls crack, windows break as my tits overwhelm the mansions.  Probably the most interesting thing that's ever happened to them.  I'm too heavy for them even to have a chance.  I wait until stretched out on the ground, then wiggle around just to make sure that nothing's unbroken in those boring things.  I get back up, and look at the twin craters filled with broken rubble.  I feel satisfied.  A late revenge, for boring me years ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I think my work is done here.  Nothing of consequence is still standing, except the amusement pier.  And I feel magnanimous today.  I will leave them that, because I have fond memories of it.  Except, just remember, I need a trophy for my family's house.  I know just the thing.  I walk to the amusement pier and carefully pick up the antique carousel with the carved-wood mermaids.  It's quite cool, and will certainly do as a trophy.  I take it and walk carefully back home, don't want to break it, until I set it down in our yard among my other souvenirs.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I used to jog in the morning when I was as ridiculously small as the rest of the world. A body like mine required some discipline. This habit has definitely come in handy now that I've grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been running for about 45 minutes and the city I've stopped at must be a good 600 miles from the spot Tim and I have kind of established at, which is in the outskirts of our hometown. It's clear that they were not expecting me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts inhabitants will not be the first ones to suffer me today. Stuff has unavoidably got crushed as I jogged, since a girl my size just cannot care about farms, roads or small towns on her way. Running barefoot felt a little odd at first, but I really enjoy it now, the feeling of stuff under my soles often being the only reference I have about what I'm crushing. It actually feels weirder to have my DDs bouncing freely with every stride, but until someone makes a sports bra in size 3600... or actually any other clothes for what matters, I'm stuck at showing myself to the world in my birthday suit. I'm hardly concerned about it. I've always been a little of an exhibitionist and it's not as if there's anything about my body I would like to hide, is there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim doesn't feel like this. He has somehow managed to cover his groin with some type of horrible cloth that make him look very weird. True, the rest of what he's showing to the world is not to feel too proud either. Calling him scrawny would be an understatement. I'm actually a little concerned that people associate him to me, since it's well known that we are supposed to be a couple and I guess that people must be thinking how someone like me could be with someone like him. Once you think about it, there is only one possible reason: he made me like this in the first place. It's not a bad reason. Of course, now that we're both big there is really no good reason for me to break up with him, Tim being the only real animate being able to please me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, enough of Tim. I'm here at this new, unsuspecting city, and I'm ready for a new day of fun. I can hardly believe that it took me a full week to embrace the entire extent of what had happened to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not going to get to the city right away, though. Cleaning my forehead with the back of my hand, I notice that, once more, I'm sweating. My skin is glistening in the bright early morning sun and the consequences of my exertion are evident in the streams of sweat that ran along my body. Of course, I'm not tired. If anything, I only feel healthier and stronger since I grew. But still, this is summer, the temperature must be already in the high eighties and I've ran 600 miles non stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may be 500 feet tall, but I'm still a girl, and there's no way I'm going to be on worldwide TV rampaging a city with dry sweat or sticky hair. A bath is in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, rather than crossing the highway I just walk around it, in the direction of the cliffs that will give me access to the ocean. I guess that sooner or later people will realize that I keep choosing cities by the sea or by a lake. I stop a few steps short of them. There's one more thing I need to do to complete my morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's curious how quickly one can get used to a new perspective to the world. Things are still the same, but they just serve a new purpose to me. Take mass transportation, for example. Keeping aside the fact that I've always loved model train sets, I don't know what I would do without buses, and trains and the like. I mean, I'm a big girl, so unless people were not already making it easy for me by conveniently packing themselves in easy to grab vehicles, I would need to spend a while plucking them one by one in order to have breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy catch of the day is a Greyhound bus that's about as long as my hand. I need to reposition my left foot to reach for it, inadvertently crushing half a dozen cars under it. The usual stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand back and and look through the windows with curious eyes. Nice! The bus is pretty packed! I start ripping the roof with my fingernails and by the time I'm done I have a screaming crowd of fifty trapped as if they were sardines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE A TASTY BUNCH!\" I say. Then, I just start gently shaking people out of the bus and into my free hand, using two fingers into the ripped open vehicle as if it were a pack of tic-tacs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first half a dozen do actually look like tic-tacs as I open my mouth and toss them in unceremoniously. A couple minutes later the busload is in my stomach and the bus is a county away, after I have tossed it over my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the city knows of me is a massive shaking as I lazily let myself drop off the cliff and start walking across the beach. I've said it was a sunny day, so the beach was starting to become pretty crowded. That is hardly a problem for me as I casually advance towards my morning bath. I stop when I reach the waterline and lift my right foot, looking under my sole to find a dozen tiny square colored cloths. Of course I know they are beach towels. They don't let me see the people that was probably between them and my barefoot's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI already know that it's going to take a while to get to a spot where the water starts having some meaningful depth. And when I say a while I really mean a while. The bright side of this is that once I reach that area it's usually filled with boats. Well, I guess I should call them ships. I'm having some problem to qualify sizes, as you can imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore them at first and just let myself drop into the water, letting it cool my massive body and rubbing my hands along my skin, massaging it and cleaning it from the plenty of stuff that unavoidably ends up getting stuck into multiple parts of my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning upside down, I look at the sun filtering through the surface and identify the silhouettes of a few ships that are nearby and that are obviously trying to make a run. I know they have no chance, but as I stay underwater for even longer, taking advantage of my recently increased lung capacity and scaring the shit out of the people that are trying to guess where I will emerge, I think on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, that's one of the problems when one is my size: there are so many possibilities that sometimes it's hard to choose!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I guess everyone on the cruise ship is shitless scared when I emerge right in front of their speeding vessel like a kraken emerging from the deep. If they were not, they are when I reach out with a slender arm and easily stop the ship on its tracks, sending everyone off their feet. The cruise ship is still a little bigger than me, but strength is a different matter, the ship's powerful diesel engines hardly a match for my lean muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having taken care of my morning exercise, breakfast and hygiene, it's time for me to start the real day. The real day, of course, involves me doing skyscraper-sized girl stuff to a city, taking care to control myself enough to have the city lasting through the day. I'm glad I live in the USA. I would have probably run out of cities if I had been born in any other country of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of bold but quite stupid passengers have put a lifeboat in the water and are starting to try to get away from the cruise. I call them stupid because it's not a good idea to catch my attention, and they have. I reach out and pick their boat up with two fingers. They scream as I hold them in front of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LIKE BOLD PEOPLE\" I say. They seem to relax a little. \"I REALLY LIKE THEM\" I repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I open my mouth and start shaking the people in the boat into it. They are easily beaten by my fingers and start dropping into my tongue. Once they are all in there, I toss the boat and chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMM\" I moan as I get my tongue out and lick my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crowd in the ship is shocked, terrified. I've come to learn that eating people always has this effect. It's the same with Tim. Out of all the times he's got upset with what I'm doing, the time he found out I had eaten some people was clearly the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, I cannot understand it. I mean, in the week I've been roaming around the death toll has easily been in the tens of thousands per day. I've killed tinies in many different ways, and I cannot blame accidents or carelessness for most of them. I've actually eaten only a few hundred per day, so once you put it into perspective, it's a really small quantity. And they have probably been the ones that have served a better purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not a psychologist, so I can only guess, but I think that what happens to everyone else, including Tim, is that they see someone eating someone else of their own. I may have to ask a few people to verify the theory. And I may need to spell what should be obvious out to everybody: I'm not one of their own anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowning the people on the boat serves two purposes. For starters, it helps to satiate me. After all, a busload is not that much for a girl my size. It has the added benefit of making sure no one else is going to attempt getting away from the cruise ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach out for the ship's prows and casually shake the entire boat with a flick of my wrist, sending everyone off their feet with my casual gesture. Then, I start wading around the large vessel, the water reaching all the way to my hips, making my lovely breasts dangle over the upper decks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I inspect the cruise I unconsciously start humming the \"Love boat\" theme, stooping with curiosity to look at all the activity I disrupted. I've never gotten on a cruise like this and I find it amusing that there is a large swimming pool on the top deck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach out and easily rip it from the ship. A few people had tumbled into it when I shook it, but I don't care. I'm thirsty, so I just bring the swimming pool to my lips and suck its contents. Of course, the people that were desperately trying to swim out of the pool end up going down the hatch with the thousands of gallons of water it contained, but I hardly care. It's not the first thing it has happened. One gets used to this sort of accidents when she gets my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep wading around the ship and reach its stern. Feeling curious, I crouch and reach with a hand under the area where it meets the water. I find a handhold and start pulling upwards, the entire rear of the ship lifting and sending countless people sliding forward in deck after deck. Then, without warning, I let go, letting the ship meet the water again with a loud splash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep circling the ship, now wading along the opposite side, looking with curiosity at all the tiny people that are trying to scurry away from me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a group gets dangerously close to the edge of the top deck, I force a sudden twirl and giggle as my large breast hits them with enough force to send them flying. Since I'm at it, I complete my turn and rest my two large boobs on the deck, trapping a couple more unsuspecting groups under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've long learned that despite how soft they look to me, each of my breasts weighs a few hundred tons. In a way, they have become the weapons of mass destruction classmates had always claimed they were. So, I have no doubt about the fate of the people I've trapped under them. I just keep going, making my tits break through the upper deck and through another indeterminate number of decks until they are all the way in. When I remove my self from the ship there are two massive holes leading deep into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HOPE THEY AT LEAST DIED HAPPY\" I mock aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI peek and lone terrified guy at the bottom of one of them. I cannot have that, so I reach into the ship and pluck him out. The inch-tall man is soon held between two fingertips, right in front of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'D HATE IT IF YOU THOUGHT I HAD DISCRIMINATED YOU OUT OF SOME REASON. IT'S JUST THAT YOU ARE TOO SMALL AND TOO MANY TO NOTICE. BUT HEY, LET ME MAKE UP TO YOU\" I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I bring him to my swollen nipple, which must be about his size, and push him. I feel the plop soon enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the prow of the ship again soon enough. I turn my hand into a claw and easily rip the roof of the superstructure away, exposing the bridge. A man is trying to dash to the door, so I just bring a finger in, pinch him against the floor and pop him like a grape. I don't have to say anything for the rest to understand that I don't want them to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look really nice, dressed in their whites. I smile at them and ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO, WHO'S THE SKIPPER?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in his fifties but looking lean and sharp raises his hand. I smile at him warmly. I'm about to switch my register. I'm very skilled at mass destruction but years of bullying others in high school have left me with a liking for personal interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the greatest thing about my size is that it allows me to do both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI extend a finger and bring it to the bridge, rotating it and exposing it to the captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CLIMB INTO MY FINGERTIP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man hesitates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK, I CAN THINK ON PLENTY OF STUFF TO THREATEN YOU WITH, BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT AN IDEA ALREADY. WHATEVER YOU THINK MAY HAPPEN IF YOU CLIMB, IT WILL BE WORSE IF YOU DON'T\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nods and then I giggle as he tries to take a foothold in my fingernail in order to climb up. He is quite in shape, and he manages to get into my fingertip soon enough. I curl it, to prevent him from falling, and lift him to my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surprises me when he asks: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY\" I casually reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you have fun torturing people?\" he protests<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, DON'T JUDGE BEFORE YOU'VE TRIED IT. ALTHOUGH, UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, I DON'T THINK YOU'LL EVER BE IN A POSITION TO TRY. THE ONLY ONE BESIDES ME WOULD BE TIM, REALLY, AND THAT WIMPY BASTARD I CALL BOYFRIEND IS TOO STUPID TO EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S MISSING\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't kill anyone else on my boat\" the man says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slam my fist on a group of people on the top deck, obliterating them before breaking through a few more decks. Looking at the captain I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a monster!\" he protests<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SEE THAT YOU GET THE IDEA\" I let out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks so cute, so red faced and enraged about my actions, that it almost feels sad to just smash him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I THINK I LIKE YOU\" I say. \"YOU DESERVE A CHANCE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, I bring him to the top of my head and drop him there. The sun is really shining hot today and my hair has already dried. I have really long, really abundant hair and without a hairdryer or any cosmetics around, there's not too much I can do to take it any less volume. I don't mind too much, though. I've seen myself and I like the lioness look it conveys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when I drop the tiny man there he is really dropped in a jungle of golden vines. It's wild, but it also gives him a chance to get a hold of plenty of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF YOU STILL THERE BY THE TIME I GET BACK HOME TONIGHT, I'LL LET YOU GO\" I promise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I forget about him and look to the city's skyline. Time to do some shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would just feel unnatural to leave the cruise ship alone, in any case, so the moment I reach its back, I steer it in the direction I'm aiming and then give it a push that sends it forward with way more momentum than it has ever had. My aim was perfect. I see that there is nothing that anyway will be able to do to prevent my cruise ship to ram into the tanker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, I'm very fond of myself. Turning towards the city, I ponder about how to make my entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I chose this city at random I did not think on its suspension bridge. Now that I'm looking at it from the distance, I cannot take my eyes away from it. I like it... and I say it for real. I appreciate the architecture. My father's an architect and he used to tell me about bridges when we went on a road trip. I did not pick any real interest on becoming an architect myself, as he would have liked, but I became quite fond of bridges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first choice for my career had been model, of course. In the unlikely event that I could not achieve my goal, I was planning on becoming a bloodsucking lawyer, much to my father's dismay. Architects don't like lawyers, for some reason. I did not know that I could choose Goddess, back at the time. The path was actually pretty simple: get involved with the local nerd with the hopes of getting an A that can bring your average up enough to get considered at an Ivy League university and wait for him to mess up and turn both of you into skyscraper-sized teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I'm the terror of the world's population and the object of envy of at least half the girls my age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you ask: my father is alive and well. So is my mother. I have no siblings to worry about, which is part of the reason I've always been told I was so self-centered. The thing is: I love my family. It actually goes further than this. I've left my hometown mostly alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, some stuff got broken right after we grew and when the cops first got upset. Could not be avoided. But I've been quite careful afterwards, even when I was executing some personal vendettas. Pleasanton made me queen of the prom, sent me to the state beauty contest and almost worshiped me before this happened to me. It's only fair that I'm benevolent to it. The country is big enough to play somewhere else, in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, my town mates were not too convinced about my intentions at first and wanted to flee. I guess I can understand them. It took a little bit of a talk to get the to see the light. Well, that and blocking every exit route out of town. I brought the bridge down and dug two trenches deep and wide enough to be considered canyons in the other two exit roads. Then I dictated my rules. Ruling a town of 26,000 is harder than destroying a city of millions. I know what I'm talking about, I spent one week at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I said, I love my family, so one of my first decrees was to get them the largest house in town: Bale's manor. It was a magnificent mansion and it had enough land around it for me to visit safely. Bale's heir did not like it too much and protested, so he became the first person I ever ate. Once I thought everything was clear and settled I got awake one night, feeling some unrest. Sitting up it was easy enough for me the procession of people with torches advancing to my new family's home. I got there in time to intercept them. Well, my foot did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, I was incredibly upset, so I crouched down and picked them up, one by one. By the time I finished, I had a handful. I reminded the rules to the rest of town, let them know what would happen if anyone as much as looked at my parents and then closed my fist, crushing fifty or so attackers into a bloody pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to calm my parents afterwards, especially my mother, who was really shocked at suddenly being so hated by everyone else in town. I tried to make her see that things were better but when I reached out to her with my gory right hand she almost had a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that I was not sharing enough of what had happened to me with my family. I felt a little guilty. I mean: I had limitless power and possibilities. Once you have everything, you can share and you still will have everything, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI commanded all sorts of stuff to the government guys that work with Tim the day after. I wanted money to be given to my parents, I wanted servants, I wanted a helicopter at their disposal. I've also made a habit to bring them some souvenir of the cities I visit. It's typically a sculpture or similar. I've created some sort of museum of the country's wonders in their backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm doing my best to be a good daughter. I take them for walks. I've found the spot between my shoulder blades is pretty convenient to safely carry a couple of people. I have dinner with them three times a week. And no, I don't eat people then. Mum is really upset about that. Of course, she knows. My life is a 24/7 reality TV program ever since I grew. Once I tried to explain to her how it was just much more convenient than all the massive logistic nightmare the government guys had to go through every time we had dinner together. She did not talk over the rest of the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad is quieter about it, but I know he also does not understand. I overheard them talking once about how their sweetie had become a killer. Of course they did not call me monster. They are my parents, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of weeks, I've lost any hopes at them understanding. They just don't get it. They don't realize that I've suddenly turned into something else. I mean, it's like... I'm not a human anymore. Call me goddess, call me whatever you want...I don't even care about names. But I'm not the same as everyone else. The way I see it there are only two differences, but they are THE differences:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. My power is overwhelming. I swatted the two army task forces they sent at me like flies. Didn't get scratches, didn't break a sweat. So, basically, I get to do anything I want and no one can do shit about it. I'm above right and wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Having become larger, the world has suddenly become a playground. Everything around me are nothing more than toys<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been doing a bit of thinking, you know? And I've reached the conclusion that there are only two things someone like me can do: rule the world or have fun. Well, there's a third if you are Tim: whine and try to actually fix it, but I don't even consider that an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week trying with my 26,000 people hometown, I'm fed up of ruling, which basically leaves me with one and only thing to do. Which is what I'm doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God! I really god derailed. All I wanted to tell you is that the suspension bridge is really nice. My father would have liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm already next to it and smile at the hundreds of cars trapped in the pile-up that unavoidably forms every time I show up. Then I bring my fingers to the suspension wires and I fake playing the harp. I cannot get any sound out of them. But I feel the steel cables giving a little under the immense power of my fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that you know what comes after that. I decide that the bridge will either produce some sound or die trying. It's the latter. When my fingers casually snap four wires in a row the rest start snapping out of their own will, like dominoes, suddenly not being able to hold the entire weight of the structure. A large section of the roadway gets unattached from the cables and turns 90 degrees, sending dozens of cars into the bay water below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll along the bridge, car doors are flying open and people start filling the lanes between vehicles. When I curiously lift three of them between my fingers, many of their colleagues think that it's actually a good idea to get out of the bridge and start jumping into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly losing interest, I let the three people in my finger, two men and a woman, roll into my extended palm and then I blow them a goodbye kiss, sending them flying a few hundred feet before they drop into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I crouch and focus on the increasing number of inch-sized people in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW THE WATER IS SOOTHING AND SUCH BUT... DO YOU THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?\" I ask. \"I'VE HEARD THAT THERE ARE TREACHEROUS CURRENTS IN THIS AREA\" I conclude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing my hand in the water, I start to gently rotate it in a wide arc. Then, I increase the speed as I go. Soon I have the whirlpool I was looking for. And soon after one person after the other start getting dragged by it. I stop my movement, letting the whirlpool in autopilot and sand up to focus back on the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a large bridge and I'm not int he mood to waste too much longer with it. So, I just raise a first and smash it into one of the sections at the end of the bridge closer to where I am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I walk along the bridge, casting my shadow over the terrified on its road. I can almost sympathize with the poor fuckers. They don't want to stay on the bridge but they know they can also not jump to the water. And if by any chance they could think of a third option I guess they're sure I'll find an even more creative way to deal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is that they're toast since the first moment I set my eyes on the bridge. They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time to be caught in one of my games. A great many people have shared their luck over the last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the end of the bridge and grab two handfuls of cables. Then I start pulling up. I'm more than strong enough to rip the roadway from its pillars, lifting the end I'm not standing at and beginning to tilt the overall structure. I keep going until I see cars and people start to unavoidably slide towards the spot I punched through. A minute and a few shakes later, every person and vehicle on the bridge is on the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do with the structure, I just tossed it forward without too much ceremony, letting it sink in the river and drag a great many people with it. It's not as if I need a bridge to cross, in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back to the city and smile. I'm eager to get to my next stop</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's curious how every time I step out of the water and into a city the first victims are not those under my foot but the ones being carried away by the waterfalls raining down my legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm of course large enough to be seen, so when the spot I will use to emerge out of the water becomes obvious, people do their best to clear the area. It never gives them more than half a dozen steps of head start, but I think my feet have not yet ended up on anyone as I took my first step out into dry land. Half a dozen steps is not enough for them to clear the tide, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple of times I was actually surprised that someone could actually die like this. I've now already learned that, with my size, everything I do has an impact. I could be the gentlest girl in the world and just go for a sightseeing tour of the city and still hundreds would die. It was the realization of this, pretty early on, that helped me embrace my full power. Tim has not yet understood it and his life has actually gone to worse more or less in the same order of magnitude than mine has improved. I've gained the power to do anything I please at the same time he's become so scared of moving that has kind of secluded himself. It must be a miserable life, even when you add into the equation that he got to fuck me as a consequence of all the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm thinking about this as I reach the first survivors of my tidal wave. There's no way they are going to survive my feet. I love the way they sink in the asphalt every time I take a step, oblivious of whatever is on their way. I got infatuated with my footprints early on. Each of them leaves a well-contoured mark of my presence, making the road look just like Walk of Fame in Hollywood, only I'm the only star around. I also thoroughly enjoy the fact that once I've moved along a road, there's no way it can be used by anyone who does not share my size. This would technically include both Tim and me, but he has chosen to stay back home and whine all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more steps and I've already reached one of the avenues of the city, which feels like a canyon of glass and steel. In this area none of the skyscrapers can reach much higher than my shaved crotch, but I can already see that deeper into downtown a few of them will actually get taller than me. A few days ago somebody asked me if I got upset when that happened, but I can't just see why. A skyscraper cannot step on people, or boss them around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange as it may sound coming from me, I'm not obsessed with height. I mean, I'm just happy like this. Large enough to be unbeatable and small enough that the scale of the world still allows me to mess with individual people and move around. If I were offered to grow taller than the tallest skyscraper I would probably reject it. I mean, what would be the benefit of being, let's say, a thousand feet tall? I mean, it's impossible to become twice as invincible, for example. And then, everything and everyone around me would become just too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, it would have some marginal advantages. I would be able to move faster, reaching more of the country in shorter times. But I'm already pretty damn fast and improving my speed would not compensate for having a harder time talking to mom and dad or for making interaction with the inhabitants of the cities I'm fucking with harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I think that my current height is more or less ideal. Or at least it has been so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night I was reflecting that there also seems to be something similar to an ideal height for buildings too, at least when it comes to face me. The ones next to me now are probably just there, in the center of what I got to call \"height safety range\". It goes from right above my knees to somewhat under my breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShorter than that, and I can easily step on its roof, which I relish on doing, by the way. Taller than that and they already get at a height where I can stoop and mess with the people inside. As I thought about it, I wondered if anyone is keeping a stat of how many buildings are getting spared just because they are at a height that is not convenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a goddess, I always strive to improve, and a key to that is originality, so I've decided that today I'm going to learn to play with some of the toys the world has put at my disposal and I had not been using yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop and look down at the pretty unremarkable roof of the crotch-high building to my right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told you that my father was an architect, didn't I? He was not successful into making me choose his same career, but this does not mean that he did not try. The apparently useless knowledge he gave me over my years at high school has suddenly become handy in the most unexpected of circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know stuff a 500 foot tall girl like me should not know, like which are the best points to apply pressure in order to remove a roof as much in one piece as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love the reaction of the dozens of people in the top floor. One instant they were looking at my snatch through the windows and now they are looking upwards, at my smiling face peeking through the valley between my mountainous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot prevent a giggle when my eyes catch a guy with his pants down and his hand on his obviously excited cock, facing the window. It's not the first time it has happened to me over the last week, but it still manages to amaze me. I mean, with my looks I'm more than used to making men excited... but I would have thought that going Godzilla on their cities would take away some of my sex appeal. Apparently, it has not... at least not for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach down and deftly pick the inch tall pervert between my fingertips. Bringing him in front of my face, I smile at him and I ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAPPY TO SEE ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wiggles in my fingertips, but there's no way he is going to break away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DON'T NEED TO DO YOURSELF. I'M HAPPY TO HELP\" I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just wiggles in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE ME JUST A SEC\" I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people on the building are finally reacting to my presence, a chunk of them heading to the stairs and elevators. I reach down with my free hand and push two of the leading ones in their dash for the exit with my fingertip. It just takes a little more pressure to crush them and send them to the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T RECALL HAVING TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD LEAVE\" I say. I bring my fingers into the floor and start walking them, herding the people. With my privileged view of the situation, I can devise a destination and a route. Soon, the majority of the occupants of the floor I've exposed to the world are confined into a large meeting room. Once they're there, it takes almost no effort to pick a few heavy-looking pieces of furniture up and to barricade the doors. Now that I know that they will be waiting for me now that I'm done, I switch my attention back to the guy I've come to name \"the pervert\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think he believes that I'm going to crush him when I reach out with two fingers of my free hand. I don't do that. I just finish ripping his pants off. I examine him and see that his erection is gone. I guess that this situation can do this to a man. I don't care. I just stick my tongue out and reach out with its tip. I feel something tiny harden almost instantly and I giggle once more when I move the man further from my face and see that his erection is back with a passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't say anything. I just move him back to my mouth and start small licking movements. Less than ten seconds later I feel something that cannot be anything else than his discharge. Bringing my tongue back in, I feel the salty taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DID YOU ENJOY?\" I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nods frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD. NOW IT'S MY TURN. KEEP ME EXCITED FOR LONG ENOUGH AND I MAY LET YOU LIVE\" I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further word, I bring him down and carefully set him on my clit. I wait for him to have a good hold and forget about him. Well, I do not entirely forget about him. He feels good down there and I can tell he is trying hard. I have some experience. Of course, he is way too inconsequential to achieve anything too remarkable, but he keeps me aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of course, makes me wilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down to get the building at the right height, I bring a finger to my crotch to verify that the man is still in place and then focus on the crowd I've gathered in the meeting room. My tits come down like twin wrecking balls and crush about half of them. The other half are trapped between my mounds and the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL LIVE IS IF YOU MAKE ME HAPPY. KISS THEM, MASSAGE THEM, LICK THEM... BUT MAKE ME FUCKING HORNY OR YOU'LL BECOME AN EARLY LUNCH\" I threaten<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the people need some time to react. They always do. I know I'm shocking. Most of them get eventually at it. The few that don't end up in my stomach as promised, making the ones that followed my instruction doubly as applied to their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's in moments like this that I wish they were not so pathetic compared to me. Of course, there is excitement, but the majority of it is more mental than anything else. Still, I moan, encouraging them to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since I've grown, the only thing that can have an effect on me is someone my size. This reduces the possibilities to Tim and myself. And since Tim is not around, I just bring my fingers into my sweet spot. I remember about the man there when he gets smashed in the first stroke. Then I forget about him and keep going. I don't realize about the fact that I've smeared the people working on my tits until I'm about to go off. When I do, I embed myself further in the building with the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scream, the entire city learning about my orgasm. Nearby windows shatter and I've been told that a few people has become deaf in similar circumstances in the previous days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, I remove myself from the building and stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOPS, I DID IT AGAIN\" I say aloud, teasing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mob has used the time I used to... ummm... satisfy my needs to get a little farther away from me. Nothing that I cannot solve with a few strides, but I want to make things a little more interesting. So, I get down on all fours and I start crawling after them, pushing my ass out and letting my generous rack dangle over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize that I'm being sluttier than needed, but hey! I just feel like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands and knees sink in the asphalt with the same easy as my feet did; now I'm really leaving my hand prints on the road like some average Hollywood actress. As I advance, my head is level with what must be the tenth or fifteenth floor of the buildings that frame the wide avenue. I can see hundreds of faces glued behind the windows, so I wink at them but largely ignore them, keeping in mind what my objective is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the crowd shortly afterwards. Of course, I could just trample them under my body, but that would be too standard. Part of them fun in being me is to be creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need a drink, so I just flick a hydrant with two fingers and then proceed to drink from the geyser that comes out of it. When my thirst is quenched, I just use my fingers to redirect the high pressure water stream, hitting the crowd hard as if I were some sort of riot cop. Their fragility to things that are so harmless to me never ceases to amaze me, no matter how used to it I am already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm feeling playful, so I just set two fingers on the ground and start walking them towards the crowd. Their sight alone is able to scare them, each of my fingers easily towering several times over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the crowd soon enough and just push my way into it. Once I'm in the middle of it, I start \"kicking people around\". Their screams intensify and then someone does something utterly stupid and shoots my fingers. Of course, it has no effect. My finger's retribution is considerably more effective as I pin him to the ground and cut him in half under my auburn fingernail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams get louder and people start running around in a wilder way. I get bored and just slam my fist on them. Then I slam it again in a different section for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then advance deeper into the crowd, not minding that my palms and knees are creating a little massacre as I do. My attention is focused somewhere else. I cannot prevent a few chuckles when I see that my long blonde locks are long enough to reach the road and are wrecking havoc on their own. Feeling playful, I move my head, sending them flying around and making a few of the tinies airborne as I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GUYS CANNOT EVEN FIGHT MY HAIR\" I say, really amused at the results of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach then groans and the yells from the ground tell me that the crowd already knows what's coming. Time usually flies when I'm having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out, I pick a tiny woman with two fingers and bring her in front of my eyes. Smiling and using a soothing voice, I ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT TIME IS IT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman needs a full minute to tell me it's well past 1pm. Time really, really flies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman has been helpful so I just set her to my side and focus on my meal. Reaching to the side of the avenue, I pick an 18-wheeler which is about as big as my hand. I rip the tractor off and then the axles with the wheels with delicacy. Once I'm done, I rip the roof and the back door. Happy with the result, I pick it from the front and push the resulting half-opened cabin into the thick crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy idea works and a couple dozen people get trapped into the cargo area, scooped as if I had used a spoon. They go directly to my waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the lessons my parents made sure to teach me when I was little was not to play with the food, so I don't. I release my morsels, chew and swallow, and then I'm ready for another spoonful. I know I could do anything I pleased, like with everything else, but my parent's teaching stick, at least for this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has not prevented me from torturing and killing more than a few people in my mouth, but that's when I'm not having meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was thick enough to satiate me. I may even have eaten a little too much. I should not have. Tonight I am having dinner with my parents. I always get a little sleepy after lunch, so I stand up and look for a suitable spot for a nap. A ballpark looks appealing enough to me, so I trample some of the survivors of my lunch and move towards it, not caring to look at my feet a single time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach my destination and easily step into it through the spot where the stalls get shorter. It's not the first time I've used one of these, so I know what comes next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to the opposite side of the pitch in three steps, sit down and rest my back and head into the northern stalls. When I'm sure that I'm comfortable enough I address an invisible audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW YOU'RE THERE. I COULD BRING THIS BALLPARK DOWN, BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED ON IT. I WILL LEAVE YOU ALONE. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TUNE THE NEWS INTO THE JUMBOTRON. I WANT FOX NEWS. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than three minutes later the red face of Chuck McCormick shows up on the large screen. I love listening to him. He is so upset about me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Today spoilt brat has decided to visit Bandberg. As usual, she stepped on countless people and ate several others. Today she has also been reported to sink two large cruise ships, destroy Bandberg's bay bridge and to bring down an office building</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has been referring to me as \"spoilt brat\" for a while now. It's not that I like it, but seeing how red his face gets and how his eyes are about to pop from their sockets when he says it is quite amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, do you know what the government is doing about it? Nothing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDude, they already tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The mightiest country in the world and we are humiliated by an 18-year-old bitch</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep! That sounds about right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where the hell are the nukes?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa! He is asking the government to nuke me? Tim already said that it would not have any more effect than anything they had tried so far but if they did it would be like... gross!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Out of all the good American girls in the country, this had to happen to Amanda Stones, a person that does not represent any of our values</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, back when I was 5'10\", blonde and with a killer body and won one beauty pageant after the other I was kind of tired of hearing about how I was the perfect American girl. It's curious what a few hundred feet can do to your reputation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's a girl that walks her naked body around the country, who has sex in public, who doesn't have any respect for the symbols of our nation</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess he is referring to that time I used that statue to...um... well, you get the idea. I guess I'm not conservative enough for him. I can hardly blame him for thinking that. I just hope that he does not learn that my dad actually belonged to a socialist organization back in College!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Our commander in chief should take care about her now! If he cannot, he should resign and let someone with the balls to do what needs to be done take his place</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor guy! The President is really having a hard time because of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cut for some commercials and I realize that I'm feeling sleepier. I've had enough of my daily dose of McCormick's hate. I love watching him. The way he gets upset about me is really funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CAN SWITCH THIS OFF NOW\" I say to whoever it was that was operating the jumbotron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooting forward I lie down and wait to doze off. As I do, I have a naughty idea.</span></div></div>",

I smiled at the imaginary dullness of the tinies looking surprised at this. Well, if they didn't know already they know now there is a giantess in town, or near it at least, and I bet they are all scared shitless. I'm used to seeing panicking people, it gives me such a buzz, multitudes panicking because of me, a regular girl, albeit large and naked, the number of times I've caught myself with my fingers between my legs.. And when people are scared shitless it makes them do all sorts of stupid stuff, so a lot easier to squish them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the city awaits, I suppose I can't keep them waiting, and watching me as I tear everything apart, and I am sure they want a spectacle. How shall I make my entrance. I put my finger to my mouth and ponder. It didn't take long. I always loved Godzilla movies when I was the same size as these tiny creatures which are such fun to crush and in the first movie he came ashore through the docks. Here I am, the sea, a reasonable depth, and I can do underwater swimming, the docks over there.....heehee, brilliant, even though I say it myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wade out to sea to give myself a run in, and they will no doubt be thinking I'm going and they will breath a sigh of relief, but just wait.....Having gone what must have a few miles out to sea to them I turned towards the city, took a deep breath, and went underwater. It didn't take long to get back to the city swimming underwater so I didn't have to hold my breath for long. If the Godzilla movies are anything to go by, my progress would have been marked by increased waves and maybe some small boats capsizing but nothing serious enough to spoil the suspense and surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was my surprise, suddenly surfacing from the water, cascades of the stuff coming off my body, it must have been a sight to them to see me there smiling, hands on hips. Then even more so as I walked towards the shore and the docks, I watched smaller boats sink as I waded, they always seem to do that, also the ending of more lives without me having to lift a finger. Then I climbed on to some larger ships as a step up to the shore, careful not to lose my balance as they moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOooo that first crunch as my foot slammed onto some warehouses, squashing them flat, that was ecstasy. Onto dry ground, or now wet as the destruction at my footsteps was accompanied by fountains of water dripping off my body and drowning those who escaped the destruction. As I flattened the dock installations and knocked over the cranes I delighted in watching the panicking hordes. Thinking they were safe when I went out to sea they had had less time to think about escaping, which was fine by me, destroying a city which was living normally just moments before is just so much more interesting tan something half empty with people taking measures to save themselves. Several bloody squishy crunches followed as I tackled the crowds before starting on the front ranks of buildings next to the docks........</span></div></div>",

Pushing over and smashing the skyscrapers near the docks was such a blast, I got really turned on by the full on nature of my assault, so I just continued. I suspect 1000s of tinies died during this, but that's just too bad. They help make destruction so much more realistic, otherwise I might as well just step on cardboard boxes to fit them in the dustbin/garbage can. Anyway the destruction made me horny that I found myself rubbing between my legs and actually getting quite moist, well a girl must cater for her needs as the wimp Tim is not available, or even when he is, I joked to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway enough of this, I set myself a target, just for fun, to go over the million, I don't know how I'm going to count though, red blotches tend to mix together. I suppose I won't know until the news networks tell me, or Tim.........I'm so fed up with his whining, why doesn't he just live the life? First step in this is a few more steps, there are queues of crunchy cars trying to escape, with tinies in them, I count on my fingers, say 4 per car and......anyway no time to lose as I stretch my foot forward and step on the back of the queues of cars, mmmm, exquisite, the tickling of the cool metal, the soft squishing of their occupants. I can't help but topple more structures into the mix, I'm that kind of girl, a rich mixture of textures with concrete and glass there too. I took my time savouring every step, but it was over too quickly. I really need to be more assertive and order more people to join the queues...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, heaven........I spied a stadium, and it was large and could fit so any people in, walking over to it, carelessly destroying structures and squishing people in my path, well if they must be in my way, and looking at it..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
