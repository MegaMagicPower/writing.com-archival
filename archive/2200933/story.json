Its walls are made of stone. I recognize this place, it's the city of Windhelm. The center of the Rebellion.<br>\r\nI've played Skyrim for years, but never like this. I favored the Stormcloaks, their efforts of fighting back for their homeland is a worthy cause. I felt as those it was job to join their army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A few weeks later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the battle, the final battle, which took place at the capital of Skyrim. Solitude. Ulfric Stormcloak proudly shouts his speech, one of glory and revenge. Then bloodshed began. I was fighting alongside the Stormcloaks. My pride and strength in every swing of my glass greatsword. I slashed wounds in the Imperials, dismembered many Thalmor, and smashed in the skulls of my enemies. I was the Dragonborn, I fought for what I believed was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to bring peace to Skyrim, the civil war must end. Running up to the gates, after slaying more Imperials, I spotted a Nord boy, young enough to be a boy, old enough to be mistaken as a man. He was ducking, avoiding the boiling rages of the soldiers. He grabs a pointed rock, sharp enough to stab someone in the chest. He charges at the nearest soldier. Unfortunately, for me, it is a Stormcloak battlemage. I spot a dead Imperial Archer, his bow and iron arrows still intact.<br>\r\nDo I...</span></div></div>",

A few feet away from me I hear a shout. It was a different shout of pain than what the soldiers, with their matured throats, could do. It was a woman's scream of grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around, and I see the redguard woman kneeling on the ground, tears in her eyes. I saw a blackened figure in her lap, twitching ever so slightly. It was the boy, burned by a powerful fireball spell. His body twitched, then went as limp as a skeever caught with an arrow, his eyes look straight at me. I've played Skyrim for so long, I knew curses existed. Just then I knew the boy's soul cursed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman cries loudly, grabbing the attention of the nearby soldiers. This caused an issue within the Stormcloaks, now they're distracted from the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the nine divines, shut the woman up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swing at a few more soldiers to see what's going on. An Imperial healer rushes to the aid of the woman. I look at the still undamaged bow.</span></div></div>",

You asked Serena hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know, I don't want to hurt you, but neither want to loss you, so I need to put you where I can feel you to be sure that you are ok, mmm...\" She turned her head down thinking deeply, and saw her well worn boots she was wearing and a idea come to her. \"Well you maybe wouldn't like this idea, but maybe I can put you in one of my boots until we reach a city or something, I think there other places.\" Adjusting her bra a little seductively. \"But we don't know each other that well yet.\" Serena said leaving the possibility to put you in other places in a future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok if you think is a good idea, but there is another issue I only bought the house in Solitude so far, and we are in a dungeon close to Riften.\" You said wanting Serena to think in a better place to put you since this gonna be a long trip <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? I know this gonna be a long trip, but comon, you are the mighty Dragonborn and I will be gentle I promise, also I will heal you with an area spell from time to time to be sure that you are ok, so what do you think you accept that, or we gonna stay here until other adventurers comes? personally I don't care I'm a vampiress and I already waited some centuries in that other dungeon you found me, so I can wait some years here too.\" Serena said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, defeated, accepted that Serena put you in her boot since you had your doubts about being able to wait years to be rescued, as you might have endured that long being the Dragonborn, but you were not so sure about that, so you went with Serena's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena crossed her right leg above her left one, grabbed the bottom of her boot with her free hand, and pulled, the boot came out with an audible pop sound, then she took her thick sock off, which comes out slowly since was glued to the skin by a layer of sweat, finally when her toes where freed they wiggled happily for their newfound freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now Bugborn here is where you gonna be during the trip, this way I surely will feel you and know for sure that you are all right, so in you go\" Serena said tucking you inside her sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what you called me?, I'm the Dragonborn not the Bugborn\" you screamed while falling through the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I think that the Bugborn is a better title for the time being, now don't move because here come my foot.\" Serena said amused with the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw five digits coming closer to you, they looked excited to play with you, finally they reached you, and grabbed you in a vice, squeezing you trying to figure out if they liked you in there or not, at the end they decided to pass you from toe space, to toe space hugging you in each space, as a welcome for their new roommate, you ended between fourth and pinky toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time Serena was amused watching a small lump inside her sock, manipulating and playing with it with her toes, after some minutes she calmed a little, and lodged the tiny Bugborn between her fourth and pinky toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Bugborn I will put back on my boot now, I will let you take a break when we reach Windhelm ok? Serena asked you with a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing how to respond from the insides of the sock, you simply gave a lick to the pinky toe, which caused that the toes around you gave you a squeeze back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that felt great Bugborn thank you, I will take that as a yes, you can do that from time to time during the trip, to thank me for help you, I see you in Windhelm then, so bye Bugborn\" Serena said finally putting on her boot and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the dungeon, and started her way to Windhelm first her idea was to travel to Windhelm from there to Whiterun, and finally to Solitude where you the Dragonborn had a house where to plan what to do next, and learn how to cure you if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked slowly and carefully to step as softly as possible with the foot you where in, in other hand she was enjoying the feeling between her toes wiggling them occasionally, to feel your struggles and licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inside her boot and sock where more or less comfortable, the things you disliked where, the intense pressure, the motion, and the oppressive vinegary aroma, but you noticed the care Serena had while stepping softly on you, the temperature wasn't an issue neither the frozen lands of Skyrim compensated the heat of being inside a boot and thick sock, also the soft skin embracing you was somehow comforting you, so was a passable situation in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Serena found some bandits so she started to fight, casting spells to them, and running a little dodging their attacks, wasn't a hard fight since she was a powerful vampiress, and the fellow companion of the Dragonborn, so she ended with them quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you however it was another story, the ruckus launched you under the big toe and your legs, where trapped under the ball of the foot, so you couldn't move, looked like Serena noticed this since she started to poke you with that toe, but for you more than a poke was a mighty battering on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you are there can you rub my toe a little, I will poke you whenever I want little massage ok?\" Serena asked waiting a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wasn't so sure, but you licked her toe as before to let her know that you accepted request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Bugborn.\" Serena said rubbing the tip of her boot on the ground in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you the pressure increased for a moment, you got smashed, while she was <b>\"thanking you.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was close to Windhelm when the sun started to rise up above in the sky, was dawn time, and as a vampiress she preferred to avoid it, so she ran the last bit of the road to town, smashing you more under her toe while you where rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she got into the inn, and calmed down, approaching to the reception. \"Hello there I want a room please.\" Serena Asked to the Receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course the price is twenty septims please.\" Said the receptionist, and Serena just paid quietly. \"Thank you very much your room is the last one in the left side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena walked once again stepping softly when stepping on you, when she entered her room she seated in her bed, lying down lazily for moment, she was exhausted after all, since she cleared a dungeon at your side, then someone shrunk you, leaving her with the responsibility and stress to look after you, and also she walked for a while and had little fight with bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you when everything calmed down, you started to heard a familiar song far from you, and muffled through the boot and sock, but still very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our hero, our hero claims a warrior's heart, I tell you, I tell you The Dragonborn comes.\" The bard sings far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard enough you where in a inn and you knew it, you started to lick Serena big toe madly, wanting to get her attention, to make her take you out of your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah I know, I was just taking a breath\" Serena said clamping her big toe on you preventing you from moving at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her other boot first, taking as long as possible too, she had developed a pleasure to have you under her sore foot, so she wanted you there as much as possible, but also liked you as friend and maybe something more in the future, not to mention that she was also grateful to you for rescuing her from the dungeon originally, so she didn't want to upset you, she only wanted to enjoy the feeling of you under her foot as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she took you from her boot, and sock, she shook the sock contents in her hand, dropping you in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last.\" You said breathing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wasn't that bad, right? Serena asked you interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but still want to enjoy the fresh air.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't that bad then huh, then what you say to sleep in my sock through the day, until we can leave again at night.\" Serena said expecting that you accept her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" you decided to...</span></div></div>",
