Just as you are about to enter the narrow doorway a knife thuds into the framework where only seconds ago your throat had been. You smile, yep, this is your kind of place all right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inn is crowded. Folk from all over the world are gathered here. Most, like you, looking to be recruited by the various warlords and ladies that habitually travel here. You lean up against the bar, having forced yourself through the crowds with varying degrees of politeness. Behind the bar is a large mirror, useful for keeping an eye on your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you see when you look at yourself?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The figure is clothed entirely in black from head to foot, except for a pair of steel gray eyes. Suddenly, the figure levels a handheld crossbow and levels it at your heart. You quickly dodge the bolt and dive to your bag to retrieve a weapon. You pull out a dagger and spin around to meet your foe. The figure pulls out a jagged knife and dives at you. You quickly knock the figure's arm aside and gash the figure's face. The figure gives a yelp of surprise, and you hesitate for a moment, realizing that it's a woman that's attacking you.

Swirling the goblet of mead, I watched the golden liquid lap around like a tiny ocean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the repast, I pounded the lumpy, musty-smelling bed with my fists, bidding it to be more welcome to my weary body.  My armor, I removed, though my chest and leg plates stood nearby.  My dagger, as always, remained strapped securely to my right ankle with a leather bond.  I hit the pillow, my face covered by my long, raven hair as I lay wary on my back.  Not much sleep would be had tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had seen the lustful stares of several males, all mercenaries, as I'd made my way up to the barkeep's station.  It has always been difficult being a female in this line of work, but since I am able to fight, slash, dismember and escape unscathed, I feel I should be treated as they are.  Perhaps not in this century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assignment I would be getting tomorrow-would it take me on as far a trip as I'd just returned from?  Would I find the terms to be reasonable?  What about the danger?  I tossed restlessly upon the lumpy mattress and beat the pillow one last time before getting a few hours' spotty sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I awoke, as I always do, with my right hand wrapped around the handle of my dagger.  The sunlight was spotty, choking its way through thick clouds which promised rain.  I jumped up, washed quickly with the tepid water in my bedside bucket, and strapped on my armor.  This would be a day to remember.</span></div></div>",

His gaze never leaves yours and your opinion of his skill goes up a notch or two. \"We don't coddle our troops though,\" he says and you get the impression that he's honestly amused now. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you... </span></div></div>",

After a few more spoonfuls you decide to send them on their way, you don\u2019t need a job right now, and certainly don\u2019t want to get mixed up in something straight away. You\u2019ve only just finished a very well paid job, mainly disposing of a certain troublesome lord who was taking too much liberty with outlying villages to his county.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman speaking cleared her throat looking for a reply, which you happily gave; <br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m ok for now.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cVery well\u2026Sir.\u201d <br>\r\nThe last bit had a little venom in it showing that just like the last town you weren\u2019t making too many friends. Fine by you, friends only give weakness, just another target for others that is more difficult to protect. You loom up as a waitress comes over, and hands you a large key and says; \u201cRoom 34, 2nd floor 3 door to the right.\u201d then leaves taking away your now empty bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realise that you haven\u2019t slept for just under a week. Which will defiantly cause a lack of awareness if it carries on, so you take your leave getting up and moving over to the stairwell which will lead you to your bed. Before you disappear you can see the woman who came up to you on a table, which is surrounded by several males, all engrossed in a conversation, plus somebody as stupid enough to thrust a thumb your way obviously making a statement about you, mental note; to keep weapons close when you go to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach your room, and unlock the door with a heavy click and step into the candle lit room. Basically furnished all it had was a bed, a table next to it, a mirror on one of the walls directly over a basin for washing off the grim of the road. Walking over to the mirror you sigh and look at your reflection; an unshaven rugged face looked back. Dark circles round your eyes cast an even deeper shadow over your face. Your hair; black, ragged from many days of lack of washing, the local bathhouses would be a welcome break. Your fringe hung over your eyes obscuring them from any watchers at more than a meter away, making it easy to watch someone without them noticing. You step back and look at the clothes and equipment you carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most noticeable thing about you is the dark clothes you ware, as you execute most your objectives during the cloak of night. The long cloak is great for hiding several items, mostly throwing knives, and making sure your purse was safe so nobody could find it to slit it. You chuckle at that thought; the last petty thief to have tried to cut your purse now has a constant limp. You unsling your long bow, as it is essential sometimes in your work to be a good archer, your bow is elf made, only the best for you. Next off comes your belt, and the familiar weight was lost as your short sword came off. You quickly check the sword itself for any kind of moister that might cause it to rust. The black blade glints under the candle light it cost a bundle, but it was worth it, the blade never makes a sound coming out of the scabbard and the colour helps hide you in the night due to it not reflecting light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off your cloak you sit on the bed ready for a good nights sleep. Quickly grabbing your dagger you unsheathe it and hide it under your pillow for quick access. Soon sleep takes you and you enter a deep sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your hand closed about something smooth and you raise the dagger just in time to stop the cold steel from slicing open your throat. You drew back your arm and delivered a painful blow to the stomach.

Lots of cutthroats and fools seem to by vieing for their attention anyways, and you figure either one man will be killed and stolen from, or one whore will charge too high of a price and be killed... and stolen from, too.   You sit and wait for you're meal in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'By the gods, it's taking a long time.' You think to yourself. Just then, the doors open.  A group of men walk in, seemingly surrounding another man like body guards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Clear the way.  The honorable Erros needs to get to the bar.\"  One man in front of the pack says.  Everyone expediently gets out of the way, as if they'd done this a hundred or even a thousand times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Honorable, yeah right. About as honorable as myself.' You think as the group moves to the bar.  You glance around, noticing you are the only one at the bar, and at least one person from the group is going to have to continue standing, or take a table.  The \"Honorable Erros\" takes a seat only three seats from you, and his men fill in around him.  Seeing that there are no seats left, two of his men approach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Filthy half breed, move out of our seat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Although you fellow guards accept you as an equal comrade after the shared drinks, exploits and nights on the road, for the most part, they spend more time drinking and whoring than training.  Even though you wouldn't consider yourself a stalwart example of regular practice, you do take some pride in your skills.  They've fed you and kept you alive.  A mercenary lives or dies by their skills but even as you watch the people around you, you can see that they have gotten too relaxed.  They're far better at boasting than in physical tasks.  When you start asking questions, it's clear that those in the worst physical condition are those that have been there the longest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlmar, the guard whose worked or the old merchant for almost two years is all flab, heavy gut and from the glimpses you've gotten of his knife and sword, he hasn't bothered to sharpen them for at least a year.

In a war-troubled part of the country, what made the old geezer's caravans exempt from even an occasional scuffle?  A trained eye watching the group would quickly discern that they weren't in much condition to defend their posts.  Yes, on the trip out security is watched but on the return trip, they were prime targets for any well planned attack.  They may not be hauling merchandise, but Gallino must be carrying a fortune in gold or whatever else he got from the sales and when you think it through, the latter would be more valuable, easier to escape with and far more liquid in bartering.  In fact, you try not to think it too far through because soon it seems like an opportunity too good to pass up ... I mean, it wouldn't take much to bargain with some local mercenaries at that inn and plan an attack that could make you and the group very wealthy ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Natin \u2013 you'll have to remember that name since it was the best clue for nailing these traitors.  You've never heard the name \u2013 that you can recall \u2013 but then the guards have very little interaction with house servants except for those that brought meals to the barracks.  It was too risky to try to sneak look at the two.  The name would have to do \u2013 besides, it sounded like he was the one running the operations.  She may just be a maid who spied on people and gathered information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the man called Natin assured her.  \"Trust me, they have as much reason to hate <i>him</i> as we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn't too hard to conclude that \"him\" meant the merchant since he was the biggest one to suffer from a raid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices fade and you hear a door close, then silence.

At this point, you didn't have any evidence \u2013 just chance eavesdropping \u2013 and the man Natin would definitely deny it so it would end up being your word against his.  Not ideal for just being hired on a week or so ago.  On the other hand, the caravan would probably be heading out soon if plans were already set in motion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He keeps clear of the barracks and not too keep on mixin' with our type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaguely, you remember some of the comments about him back at the inn, but there wasn't much useful.  \"I hear he wears a sword, can he use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old guard shrugged again.  \"Don't rightly know, but I guess so.  Think he takes lessons from some local noble or atleast a fancy warrior employed as a teacher by some noble but don't know who.

Something about a common girl and Natin being forced to marry her.  Or maybe he wanted to marry her and the boss wouldn't have it.  All I know was that the girl ended up going missing for about a week and when they found her she was dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't remember if the guy wanted to marry or was trying to get out of it?\" you demand.  \"Good grief, it makes a big difference.  If he didn't want to marry her then he might have killed her to settle the issue, or paid someone else to take her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it really matter?\" Olmar scoffed in his gruff voice.  \"These nobles have their own ways in this place.  It don't matter what they do \u2013 murder or steal or whatever \u2013 cause they got money and that's all the law cares about in this place.\"  He levels his black eyes on you.  \"Trust me, best to stick to our own business and just leave them to deal with their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did have a point.  At least now you're glad you didn't rush it and tell Gallino.  Accusing a servant was one thing, but accusing the boss's son of treachery without proof is something else entirely.  So, that left you with two options.  Do you get proof to nail the guy, or do you go along with it and stick to your job by trying to protect the caravan from attack as best as you can without implementing the snake?  With only tonight to gather proof, you'll be working blind and hope you get lucky \u2013 not to mention it will probably require sneaking into the big house and breaking who knows how many rules in your contract.  If you wait until after the return of the caravan you will have more time to work, but you're not overly sure of your ability to keep an entire caravan safe without somebody else on your side.  Either way, the odds were against you, but then again, that's usually when you are at your best ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the old geezer seemed a decent guy and it made you sick to think of his own son betraying him like this.

You need a lot more proof than your word to convince him that either of them are working against him.  You'd probably end up being the one in prison just for hinting at such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And frankly, that's why I haven't done anything yet,\" you admit, \"because I much prefer some sort of evidence to back me, but let me assure you of one thing \u2013 if it comes down to it, I'm willing to go in there with just what I have now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as she stared at you.  \"I just said you'd end up in prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed her skeptically, \"As if you care about what happens to a stranger like me?\" you muse.  \"But yes, I would do it rather than remain silent.  Call it a personal issue, but I the boss seems a decent guy and I can't stand by and watch his own son betray him \u2013 not if I can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes search yours as if not convinced or just surprised by your insistence, but you don't have anything to hide there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" you continue, \"I don't know how you got wrapped up in all of this, but I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and give you a choice.  Help me get the evidence I need and I'll convince the boss that you're clean, or I'll let you walk away now and I'll get the evidence on my own to take him down and you down with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you see her expression deepen in thought, you back away, giving her enough room to run if she decides.  However, she doesn't move for a long moment, but studies you through the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you real value the loyalty between father and son so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe narrows her eyes.  \"How can I trust that you're being honest with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give an open shrug.  \"I'm risking my job by even being here and talking to you.  If I didn't care what happens, then I would have gone straight to Gallino or done nothing at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stiffened.  \"Do you trust Gallino?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boss has entrusted the caravan to Gallino so since this concerns the caravan, it only makes sense to talk to him first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the loyalty between father and son?  Why look after Galen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The older merchant is the one who hired me, and is the one paying me, so my loyalty is to him first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chewed on her lip as she considered, then nodded.  \"Follow me, I know a place where we can talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, but decide to follow her since you gave her the option of running and she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you down the dark hallway and then stops to knock on a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense as you hear a muffled, sleepy voice call out, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl lifts an open hand, gesturing you to be patient, then answers the voice.  \"It's Salyna.  We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the shuffle of footsteps and the door opens.  \"This had better be important,\" the man inside mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand clenches around your knife as you recognize the voice.

As you pass beneath the rare torches, you note the long braid of dark hair down the young woman's back, almost lost in the simple, dark skirt and tunic.  With that dark of hair and that figure, she probably had gypsy blood in her.  That was pretty common in that area although most pure-blood gypsies had left years ago because of the wars and all the different bands of fighters wandering the countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon turns to a door and glances back at you as she opens it and allows you to enter first.  With your knife still out, you enter cautiously, keeping one eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is empty \u2013 a simple maid's room with a narrow bed and a trunk pushed against the wall.  A wooden table with a wash basin and polished silver mirror.  A small, solitary candle sat beside the basin and the young woman picked it up and lit it from the torch in the hallway, then returned and closed the door.  With the candle in her hands, you catch the glint of dark green in her eyes, highlighted with golden reflections of the flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident that the room is secure, you slip the knife back into the sheath.  \"I apologize for the rough introduction back there, but I am supposed to help keep this place secure and I take my job seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised one eyebrow.  \"Yet you seem to pick and choose since I know mercenaries aren't allowed in here \u2013 especially at night.  Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your head and offer a casual smile, giving your name.  Taking a few steps toward her, meeting her stare with an easy, roaming study of her face and figure.  \"So why would a pretty little thing like you be involved in such deceit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pursed her lips, glancing away.  \"Things are not always what they seem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head to catch her gaze again.  \"Are you speaking of your beauty, or of the conversation?  From where I stand, they both seem pretty obvious to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering at you from the corner of her eyes, she asks, \"Have you told anyone what you heard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I shouldn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.  \"I know it sounded bad, but it really isn't what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are within an arm's reach, you lower your voice and ask softly, \"Are you in love with Natin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the question, she lifts her face full into view.  \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you mutter, \"Well, many women have done more for a man they think they love, so it would explain how you got involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her chin arrogantly.  \"Fine,\" she declares, \"I love him, but what why should you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise one eyebrow skeptically.  \"That didn't sound too convincing.  Is it because he doesn't really care for you?  Guys like him tend to use girls more than love them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys like him?\" she scoffs, glaring at you.  \"You don't know anything about Natin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move in a step closer, using your height to your advantage since her eyes reaching your chin-level.  \"I do know that any son who would betray his father behind his back doesn't deserve the love of someone as lovely and spirited as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her head higher to meet your gaze, you can tell that she's shaken by your closeness, but she doesn't back down.  \"Are you trying to hint that you might be more deserving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her one of your disarming grins you mumble, \"Maybe.  Certainly sounds like a good place to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint blush colors her cheeks and she looks away, shielding the candle flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother step closer.  \"Has he ever kissed you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush deepens and she turns on you sharply.  \"No, how can you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the candle aside, you pull her to you, wrapping one arm around her tense waist and claim her lips with your own, cutting off her protest and her breath.  She struggles against you, pushing at you with her free hand, but is no match for your strength.  Her other hand clenches around the candle, the light flickering and tossing shadows in the dark room, but your own hand keeps the arm far away.  The last thing you want is to be singed by maidenly outrage.  Shifting closer, you feel her struggles fade, unmistakable submission evident in her slight lean against you.  You deepen the kiss to erase all lingering hesitation on her part, then, once you are sure of her returned desire, you pull back, your body tense with its own demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman sucks in a breath of air, her body heaving against your and her face flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" you whisper, kissing the corner of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salyna,\" she breathes, her voice shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salyna,\" you purr, drawing out the name in a seductive tone that few women \u2013 especially young women \u2013 have ever been able to resist.  \"And do you still love Natin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates but you slide your hand up her back, pressing her to you and caressing with your fingers to bring her mind back to focusing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers tighten, pressing against her back and you trail kisses to her ear, but fight to keep anger out of your voice as you hiss, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my brother.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You may take the matter up with him.  He has much more time available than his father since the caravan is \u2013for the most part- his only major duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown.  \"Like I said, it's not urgent.  Just let the master know that I wish to see him when he has time.\"  You turn and head back to the barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Gallino is only really working when he's running the caravan?  He didn't seem the lazy type but yet you haven't seen him around the estate so how did he pass the time between trips?  Not that you knew much about the man since he kept to himself on the road except to keep order and managing the handling and selling of merchandise.  Seems a somber, quiet type that's always stressed underneath.  You've never seen him loosen up so it's possible that when he's not on a caravan he goes elsewhere to kick-back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, that was another thing that didn't seem overly logical.  Why did he seem so stressed if he only managed the caravans?  If it was the strain of the responsibility, why would he be so lax on the security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you were looking for my father,\" a male voice interrupts your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to find a young man no more than twenty, with brown eyes and sandy-colored hair.

This is the first caravan trip for you and the last thing you need is to make a big scene.  So far, the others have been pretty accepting and you want to keep it that way if you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night air is cool and you pull your cloak tighter against the wind.  Glancing about the camp you sigh.  Away from the boisterous group at the campfire, the rest of the area seems deserted.  You had expected at least a few guards to still be walking the perimeter.  As it was, the whole area around the wagons lay silent and vulnerable.  It's a good thing the merchandise had all been sold, but even then it seemed odd that no one cared about the value of the wagons themselves and you could have sworn that when Gallino came back to wagons that afternoon, after dealing with selling/delivering the goods, he'd brought a few wooden crates back.  Maybe they hadn't sold, or maybe part of the business included trading for something that would be valuable back in Hewor.  You didn't really know all that much about the details of how merchants operate, but at the very least, Gallino must have a valuable return in some form stashed somewhere.  From the way the old geezer had acted the day you signed on, the guy seemed awfully concerned about security and the safety of his family, yet Gallino \u2013 the one in the most danger if there was an attack \u2013 didn't seem worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, staring at one of the wagons.

Out of curiousity, you glance around, then wander over to the nearest wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only reasonable,\" you rationalize, \"it's best to know what you're guarding, right?\"  Yet when you reach the wagon, you hesitate \u2013 your hand on the oiled tarp.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a monastery in the town and one of the monks took pity on me.  He brought me into the monastery to educate in hopes of giving me a brighter future.  Although those higher up frowned on the action \u2013 particularly because as you see, I'm only half human - , they didn't stop the monk and most of the brethren accepted me warmly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then may I ask how you became a mercenary?  Were you rebellious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.  \"No, I loved them like a family, but when I was a young man, the town was cruelly attacked under the cover of darkness and the buildings razed to the ground.  I survived because the monks hid me in the catacombs where there dead were buried.  There was just enough moisture to keep the fire away, but I was the only survivor.  After that night, I swore to track down the people responsible for the attack, but the trail turned cold after a month or so and I knew that I would need far more training and skills if I was to succeed.  With no money or any one who knew me, mercenary training and work was how I kept alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant stroked his bearded chin.  \"What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you gave it, the man replied, \"I am Galen Tarish.  You are an interesting man with a dark past, I see.\"  Galen grinned.  \"I like you.\"  He gestured to the contract.  \"Please, feel free to study it and ask any questions you wish.\"  He waved to his servant to escort Taz out, leaving you and the merchant alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, the contract was simply verbatim of what Galen had said.  You eye him.  \"What's the merchandise you trade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalen shrugged.  \"Standard stuff \u2013 lots of quality fabric, including the best silk on the market -  prime ale and wine, and spices with a few medicinal herbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise one quizzical eyebrow.  \"So you don't cater to the war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalen grimaced.  \"I want nothing to do with that type of people.  It's because of these idiots that I have to waste so much money on guards!  All the cut-throats brought in by the war and paid to wander the countryside are half thieves and when they're bored, they seem to think it's fun to lurk around my estates, steal from my caravans and would probably love to demand ransom on one of my children.

We had worked out the beginnings of our plan where I would be introduced to the household the next morning. I would meet the captain of the guards, the chamberlain, the mistress of servants and Galen would point out his sons and daughter to me. My job was to check out the defenses of the home and yards, then make recommendations as to how best to secure them against attack. I was to have the run of the house during the day, but at night, I was supposed to have the same restrictions as any other mercenary. Only Galen and I knew differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI returned to my inn, gathered my things and went back to Galen's. I entered by way of the main gate before it was closed for the night. The corporal of the guard escorted me to the barracks. He told me he had heard I would be arriving late, but he hoped I would understand if he posted a guard until I could be better identified. I told him I did understand and if he wanted, to spare his guards a partial nights sleep, i would be willing to allow him to lock me in a cell until morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and said, \"Ah, the lot of a soldier is to go sleepless so others may sleep sound, to go hungry so others may eat and to die if need be so others may live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled back and said. \"As a rule, I have found it much better to make the enemy die for his god rather than dying for mine.\" He laughed aloud at this and pointed the way to a small room at the bottom of some stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may take your gear with you.\" He signaled to two privates and they came forward. \"These are privates Conn and Gilsepth. They shall watch over your sleep the first part of the evening. Others will relieve them throughout the night until time for morning chow. At that time, we shall go to our dining area and make sure you are fed the best gruel money can buy. Who knows, perhaps you may have luck and actually find some meat within it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the room, unrolled my blankets and went immediately to sleep. I woke with each changing of the guard and pretended sleep when two men entered my room around two of the clock. They merely looked around and disturbed nothing, so I let them live when they left. I was up and ready before the sun had risen in the sky. The corporal of the guard came back and collected me. He handed me a key to fit the lock on the door, which I closed and locked. We went to breakfast and ate the gruel he had spoken of and dined on hard rolls which he hadn't mentioned. Then, we were off to the main house to meet the captain of the guard and Galen.</span></div></div>",

He also had several scars on his arms and one small gash down the side of his cheek. He was one I would not like to have to engage in a sword fight. He appeared to be wearing a bastard sword on his right side and a fighting dirk on his left. That told me none of my usual training would be effective against him since the moves would all be backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ducked my head, \"Good morn to you, Galen. I am prepared to begin my work as soon as you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have broken fast, have you not?\" he asked gruffly. At my nod, he said, \"Come along then. This is the captain of the guard here. Dan'l Tremont.\" Galen led the way down a narrow hallway which opened into a bigger room. This my housekeeper, Elaine Halfblood. My Majordomo is Sal Tallfellow. The housekeeper is in charge of all the females working here. The majordomo is in charge of everyone else. And, this is my daughter, Saline Moongift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, I could see where the old man wouldn't want her bedded by anyone before she married. She had a regal bearing to her, standing almost as tall as my own 5' 8\". She could have weighed no more than 5 stone (100 pounds) and had a beautiful glow about her. Her reddish hair and creamy complexion were enough to seduce any man. She also possessed the most penetrating green eyes I had ever seen. Her breasts were full, but not overly huge. Her waist was small and her hips were just right on her, neither too big nor too small. I would have to watch myself around her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalen explained my duties and said, \"He'll be poking his nose into every crack and crevice of the house. If he asks you a question, answer it to the best of your ability. Otherwise, ignore him. He will only be in the house during the day. Any questions?\" he asked. Getting no response, he said, \"Good! Back to work then.\" Galen led the way back to the little room where we had first been. \"You know what to do. Find out what you must and report back to me. Good luck,\" he said, offering his hand. I shook it and he nodded at my firm grasp.</span></div></div>",

However, my father's family could never accept the marriage and claimed it a farce and betrayal.  When I was born, I was condemned by the superstitious as a changeling or a demon child, saying that no child of mixed blood can claim a soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The household and servants of the estate rebelled and threatened to abandon my father \u2013 both hating and fearing me even as an infant \u2013 so to keep peace, my father sent me and my mother away.  I never knew my father but my mother told me stories of him and showed me his letters.  He sent gold secretly to provide for us and even a tutor to educate me.  Unfortunately, not long after I became an adolescent, the messages and gold stopped without warning.  My mother sank into depression and when I offered to search out my father's fate, she refused to tell me his name or house in fear that his family would find me and kill me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away, troubled by the memories of your beautiful mother wasting away in grief and silence.  \"Eventually I couldn\u2019t take it any more and I left to make my way on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant studies you skeptically.  \"Your story is intriguing, but any man with a bit of learning and an active imagination could concoct such a story to dupe any fool.  With no names, dates or house to confirm your claims, it's possible that you are lying or even that you have been lied to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffen, fist tight at your sides.  \"I was not lied to,\" you declare.  \"I said I don't know his name or family, but I <i>do</i> have proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man lifted an eyebrow.  \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull on the thin, metal chain around your neck, feeling the heavy man's ring slip free of the neck of your tunic.  Holding it out for the merchant to see, you eye the gold band, thickly encrusted with small diamonds and a large sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed, the merchant stands and asks, \"May I inspect your relic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, only slightly nervous.  You never showed the heirloom to anyone, cautious about your enemies finding you before you can identify them, but if you were going to commit to six months of working for this guy, you'd prefer it an open deal on both sides.  Besides, as a merchant, he might even know something helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man studied the ring for a long moment, stroking his chin.  \"There is a crest here \u2013 or rather the hint of one,\" the merchant informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" you demand, eager for any information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pattern of the diamonds,\" he explains, \"they are set in a star constellation, I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know what noble house used that constellation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed.  \"It has been decades since such have been used as crests.  Most have been dropped to adopt modern styles.  I'd have to research it more to know.\"  He eyes you shrewdly.  \"But time for such research and tracing can get pricey.  Perhaps we can make a deal.

Your pay remains the same, but after the glare that Taz gives you as he's dismissed to the barracks, you decide that it's probably best.  You hadn't intended the story of your past to come out this soon, but you would be a fool to pass up a chance to find out who and where your father is.  Taz didn't look too impressed by your claims and you doubted that the other mercenaries in Galen's employ would accept you as one of them now.  You sigh.  <i>And so the cycle begins again.  Getting others to accept my half race status was one thing and whenever my past comes up, it only isolates me further \u2013 you'd think I'd be used to it by now \u2013 but just once it would be nice to be viewed by who I am and not my ancestry.  For all it's promises and possibilities, so far it's only produced more enemies and complications.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the singular house guard, you have a private room in the main house and your duties mainly consist with maintaining the security of the main house at night, dealing with would-be intruders, following up on suspicious activities, breaking up any domestic fights if they turn violent and reporting rule-breaking to Galen.  All in all, it seemed pretty straightforward \u2013 that is until you walk the grounds around the house and realize all the shadowed arbors, the three servant entries that added on in the most isolated corners and the low, first-floor windows that had been carved into the original garrison design.  Window shutters and doors had no bolts or beams to keep them closed except for the main front door and that one not only looked like it hadn't been used in years, but when you handle it, you discover that it's half rotten.  It wouldn't hold up against two strong kicks from a determined attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, the hallways twist and turn then end abruptly with lots of isolated branches and when you ask, you discover that to cut back on costs, only torches at intersections were left burning at night.  That left major sections of shadows for people to hide and sneak through the innards of the building.  With just yourself, it looked like a serious all-nighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are thoroughly discouraged by the security you are responsible for, you are summoned to meet the house servants.  More than two-third of the men looked like they had served the estate when Galen was a mewling infant.  On the other hand, most of the maids looked in their twenties or lower with relatively slim figures and pretty faces.  The only two women who looked matronly were the head cook and the head housekeeper and they seemed ill-impressed with their young helpers.  Even as you enter the room where they are assembled, you can hear the two women bellowing reprimands at their underlings.  The girls, although pretty, had no qualms about laughing and yelling back at their superiors and frankly anyone who questioned them.  Although they seem to have the advantage of numbers and graphic name calling over their elders, you discover after about three or four cat-fights later, that the girls were just as vicious and competitive against each other than authority figures \u2013 apparently more so.  The main dispute among them seemed to be a select, coveted group of mercenaries.  It seemed odd to you since you were used to maids like that fighting over the sons of the boss but since you haven't actually seen or met either of Galen two sons yet, you supposed that it might be that they were out of shape, overweight or otherwise unappealing to females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't hard to guess that most of your \"would-be\" night intruders will probably be mercenaries from the barracks trying to make or keep night appointments with the maids.  You figure you should probably clarify with Galen whether or not he considered moon-light trysts in the gardens as a threat to the main house.  You're also not sure when you will be able to get some sleep during the day without regular interruptions demanding that he break up more catfights.  By the time you complete your review of your duties and shuffle back to your room, you already feel exhausted and sleep-deprived, and thinking about your first night on the job beginning in a couple hours did not help.  However, the thought of just being able to lay down on a real bed kept your feet moving until you open your bedroom door and look up to see a beautiful, dark-haired young woman sitting on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, looking the stranger over \u2013 her slender curves covered in a red-silk dress \u2013 and the waves of black hair draped over one lifted shoulder.  Troubled, dark green eyes studied you and you notice a touch of fear \u2013 not enough to noticed by the casual person, but as a fighter, fear is something you learn to pick up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your help,\" the woman announced, her voice shaking a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting one eyebrow, you ask, \"Do you usually intrude on stranger's private space, or only when you want to look desperate?  I know the damsel in distress technique so I suggest you have a real convincing story to go with it because I don't favor people who sneak into my bedroom \u2013 especially when I don't know them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her head somewhat defiantly.  \"I am Galen's daughter, Salyna Tarish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah</i>, you recall from earlier descriptions, <i>the babe</i>.  With one more appraising glance, you decide the reference justified.  \"So, what help do you need from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother is a crook,\" the young woman declared.  \"I want you to help me stop him or at least prove what he is to my father.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
