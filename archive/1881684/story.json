You look at it to see that it is 10:48 AM.  \"Guess it's time to get up,\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was pretty typical for you lately.  Since you had no job and no one to hang out with there was really no point to get up any earlier.  James had been away for a week or so because his grandfather had passed away and his family had been making arrangements.  You remember when your granddad died and felt bad for the guy, though you didn't know how close he was with his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull on your shirt, you leave the room and head toward the kitchen.  You pass your sister's room on the way to find the door closed, like usual.  Samantha was worse than you most days and would often stay in bed 'till noon.  It might have been partially due to her late night runs, but she was really just ready to get out of here and escape to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing down the stairs, you see your little brother sitting on the couch in front of the TV, controller in hand, shooting at somebody online.  \"Good morning,\" you say, but he is so focused on the game that he neglects to notice you.  You just ignore it and arrive in the kitchen.  \"Hmm, cereal sounds good for breakfast today,\" you think.  After fixing a bowl, you head back toward your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing Samantha's room once more, you hear giggling.  \"Weird, guess she's up, you think.  You knock on her door and ask, \"Good morning, what are you up to in there?\"  No answer.  In fact, it just got dead quiet.  You knock once more, but there is still no sound.  Curious, you open the door to find no one in sight.  There are just some scattered clothes all in front of the mirror, but your sister is missing.  You could have sworn that you heard her, but where is she?  Shaking it off, you just continue on with your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later, after finishing your cereal, you head back out of your room toward the kitchen.  You again pass your sister's room and the door is again closed.  \"Okay, something's up,\" you mumble.  You then grab hold of the door knob and thrust the door open.  Inside you find your sister standing there in front of her mirror wearing nothing but a black miniskirt and a bra to match.  She jerks a look of surprise at you and just freezes.  A little stunned too, you just stand there for a moment, saying nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you finally ask, coming out of your trance.  Still gawking at you, she hesitates, but then answers, \"Well...this is a little strange I guess, huh.  I wasn't sure how I was going to tell you, but I guess this makes it easier.\"  \"Tell me what?\" you retort, a little confused.  This situation felt so awkward and you just wanted to leave, but curiosity still held you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Chris,\" she started, \" it's me...James.\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\"><span class=\"cgrape\"><u><b>Background:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0World War II began in 1939 with an invasion of Poland by Germany.  From then until it ended in 1945 new inventions and improvements to technology were developed by both Axis and Allied powers to boost the progress of the war effort.  However, there was one piece of weaponry that never made it into combat.  It was a handgun, resembling any ordinary pistol, that would have turned the tide of battle in a way that no person could have predicted.  Though it looked like any other firearm, it could not fire bullets.  The gun was designed with this disguise to hide its one true function...<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Body Possession</b> </div> <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, this device was developed in Nazi Germany and was to be used against the Allies.  The plan was to have soldiers trained for a mission to travel from body to body until reaching the highest position of power within a country, whether it be the President of the United States or the Prime Minister of England, and crush their organization from the inside.  Fortunately for the Allies however, Germany was defeated and only one prototype of the gun was ever produced.  Only a select few scientists and German officers knew of the weapon, including Hitler, but all the officers were either killed or executed and many of the scientists were old and died shortly after the war, never revealing the secret to anyone.  One scientist, Walter , had been running tests on the gun.  He, unlike the others, was a young man that would live for many years to come.  After Germany's defeat, he escaped to America, with the gun, to start a new life and to never again speak of his time as a Nazi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walter got a job as a factory worker, forgetting all about the device and storing it away in the attic of his new American home.  He met a girl, Marge, and fell in love with her.  The two were married in 1956 and they had three children, Thomas: Now 55 years old, Martha: Now 49 years old, and John: Now 46 years old.  All three grew up to live happy lives, but John is the only one important to this story.  He  stayed relatively close with his father as his brother and sister grew distant to a point that they no longer talked.  The last time that he saw them was at his mother's premature funeral.  John met his wife, Samantha, in 1983 and married her in 1986.  Together, they had two children, Rebecca: Now 21 years old and James: Now 20 years old.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><u><b>The Present:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, your name is Chris and you are 20 years old.  You just finished your sophomore year in college last month and have been enjoying your summer vacation by just laying around at home. You have a sister named Samantha, a just graduated senior from high school that is 18 years old.  She is on her way to a college far away from your home town and far from where you are attending college.  However, for the time being, she is on her summer vacation like you.  You also have a little brother, Jeff, that is 13 years old.  He is your typical middle-schooler and is very glad to be on summer break.  Your mother, Karen, and father, Bill, have been keeping up their daily schedules by working a normal 8-5, Monday through Friday shift, and spending the weekends in leisure as best they can with the three of you out of school.  Lastly, you have a dog named Rex that is about 5 years old.  He is a German Shepard and is as friendly as they come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0James has been your friend ever since you met him back in the sixth grade.  You two followed one another through middle school, into high school, and even wound up attending the same college.  You've met several other friends along the way, but none of them will ever share a bond with you quite like he has.  He's your best friend and you'd trust him through anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As far as girls go, you have had many crushes, but you were always too shy to actually have a girlfriend.  There was always that one girl, but she was eventually replaced by another and the cycle would be endless, at least up to this point in your life.  Currently, there is a girl named Sarah that you are obsessed with.  She always smiles at you when you two walk by one another and you've sworn that she must feel the same way, but you've been afraid to tell her how you feel.  She too is heading into her junior year of college.  You met her two years ago as a Freshman and have not stopped thinking about her ever since.  But, life must go on...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">I will be the only one handling the first line of the story.
