This was unfortunate, seeing as all there was to do was learning. This was the reason behind your short escape to the bathroom. You never focused on the factors that would supposedly bring you success in life, but rather, the path you had to take to achieve it. This was the philosophical logic you presented to yourself while pissing into a urinal. Perhaps, you wondered, there were more practical applications for this mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on your way back from the bathroom, you trekked the main corridor on the second floor. The atmosphere outside was glowing, so you decided to prolong this feeling of freedom for just a little bit longer. You took in the sights from behind the rows of windows that lined the outer wall. Aside from seeing the front gate, a grim reminder that you were still at school, there was much to please the senses. It was the start of a new semester as high school, and Spring was restoring order to the environment. Leaves were regrowing, grass was recovering, flowers were blooming, and the temperature was warming back up. It was perfect weather for a day spent outdoors, but there was no way to leave the school without getting caught. It was a difficult compromise, but you decided to return to the homeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, your attention was drawn to an incident unfolding near the main gate. A few teachers made their way to the gate to deal with an unknown man wrestling at the metal bars. You continued to watch as the bulkiest of the teachers tried to push the man away from behind the safety of the gate. A couple grunts of pain were all you heard, as he clutched his arm in distress. You were shocked to see him collapse to the ground shortly after the attack, somehow incapacitated. It was hard to understand what happened, but that was one of the strongest staff in the school. Surely, he must have been alright. As if you answer your worries, he started to move again. His movements were sluggish, and he immediately latched onto the nearby female teacher tending to his arm. Blood-curdling screams arose from the front gate, as the gym teacher tore into the flesh of this woman's neck with his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, as you backed away from the window and tried to make sense of the situation. The school was about to be evacuated, that much was certain, but it seemed like no one knew about this strange event yet. You had free reign over your emergency plans for the next minute or so, before the school would surely erupt into a dangerous clamor of students trying to escape. Time was of the essence, and you needed to make a decision right now.</div><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">- - - - -</div><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>&lt;:: Game Paused.</i></span><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Displaying Love Interests.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>Love Interest #1:</b></span> Rei Miyamoto<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Pairing Type:</b></span> Survivors<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Romance Type:</b></span> Playful<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- - -<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>Love Interest #2:</b></span> Saya Takagi <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Pairing Type:</b></span> Leadership<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Romance Type:</b></span> Timid<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- - -<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>Love Interest #3: </b></span> Saeko Busujima <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Pairing Type:</b></span> Battlegroup<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Romance Type:</b></span> Dark<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- - -<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><b>Love Interest #4:</b></span> Shizuka Marikawa <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Pairing Type:</b></span> Support<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>Romance Type:</b></span> Erotic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>&lt;:: Enabling Choices.</i></span></span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">Saving Rei was your utmost concern. You loved this girl ever since childhood, where you promised to marry her when you became adults. Unfortunately, acting on this promise became increasingly hard as you grew older. Your hesitance to take action led Rei into the hands of your best friend, Hisashi. But you were hesitant no longer. With Rei unaware of the impending danger, you ran through the second-floor corridor until you reached the door to her homeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barged straight in, ignoring the uproar from the seated students and their teacher. Sitting at a desk closest to the windows, Rei turned to investigate the clamor you instigated. Her hazel eyes stared at you, complimenting the natural, brown hair that flowed down the length of her back. She was a beautiful girl, and today was no exception to this. But you had a purpose here today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cRei, we need to leave.\u201d</span> You stated, walking up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat are you doing?! We\u2019re in the middle of class!\u201d</span> Rei protested. There wasn\u2019t any time for pointless arguments like this. You leaned towards her, giving her the most subtle explanation for the horrors you saw at the front gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cA teacher was just killed outside the school. Get up, because I\u2019m not leaving you here.\u201d</span> You made sure that these whispers were muddled enough to reach only Rei. She seemed hesitant to move, though. You had wasted enough time here, grabbing her wrist and pulling Rei away from the desk. Her confusion was obvious, offering little resistance as you dragged her out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis compliance was short-lived, however, as she pulled away from your grasp and stood in the middle of the corridor outside her classroom. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey, is this a joke? What are you trying to do here?\u201d</span> Rei had every reason to question you. Her years of waiting to receive your confession were fruitless. The feelings that she perhaps held for you at some point were gone, and she was starting to move on. And now, here you were. It looked like there were deeper implications behind your actions, but she was wrong. This was a real situation, and it demanded haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed Rei, forcing her against one of the windows that lined the corridor. This was the only way you could make her see reason \u2013 that you were serious about keeping her alive. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cW-Wha-?! What are you doing?!\u201d</span> Rei was more shocked than anything else to find herself in this position. You pinned her arms against the glass, and lowering your head forward with a gentle expression. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cRei, please\u2026 I need you to trust me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei saw the truth behind you words, if not a little bit too late. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWait\u2026 you can't be serious.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">. . .<br>\r\n<i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-0:00:03 Minutes<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-0:00:02 Minutes<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-0:00:01 Minutes<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-0:00:00 Minutes<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Starting Timer: <b>\u201cSurvival\u201d</b>.</span><br>\r\n<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+0:00:00 Minutes<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+0:00:01 Minutes<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+0:00:02 Minutes<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+0:00:03 Minutes</b></i><br>\r\n. . .</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crackling of static poured out from the speakers embedded into the ceiling of the school. From behind the mechanical whirring, an unknown teacher warned the entire school about the events that took place at the main gate. He was rather conservative with the details behind the encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>*Click*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cAttention, all students.

A dying scream marked the demise of the broadcaster, as silence took over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere grew especially grim following this silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, massive panic erupted inside of the school. Standing amidst one of the most trafficked hallways in the school, you knew that the stampedes were going to be a threat. Surveying the immediate area, you found the door to the female restrooms beside the classroom you emerged from. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cQuick, into the restroom!\u201d</span> You woke Rei from her trance, as you both stormed into the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you bolted the door, pandemonium engulfed the school. Hordes of students charged down the corridor with little care for the safety of others. It didn't take long for screams to flood the corridor, as some of the students were unlucky enough to encounter whatever killed the broadcaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt's a complete massacre.\u201d</span> Rei muttered, standing in front of a window at the end of the restroom. You walked up beside her, sharing her view of the carnage that unfolded on the ground floor. Students funneled out onto the track field in the back of the school, only to encounter a swathe of shuffling, cumbersome monsters hounding the doors. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThey're coming back to life\u2026 just like in the movies.\u201d</span> This seemed all too true, as you watched a deceased student rise from the ground and start attacking those who were once friends. These things displayed nothing other than the desire to feast upon flesh, and emitted nothing but deep, guttural moans. They were walking corpses.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

You leaned against the window that looked down upon the back of the school, including the track field and sports grounds. A rustic fire escape lined the second floor of the building. It looked in good condition, if not a tad outdated. This would be your escape route. The second barrier to your success, though, was the fallen students that seemed to attack anything on sight. You needed weapons to defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the restroom, you noticed an industrial push broom leaning up against one of the stalls. It looked sturdy enough for use as a temporary weapon. With creating a spear in mind, you gripped the stick and gave the head a well-placed stomp, snapping it from the base. A sharp, metal screw revealed itself at the tip of this new weapon. You knew that Rei was an experienced member of the lancing club, a group devoted to learning and mastering the way of the spear. This mere stick could become a deadly weapon in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cLooks like we found you a weapon.\u201d</span> You walked up to the window, rearing the blunt end of the stick into the glass. The brittle substance shattered, dropping fragments of the glass on both sides of the window. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWas there a reason for that?\u201d</span> Rei seemed flustered by the sudden decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head in mock confusion. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cObviously, we're going out the window.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed the makeshift spear to Rei, leading the way as you crawled out the window. Stepping onto the fire escape, you could feel the resounding hum of the metal grating beneath your feet. This was unsettling, coming from the solid flooring inside the school. Rei followed shortly afterwards, ducking through the window with her makeshift spear in-hand. You knew Rei was capable of defending herself with that weapon, and that put your mind at ease. But you were still unarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cRei, I\u2019m going down there to find a weapon.\u201d</span> You scanned the nearby ground, eyeing a stack of sports equipment left out to roast in the sun. There had to be something you could use in that pile. Your gaze shifted to a single fallen students, aimlessly shuffling around the area below. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cCan I trust you to keep that fucker away from me for a little while?\u201d</span> You pointed to the zombie in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d</span> Rei seemed unsure, but eventually relented. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI think I can handle that.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei climbed down the fire escape first, drawing the undead student into a very one-sided battle. Strike after strike, she delivered heavy blows to her opponent, effectively keeping the zombified student distracted. Just as you expected, Rei was a strong fighter. She was more than capable of holding her own in a fight against these mindless creatures. You slid down the fire escape and zipped past Rei amidst her fight, immediately beginning your search in the pile of sports equipment. Batting gloves, uniforms and random sports equipment made up the majority of the clutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, finally, you found the weapon you so desired \u2013 an \t<script language=\"JavaScript\"><!--\n\t\tvar notex, thisx, mmove;\n\tfunction showPopNote2(notex, event, thisx, mmove) {  var thisxPosY = $(thisx).position();  var ccTop = 15;  if ($('#Content_Column_Wrapper').length) {  var ccPos = $('#Content_Column_Wrapper').position();  ccTop = ccPos.top;  }  var thisxBot = thisxPosY.top + $(thisx).height(); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).appendTo('#Content_Column_Wrapper'); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'top':event.pageY-ccTop + 15, 'position':'absolute'});  if ($('#bigPopNote' + notex).width() < $('#bigPopNote' + notex).parent().width() - 50) { $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'left':event.pageX-50});  }  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'block';   if (mmove == 1) {  thisx.style.borderBottomStyle = 'solid'; }  thisx.clicked = 0;  }\n\tfunction clickPopNote2(thisx) {  thisx.clicked = 1;  }\n\tfunction hidePopNote2(notex, event, thisx) {  document.getElementById('popnote' + notex).style.borderBottomStyle = 'dotted';  if (thisx.clicked != 1) {  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'none';  }  }\n\t\t\t\t//--></script><span id=\"popnote15785698791\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('15785698791', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('15785698791',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">aluminum baseball bat.</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote15785698791\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\"><div align=\"center\"><b>Aluminum Baseball Bat:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis durable piece of hardware is built with cork, and then <br>\r\nencased with lightweight aluminum.

Something primal within you triggered, as you gripped your new weapon and sprinted back to her. The scenery blurred, as you had no less than a second to understand the situation. Rei was hunched up on the ground, using her spear to keep the target undead at bay. This one was your target. You leapt forward, raising your baseball bat into the air. With one powerful movement, you brought your weapon crashing down against the skull of this enemy. Blood flew everywhere, as the zombie collapsed to the ground, absolutely slathered with its own brain contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear your own pulse, as your heartbeat raced. Adrenaline was rushing through your system upon the thought of your beloved partner being injured \u2013 or even worse \u2013 dying. You refused to let fate take hold of your beloved woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you turned to Rei who cowered on the ground. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</span> Although she heard your question, Rei seemed distracted by something else. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI pierced this one right through the heart, and nothing happened\u2026 what the hell.\u201d</span> Rei rose to her feet and retrieved the makeshift spear from the chest of her brutalized opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSmashing its head seemed to work just fine.\u201d</span> While only joking at first, you realized this to be the truth. But you had little time to dwell on this, as the racket caused by your frantic battle had drawn the attention of more undead. They shuffled across the track field as you spoke. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWe need to keep moving. The side gate should be clear\u2026 it looks like everyone else got caught inside the school.\u201d</span> This was difficult to stomach, knowing many of the students who perished were once close friends. Whatever the case, you refused to let their death mean your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou navigated the school yard with Rei, deterring the occasional zombie until you reached the side gate. It was wide-open. Some teacher must have had the foresight to unlock this gate during the chaos, but such a person was here no longer. They had either run away or joined the ranks of the dead. Regardless, you fled the school and worked your way to the outskirts of town. This was where the population waned, and it would be safer to rest and formulate your plans for survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was plenty more danger in the future\u2026 but for now, you had succeeded. You were safe, and so was Rei. That was all that mattered right now.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, it did not have the beautiful scenery you remembered. Abandoned cars lined the street, their doors left ajar. This told the fate of those who attempted to flee an onslaught that followed them out of the city. Knowing it was only a matter of time before you, too, encountered this threat, you changed your path and wandered down a little backroad disconnected from civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft, but audible steps of Rei behind you were reassuring. She had done an excellent job of diverting the occasional zombie with her spear, and you were proud to have fallen for such a reliable girl. But then, you heard a faint yelp come out of her mouth. You stopped, turning behind you to look at Rei. She was ignorant of the bizarre noise, returning your stare with a curious expression. Maybe your mind was playing tracks on you. With another few steps, there it was again. There was no reason to turn around this time. Something was plaguing Rei, so you wanted to get off the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning your surroundings, you remembered the existence of a ruined monastery down the road. This was a place where you explored with Rei when you were younger. It was not so much a single shrine, but a collection of smaller religious buildings. It was obvious, even back then, that such a place had fallen out of favor with the locals. You decided to take Rei there once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cI think it\u2019s time for a break.\u201d</span> Your voice was almost pleading for Rei to accept such a decision. Stopping anywhere in this apocalyptic scenario was a poor choice, but you needed to diagnose Rei\u2019s affliction. If it was something serious, you would blame yourself if something happened later. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThat old monastery down the road is around here\u2026 it should be safe there.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough hesitant, Rei was at least aware of her own health. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYeah\u2026 let's rest for a while.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wandered down the road and approached the monastery entrance. There were no signs of life besides the various insects that buzzed through the warm air. Likewise, the entire courtyard was overgrown with wild vegetation that ever-so-slowly reclaimed the human constructions. Only the largest of the buildings \u2013 a temple \u2013 remained undamaged from the environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached this temple, forcing its sliding doors to the side to reveal an old, musky interior. While your memories were fleeting, you followed them down a long hallway and entered a small room towards the rear of the structure. A small coffee table sat in the middle of this room, surrounded by aged sitting pillows. A permanently clouded window on the other end channeled enough light for you to make out its unchanged appearance. This was the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could invite Rei in to take a seat, she brushed past you and sat down on one of the pillows closest to the window. She remembered this place, the same as you. Her first order of business was to remove her white tennis shoes. You were soon treated to the sight of a matching pair of clingy, white ankle socks. These must have been one of Rei\u2019s favorite pairs, because they had seen quite a bit of use. Alongside the obvious grayish dinge that tainted the fabric, patches of cotton around her toes and heel had been worn off. This erosion left nothing but a thin, transparent mesh to cover her exposed soles.\u2003<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked up at you, with her eyes expectantly prodding yours. She looked to be asking something with her gaze, almost as if she knew you were looking at her socks. Was she aware of your secret admiration for her feet? Your heart fluttered at the possibility of her knowing the truth. After all, it was Rei herself who inspired your affliction for feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a child, you would often go over to Rei\u2019s house to play. She almost exclusively went barefoot during this time, so you would regularly involve her feet in your childhood games. You were fascinated with them, and with good reason. Rei had uniquely small feet, to the extent that her parents had to special order shoes for her. Playing with her feet was all it took to instill a foot fetish into your subconscious, later to reveal itself when you grew older. Although Rei was almost an adult now, you were elated to see that her feet grew into the physique that you remembered so well. The dimensions of her feet were still petite, as visible through her pair of well-used socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell? Are you going to sit down?\u201d</span> Rei questioned, as you stood in the doorway recounting your past. A part of you was glad that this was just a coincidence. There was no way she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cAh, sure\u2026\u201d</span> You followed Rei into the room, kneeling down on the pillow next to her. Although this was a rather inviting situation, you wanted to keep your head. Your concern for Rei outweighed any fetish you harbored. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence was her response, as Rei turned away to look at the window. She seemed embarrassed by whatever was plaguing her, and was hesitant to reveal her problems to you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cRei, please tell me. I want to help you.\u201d</span> A few caring words were all it took to tip Rei over the edge, as she looked down at her socks. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt\u2019s my feet\u2026 after practice, they\u2019re usually a bit sore. Usually I could get Hisashi to give me a foot rub during our lunch break, but\u2026 you know.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised such a problem arose, especially in the wake of your school being razed by the undead. You also knew that her boyfriend, who she had been forced to abandon, was likely among the deceased. There was no upside to talking about her boyfriend\u2019s whereabouts, so you changed the topic to the only thing you could in this conversation. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWould you like a foot massage?\u201d</span>\u2003<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reaction was exactly what you expected it to be. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWha-? No, I couldn\u2019t make you do that.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cIf it helps, you can think of it as volunteering my services.\u201d</span> You found success with your words, as she paused in contemplation of such an arrangement. Rei swiveled her body to face you, as she stammered her response. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cO-OK.\u201d</span> There was something curious about her so readily accepting the massage, but you weren\u2019t complaining. This was the first time you would be able to hold her bare feet since you were both children.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">Rei snuck a couple of fingers underneath the elastic cuffs of her socks, slipping the fabric straight off her feet. While removing her socks wasn\u2019t necessary for a foot massage, you weren\u2019t going to fight her decision. You wanted Rei comfortable, but more importantly, you wanted to see her feet once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoved from their restrictive confines, her bare feet were soon revealed. The sight was spectacular, as you marveled the features that were so shamefully hidden beneath a layer of cotton. Her long days of practice seemed to have left a permanent mark on her feet, coloring the most active parts of her soles with a brownish tone. This tint worked in conjunction with her deep curves, allowing for a beautiful contrast between this firm skin and the milky, white skin that ran along the length of her arch. And just as you imagined, the smallness of her feet brought out their feminine side. Her toes were proportionally sound, decreasing in length as you counted down from her big toe, while her voluptuous heel curved towards her ankle in one, gentle bend. It was undeniable that Rei had an attractive pair of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze remained unbroken, as Rei brought them down into your lap. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHere you are!\u201d</span> She exclaimed with a little smirk. There were no more words of resistance from her, as she idly flexed her toes while waiting for you to begin. A scent wafted up from her feet, the faint aroma tickling your senses. This goaded you onward, as you wrapped your hands around her left foot. The damp warmness of her skin was welcoming, as you pictured the rough day at practice she must have had earlier this morning. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThanks.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting the massage, you eased your thumbs into her upper sole. These movements were tender and smooth, as you examined her foot in search for the most distressed areas. Your fingers flowed down the length of her foot, working in tandem with her sweaty skin to provide an even massage. It was here that you rolled down to the curve of her arch, prodding this soft flesh to discover a cluster of stiffened muscles. Her mere soreness was looking to be an understatement. You worked your thumbs into these muscles, slowly kneading the stiffness out of her sole. This must have been the reason Rei needed to rest. Although she withheld her words of approval, as if to compliment your efforts, her big toe started swaying back and forth alongside each of your strokes. Rei was enjoying this, as she leant back and propped herself up with her arms. Such innocent cues were endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her main cause of distress dealt with, your movements became far more sensual. You made the most of every second, extending your fingers to caress the smooth skin around her ankle, while your thumbs rolled across the deep curve where her heel met her arch. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</span> Rei relaxed, letting out a hum of delight. While this was pleasing for Rei, such movements were similarly pleasing for you, and all of this stimulation was starting to distract you from reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou\u2019re so gentle with my feet\u2026 you must really love them.\u201d</span> Rei joked, flexing her big toe backward in sheer delight of the massage. It was clear that Rei had not taken into account the chance that you actually had a foot fetish. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI do\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple seconds passed before your mind caught up with the substantial words you had uttered. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou like my feet?\u201d</span> Rei questioned, growing an immediate interest in the conversation. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cY-Yes\u2026\u201d</span> Your words lacked the smoothness that they had before. Rei leaned forward to explore the sudden development. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhen did this happen? I had no idea\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cIt was a long time ago\u2026 back when we were kids, even.\u201d</span> You truthfully admitted to Rei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAll those times you played with my feet\u2026?! Wow\u2026 I gave you a foot fetish.\u201d</span> She remembered her childhood quite well, and was astonished by the sudden realization. Even with this, however, Rei was rather accepting of the situation. Your ulterior motives to offering this foot massage didn\u2019t frighten her. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, if it helps, you gave me a little something, too\u2026\"</span> Rei looked at you, hinting at something that escaped your calculations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to be confused. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI like men touching my feet, and that's <i>all because of you</i>. So, I guess we're even.\u201d</span> Rei revealed this with a mischievous, little smile that you soon came to adore. If what she said was true, then you were inadvertently sharing pleasuring each other. You were frozen at the mere thought, your mind crippled in its efforts to understand how you too inspired a fetish within your beloved crush. It was hard to believe that this situation could arise from your mere blunder of words. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cDon't forget my other foot, now.\u201d</span> She playfully prodded your arm with her right foot, reminding you of the promised massage. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cPlease, I wouldn't even dream of it.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">- - - - -</div><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Foot Trait Revealed:</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><b>Reverse Foot Fetish:</b><br>\r\nAs a result of her childhood, this girl <br>\r\nfinds pleasure in having her feet handled.</span></font></div><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Relationship Revealed:</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><b>Magnetic Lovers:</b><br>\r\nTheir attraction was inevitable, <br>\r\nand nothing will draw them apart.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>+2 to Survival</b></span></span></font></div><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Ending <b>'Scenario Projection'</b>.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Running <b>'Choice Projection'</b>.</span></i><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - - - -</div></span><br>\r\nLeaving the monastery, you stepped back out onto the rugged, asphalt street. Rei stood beside you, her stride left energetic after the rejuvenating foot massage she received. You imagined that revealing both of your sexual interests also had something to do with her blissful state-of-mind. Even you were feeling rather refreshed after your short stay at the monastery. You were glad for this feeling, but the outside world hadn\u2019t changed in the short time you spent isolated in the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to decide which way you were headed. There was no staying here, as the monastery lacked the three most essential elements to your survival: water, food and safety. Although your choices were limited, you could at least choose your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left was the road you had arrived from, which lead back into the city you originally fled. The urban backdrop reflected its current state of chaos, as fires raged and massive plumes of smoke colored the distant skies. You didn\u2019t want to return to that undead clusterfuck. It was a dangerous place, even if it was guaranteed to be rich in the supplies you needed to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the road to your right led straight into the woods. Massive, overgrown foliage dominated these forests, providing safety for those gifted in survival. Anyone within them would need to turn to nature for sources of food, water and shelter. However, once these were established, the threat that the undead posed would be exponentially reduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Rei, lost in your decision. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSo, which way?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression grew solemn while contemplating an answer. You knew Rei wanted to return to the city, if not just to locate her family and friends. That was the sort of woman she was. Unfortunately, there was no surviving alone in such a dangerous place. Rei needed to return with you, not only because she trusted you, but because she knew that you would never abandon her in a dangerous situation. This was nothing short of true, but you wanted to cherish more of your time with Rei. Any one of your lives could be cut short in the city, while entering the forests would at least spare you a horrifying death at the hands of the deceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIf I go back\u2026 can I continue to count on you for foot rubs?\u201d</span> Rei seemed hesitant in giving an answer, supplementing it with her desire to bring you along. This was her request, but she wasn\u2019t forcing your decision. In fact, the softness of her pleading eyes seemed to speak the opposite. She would follow you wherever you chose to go, simply because it would mean survival. The choice was yours.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew that she was the Kendo Team Leader, and that her skills with the sword were unparalleled. While you were looking to forge a relationship with Saeko, fate was not sympathetic to your cause. She was a third-year student, while you were just a second-year. This age difference of one year strongly influenced your ability to converse with her, outside of introductions and the occasional greeting. But today was going to change all of that. Today, you were going to take fate into your own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this optimism however, there was a slim chance of actually finding Saeko. You knew very little about her routine school activities, outside of her classroom being on the third floor of the school. There was no guarantee for her to be in her classroom, as an exemplary student like Saeko would often be excused from daily lessons to handle the duties expected of her. She could be anywhere in the school\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could figure out your plan of attack, you heard exasperated whimpering from further down the corridor. A female student hobbled up the stairs not but a few meters from you, limping from some unknown damage inflicted to her leg. She collapsed to the ground after completing her ascent, hastily crawling along the floor to huddle up underneath one of the windows that lined the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran towards her, kneeling at her side. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHey, what happened?!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded with a simple shake of her head, as tears filled her eyes. This girl was a first-year student, likely having enrolled into high school this very semester. Upon closer examination, you found a bite wound on her left ankle. It looked like a wound she received from one of the teachers while fleeing the incident at the main gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dull, clunking noise woke you from your investigation, as you found that the girl had released her grip on a hefty brick. This was likely prepared as an improvised weapon against her aggressor. Judging by its condition, this girl didn\u2019t have the time to use it. This would change shortly, as you heard an eerie moan echo up from the stairway right next to you. Turning around to meet this threat, you found one of the older teachers who was involved in the incident shambling up the steps. He was drenched in copious amounts of blood, most of which didn\u2019t even appear to be his own. An unceasing rasping came out from the teacher\u2019s gaping mouth, as if he had caught sight of his next victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t going to let this be your final resting place. Grabbing the brick, you rose up and stood against this reanimated creature. With its first step onto the second floor, you weightily slammed your blunt object against the side of its head. The clumsy beast toppled to the ground. This was your chance to win, so you leapt onto its sluggish frame and pinned it to the floor. Instincts took over, as you repeatedly brought the brick down to bear upon the teacher\u2019s forehead. With each successive blow, your opponent grew slower and less cognitive. Your blood was rushing through your system from the thrill of combat, while your vision hazed in a primal attempt to focus on the only threat in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the teacher\u2019s struggles came to a halt. There were no more rasps or groans \u2013 only your own hurried breathing remained. The brick once again dropped to the ground, this time stained with the blood of another. You were exhausted, but you had easily won this engagement.

But even then, you noticed that something wasn\u2019t right.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>*Click*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cAttention, all students.

She staggered towards you, her body as cold and lifeless as the reanimated teacher you had just slaughtered. In less than a second, she violently clashed against you, tossing you to the floor. The girl dropped on you, pinning you just like you had to your previous opponent. Her jaws actively sought out your flesh, as your groans of distress went unheard due to the live skirmish that erupted in the broadcasting room. Though you kept this girl at bay, the brick was out of reach and you were still exhausted from your first engagement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour strength was fading, until the fight was quickly ended with a distinctive, lurid crack. While you concerned that this crack originated from yourself, this fear dissipated when you found your attacker topple off you. As her body flopped down the stairs, you discovered a tall, feminine figure standing above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAre you injured?\u201d</span> She asked, her voice calm and collected in spite of shattering the skull of a former student. A splotch of blood stained the wooden katana that she wielded. You rubbed your eyes, revealing this person to be exactly who you were looking for \u2013 Saeko Busujima. You let out a sigh of relief, picking yourself back up. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cNo, no... I'm doing better now.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you first noticed, Saeko was quite tall. Her presence was intimidating, if not for the fact that she was a year older than you, but also because she was an astonishing beauty. Saeko had long, black hair that radiated a bluish tint, complimenting her piercing, dark blue eyes. She had a slender, feminine body with a perfect posture, reflecting that of a noblewoman from centuries long past. Further down, you caught a glimpse of the black stockings that she always wore to school. While this was not a regular part of the female uniform, she adopted this piece of clothing into her own personal style. And as you figured, it suited Saeko well. No thought pleased you more than being able to soothe her stocking-covered feet after a victory at one of her tournaments. You tried not to let these desires plague your thoughts, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer excessively formal style of speech only supported the idea that Saeko was raised in an upright household. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cGood, then you can come with me.\u201d</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout being given a second to preach your gratitude, Saeko grabbed your wrist and dragged you down the stairs. Her expedited pace forced you to leap over the corpse that had fallen down the stairs. You imagined this rush had something to do with the battle over the intercom, as the broadcaster let out a chilling scream that echoed throughout the school building.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your confusion for her haste disappeared when you heard the school burst into an uproar behind you. Saeko plowed through the double doors with you close behind, as the both of you narrowly avoided the blind stampede of students trying to escape the coming slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat the hell were those things that attacked me?\u201d</span> Your frustrations started to show themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid I do not know.

In the wake of your complaints, your senior grinned. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI thought that all men knew how to use their wood.\u201d</span> Saeko joked before strutting off into the locker room, closing the door behind her. Even if you had a response to her adult humor, the warmth that filled your cheeks kept you silent. It was clear that Saeko had a rather dirty mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the hilt of the wooden katana, you wandered away from the locker room entrance and stood guard underneath the shaded pathway. Trying to ignore the ruckus inside of the school building was impossible, especially when the terrified screams of its occupants seemed to grow by the moment. There was a twinge of guilt in your mind for not helping them, but you felt no urge to risk death at the hands of your fellow students. A much closer scream reached your ears not long after deciding this. You glanced in the direction of this scream, watching as a female student rounded the corner by the front of the school. She ran towards you, but tripped and collapsed to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</span> You uttered, watching as those reanimated students surrounded her collapsed frame and begun feasting upon her flesh. Judging by her horrifying screams, it was safe to say these creatures lacked the intelligence to put a victim out of their misery. Three more deceased students rounded the corner with a new banquet in sight \u2013 you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your weapon in preparation for their arrival. As you had noted earlier, you had no idea of the technique required to wield this weapon correctly. However, it packed plenty of weight within its bulky, durable structure. If technique was thrown out of the mix, this weapon could facilitate the type of aggressive frenzy that you displayed back in the school building. Perhaps, this was what Saeko intended. You lowered the katana, wielding it in your dominant hand as you walked forward towards your new opponents. Rage was filling your mind once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of these reanimations broke off from the pack and lunged towards you. With a simple side-step, you evaded this attack and smashed the wooden katana against the back of its skull as it passed. A spray of murky blood appeared around the area of impact, as you felt the vibrations of its skull cracking through the hilt of your katana. The thrill of combat was returning to your system, as the motionless carcass of your target flopped to the ground. You turned to face the remaining two reanimations. These two shuffled towards you at the same pace, prompting you to charge forth and launch an indiscriminant attack on the one closest to your katana. Your weapon met with the face of this second reanimation, completely rending its jaw as it toppled to the ground. On its way down, however, the second corpse glanced the third reanimation, resulting in an unpredictable wobble amidst its lunge towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempt to get an attack off on the third was a failure, and resulted in your blade being shoved into the mouth of this creature. Its teeth clamped down against the wooden frame, as it forced you backward and pinned you against the school building. You groaned, resisting the superior strength of your opponent, but it was a fruitless effort. The rage you felt moments ago was quickly being replaced with terror. Here you were again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as before, you noticed a whitish, metallic gleam in the corner of your eye. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</span> That was Saeko\u2019s voice, albeit more serious than before. Trusting her words, you held up your defense and waited. In a flash of movement, something sliced through the neck of the third reanimation. It was an instant defeat. As your attacker fell, you found Saeko holding a <span id=\"popnote15785698792\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('15785698792', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('15785698792',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">traditional katana.</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote15785698792\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\"><div align=\"center\"><b>Traditional Katana:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a historic katana from an era where quality was <br>\r\nprized above all else.

These words drew her attention, as she lowered her katana and walked towards you. With her main hand, Saeko reached out and cradled your cheek. The smoothness of her skin was welcoming, as was the gentleness of her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThere is no reason to apologize.\u201d</span> She was speaking directly to your pride as a man, through her understanding as a woman. Her words held a deep level of intimacy that was unexpected from a girl you barely knew. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYou did exactly what I requested of you, and I am grateful for this.\u201d</span> Saeko withdrew her hand as she strolled away, treading past the slain reanimations. You were enchanted by her ability to waive your conflictions like they were nothing. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cBesides, it would be a far greater inconvenience for my new companion to perish before I could even see him in action.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange feeling welled up inside of you. The desire you had to form a relationship with Saeko was still there, but it was minimal compared to the sudden attachment you felt for her after this moment. Though hesitant to call it love, something drew you closer to Saeko, and it was a hard feeling to ignore. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cShall we leave?\u201d</span> Saeko glanced back at you with a pleasant, little smirk. Even now, amidst all this killing and death, she was the exact same person that you had met before. You wanted a response that would suit the perfect, noble existence in front of you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOf course\u2026 my lady, Saeko.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trailed Saeko across the school grounds, eventually reaching the side gate that was left wide open. This would be your exit. As Saeko split off for a moment to finish a nearby zombie with a clean, precise sweep, she led you out of the school and down a path further into the city. While you were unsure of your destination, as long as Saeko was there, you would be too.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was a heavily-populated area, and you were starting to encounter more and more of the infected that you intended to escape from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason you were still alive was because of your new companion, Saeko, who was more than capable of dispatching small groups of this town\u2019s new, cannibalistic residents. She was an unstoppable force \u2013 everlasting in her determination to survive and reach an unknown destination. With each engagement, Saeko only grew fiercer and more aggressive towards her attackers. It had gotten to the point where she was going out of her way to draw herself into conflict with the undead, when stealth of evasion would have been a far more effective means of survival. Something was agitating your new companion, and it was difficult \u2013 if not perilous \u2013 to keep up with her at this pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile wandering through a middle-income residential area, a new dilemma threatened to endanger your lives. An abandoned police cruiser sat in the middle of the road you wanted to traverse, its siren on and blaring loudly to draw all of the reanimated to its location. To say this street wasn\u2019t safe, with such a massive group of flesh-seekers flocking to the police cruiser, was something of an understatement. To any intelligent survivor, this route was blocked\u2026 but Saeko was thinking irrationally. She licked her lips and continued her stride forward, walking towards the immense collection of undead. This was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSaeko!\u201d</span> You attempted to nab her attention, but it was an effort made in vain. Dashing to her side, you tried once more to dissuade her from fighting this senseless battle. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to fight here\u2026!\"</span>\u2003<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201dI didn\u2019t take you for a coward.\u201d</span> Saeko stated with a playful smirk, as she approached a straggler from the swathe of undead swarming around the police cruiser. With the force of reason no longer applicable to your partner, she raised her katana and decapitated this zombie with a single, clean swoop. The sounds of gore alerted the rest of the horde to her presence, and forced you into this risky, almost suicidal battle alongside your companion. Saeko licked her lips in spite of the danger, striding straight towards her enemies with her bloody fang of a blade exposed. She was completely lost to her inane desire to destroy these undead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lone person with any sense, you tried to position yourself close to Saeko in order to deflect some of the undead attackers that would flank her. It was a defensive role, but it played out well as you brought your practice sword to bear against the skull of your first target. You could feel the crushing effect against the side of its skull, as you reduced it to mere fragments with a decisive strike to the head. It was your role to protect Saeko as she controlled the crowd, allowing her to freely engage the zombies without being mobbed by stragglers. This was a conservative tactic, but you maintained some success defending Saeko as she left a trail of undead corpses in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were content with this sight, as you carefully continued to choose your fights against those who most threatened Saeko\u2019s rampage. Not long into the battle, you began to notice some vague inconsistencies appear in her fighting style. The preciseness of her strikes was deteriorating, as she started to focus on non-killing blows to dismember or gore her opponents before finishing them. Her mouth was left agape, as exaggerated breathing plagued her movements. This was no longer the result of simple exhaustion; there was something very wrong happening to your new companion. However, over a couple minutes of careful battle had left the undead horde considerably thinned out. Most of those taken out of the fight lined the streets motionless, or were left too disabled to rejoin the battle. Only those who lagged behind remained, and you were sure to mop them up with not but a little more effort. Despite the bizarre condition that Saeko continued to show, you decided to finally break off from her and mop up those of the undead who remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the roaring pitch of the police sirens, and a short distance away from your new companion, there was no way for you to realize the deteriorating nature of Saeko\u2019s condition. Her intentions were obvious as she approached one of the damaged, crawling zombies, and slowly delivered the tip of her blade into the forehead of her helpless opponent. The gleaming metal slipped deeper and deeper into its cranium, piercing greater depths as each second passed. Saeko bared an ecstatic grin, as she watched the zombie struggle against its brain matter slowly being torn asunder. It was purposeless, prolonged torture, and Saeko was enjoying every moment of it. Her opponent grew progressively unresponsive, until the intrusive blade was drawn from its skull with a sudden jerk. The zombie went unresponsive, as its head fell to the ground below. In a final act of submission, the loose contents inside its head, a rancid mixture of torn brain matter and murky blood, leaked out onto the asphalt before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaeko gazed at the puddle of gore forming beneath her school shoes. This sight instigated a strange flicker of emotion within your companion. Her unusually pronounced breathing grew even heavier than before, as her entire body quivered. Whatever was building up within Saeko for the last couple hours had finally been released, as she whimpered a stem of erotic whimpers. Her legs shuddered, forcing her to stumble backward and collapse beside the police cruiser that relentlessly blared its sirens. It was with her collapse that your fears were finally realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke off from the undead and rushed to your collapsed partner. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHey, what happened?! Were you hurt?!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question was swiftly ignored, as Saeko slipped a few fingers beneath her skirt and into the confines of her panties. While this was nothing but a surprise, the real shock came when you saw her hand return, only to find her slender fingers glistening with a light slather of her own womanly juices. Somewhere in your unconscious mind, you had already drawn this conclusion \u2013 that Saeko drew sadistic pleasure from her battles with the undead, but you wanted to avoid that discussion for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201c\u2026Not again\u2026\u201d</span> She muttered, physically weary and mentally incapable of defending herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn such a dangerous situation, and with more undead before attracted to the police siren by the second, you were left with no choice but to retreat. You grabbed her hand, ignoring the moistness caused by her feminine bits, before dragging Saeko away from the conflict she started.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The previous occupants of this household were missing, having taken everything of value and rushing to flee the country in wake of this outbreak. With no one able to object to your presence here, there was now only a single worry on your mind \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Saeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the confident, mature persona that you came to adore. Saeko was a dejected husk of her former self, and you had suspicions as to the reason for this. This was likely a problem that plagued your companion for the entirety of her teenage years, but there was little to insinuate beyond that. The rest you needed to hear from Saeko personally. You searched the kitchen, locating a chilled bottle of water from the still-functional refrigerator. This was enough. Water bottle in hand, you returned to the living room where Saeko had gone to rest after arriving. She sat on the couch in the middle of the room, her shadowy figure inscribed by the vibrant, white static of the television perched in front of the couch. Based on the insecure glances she gave you upon returning, you could tell that Saeko was humiliated by this event. She knew that you sought an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a seat beside Saeko on the couch, handing her the chilled bottle of water. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> Her voice was soft and withdrawn, hinting at the fatigue she bore from the intense battle you helped her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you alright?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> You asked, taking note of the indifference that Saeko showed towards your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need to worry about me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling better now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> Her words were filled with gloom, as Saeko stared blankly downward. Despite your worries for her, she was unwilling to divulge the nature of her weakness. Even if that was the case, you were far too concerned with your new companion to give in here. <span class=\"cred\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really like you, Saeko, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry this happened to you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but something like this needs to be addressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaeko glanced towards you, before returning her gaze to the floor. Introducing your own feelings into the mix did little to gain her trust. You felt helpless, forced to watch this beautiful flower wither away in front of you. But then you noticed something. Over the course of your search for water, Saeko had slipped off her school oxfords. This allowed her illustrious, black stockings the freedom they warranted. She slowly ran her stockings against the mid-length carpet, allowing its dense consistency to caress the both of her soles. This looked like an unconscious action, brought about her desire to seek comfort in an otherwise stressful situation. This was the answer to your problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your better senses, you reached out and calmly grabbed her legs. Still distraught by her sadism, Saeko showed little resistance to your movements. Her eyes followed your hands, as you maneuvered her feet into your lap. It was obvious that the more heated a fight was, the more heated Saeko became. You wanted to become the one that could support Saeko in the future, but there was only one way to ensure her dangerous weakness would never show itself again \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you had to become her pleasure. For this reason, you began stroking her soles, running your fingertips against the smooth fabric of her stockings. Her feet had these elegant, womanly curves that spanned the length of her soles, ceaselessly welcoming your hands into the subtle muscles beneath her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"You know, I rather like that side of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> You stated, now running your thumbs along her arch. Saeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sharp, intimidating gaze shifted to your hands, and that of the devoted effort they put into soothing her feet. No doubt, she had already discerned your next words. <span class=\"cred\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll we need is a different method of stimulation, if that makes sense. You just need\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the right partner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression turned grim after hearing this. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> Her stare expressed her disappointment with your intentions, under the assumption that your words were nothing but a pathetic attempt to get into her panties. She gave no response besides this stare, forcing you to push the invitation a tad further. <span class=\"cred\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cEhm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing, I can-\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Right, then.\"</span> Saeko was quick to agree, interrupting your offer with her agitated words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>&lt;:: Event Trigger Recognized.</i></span><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>&lt;:: Locating Correct Protocol.</i></span><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>&lt;:: Administering <b>'ERE Protocol'</b>.<br>\r\n&lt;:: Initiating <b>'ERE Sense'</b> Program.</i></span><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">&lt;:: <span class=\"cmagenta\"><b>Erotic Sense</b></span> Active.<br>\r\n&lt;:: Detecting Event \u00e2\u0080\u0093 <b>Strength: 35 Ere</b><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>+15 Ere</b> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Stockings<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>+10 Ere</b> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sexual<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>+5 Ere</b> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Light Scent<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>+5 Ere</b> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Submissive</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">. . .</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, such an easy development was unlikely. Saeko pulled her left foot away from your grasp. Before you could decipher the reason behind this movement, she pressed her sole against the middle of your chest. With a sudden thrust of movement, she used this foot to push you off the couch. Despite the cushioned impact, you still landed onto the carpet with a noticeable thud. You weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure how to take her actions until a moment later, when both of her feet returned. Saeko placed her left foot flat upon your abdomen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to ensure you remained in this position \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as her right foot hovered above your face. She remained silent, instead delegating her toes to do her bidding. Saeko flexed them back and forth, allowing her digits to come dangerously close to your face at the apex of her tauntingly devilish movements, only for them to stop and repeat these motions all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong? Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this what you wanted?\"</span> Saeko chastised you for not beginning as soon as her feet were introduced; although she seemed to have accepted your offer for the wrong reasons, there was no doubting the insatiable lust that flowed through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up towards your companion, you felt your existence diminish. From this position, there was no correcting her thought process. Saeko was sure to ignore any of the comforting reassurances that you wanted to speak to her \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these words had surely betrayed her in the past. Instead, she needed someone to cater to her innate sense of dominance, and as of moments ago, you were resolved to this degrading position. This conclusion took you seconds to reach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 precious time that Saeko mistook for hesitance. She brought her right foot down to your mouth, covering half of your face with her slim, seductive sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cKiss it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> With her desires suddenly transparent, they were now being directed towards you.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was hard to decipher whether this scent was coming from her foot , or the stocking which had been basting in her sweat until now. Regardless of the answer, you refused to become another disappointment to Saeko. You pursed your lips and placed the first kiss upon her sole, drawing a satisfied hum from your troubled companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"\u2026Do continue.\"</span> Saeko slurred, offering you a chance to prove your noble intentions right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reason to ignore her request, but it became clear that you needed greater access to her foot in order to fully commit yourself. You brought your hands upward, placing one under her calve and another around her ankle. The rough, grinding sensation offered by her stockings invited you further, as you supported her leg and resumed traversing her stocking-encased foot with more kisses. This was surely pleasurable to Saeko, who closed her eyes and dipped a hand beneath her skirt. There was little wonder what her mischievous fingers with doing, as quiet, subdued moans began to arise from further up the couch. You wanted to help Saeko feed her sexual appetite, and it seemed like this method was most effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new mindset, you left a swathe of kisses in your wake as you flowed up her encased sole. Knowing that it was paramount to convince Saeko of your intentions, you fumbled to reach your new target \u2013 her toes. You guided her foot forward, slowly nudging your mouth against her toes until Saeko gave into your movements. She flexed her digits upward, revealing to you the delicate pit of flesh beneath her toes. This was all you needed, as you pressed your lips against this sensitive area and lathered her toes with as much passion as you showed the rest of her foot. Her soft moans grew louder, and Saeko was no longer sparing the effort to keep them concealed. She spread her thighs and gyrated according to her increasingly furious movements. While this was already an indicator for your success, her toes wiggled about their stocking confines, flexing its irresistible, dark fabric every time a moan escaped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you noticed the muscles within her leg shiver with tension. A flurry of progressively louder moans came out of her mouth, eventually culminating in an uncontrollable scream of complete ecstasy. This was her moment; this was Saeko\u2019s climax. Her wiggling toes froze, allowing you to furiously peck at them with your kisses, while her body trembled violently and gave way to the pleasure that overrode her actions. Her eyes jolted open, as her back arched in the final throes of her sexual pinnacle. All you could hear were her stressed cries, accompanied by the faint splatter of womanly juices beneath her lengthy skirt. Her cries turned to whimpers, as her stunning, blue eyes glazed over, effectively marking the end of her climax. The tensed toes you worked against finally relaxed, as the rest of her body slumped back down onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally calm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rich, euphoric moment following her climax was abruptly ended by the gruesome moans of the undead, as they clattered on the walls, windows and doors of the house. Their corrupting influence was brought by the deafening cries of your companion as she underwent her climax. It was an upsetting thought, to say the least, which was only worsened as you noticed Saeko dawning an unsettling smile. Her laughter soon followed, as her voice bled through the erratic moaning outside the house, if only through the breaks in their animalistic shrieks. Her head drooped downward, as her amusement came to a gentle, disheartening close. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to die, you know.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stricken for words. <span class=\"cred\">\u201c\u2026Saeko.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSay nothing else.\u201d</span> She demanded, as the incessant groaning fought to drown out her voice. Her foot slipped out of your weakened grasp, falling to your chest where it remained. A soft pause followed her words, as you propped yourself onto your elbows to better understand your companion\u2019s plight. Judging by the somber expression on her face, you could tell this incident left a great impact upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDon\u2019t think me ignorant. This is the reason I might last a little bit longer out there.\u201d</span> Saeko brought her feet back towards the couch, lining them up alongside her shoes to put them back on. It was during this moment that you realized how natural it had become to be underneath her feet, as you only noticed their presence once they had been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet gradually left your sight, slipping back into the obscure confines of her shoes. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThat \u2026 you\u2019re the reason.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe displayed as little intimacy as possible, likely because she knew this wasn\u2019t a romance built to last. Even you could understand that it was only a matter of time before one of you made that fatal mistake\u2026 and Saeko wasn\u2019t prepared to commit herself to anything just yet. Judging by her somber expression, she had made this mistake before; past loves that she cared for turning against her, or judging her and running away upon discovering her darkest secrets. You must have been the first to accept her desires \u2013 maybe even the first one to instigate such blissful sensations within her, even if only for a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cCome on, let\u2019s keep moving. We need to make it to my house before sundown\u2026 fighting those things in the darkness would be a mistake.\u201d</span> Saeko brought herself to her feet, her confidence restored. She walked over to her katana, resting on an empty photography shelf near the front door. You stood and followed her, reaching out to grab your practice sword from the same shelf. Saeko, however, paused in front of you for a moment. She peered at you from the corner of her eyes, a touch of curiously girlish embarrassment tingeing her cheeks as she handed you the practice sword. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201c\u2026T-Thanks.

With one hand on the doorknob, and another on the grip of her katana, Saeko opened the door and unleashed her abilities against the undead that rallied to her cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was surely going to be the start of an interesting relationship.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This plan faltered as you reached the nurse's office, only to discover that her door was locked. The school intercom system then sparked to life, as a teacher broadcasted an evacuation order to the students and teachers of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis message was cut short however, as one of the creatures from the incident at the main gate <i><span class=\"clred\">slaughtered</span></i> the teacher while broadcasting. Amidst the ensuing panic that erupted inside of the school, a stampede of <i><span class=\"cindigo\">terrified</span></i> students swarmed down the hallway towards you. You pushed yourself against the door, withstanding the light battering until a <span class=\"clred\"><i>dire blow</i></span> struck the side of your head. With the damage sustained from this <i><span class=\"cindigo\">unexpected attack</span></i>, you faded to <i><span class=\"clred\">unconsciousness</span></i> just outside of the nurse's office.</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">. . .<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i>&lt;:: Engaging Storyline.</i></span><br>\r\n. . .</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Shadowy images of death filled your vision, as you started to regain your senses. The corridor you once roamed was filled with collapsed students, much like yourself, as those lumbering creatures you saw at the main gate feasted upon the unluckiest ones. They worked their way down the hallway, progressing only after having their fill of the meals set before them. You felt your head, wincing in pain upon touching the bloodied area where the blow had connected. As if the pain wasn\u2019t already enough, you struggled to move around the tiled flooring. It was clear your cognitive abilities had yet to fully return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to accept a fate like that, you crawled towards the closest wall and fastened yourself upright against it. If you were going to die, it wasn\u2019t going to be while lying injured on the ground. But all of a sudden, you heard some soft chattering. The door to the medical office cracked open, and from within emerged a series of students that avoided the initial stampede. None of them paid any attention to the wounded who were scattered along the corridor, of which included you. Judging by their relative calm, an official evacuation must have been underway. But none of that meant a thing to you unless they felt like dragging you out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then another person appeared. Your eyes were somewhat out of focus, but you could tell it was the very woman you were searching for \u2013 Shizuka. While it was too late to warn her about the outbreak, she could at least administer some first aid to get you back on your feet. However, the chance was slim that she would care enough about you to stop and treat your wound. Shizuka finished locking the door, turned around and then\u2026 looked straight at you. Concern flickered in her eyes, as she ran past the students she helped and towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d</span> Shizuka cooed, dropping the bulky medical box beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head and exposed the bloody gash beside your temple. Shizuka dug into her medical box and started gathering supplies. You were surprised. Very rarely had you seen Shizuka outside of her office, but she was an exceptionally beautiful woman. Her lengthy, blonde hair was tied into a single ponytail, while her soft, amber-colored eyes provided the perfect compliment. Your eyes strayed downward, examining her voluptuous body. Everything curved in all of the most sexual places for this woman, an attribute that was prominently featured in her massive breasts. Even in the midst of all your pain, it was hard to distract yourself from the erotic physique of this school nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a glance at her footwear, noticing that Shizuka wore a pair of school slippers. Her bare ankles were sticking out and exposed to the open air, something you thought was peculiar to see from one of the staff at this school. Though curious about this, you were just glad to have someone here. But there was an inevitable downside to Shizuka\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cSensei! If we stick around here, we\u2019re all going to die!\u201d</span> One of the students that Shizuka sheltered in her office came up behind her, immediately addressing the situation. You didn\u2019t blame them for wanting to flee, and apparently, neither did she. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cYou can go on ahead! We\u2019ll be right there!\u201d</span> Her cheerful tone made it hard for the students to object, as they left their savior behind and headed down the stairs. <span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cDon\u2019t expect for the bus driver to wait for you!\u201d</span> He followed the rest of the students down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat must have been their method of escape \u2013 one of the school buses. This was a problem. Even if Shizuka could get you down to the bus, it was unlikely to find their support waiting for you. There was no way you could handle the responsibility for the death of this woman, especially when she was trying to save you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cPlease, go with them.\u201d</span> Your heroic words were ignored, as Shizuka continued treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cErr\u2026 Miss Shizuka?\u201d</span> You called out to her, as she rubbed a dampened, alcoholic pad against your wound. While you writhed in pain from the contact, Shizuka finally responded. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThey won\u2019t leave without me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe certainty of her response surprised you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat? How are you so sure?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m the bus driver.\u201d</span> Shizuka bared an impish grin, dangling the keys to the school bus from her finger. You couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether she may have unintentionally sentenced all of those students to death through this action. Despite this, you were charmed by her uplifting nature. With a wild slap, Shizuka pressed a small bandage over your treated wound. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</span> She smiled, entirely unaffected by the catastrophe at work around her. For this loveable woman, you were prepared to do anything.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your steps were erratic, as the effects from your wound still plagued your movements. It was this inconsistency that slowed your progress. However, you were no burden to Shizuka, but a precious life that needed rescue. This knowledge was reassuring, as you finished traversing the stairwell and steered towards the main entrance to the building. You were nearly there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as fate had been so kind to send you a savior before, it was not going to do so again. As you rounded the corner of your preferred exit, you found an undead student shambling towards you. There was no way to evade this one. In a split-second decision, you broke off from Shizuka and tackled this threat. You crashed to the floor with your target, alongside Shizuka who collapsed from the sudden shift in balance. You redirected your opponent\u2019s gaping maw by gripping its neck, preventing the creature from its chilling method of slaughter. Though unaware at first, Shizuka realized the existence of your battle upon hearing your aggressive groans. She was terrified, left frozen in fear from the sudden encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnduring this struggle wasn\u2019t difficult, but the noises from this battle were attracting every undead in the corridor to your location. With this decision, you were no longer a burden to Shizuka, and she could escape the swarm with her life. Time was of the essence, and if it was wasted here, it would mean both your deaths. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cMiss Shizuka, go on without me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, instead of accepting your wishes, she scrambled over to the medical box she dropped and frantically started digging around for something. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d</span> You objected, trying not to lose focus on the undead within your grasp. From the corner of your eye, you saw Shizuka extract a syringe with an exceptionally long needle. She crawled over to you, slipping the plastic cover of the needle and taking into both of her hands. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI\u2019m helping you, of course!\u201d</span> Shizuka slammed the syringe through your opponent\u2019s eye, driving the needle deep into its brain cavity. It stopped moving shortly after this attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally over\u2026 until it resumed its struggle, flailing more violently than before. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh, fuck! Why is it still moving?!\u201d</span> As you posed this question, the struggle with your opponent resumed. Shizuka fretted, searching through her medical box for another alternative. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moans from additional hostiles became apparent from behind you. There wasn\u2019t any time for another plan, so you bunched up your fist and slammed it down on top of the syringe. Its pre-filled contents forcibly ejected inside of your opponent\u2019s brain. The result was a soft, unsettling pop that emanated from deep within its cranium. This time, it stopped moving for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cCome on!\u201d</span> Shizuka reached for your hand, ignoring her medical box as the rest of the undead started to swarm your location. As you grabbed her hand, you used her shoulder as support once again and hobbled away from the undead that threatened your lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fled to the parking lot, receiving nothing but looks of disdain from the survivors who spent their precious time waiting for your arrival. Among this group were the same students who left you back in the corridor, so their feelings mattered very little to you. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cSorry, everyone! We\u2019ll be going now!\u201d</span> Shizuka apologized to the other students, leaning you against the side of the bus as she went to unlock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the survivors boarded one after another, you closed your eyes in exhaustion. Trying to refresh your mind from this tragedy was difficult. Behind your eyes, it was the sight of those creatures that haunted your thoughts. Suddenly a shadow enveloped your face, and all you imagined was another one of them lunging towards you. Opening your eyes to defend yourself, you were met with a surprising sight. Shizuka leaned towards you, pressing her lips against yours in an arousing, but gentle kiss. This was a fleeting sensation, as she broke the kiss and smiled at you. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cThanks for protecting me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in disbelief, replying with the truest thought you held. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cT-\u2026Thanks for saving me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could collect your thoughts, Shizuka snatched your hand and led you onto the bus. While at this point you were capable of this yourself, there was little reason to object to a little extra compassion from the school nurse. Shizuka helped you towards the front-most row on the bus, where you thankfully reclined into the springy material of the closest seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exhaustion of the day was finally catching up to you. Accepting this moment of respite, you closed your eyes once again. Instead of the abominations that plagued your thoughts before, you now found a mental image of your blonde savior. While she was a selfless, but also careless individual, you saw a future in this new world for her. As your gratefulness to her could never be measured in words, you wouldn\u2019t be so disloyal as to forget her actions. Upon this, you vowed that today would be only the first of many days you would risk yourself to ensure her protection. It was these comforting thoughts that accompanied your swift departure into unconsciousness.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rubbing your eyes, the memories of your escape from school filled your mind. Survival in that situation would have been impossible if not for your savior. You reached up to your bandage, peeling its adhesive borders off your skin. The debilitating wound it covered had started recovering while you were asleep, so it was now nothing more than a wretched souvenir. Tossing this bandage on the floor, you resumed focus onto your fellow survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka was right in front of you, proudly at the helm of the bus. She drove according to the directions that were plastered on an evacuation pamphlet. The other teacher who joined your exodus from the school preached an unknown sermon to the rest of the students who escaped alongside him. While curious about his actions, your thoughts were separate from those of the others. The only thing that filled your mind was Shizuka. You thought about the reward she gave you before escaping. Never had you expected to receive a kiss from a grown adult, and no less from such an attractive woman. You stared at her, only catching yourself when Shizuka peeked at you from the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cPsst!\u201d</span> She called for your attention, cutely waving you to come closer. There was no way you would refuse a plea from this woman. You followed her bout of secrecy, ensuring no one was looking before shifting to the edge of your seat and leaning towards her. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI need a huge favor\u2026\u201d</span> Shizuka whispered, an unusual amount of concern filling her voice. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cOne of my slippers fell off\u2026 and I can\u2019t get it back on.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words got caught in your throat upon the slightest mention of her feet. <span class=\"cred\">\u201c..What?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cI think it\u2019s stuck behind the gas pedal\u2026\u201d</span> Shizuka pointed to her feet, beneath the massive dashboard of the school bus. You knew that she was asking you to retrieve it, and for such a request, you were totally compliant. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</span> Your savior seemed overwhelmingly pleased upon hearing this response. Shizuka peeked back towards the other teacher, who was unwittingly distracting the rest of the students on board the bus. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cQuick, come here!\u201d</span> She said, pushing you down and rushing you into the empty space between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little bit of repositioning, you found your head comfortably snug between her lower thighs. The puffy, marshmallow-like consistency of her flesh left you flustered, but no more than the thought of exploring the depths where her feet lurked. The engine block radiated an extraordinary amount of heat, turning this nook of the vehicle into a sweltering alcove. While faint, you could discern the scent of a fruity body wash rising upward. This delightful fragrance was left to stagnate alongside the sweat that your savior was sure to accumulate over the course of the day. The resulting aroma left an impactful twinge in your consciousness, further cementing your hesitance. After all, it was unclear whether you would be able to control your mounting excitement in such an environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you struggled to begin your search for the slipper, Shizuka grew impatient with your extended presence between her thighs. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cPlease, hurry!\u201d</span> She shoved you downward, pleading for your compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced into this dim crevice, your eyes were slow to adjust to the darkened interior. The faint scent that you noted earlier grew stronger, and noticeably more enjoyable. After a couple of seconds absorbing this fragrance, your eyes had attuned enough to examine its source. The feet of your benefactor were in front of you. Her left foot was still clad in a slipper, hanging just out of reach to ensure you had the room to conduct your search. However, her right foot was left bare. Shizuka carefully administered pressure to the gas pedal with her toes, blissfully unaware of the erogenous scent wafting off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entirety of her sole was left exposed, revealing the smooth and calloused skin that she had to offer. Judging by her skin, you found that your savior was one to frequent the beach, as the exfoliating effects of the sand were present even now. This looked to be the primary cause for the smoothness that her foot displayed. Alongside this, it seemed as though Shizuka received recurrent pedicures to maintain the length and symmetry of her unpainted toenails. This was an admirable quality, and you knew that she would likely turn to you for a continuation of such activities in the future. While fantasizing about these moments, you caught sight of the troublesome slipper that strayed too far from its foot. This item was stuck in a precarious position \u2013 wedged in-between the gas pedal and the interior of the bus. While this slipper was within reach, you needed a better vantage point in order to correctly dislodge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling forward, you brought yourself closer to this mischievous piece of footwear. You reached out and gripped the slipper in order to negotiate its gentle extraction. Before starting, you drew your first breath from this position, and all progress came to an immediate stop. You laid there stunned, trying to register what just occurred within you. You had just inhaled a breath of heated air, heavily laced with the perspiring fragrance that drifted off the foot of your benefactor. The scent was indomitably more intense than before, and the warmth beneath this dashboard made it so this was all you could breathe. As you felt the punishing scent flood your lungs a second time, you scrolled your eyes to gaze upon the absurdly close bare foot of your savior. You knew this was a dangerous situation.\u2003<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to withstand this pleasurable aroma, your retrieval of the slipper was forgotten. The climate around you grew stuffier as the seconds passed, influenced by your insulating presence beneath the dashboard. But still you laid there, fighting for every breath. You felt nothing of the neutral air that once filled your lungs, but only the prevailing scent of your mature benefactor. The attraction you felt for Shizuka was growing, and it was clear that the scent of her feet was the cause for this affliction. All of your emotions you held for this woman were blending together, creating a muddled sense of lust that took its toll on you. The fortitude you displayed was strong, but upon reaching it limit, your vision dulled as you focused in on the closest part of her bare foot \u2013 her lovely, voluptuous heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, the urges that filled your mind conflicted with the slightest bit of rationality that was still present. Your conscience hoped that entertaining this desire for a moment would be enough to dissuade it from doing anything too extreme. With this thought in mind, you pressed your lips against the back of her heel. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAh! Please be careful down there!\u201d</span> Shizuka was quick to react, but was unable to discern which part of your body touched this sensitive part of her foot. She dismissed this as no more than an accident, but that was far from the truth. You were left reeling in pleasure from this simple kiss. As you imagined, the scent of her foot was strongest at its source, but you found an unexpected, secondary benefit. Where your lips had made contact with the dimensions of her heel, you noticed the slightest tinge of her precious flavor. In this moment, your hopes of ending this safely were dashed; the kiss did not satisfy your desire\u2026 it left you thirsting for even more.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"justify\">Under the intoxicating influence of Shizuka\u2019s pheromones, there was no holding back. You focused onto the foot of your benefactor, as her curvy toes grappled the rubbery composite of the accelerator. The peachy complexion of her sole was startlingly erotic, pushing you straight into the final stage of your attack. Your mind went blank as you extended your tongue, allowing it to roll over the back of her heel. A jolt of surprise ran through Shizuka, as she released an endured squeal in response to your actions. Her voice was audibly muffled, as she tried to conceal this affair from the other occupants of this bus. She must have understood by now that your previous offense was no hapless accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this secrecy did not deter you from your desires. Your tongue actively sought out the area where her feminine musk was most accessible \u2013 a search which soon brought you to the curve of her heel. With but a single taste, you could tell that the flavor of her foot was very potent in this region. Your tongue explored every available bend along her heel, savoring the very essence of her foot. Under considerable strain from the pleasure you were experiencing, your sense of reason began to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst the tide of her numerous, gentle squeals, your savior couldn\u2019t help but state the unfortunate nature of her decision to draft someone with a foot fetish to retrieve her footwear. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cOh gosh, of all the times to discover you like my feet\u2026\u201d</span> She muttered, enduring the sensations wrought by your moist, frolicking tongue. While Shizuka was quick to diagnose the truth behind your actions, that wasn\u2019t the only reason you chose to do this. Hidden beneath your lust, you sought to express your thankfulness to Shizuka in the most intimate fashion possible. In this vein, your actions were suddenly very fitting, although your lust crippled any shred of wisdom you once held. You hoped that your benefactor could see through this drawback, as you transparently expressed these muddled emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oral barrage continued with an endless stream of slow, luscious laps. Her skin was soft and inviting, and the potency of her flavor graciously lured you across the crest of her heel. Exploring the curvaceous bottom of her heel, you noticed a gradual change in flavor. Here, the presence of her fruity body wash was weathered by the full extent of her sweaty pheromones. All of this was occurring in the one place you had yet to explore \u2013 her sole. The warmth welling up in your body was almost as intense as your rapid heartbeat, as you pushed onward in an attempt to find this pure flavor. You slid your tongue across her heel, savoring the precious moments your taste buds spent ravishing her smooth, calloused skin. This, however, was nothing but a taste. You craned your neck, struggling to reach the softer, more delicate skin of her arch. The tip of your tongue flailed around, merely tickling the sensitive heel of your benefactor in its response to your efforts. From this inconvenient position, you couldn\u2019t reach her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fight wasn\u2019t over yet. You jammed yourself between the accelerator and her foot, providing just enough room for the tip of your tongue to glance the tender sole you had been longing for. While it offered just a sample, the rich, untainted flavor you discovered was thrilling. What you didn\u2019t realize was that Shizuka was sharing in this moment, trying to cope with the effects of the sustained battle taking place upon her sensitive heel. Your tongue, constantly grazing her delicate skin, was practically torture. Her leg shivered with inaction, as she forced herself to wade through the trying sensations and maintain control of the accelerator. However, Shizuka was approaching her limit. Within the following seconds, you heard your benefactor release a loud, prolonged moan. Although this could potentially alert the rest of the bus to your presence, another worry introduced itself in the form of screeching rubber. This deafening noise filled your ears, as the inertia from a sudden turn threw your head straight into one of the interior walls beneath the dashboard. The tremor from this blow traveled through your both, ejecting the slipper that you had conveniently forgotten was still in your grasp. Through this awakening bout of pain, you were roused from your pleasurable trance. This was going to be difficult to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the struggle to regain your senses, a voice rang out from above. <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cWhat the hell was that?!\u201d</span> This was the voice of the male teacher, who angrily demanded to know why Shizuka had so suddenly jostled the direction of the bus. As the cause for this situation, you didn\u2019t want to get your benefactor into any trouble with the rest of the group. You attempted to reveal yourself, only to be kept into seclusion by the outstretched palm of your benefactor. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cSorry! There was something in the road\u2026!\u201d</span> Despite being very obviously exhausted, Shizuka covered for you. The conversation devolved into a long pause, almost as if the other teacher was contemplating something. The silence was dreadful, as each second passed under the threatening gaze of this outsider. <span class=\"cindigo\">\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to hit that \u2018something\u2019, next time.\u201d</span> The teacher scoffed at Shizuka, returning to his place at the back of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a moment to ensure the privacy of your activities, you emerged from the depths beneath the dashboard. Amidst the dangerous situation that almost transpired, no one had noticed your missing presence. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t over. Shizuka deserved an explanation. Although you turned to face your benefactor, nothing came out of your mouth. After so obviously taking advantage of your benefactor, it felt impossible to face the woman who saved your life, let alone explain your sudden infatuation with her feet. You were afraid to proceed, knowing your relationship with Shizuka could end from this simple debacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI-I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</span> Even with all of the shame that wracked your mind, you refused to make her wait any longer. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cPlease, can you ever hope to forgive \u2013 mppphh?\u201d</span> Your sincere words with promptly ended by Shizuka, as she brought a finger to your mouth. Could it be that she understood the problem, and could someone sympathize with your situation? Or perhaps she had no intention to listen to your apologies, and was contemplating throwing you off the school bus right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer became clear as soon as you noticed the corners of her mouth rise, forming a cute grin. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry; in the end, you did manage to free the slipper.\u201d</span> Still out of breath from your encounter with her feet, Shizuka wiggled her slippered foot beneath the dashboard. At least you were able to complete your objective, but she was surprisingly carefree about this. Before you could ask anything, Shizuka anticipated your question. <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cNext time, don\u2019t do it that when I\u2019m driving.\u201d</span> Shizuka dumbfounded you with this demand. She tilted her head, with the same cute grin plastered upon her face. There was no chance of maintaining your composure in front of her right now. <span class=\"cred\">\u201c\u2026U-Uh, yeah\u2026 of course.\u201d</span> You muttered a response of approval, and then awkwardly stumbled back to your seat.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">- - - - -</div><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Character Trait Revealed:</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><b>Pleasure Hound:</b><br>\r\nThis woman has no intention to hold<br>\r\nback her shameless thirst for pleasure.</span></font></div><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Finished Updating Traits.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">&lt;:: Resuming <b>'Storyline Projection'</b>.</span></i><br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - - - -</div></span><br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Plopping yourself down onto the rubbery seat, you stared straight into space. Adrift in a sea of confusion, all you could do was contemplate what just occurred. Her words seemed to indicate that Shizuka understood what happened to you. Even more so, she seemed accepting of your actions. Perhaps, you wondered, would it truly be possible to romance this woman known as Shizuka Marikawa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the answer never changed \u2013 of course, it was still no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka was a grown woman, and you were nothing but a kid still in high school. Although these labels meant little in a post-apocalyptic world, you knew there was never a chance for a romance with her. However, following this encounter, you discovered an alternative. The lines between love and lust were blurring, and Shizuka was showing herself to be an even bigger fan of the latter. It seemed foolish, building a relationship on the shaky foundations of lustful activities, but there was no other choice. You wanted to protect Shizuka from this world \u2013 a world that would take advantage of her compassion \u2013 but her feet were an aphrodisiac to you. It would only be a matter of time before you fell into this situation again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a great sigh, leaning back against the window. It was difficult to see the future of such an exceptional relationship. Would it be based solely on sexual activity, or would there be any vague semblance of romance intertwined? Would Shizuka even agree to such a future, if she knew the repercussions if others witnessed the relationship? Was it even be worth it? All of these questions plagued your mind, but like before, the answer never changed \u2013 you would do whatever it takes for a chance to be with Shizuka.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
