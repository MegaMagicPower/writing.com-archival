There is silence once again and a still breeze wanders through the air, gently causing the woman's golden hair to roll like waves of amber across her face. The dragon thinks for a moment then responds<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alight we do this tomorrow you bring your candidates and I'll bring mine.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Deal.\" The woman answers and then sinks back into shadow.

This is so exciting!  \"Prepare yourself to be joined in a bond more powerful than anything you've ever experienced.  Follow me!\" Beck leads you three around Training Hollow through the woods.  Then you see them.  Lounging in a clearing, are three dragons.  They are astounding.  This is the first time in your life you have witnessed a live dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Osiris, Loki, Venus!  Wake up!  Three young humans have been selected to make the bond.\"  Immediately as the blue-green female dragon, that must be Venus, turns her head to look at you three, Patricia dashes quickly toward her.  Venus now jumps up and runs to Patricia.  A blinding white light emerges from between them.  When the light clears, you see Patricia on Venus's back with a triumphant look on her face.  \"What you have just witnessed,\" Beck says, \"is the ultimate bond between dragon and human.  Patricia and Venus obviously have a very deep connection and now shall be inseparable.  Now it is time for the rest of you to also join in the bond.  Osiris, Loki meet Zack and Joshua.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOsiris is a pale green and black dragon.  He looks very grave and intimidating.  Loki is a fiery shade of red.  He looks playful and mischievous.  Which dragon will you bond with?</span></div></div>",

A life flashes before your eyes, a life not your own. You feel the power in your talons and the strength in your wings as you soar over the great forests and mountains. You know the thrill of the hunt, the feeling of a dying breath between your teeth. Still more scenes flash before your eyes and in the space of several seconds you have lived another lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your sight returns you realize that you are also seated upon Osiris' neck as Patricia was upon Venus. Immediately a feeling of peace and happiness overcomes you, and a smile spreads across your face, knowing that you have a companion that will never leave you or let you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look over you see Zack seated upon Loki as well.

You feel as though you have known Loki for a long time, and you are good friends.  You climb down his red scales to talk to him from the ground.  The others have also seemed to have started up conversation already.  Loki tells you many things.  He's also very funny.

You see one of them is your friend Rain, a blue she dragon about the same size as you.

There are only three of them and ten of you, seven of you will not be chosen.\" Your commander says, your heart stiffens at this information. That doesn't give you a very good chance of being selected. You hope for the best as the humans emerge from the trees. You wonder how such tiny beings could possibly be so strong. Though you had never seen a human you can clearly tell the difference between the males and females. The two males have a stronger looking build and shorter hair, the one female is more slender and has long silky hair. As the humans approach they look closely at each dragon, as if they were seeing their very thoughts. Suddenly the boy with black hair that reaches down to the tops of his shoulders turns and looks at you. Your heart skips a beat as he walks closer and gazes into your eyes. You want to turn your head but you feel fixed to the spot and can't.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is your name?\" He questions in a smooth calming voice,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"J-Jasperine.\" you stutter <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am Joshua, Joshua O'Connor.\" he responds. \"What reason would you give for me to choose you?\" Joshua inquires<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I don't really know, I'm no different than anyone else here.\" you answer<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes I know the reasons you think I should not choose you, but I feel in my heart that that is what makes you the right choice. There is something different about you from the others,\" he leans in close and whispers so you can barely hear it \"You are different because I choose you.\" he then presses his forehead against your snout and you feel his emotions flow in and mix with yours. It's the most wonderful feeling you've ever had and you couldn't possibly describe it to anyone should they ever ask. His emotions sweep in and blend with yours, they feel cold and determined, yet warm and loving at the same time. No rush of wind beneath you wings, nor excitement of hunting could ever compare to this feeling. You are now bonded with Joshua.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The same strange hooded man from before stands off at a distance watching these events unfold. Once it's over he turns and walks deeper into the woods. \"So now it begins, like so many other stories.\" he says \"I must continue to watch until it is absolutely necessary to interfere. Only then will I reveal myself.\" He then fades away into shadow once more.</span></div></div>",

You hated them, those nightmares that assaulted you almost every night; a night with no dreams was one of the most blissful things in life... but anyway, what were the nightmares about? You cracked your head every morning, trying to remember, nut nothing came to mind, you just wake up your heart pounding, sweating, sometimes screaming... Normal people don't fear about sleeping, but to you, it's torture.<br>\r\nOpening the window you look outside; a gray sky awaited, probably a storm, usual in that region; you just can't remember the last time you had a sunny day; not that you miss them, gray skies are at the very least calming. Your stomach began protesting and you remembered you haven't eaten since midday of yesterday, so you head to the kitchen. That was one of the days you wished you had parents... or siblings... or anything... at least someone to cook for you since you were so tired. No family, no nothing, the closest thing to that had been an old man, but even your memories of him were poor. He took care of you since you can remember; his name was a real mystery, he never told you, all he asked was to call him dad, even though he told you himself he wasn't your real father. When yous asked him about how you ended with him he just changed the subject so anything about your real family was in darkness. He raised you, and even though it wasn't the usual for a girl he taught you to hunt, to fight with a sword, to aim perfectly with a bow; in that matters he was very strict and you developed quite awesome abilities for your young age. He just vanished one day; when you woke up he wasn't there anymore. You were 11 at that time, too young but still you had to care for yourself. Maybe that was why you didn't relate to much of the kids of the village, you had to grow up alone and fast, they just had to play.<br>\r\nDistractedly you took an apple, no motivation for cooking, and sat absently in a wooden chair. That's when your eyes caught a glimpse of a letter that had been passed under your door. That was odd to say the least; you knew the villagers, but none of them could be called your friends and surely none of them would send you a letter, unless they were going to complain about something, but since they barely saw you, you just couldn't get what could be inside.<br>\r\nThere was only a single line written: Meet me at Kahil's Peak when the sun sets.<br>\r\nYou turn the sheet, looking for something else, like a signature, but that was it. Many thoughts filled your mind: who sent this? was this some kind of joke? But who would play a joke on someone you don't ever see? What if they had the wrong address and someone else is waiting for this? What could be waiting At Kahil's Peak?<br>\r\nIt was a long journey to the meeting point, so if you meant to go you had to leave now...</span></div></div>",

You stripped of your nightgown and put on your traveling clothes: dark leather pants, a black cotton sleeveless shirt and a black cloak, never too careful about being seen, not with the actual state of the kingdom... you also wear boots and fingerless gloves; in your waist you hang your sword, bow and arrows on your back. The world had become too dangerous to go unarmed.<br>\r\nYou leave the village as stealthy as possible; you lived with these people, but these were hard times and resources were scarce, no need of having people taken advantage of your leave and raiding your house. When was the last time the king had sent a messenger to the village? There were many complaints about how little he cared of the dire situation you were living, but you just couldn't blame him, if he was still alive. You see, with so many loses after the war with the dragons humans had feeble. The small kingdoms that remained have difficult times surviving the attack from other creatures that now occupied the former cities, creatures that were thrown of their living habitats while the golden age of humanity persisted. But that was a long time ago, now you were in the lowest levels of the food chain... You sometimes wondered why hadn't your little village had been destroyed, but then a few houses can pass unnoticed...<br>\r\nFinding someone in the woods was rare. People usually didn't venture outside the village, unless they were going in groups. Stories went about wild creatures that could separate a human in half with no effort, of people that were impaled with no resistance to offer...  You knew what lurked in there, and the truth wasn't that far from those stories. Still you have gone to Kahil's Peak many times with no real threats: don't make a sound and you'll get out of there alive. The few times you had encountered enemies you were skilled enough to kill them before they could do any harm. You were grateful with the old man for that... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In this interactive story your character is one of the last humans in the fictional land of Karn. After years of war with the dragon race, humans neared extinction. Then one of the last humans, a magician, made a truce with dragon-kind. The remaining few humans are the offspring of the magician, thus all have magic. The humans truce makes it so humans can form a magical bond with one dragon, when bonded, the pair can no longer die of old age and their magical ablilities out do any un-bonded pair. You can choose to be a male character named Joshua, or a female named Irene. This story takes place 1000 years after the Dragon-human war but for the past few years an evil dragon named Krixos has made his own kingdom separate of the kingdom of Karn and declared war on the remaining humans. The humans supposedly were wiped out but really were hidden by the kingdom of Karn. The humans have been kept secret from all but the king to avoid open war with the rebels. Should the humans be discovered the rebels would declare war on the kingdom itself. So our kind has been thought of as gone from the world, until now. One human (you) have been selected to choose a dragon and help put down this rebellion for good . Absolutely NO sexual content is permitted, and try to keep the point of view second person. No killing off the main characters too soon in the story. Dragons do not eat humans (however some may swallow them whole as a joke then get them out WITHOUT digesting them) So soft vore is allowed from time to time and try to avoid too much scat description and other gross body waste from the dragons (this may seem weird but I'm just being specific about what is not wanted in this story) Virtually no swearing is allowed (at least keep it pg 13) any pages containing the \"F bomb\" or \"S bomb\" will be deleted with no exceptions. Any pages breaking any of these rules will be deleted. Feel free to name your dragon whatever you want, but no changing names once they're selected (to avoid confusion) and the dragon can be male or female NO SEX CHANGES ALLOWED basically pick a gender for your dragon and keep it that way. Dragons are also INTELLIGENT and can SPEAK they are by no means beasts. Other than that have fun and enjoy.</td>",
