The crisp autumn breeze, the sound of small pokemon gleefully play fighting... it is quite lovely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trainer had left you here for a while to play with the other pokemon. The reason was unknown to you, since you were fully evolved and clearly not interested in the rambunctious antics of the younger pokemon. <br>\r\nYou look over at a fennikin being scooped up by its trainer and placed in a small navy green Jeep. Letting out a loud huff, you grumble to yourself as your jealous mind longed to go home as well. <br>\r\nDeciding to make the best of the situation, you peer around at the other pokemon. <br>\r\nA poochyena and an electrike wrestle around in the grass, growling and barking and they play. There were plenty of other pokemon: a few nickits, a glameow, a ton of yampers, and one rather large breloom. How fascinating...<br>\r\nYou ponder a bit on what to do, clearly curious about the other fully evolved pokemon.</span></div></div>",

You wave to the breloom, which was happily rolling around in the grass. Seems that won\u2019t get his attention... You call out the cry of your species, testing if sound would get him to notice you. As you let out a raspy cry, the breloom perks up his head and stands on his hind legs. Swiveling his head this way and that, the mushroom-like creature eventually spots you. Looking straight into his dark eyes, you let out a small gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up may cause it to charge.. and who knows what may happen to you if you attempted that... Certainly, you\u2019d be pounded to DUST. </span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t want to know what he\u2019s thinking, but it becomes clear when you see something you were definitely not expecting. The Breloom trots toward you, keeping his head low as he begins to circle you. The seed pods in his tail rattle each time the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s foot hits the ground, letting you know he\u2019s ready to fight. His warm breath washes over your fur as he stares at you, way too close for comfort.</span></div></div>",

You back away from him slowly, lowering yourself in submission to avoid any aggression from the slightly larger pokemon.
