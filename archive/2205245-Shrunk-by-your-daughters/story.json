While your wife was out on a business trip you're daughters decided to play a \"game\" with you called \"let's shrink Daddy till Mommy gets back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam age 39 (you)<br>\r\nYou married your witch girlfriend after getting her pregnant back when you both were naive to the difficulties of parenting.  <br>\r\n A good thing about having a witch as a wife is that she can manipulate your physical age to make you look younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith age 36 (your wife)<br>\r\nShe's a gentle caring person who fell in love with you at first sight.  It's thanks to her being around that you weren't at the mercy of your daughters as any spell they placed on you she would instantly dispell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly age 12 (Your 1st daughter)<br>\r\nShe has a fiery outgoing personality.  She loves her tricks and pranking her friends when they least expect it.  Though she may seem out of control at times she never does anything dangerous or something that would upset someone as she also has a caring side like her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby age 8 (your second daughter)<br>\r\nLike her older sister, she loves playing tricks on people but her tricks can't really be classed as \"pranks\" as she does them without really thinking about the consequences of her actions and often ends up going too far, though luckily no one has been hurt, she doesn't intentionally cause problems for people, she just doesn't really think about what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEbony age 4 (your youngest daughter)<br>\r\nWhile she does love a good prank, She's definitely the most aware of her sisters.  She's a lot like her mother and most of the time it's her who fixes her sisters' pranks.  If she thinks her sisters are going to far then she'll probably step in to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE:<br>\r\nThe focus of this story is Sam's daughters.<br>\r\nMay include unbirth, vore(non-fatal), diaper stuff and shapeshifting as long as the girls retain some human semblance.</td>",
