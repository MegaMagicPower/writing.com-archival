As well as a, black leather jacket, and blue jeans. He had cowboy boots on his feet, and fingerless gloves on his hands, and the blackest shades ever. He was holding a white biker helmet with a red visor, and had a large black Harley, with a skeleton exterior and white flames. 'That's awful, Ricky will hate to hear this', major said as they walked up to the two. 'Hate to hear what major?', Ricky said. 'At 4AM, Obi Aukmun, was found cut to death in a parking garage, the autopsy also showed signs of strangulation, time of death placed at 3:15 AM. I'm sorry Ricky but, your cousin is dead', the strange man explained. 'Oh my god, obi I don't believe this, wait who are you?', rick demands to the stranger. Then all of a sudden another man approaches them,' thanks for watching my bike kid', the new stranger says. 'No prob', the first stranger says as the second motors off. 'Now Ricky to answer your question of, who I am. I believe this may settle things.' The stranger pulled out a set of keys and pushed a button as a sound was heard. Rick and Tanis turned around and saw a familiar looking car: a white Cadillac. 'Brevin!', they said in unision hugging his legs. 'Well I should put some of this in my car', Brevin said, taking off the gloves, shades, cap and bandana. He then put on a regular pair of glasses. 'Let's go inside, I'm getting hungry', major said as the other three followed him inside. 'I'm getting a quick drink before, I get breakfast', Brevin said walking to the bar. 'Its good to see that party animal again', Ricky said to Tanis who nodded. 'Come on it sounds like the others are fighting', major said cautiousley. They luckily got there after it stopped but sartana had stormed off, mumbling about the bar. Ricky broke the news that obi was dead, everyone gave sad faces to him and offered condolences. 'Well I say we should get going', major said,'I'll get the problem from the bar',major finished walking off. When major got to the bar, Brevin and sartana were drinking large beverages, Brevin had a bloody Mary. And sartana had a large beer mug, they where both pretty wasted. 'That's more then a drink Brevin', Major said. Brevin fell out of his seat, into majors awaiting arms. Sartana was able to stand up on his own. As they made their way out of the bar, Brevin mumbled about his car, major was worried Brevin was incapable of driving. 'Isn't that Brevin?', major heard a voice say. 'Yeah I think it is', another voice said. Suddenley the girls were grabbing Brevin from major and helping him to his car, while Sibella fished out his keys from his pocket. The girls then gentley as they could, helped Brevin into his cars front passenger side seat. Major told Sibella she should drive Brevins car, which she took up happily, but spade pointed out the car could fit 3 other people. Tittus said he could go with Tanis and Ricky. But sartana said he and alucard and spider should go.<br>\r\nNow who goes</span></div></div>",

It said, 'couples sing-off; 1:30', that's in 45 minutes. Major thought this contest might be cool. Pulling in, Sibella followed suit.<br>\r\n \"What's up, major? Why did we pull in here?\", spider asked. \"I wanna see the contest\", major replied. As they walked in, major noticed a sign-up table right inside the entrance. \"Hello and welcome, we have 2 slots left for entry\", an attendant said. \"There was one, but one couple, got food poisoning and dropped out\", the other said. Sibella and spider, decided to sign up and put their names down. \"Anyone else, then?\", the attendants looked the group.<br>\r\n\"Hey Elsa, why don't you and Brevin sing together?\", Winnie said. Elsa and Brevin looked each other, they aren't dating anymore, but singing won't hurt nothing. They put they're names on the sign-up sheet, as they sing well together. \"Great, and still 40 minutes, before we start\", the first attendant said.<br>\r\nSoon after, the manager walked onto the stage to announce the rules of the contest. \"We have 16 couples, after the first round 8 will be eliminated. After that, 4 couples. Then two of those four will be eliminated, then we have the final two. Between each round is a 15 minute time, for couples to choose their songs. First round is in 20 minutes\", he said before getting off the stage.<br>\r\nThe contest was harsh, but Sibella, spider, Brevin, and Elsa barely broke a sweat the first two rounds. Major and the others watched the final four, with great interest. As the audience waited for the final two, to be chosen the bands, and the girls talked and joked around. Brevin said he needed to make a quick phone call, and he went to take a piss after that. The manager walked onto the stage again, And said its time to announce the final two.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Winnie struggled to sleep, she didn't get there until everyone else on the roof had. When she finally did fall asleep, she felt a familiar sensation of waking up in a dream. When her vision cleared she saw a big bright stage and a waving banner that read, \"community musicians competition.\" Winnie looked at a digital sign that had the words:Final Four, written on it, it said silver bullet, Major Allen, and Flightless Shadows. But the fourth slot was still blank. Then a loud voice out of nowhere said, \" alright now we have one more act this round before the 4th is chosen. Ladies and gentlemen, The Phantax Stallions!\" \"Who?\", Winnie thought when a big fire erupted on the stage as people stared but did not run. Four figures arose on the stage, one was the devil who approached the drums and sat down, then the grim reaper appeared and approached the microphone with a guitar, that was red with the word, \"Scythe\", printed in gold lettering. Then two shadowy figures, onefemale, one male appeared on the stage. The female pulled a, bass guitar. While the male pulled out a fiddle. Then, death spoke, \" hello this round were gonna play a song called, \" message of the destiny board\", its a goodass song so, we hope you like it. Kick us of Satan\", the devil then started a drumbeat cause the stage lights to turn red, as death started to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Its the usual Friday night the same thing happens every time <br>\r\nat times like this I say we try something different, then my best<br>\r\nbros from the hoarde came here another time more but then I <br>\r\nsaw my bestest bro brought with him an awesome ouja board<br>\r\nand then he said guys let's change things up and thank the lord <br>\r\nwe all screamed hell yeah! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd we screamed to the skies ouja, ouja, ouja, OUJA!<br>\r\nOh yeah! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got it out on the floor, busted out chips and beer and more<br>\r\nthen we all placed our hands on the eye that's when the fireplace<br>\r\nBurst! Demons demons every where filling up my vision space and<br>\r\nThat's when I got the first scare, that's when the demons started singing<br>\r\nof all the trouble on ourselves were bringing, that's when I screamed go to hell<br>\r\nand they said already been oh well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd we screamed to the skies ouja, ouja, ouja, OUJA!<br>\r\nOh yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the the demons all went back to the board and we got what<br>\r\nwe where waiting for, the eye slid out and spelled in a style so sleek, Rock on<br>\r\nmotherfucker see you next week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild when they finished, then Phantax Stallions appeared in the fourth slot just as the shadowy male became a visible figure, as he walked off the stage towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opened eye Winnie looked at the boys all sleeping then she smiled at how loudley they all snored. But she could not shake a felling the fiddler from her dream was someone she met before. She decided to shrug it off and turned to the moon when she saw a familiar sight...... the fiddler from her dream was standing next to her, winnie pinched herself as hard as she could hoping it was a dream, no luck the fiddler was still there, looking just as he did in her dream. Big thick black boots, red jeans torn and faded, a thick black belt with an angelwing buckle, a black shirt, and brown leather jacket. Plus he wore a gas mask, and round shades with dark blue lenses that hid his eyes. He also had a large black baseball cap hiding his hair. But what scared Winnie the most where the chains that where wrapped on his arms, one chain held a bible close to his hand dangling on the wrist. The other wrist had nothing on it, but the hand was holding his fiddle case, and over his shoulder was a large Wooden cross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello are you gonna say something Winnie?\", the strange fiddler asked, that he knew her name shocked her to the core. \"Oh s-s-sorry\" Winnie stuttered, \"but I just saw you in a dream, but I don't think we've met.\" The fiddler started laughing, \" sorry its been a while I'm sure, I'm Brevin, I'm a friend of the bands remember? I'm grimwoods grounds keeper?\" Winnie was concerned, \"Oh yeah prove it take that stuff of your head\", Winnie said. The fiddler took the hat off first revealing, short brown hair, then the gas mask, which revealed a good chunk of face, then lastley when the shades came off Winnie was convinced. \"Awesome it is you, but what's with the get-up?\" \"Oh sorry costume party, saw the bands car outside on my way home. Don't worry I'll go change real quick.\" He left, five minutes later he returned, no chains, cowboy hat, cross, shades or bible,\" I put everything back in my car except the cross, I put that in the trash, in pieces, for obvious reasons almost didn't find my real glasses either. They was in the glove compartment, though. Also I left my fiddle here because I thought you might wanna hear some music.\" \"Sure\", Winnie said. Brevin played some soothing music eventually, Winnie fell asleep again, then brevin climbed down again, put his fiddle back in his car, then hid his car then climbed back up the ladder and laid next to Winnie as he was very  tired. Winnie smiled, with her eyes still closed she moved right next to him and held onto him as he was shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie and William, weren't cold for obvious reasons, and shaggy had the doos, so Winnie decided she would keep him warm. He was like the sweet, mature, fun brother she always wanted, after all willy never let her touch his stuff.</span></div></div>",

She went over some of last nights events, starting with the foot prints. Some questions having more to do with Brevin and her dream came up, she decided to ask brevin these questions as he is always most often up by now. When she turned to him, she was somewhat surprised to see him gone. Then she heard a slight grunting and turned to the ladder, a little more surprised. Brevin was climbing the ladder wearing the outfit from last night again. But then Winnie remembered he said he broke the cross. A second look helped see, this was a different cross, instead of pine and leather, this cross was mahogany and brass. \"What's wrong, Winnie?\", Brevin asked. \"Oh, it's nothing, I just have a few questions\", Winnie replied. \"OK, ask me\", Brevin said.<br>\r\n \"Question one, who are the, 'Phantax Stallions'?\" \"Oh that's MY band, we formed last month, so were pretty new.\" \"Question two, how did you get into my dream?\" \"A little trick that Death taught me.\" \"Wait, so Satan and death are really in your band?\" \"Yep.\" \"Woah, what was with that song you were playing?\" \"Its a song I wrote, \"message of the destiny board\", were gonna play it at our first concert later tonight.\" \"No way your first concert is tonight?\" \"Hell yeah, girl.\" \"OK, last question: who is that female bass player in your band?\" \"Oh that's Sonya Windsley, my ex girlfriend, we finally settled our problems,so now we are good friends. I was pretty surprised when she wanted to join the band, but no arguing she is good. She somehow finds time to fit between the band, and her other \"job\".\" \"Yeah I remember that job, anyway thanks for answering my questions Brevin\", Winnie said. \"No problem Winnie, anytime\", Brevin said. They both turned to shaggys watch seeing it said, 7:13 am. Brevin climbed down the ladder, after 7 minutes, he returned with an acoustic guitar on his back instead of his cross. The cross!! \"Brevin wait I have one more question, you said you broke the cross into pieces last night, but yet you had a bigger one a few minutes ago, what's the difference of the two?\" \"Oh the one from last night was just for the costume party, the bigger one is part of this outfit that I really wear as a member of my band.\" \"OK\", Winnie said. \"Music?\", Brevin asked. \"Sure\", Winnie said. Brevin started playing a song Winnie recognized, \"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high...\". Then Winnie noticed something she could hear a couple people in the house starting to get out of bed, that and William was starting to wake up. Brevin seemed to also notice this as he stopped playing the song, and played, \"stairway to heaven instead, though Winnie doubted that would help. \"Hey who are you?!?\", a loud voice demanded, Winnie turned to see William in all his savage glory. Brevin stopped playing, stood up and simply bowed to William. \"THAT DOES NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION: WHO ARE YO-\", \"Revin!\", (Brevin) a voice said, interrupting William. Suddenley Scooby doo dashed forward, knocking Brevin, down and licking him. \"Count yourself lucky scoob remembers you\", a voice said, they turned to see scrappy, and shaggy wide awake. \"Ah, greetings Mr. Rogers, long time no see\", Brevin said. Winnie then told William who Brevin was. \"Oh my apologies sir\", William said. Brevin took off his shades, hat and mask and set them aside for later. \"You guys wanna come to my bands concert tonight I have some tickets, there's 22 people if I include: MA, FS, the ghouls, and mystery inc. Yeah that's 22 people but I have 24 extra tickets on me, I guess Lennie and Mr canette can come too\", Brevin said. \"We would be honored to come to your concert\", William said, taking the tickets and placing them in a satchel he was holding. Shaggy checked his watch, 7:40 am. \"Breakfast will be ready in about 30 minutes!\", shouted Mr canette from downstairs. Brevin picked up his guitar again.<br>\r\n\"I'll play a few tunes before you guys go down for breakfast\", he said. \"Why not come down with us? The others will be happy to see you, even if some you don't know\", William said, \"he's right\", scrappy added. Brevin climbed down the ladder, careful to not be seen, and approached his car. When he put his guitar back, he climbed back up the ladder, and put his headgear back on his head. \"All right I guess I can join you guys\" he said as the group cheered. \"Hey guys! Mr canette said I should tell you, breakfast is ready!\", came sibellas voice from the porch. \"Well be down in a moment, sibella\", William called</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Brevin told the group a fast way to get down from the roof, the only one who didn't trust it was, Scooby-doo. 'Let's go', scrappy said from atop shaggys shoulders. Shaggy climbed down with scrappy, William then jumped down while Scooby was screaming in his arms. 'Ready?', Brevin asked winnie, who he had perched on his back. 'Ready', Winnie confirmed with a cocky smile. Brevin stood at the corner of the roof, then he kicked his feet out from under him self and use a hand to grab the corner then jumped from the wall to the ground. 'Hey it worked', Brevin said sounding surprised. They joined William, who was standing with Sibella at the front door, shaggy and the doos must have gone inside. 'Wonderful to see you again, Sibella', Brevin said. 'Ah Brevin, fang-tastic to see you again', Sibella said smiling, and exposing her fangs. They walked inside, and as Brevin figured those who did not know him gave him cold stares, and since he covered his face, his friends gave him similar stares. The only ones who gave him comforting stares were, Winnie, Sibella, William, shaggy, Scooby, and scrappy. But there was one stare different from the rest, a blonde man Brevin did not recognize, wearing an ascot and blue jeans. The stranger walked up to Brevin, 'Freddy be careful!', a read headed girl said. 'I've seen you before', the blonde man said to Brevin. 'Yeah, I've seen you on the posters and on TV', he continued. 'And you are?', Brevin asked him. 'Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm Fred Jones, but you can call me Freddy. Everyone does', Freddy said. 'Freddy, who is this guy', a red head and a brunette with g,asses asked him simultaneously. 'This guy, he is the fiddler for, the phantax stallions band', Freddy said. 'The who?', the red head asked. 'No, the phantax stallions', Brevin said, everyone laughed. Freddy quickly introduced Brevin to everyone in the room, even those he already knew, so that he knew who they were. 'Mr Jones, I know most of these people', Brevin said. 'You do?', Freddy asked. Brevin took off his headgear, 'yes I do', he said. Most of the cold stare softened into smiles, but some still seemed confused. 'I guess I have to explain', Major said. After a fifteen minute, and extremely detailed explanation, and many questions, everyone knew who Brevin was. After breakfast was over, major told Brevin about the tour, and the mystery of obi's death and his ghost. When the explanation started, Brevin seemed quaint and relaxed, but as it progressed, he at one point raised a single eyebrow in confusion. Then he began shifting in his chair, looking worried, then he seemed irritated, but when it was over he was still and silent. He seemed to be studying major with an almost scientific curiosity. He stood up, said he would be right back and walked out the door. 5 minutes later, he returned with a white book, a small wood box, and a large liquor bottle. 'What's in, the box?', Mr. canette asked. 'Matches, lighters, cigarettes, and cigars', Brevin said. 'Cool, can I get a smoke?', Mr canette asked. 'Sure, but there's an 8-digit combination lock. Lets see...0....9....0...1...1...9....3....9, *click* bingo!', Brevin said pulling out two cigars and a couple matches. He handed one to Mr c, and they both lit up. 'That combination sounds like a date', daphne said. 'Yeah, september 1st 1939, the german invasion of poland , its easy to remember', brevin said. Brevin then opened the book, scrolling through phone numbers, and muttering to himself. 'OK I think this is the phone number I need. Now Major you said something about a rare bullet?', Brevin asked as Major handed it to him. 'Mr c, can I use your phone?', Brevin asked. 'Sure', Mr c said. When Brevin left the room, Velma picked up the large book. 'This is strange', she said looking through the book. 'Yeah check out the freak writing on the front', spade said. 'Its in Latin, which is weird on its own, but what's got me are these phone numbers.' 'Well what's wrong with them?', Steve's brother asked while watching coffee brew, one pot decaf, the other one regular. 'Well listen, there are phone numbers from all around the globe', Velma said. 'Are there names?', Fred asked. 'Of course, but clearly none of them are their real names. Listen to some, pool shark, myst, grease monkey, magnum. Each name has a symbol next to it, one of three. A gear, a woman's eye, and a set of animal teeth', Velma said. 'What number did Brevin call, do you know?', phanty asked. 'Yeah, its easy. The numbers are organized by country, and Brevin picked a close by american number. There's a gear next to the name', Velma stated. 'What's the name', Winnie asked. 'It says the name is, strike-down', Velma said. 'Hey I just translated the writing on the front of the book', sartana said. 'What is it?', Sibella asked. 'Pyramid master contact codex', sartana stated. Velma put the book down as Brevin walked back into the room. Brevin looked at the book, and frowned in a confused way. 'OK I'm asking, who touched the codex? I positioned it so, one corner angled towards the box, and the opposite corner was angled at the liquor bottle. Now its straight, so who snooped?' Everyone immediately pointed at Velma. 'OK then, well I tracked your bullet to a special manufacturer in San Fransisco. The serial number tracked the purchase to a military sniper named, Isaac walls. I also found camera footage of the place obi was killed. He was cut up by the same guy, Isaac who has been mia for 2 weeks. You guys are dealing with an AWOL soldier', Brevin said. Everyone in the room exchanged nervous glances, 'is that all?', Ricky asked. 'Strike-down couldn't find anything else, now I have to go, help yourselves to the liquor', Brevin said. 'Wait where are you going?', Major asked. Brevin told them the first concert was tonight, preparations had to be made. Like sound checks, lighting, he had promised Sonya he would take her to get her hair done, they had to tune instruments, lastley they had to prepare the green room for executives and such. 'Wait , Sonya like Sonya windsley, the phantax stallions bass player?', Fred asked. 'Impressive Mr Jones, you seem to know almost, too much', Brevin said. 'I have the tickets that Brevin gave me 24 of em', William said as everyone cheered. 'See you all tonight then', Brevin said leaving.</span></div></div>",
