You\u2019ve been a bit off lately?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine Robin.\u201d At her leaders knowing look, the dark titan decides to explain. \u201csigh alright fine, I\u2019m just feeling a bit of wanderlust that\u2019s all. I guess part of me wants to see what\u2019s out there, but I also don\u2019t want to let down the team by leaving.\u201d \u201cI think I understand.\u201d Robin say\u2019s. \u201cyour entire life you had the prophecy hanging over your head, and just when it wasn\u2019t anymore we had that whole mess with the brotherhood, it\u2019s only fair that you get to see the world, you know without some doomsday plot hanging over your head that is.\u201d <br>\r\nRaven was stunned. \u201cYou weren\u2019t this understanding when Cyborg left for Titans East?\u201d The boy wonder just shrugged. \u201cMy issue with Cyborg wasn\u2019t so much about him leaving as it was about him making the decision without consulting with the rest of us.\u201d Laying a hand on Ravens shoulder Robin gives her a genuine smile. \u201cif you just talk to the team first I am sure we can figure something out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i>As Robin predicted the other Titan\u2019s where pretty understanding about Raven\u2019s desire to travel the world.<br>\r\nArrangement\u2019s where made and aside from a few bruised ribs curtesy of Starfire\u2019s patented goodbye hug  and a few thousand requests for souvenirs from Beast Boy, Raven was soon on her way, which led to her current predicament.<br>\r\nThe idea of Pok\u00e9mon had fascinated her, that differences in the worlds concentration of natural energies could have such a massive impact on evolution was astonishing.<br>\r\nThe differences between the lands where Pok\u00e9mon flourished and where regular animals lived was so drastic it was almost as if she hopped dimensions instead of continents.<br>\r\nRaven thinks it\u2019s a good thing she put the effort into earning that provisional trainer license, all that studying certainly prepared her for operating in these regions\u2026. If she could figure out where she was at least.<br>\r\nSuddenly Raven hears a cry for help, turning towards the noise she sees a black clad figure taking a briefcase from what looks like a professors aide and rushing of. As Raven rushes past the aide she hears him mumble. \u201cNo the new starters.\u201d \u201cCall the cops.\u201d She calls out in passing.<br>\r\nChasing the thief down several alley\u2019s Raven thinks this would have been a lot easier with her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDude since when are you a twin?\u201d Rolling her eyes at Beast Boy\u2019s antics Raven say\u2019s. \u201cThis is a magical golem I created to help you while I am of traveling, not my twin.\u201d A look of understanding enters Starfire\u2019s eye\u2019s as she responds. \u201cthen friend Raven this is like the robotic double Cyborg created for when he infiltrated the evil HIVE.\u201d \u201cNot exactly Starfire, my duplicate will possess all of my memories and abilities along with the bulk of my power, so she will be able to fight and act exactly like me.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit dangerous?\u201d a thoughtful Robin comments, followed by Cyborg. \u201cYea girl, what if Raven2 decides she likes being you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou act as if she isn\u2019t me.\u201d As this response brings her friends up short Raven continues. \u201cRaven2 as you so elegantly called her is no mere clone, she is a part of me, when I return from my journey the two of us will merge back together and become one again, so there\u2019s no reason for her to even consider betraying me.\u201d \u201cI see you thought this trough, but what about you?\u201d Robin speaks up. \u201cYou said you gave her the bulk of your power, don\u2019t you want to keep some for yourself, for emergencies and such?\u201d \u201cI understand your concern Robin, but I believe my powers are best served here.\u201d Raven responds. \u201cThe Pok\u00e9mon regions don\u2019t have supervillains like we have here, and with all that training you put us trough I am confident in my ability to handle any regular thugs I might encounter.\u201d Shaking her head a bit at the turn the conversation has taken Raven looks reassuringly at each of her friends. \u201cit\u2019s not like I will be looking for trouble, I will be fine you guy\u2019s, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m going to get an earful from the guys for his I just know it, but I guess once a hero.\u2019<br>\r\nRaven almost loses sight of the thief as the chase leads to a crowded train station, seeing a flash of black enter a train that\u2019s about to leave the young goth quickly follows before the doors close.<br>\r\nNow trapped in the coupe Raven gets her first good look at the thief, Raven notices the thief is a woman but that\u2019s about all she can tell, hood, scarf and even a pair of sunglasses this girl obviously does not want to be recognized.<br>\r\n\u201cThat suitcase does not belong to you, I suggest you hand it over.\u201d The thief just scoffs and suddenly swings the suitcase towards Raven\u2019s head, reflexes honed by crime fighting allow Raven to catch the suitcase in mid-swing starting of a fierce tug-of-war between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Raven and the thief seem to be evenly matched when without warning the hinges of the suitcase give forcing both girls to take a step back and sending the case\u2019s contents flying.<br>\r\nLooking up Raven see\u2019s several poke-balls in the air, a quick glance shows her opponent has noticed too and is reaching to catch one, needing to act fast Raven reaches to catch the poke-ball closest to her idly noticing it has a _____symbol on it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
