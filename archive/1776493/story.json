In the distance was a strange castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" He wondered, for some reason unable to remember his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Exe.\"</i> came some voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exe, huh? Not bad. May as well check out that castle, it's the only thing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, he summoned a portal of darkness and stepped through it. On the other side Exe found himself in hallway that was completely white, with a door across from him. Curious, he entered the room beyond. The room was just like the Hallway, all white, but with a bed, a table and chairs, and a dresser with a mirror. In the mirror, Exe saw that his face was shrouded by a hood. Removing it, he saw that his hair was now gunmetal grey and his eyes were blood red. On the dresser were a book, possibly a diary and some kunai. Suddenly there was a faint noise from behind him. Quickly replacing his hood, Exe turned to see a portal like the one he had used open up. Out of it stepped a woman about his age, with blond hair with twin antennae-like extensions on the front and icy sapphire blue eyes. As soon as she saw him, her expression darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demyx, I thought I was clear when I told you to stay out of my room!\" she said, anger obvious in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Demyx, who's Demyx?\" </i>Exe wondered. \"Look, I don't know who this Demyx is, but you've got the wrong guy.\" he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, if you're not from the Organisation then who are you and how did you get here?\" she demanded, as three kunai appeared in each of her hands, crackling with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking off his hood, he replied,<br>\r\n\"Name's Exe, and I used the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a smart-ass, I meant how did you arrive in the castle.\" she asked, clearly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touchy one, aren't you? All right, if you must know, I was attacked by Heartless in Hollow Bastion and blacked out. When I came to, I found myself lying outside some castle looking like this, so I decided to check this place out. And so here we are.\" he replied, a small grin on his face. As he said this, she relaxed slightly, her knives disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not a Heartless, only Nobodies can get into Castle Oblivion without help. And the Superior didn't mention any new members. You've certainly got me interested.\" she replied, moving forward until she was almost in his face. \"And I have to say, you're not bad looking either. At least, you're not an ass like the rest of the guys here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, well, I've answered your questions, now I'll ask some of my own.

To answer your questions, my name is Larxene. I'm a Nobody just like you. I'm the twelfth member of Organisation XIII, which is using this castle for...experiments. So, interested in joining?\" she replied, a slight flicker of lonlieness in her otherwise unfeeling eyes. Exe put a hand to his chin as he pondered Larxene's offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, tempting, but no thanks. I wouldn't mind staying here with you though, if its not a problem.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can stay.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In short, Exe and Larxene's plan worked perfectly. Because he could control darkness, he could simply hide in the shadows whenever another Organisation member came near. As the days passed, Larxene told Exe more and more about the Organisation. It consisted of thirteen Nobodies, hence the name, with someone called Xemnas as its leader. The group was collecting hearts to try and obtain Kingdom Hearts, which they believed would give them hearts again and allow them to exist fully. They had managed to obtain something which would aid their plans. Some boy called Sora, who was the chosen weilder of the Keyblade, a mysterious weapon that released the hearts of any Heartless slain by it. However, Sora's memory was in pieces, so the groups plan was at a standstill whilst Sora's memories chained themselves back together. Larxene was apparently in charge of watching over Sora and the Nobody who was chaining his memories together, Namine. As time passed, Larxene and Exe noticed they were starting to have feelings for each other. Of course, these weren't real emotions, but they were there nevertheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Some time later, just before Larxene's defeat</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another day inside Castle Oblivion. Or night, Exe didn't know. One easily lost track of time with no windows around. He was sitting at the table when Larxene emerged from the bedroom, an angry look on her face. Exe was curious, Larxene didn't get angry unless something was really getting to her, like Demyx or Axel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" he asked. Larxene stopped and turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that Keyblade brat has woken up and is running all over the castle. He's already defeated two of the others, so it's my job to stop him.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, well, don't get yourself killed. Otherwise I'd have go after him in revenge for taking my Savage Nymph away.\" he replied, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what I like about you. You don't screw around, like some people I know. Don't worry, Sora shouldn't be to tough a fight.\" she replied, as she teleported out of the room, leaving Exe by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>A short time later...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's taking Larxene so long? Surely the kid couldn't be that tough...could he?\"</i> Exe wondered. If Larxene had been right, she should have been back already. \"Might as well go see what's keeping her.\" he announced, as he stood up, replacing his hood, and opened a portal to wherever Larxene was. As Exe stepped out, he couldn't believe his eyes. He was standing behind some kid holding a large key. <i>\"Must be Sora.\"</i> he thought. Next to Sora stood a duck wearing blue clothes and holding a wand, and dog-like figure dressed in green clothes and holding a shield. Not for away, Larxene was on one knee, streams of darkness flowing off her body. Her face held an expression of pain and, stangely, regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No! I refuse to lose to such a bunch of losers!\" shouted Larxene. Exe immediately rushed over to her, startling Sora and the other two. Exe knelt beside Larxene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larxene?\" he asked, feigning concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exe? I think I'm...I'm fading away.\" she told him, as the darkness streamed away increasingly. She looked up at him again. \"Let's meet again...in the next life. I'll be waiting.\" as she said that, she faded completely, leaving behind no trace. Exe rose slowly, his back to Sora, his fists clenched. Exe whirled around to face Sora and his companions, who immediately redied their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" demended Sora, looking slightly nervous. Exe unclenched his fists, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha!! You want to know who I am?! I'm your worst nightmare!!\" Exe yelled, as darkness gathered each of his hands, to form a black-bladed sword in each (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fav.me/d38mjdp\" target=\"_blank\">http://fav.me/d38mjdp</a>). \"And now, it's time for you face the power...of darkness! Shadow Strike!!\" As he said this, Exe's shadow turned pitch black, before forming into many ribbons of darkness, which swept towards Sora and the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, this guy means business! Reflect!\" cried Sora, pointing the Keyblade, forward. A transparent shield formed at the tip, which the shadows repeatedly struck at, until they broke through. Sora and his companions didn't even have time to cry out, as the shadows hit them hundreds of times. Finally, the shadows dissappated, as the three fell to the ground. Exe slowly approached, his swords disappearing. He stopped in front of Sora, who looked up at him angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I don't see why you're so special. You're nothing to me.\" he said, turning away. A few steps from Sora, he stopped. \"I'll find you again someday, and then I'll show no mercy. I hope, for your sake, that you get stronger before then. I want a decent challenge. Until then, I'll be watching you, Sora.\" he announced, as he teleported away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since Xemnas' defeat and the subsequent destruction of The World That Never Was, the rebuilding of the city had made great progress. It now looked just like it had before Sora first arrived in it years before. The group were going to see Leon and the gang, to ask if they needed any help. Over time, Sora and Kairi had grown much closer. No one was surprised when the long time friends announced their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Sora, I think we're lost\" said Goofy. Sora sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just that everything looks so different now. Hey Kairi, any idea which way it is?\" he asked, turning to his girlfriend, who giggled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved all the worlds and yet you still have ask a girl for directions. Don't worry, it's this way.\" she replied, heading off down another street, leaving the others behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, wait up!\" Sora shouted, as he ran after her. After a few minutes, the group arrived near Merlin's house. Suddenly a voice called down to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys!\" They looked up to see Yuffie leap down from a ledge to land in front of them. \"Haven't seen you for a few days.\" she said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that. See, I've been showing Kairi around the worlds. Anyway, we came over to see if there was anything you guys needed help with.\" Sora told her. Yuffie tapped her chin, pondering his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I can't think of anything.\" she replied. \"Why don't you-\" she was cut off by the arrival of Leon and Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sora, what brings you here?\" Leon asked. Yuffie walked over and explained the situation. \"Right, thanks Yuffie. Sorry Sora, everything's fine right now. Hey, if you're showing Kairi around, why not go visit Tron? He hasn't seen you in ages.\" he suggested. Sora was about to reply, when a voice came out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. It sure took a while, but I found you, Sora.\" said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?! Show yourself!\" Sora shouted, looking for the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look's like you don't remember after all. That's a shame, I guess Namine didn't put all of your memories back, did she? I thought she was more skilled than that. Very well, as you wish.\" As the voice said this, Sora heard the familiar sound of a portal of darkness opening behind him. Turning around, they group stared in disbelief as a figure wearing a black hooded cloak stepped out (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110801173659/kingdomhearts/images/2/27/Cloak.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Organisation XIII!!\" exclaimed Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought we destroyed them all!\" shouted Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Well, it is true that Organisation XIII is no more, but I was never part of it. I work alone. As for who I am, well, there's one person here who should know that. Right, Sora?\" the figure asked, removing his hood, revealing dark grey hair and blood red eyes. Everyone immediately looked at Sora, who threw his arms up in defence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I seriously don't know who this guy is!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurt that you don't remember me, Sora. Perhaps this will refresh your memory!\" the figure shouted, raising his right arm, his hand open. \"Shadow Strike!!\" As he said this, ribbons of darkness streamed from his hand towards Sora and the others. Everyone instinctively dodged, as the shadows slammed into the ground where they had been a moment ago. Sora land, looking at the figure with realisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You again?!\" he shoutedc, in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, how do you know this guy?\" asked Kairi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened back when I was in Castle Oblivion, after I defeated Larxene. Some guy appeared and used the same attack!\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you finally remembered. Except, you left out the fact that, last time we met, that attack left you and your friends unable to move. It certainly looks like you've improved. Although, you have to have gotten stronger, otherwise you never would've beaten Xemnas. I should introduce myself properly. My name is Exe, the Blade of Darkness.\" announced Exe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Exe, what do you want?\" Leon demanded. Exe laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I want to see how you've improved, Sora.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Sora asked. Exe smirked, before snapping his fingers. His shadow turned black, before ribbons of darkness shot out, grabbing Kairi an pulling her over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling you'd refuse. So I thought I'd give you some...incentive.\" Exe replied, summoning one of his swords, placing the tip on Kairi's chest. \"Either fight me, or you can say goodbye to Kairi...permanently.\" Sora immediately shut up, the fear of losing Kairi again was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you win.\" Sora agreed, grudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Exe replied, before stabbing his blade into Kairi's chest, causing her to scream in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You said-\" Sora protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I wouldn't kill her. She's not dead...yet!\" Exe replied, grinning sadistically. He slowly twisted the sword, causing Kairi to scream even louder, tears streaming down her face. Exe looked over at Sora, who's expression was now one of immense angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from her!\" Sora yelled, summoning his Keyblade (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.wikia.com/kingdomhearts/images/3/30/Kingdom_Key_KH.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.wikia.com/kingdomhearts/im...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me!\" Exe retorted, sending dark lightning through his sword. Kairi's screams intensified, her body twitching, her eyes wide in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!!\" Sora yelled, dashing forward, the Keyblade slamming into Exe's other sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, Sora. Why so angry?\" Exe said sarcastically. With little effort, he threw Sora back, pulling his sword out of Kairi's chest, blood dripping from the tip. \"So, ready to die?\" Exe asked, licking the blood from his sword. Sora charged Exe, attacking the Nobody with a rapid series of attacks (Slapshot). Exe parried all of the blows, before throwing Sora into the air. Exe then sent every shadow in the area at Sora, hundreds of them striking the unprepared boy. Sora fell to the ground, the Keyblade landing a short distance away. Exe slowly approached Sora, who was struggling to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, pathetic. You haven't improved at all.\" Exe said, aiming his sword at Sora's chest. But before he could end Sora's life, Exe was forced to jump back to avoid Cloud's Fusion Sword (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/download/213127344/first_tsurugi_fusion_sword_by_wh1pla5h-d3iw240.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/download/21312...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off.\" Cloud said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Well, I didn't come here to kill him anyway.\" Exe said. Turning to Kairi, Exe stabbed his sword right through her chest, causing her body to go limp. In a flash of light, Kairi's body disappeared, leaving her heart floating in the air, which Exe grabbed. \"Now that I have what I came for, farewell.\" he said, disappearing through a portal of darkness. Sora slowly struggled his fett, tears falling from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kairi...\" he sobbed, before Yuffie hugged him warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sora. Let's go see Yen Sid. He might be able to help.\" she suggested. Sora looked up and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, let's go.\" he replied.</span></div></div>",

However, you must know that he poses a far greater threat than Organisatin XIII did.\" Yen Sid announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, tell us!\" exclaimed Sora. Yen Sid led them into his study and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, let us start with what you do know.\" he told them. \"As you are aware, if one is able to collect enough hearts, then he would be able to create an artificial Kingdom Hearts of slightly lesser power. However, if Exe is able to obtain the Kingdom Stone, then he would be able to open a gateway to Kingdom Hearts itself.\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of this Kingdom Stone before.\" Mickey told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Few have, I am one of those few. The Kingdom Stone is an object made from equal amounts of light and darkness. Long ago, it was split into four fragments, which were then sent to four different worlds. If Exe manages to find all four fragments, he would only need a single pure heart filled with light to open the gate.\" Yen Sid replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why he needed Kairi's heart. But, what does he want?\" Riku wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, I cannot answer. But, he must not succeed in his venture, for it will be far worse than if anyone else did.\" said Yen Sid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" they all asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, unlike all other Nobodies, Exe has two sides, light and darkness, which are of equal strength. Because of this, if he manages to reach Kingdom Hearts, the ultimate Keyblade would be forged.\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ultimate...Keyblade?\" they asked. Yen Sid nodded, then held his arm out, a transparent pillar of magic appeared, inside of it floated the image of a powerful looking Keyblade (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/171/e/7/x_keyblade___xblade__by_angeldad83-d3jfqpd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/1...</a>).

Leon in particular seemed to admire the town quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be small compared to Radient Garden, but it's not half bad.\" he commented. Sora, Donald, Goofy and Aerith nodded in agreement, while Tifa was too busy watching Cloud. After a short while, the group found Hayner and the others on Sunset Hill. The three friends turned around when Sora called out to them, smiling and walking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sora. You finally came back!\" Hayner commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Kairi?\" asked Olette, noticing Sora's depressed expression. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. Sora didn't want to talk about what happened to Kairi, so Donald and Goofy explained everything. Hayner, Pence and Olette were speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" cried Hayner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kairi's really-\" sobbed Olette, before she broke down crying, at which Hayner put his arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you guys need to find this fragment before Exe does, right?\" asked Pence. Sora nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Since you guys know the town so well, we thought you might be able to help.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we'll help! Remember, Kairi's our friend too!\" Hayner told them. Olette by now had stopped crying, though she was still visibly shocked. \"Hey, remember that computer of Ansem's we found in the mansion? Maybe it has something on this stone.\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone knew anything about the Kingdom Stone, it would have been Ansem the Wise.\" Mickey agreed. The group decided to head over to the old mansion. After they arrived, Hayner led the way down to Ansem's computer room. Pence immediately got to work, searching the memory for anything on the stone. Suddenly, Sora thought he saw a movement, but when he turned to look, all he saw was his own shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmm.\" </i>Sora thought, a little suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, got something.\" Pence announced, they all crowded around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here. 'Whilst creating my virtual Twilight Town, I noticed something odd. There was one small feature that couldn't be recreated as data, no matter what I tried. Something outside the station appears to not belong in this world, but for now it is of little importance'. That's all it says. he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so all we have to do is search outside the station, right?\" Hayner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way.\" Mickey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go already! Come on!\" cried Tifa, taking off, while the others chased after her.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Sora's Keyblade summoned itself, startling Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he wondered. Mickey saw this, and came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, maybe the Keyblade can tell us where this fragment is.\" he suggested. Sora nodded, then raised the Keyblade above his head. A beam of light radiated from the Keyblade, causing a statue next to the station entrance to pulse, before transforming into a glowing crystal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cravon.deviantart.com/art/Destiny-Crystal-150077646\" target=\"_blank\">http://cravon.deviantart.com/art/Destiny...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found it!\" Sora exclaimed. But before any of them could retrieve the Kingdom Stone fragment, one of the shadows near the fragment turned black, before reaching out and grabbing it. \"Huh?\" Sora said, as a portal of darkness opened, Exe emerging from it. He grabbed the fragment, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help, Sora. That Keyblade really is something isn't it?\" he asked, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know where it was?\" Leon demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I followed you, hiding in the shadows. It wasn't hard, seeing as I control darkness.\" Exe replied, smirking. Sora realised that he hadn't imagined it when he thought he saw the shadows moving in the computor room. \"Oh, by the way Sora, no hard feelings, right?\" he joked, laughing at Sora's obvious anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give Kairi's heart back!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, that would be a no. It's funny, you know. I can still hear her crying!\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! You won't be leaving here with anything!\" Cloud yelled, charging at Exe, Leon following. Cloud swung his Fusion Sword, which Exe blocked with his own blade. Cloud then jumped away, as Leon fired six shots from his Revolver gunblade. Exe smirked, deflecting the shots, as Cloud attacked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meteorain!\" Cloud shouted, as multiple meteors shot from his sword, crashing all around the Nobody. As the smoke cleared, it revealed Exe, protected by a barrier of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, not bad. Now it's my turn!\" he shouted. \"Dark Lightning!\" he shouted, black electricity streaming from the tips of his swords again. Leon and Cloud managed to block with their blades, but were forced back from the strength of the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can he be so strong?\" Leon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, even Sephiroth wasn't this tough.\" Cloud agreed. The lightning ceased, as Exe's blades disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's been fun, but I'll be going now.\" he told them, opening a portal of darkness, which disappeared after he stepped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, he got away.\" Leon cursed under his breath, putting Revolver away. \"So, now what'll we do?\" Sora was about to reply, when he suddenly heard a voice in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sora...\"</i> came Kairi's faint voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What the...Kairi?\"</i> Sora thought. \"Guys, I can hear Kairi's heart!\" he told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, if you can sense her heart, we can figure out where Exe is going, since he probably knows where the next fragment is, seeing as he's already got one.\" Goofy hypothisised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right. It feels like he's heading for...Radient Garden!\" Sora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got some nerve going back there. Let's get going!\" Leon shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Saro agreed, turning to Hayner, Pence and Olette. \"Thanks for the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, just make sure that guy pays for what he did to Kairi.\" Hayner replied.

When they got there, Merlin was already waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Sora. Right on time.\" Merlin said as they arrived. \"Yen Sid told me of what you're doing. I did notice this Nobody enter the city, but I lost him soon after he appeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably hiding in the shadows again.\" Riku said. Sora nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we might as well start looking. I'll see if Kairi's heart is nearby.\" he decided. Closing his eyes, Sora tried to listen for Kairi's heart. After a while, he heard a faint sound from her heart, heading for The Great Maw. \"Looks like he's heading for The Great Maw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense to hide something as powerful as the Kingdom Stone fragment in a place as remote as that. Let's go.\" Leon announced, turning around. Sora and the others agreed, as the group hurried off.

Suddenly, a scream from Aerith caused everyone to turn around, only to find Exe had grabbed Aerith with his shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so predictable.\" Exe said, smirking. Cloud bristled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone.\" he demanded, putting a hand on his sword. Exe just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of grabbing her anyway?\" he asked, laughing. \"If you want her back, meet me at the Dark Depths. In the meantime...\" he said, snapping his fingers, causing a large number of Heartless to appear. \"These should keep you occupied.\" Exe told them, disappearing through a portal of darkness with Aerith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerith!\" Cloud yelled, before he was forced to block an attack from five Armoured Knight heartless. A songle swing destroyed, them, as the group continued to eliminate the Heartless. After a few minutes, all the Heartless had been wiped out. The group hurried to the Dark Depths, unaware that the same figure from before was tailing them, along the top of the ravine walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Radient Garden, the Dark Depths</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group arrived at the Dark Depths, overlooking Malificent's castle, where Exe was waiting for them, Aerith next to him, bound by strands of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, Sora. I knew those Heartless would be easy for you.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk, let Aerith go!\" Cloud demanded, at which Exe laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not yet. First, you need to do something for me.\" Exe replied, turning his gaze on Sora. \"You see, the Kingdom Stone fragment is somewhere aroubd here, but sadly only the Keyblade can make it reveal itself. So, its your choice Sora. Either use that key, or I do to Aerith what I did to Kairi.\" he threatened, his blade touching Aerith's chest. Aerith began crying quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'd never-\" Sora started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three...\" Exe said, cutting him off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do I do?\"</i> Sora thought, desparately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't let Aerith die!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you win.\" Sora replied, defeated. Exe smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now was that so hard? Go on, do it.\" he demanded. Sora brought out his Keyblade, like he had back in Twilight Town. A beam of light shot from the Keyblade's tip, causing a pulsating sphere of dark light (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://helloolli.deviantart.com/art/The-Unbearable-Being-Of-Light-154662783\" target=\"_blank\">http://helloolli.deviantart.com/art/The-...</a>) to emerge from the ground, which Exe promptly grabbed. \"Thak you very much Sora. But, I think I'll kill her anyway.\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said-' Sora shouted, before Exe held up his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you already forget? Don't be deceived by a Nobody.\" Exe replied. Before he could end Aerith's life however, a figure (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/File:Crisis_core_FF7_Zack_with_buster_sword.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/File:...</a>) jumped down from above, throwing the Nobody back with a swing of his massive sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave Aerith alone!\" the stranger shouted, pointing his sword at Exe. Cloud, Aerith, Tifa all gasped at the sight before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZACK?!\" they all shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only. I thought you'd forgotten about me.\" Zack replied, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, huh? No matter, you won't stop me.\" Exe said, as a barrier separated the two from Sora and the others. \"Let's see what you can do.\" With that, Exe charged at Zack, who blocked Exe's blades with his Buster Sword. Zack forced him back, before hitting Exe with a series of slashes (Chain Slash). Exe quickly recovered, attacking the SOLDIER with shadows. Zack smirked, before casting Flare, which destroyed the shadows and left Exe vulnerable. Zack replaced the Buster Sword on his back, before dashing at Exe, nailing him with a score of kicks and punches, each causing a small explosion. He dashed away before repeating the process from behind. Finally, he dashed paste Exe, causing a huge explosion around the Nobody (Rush Assault). The smoke slowly cleared, revealing a battered Exe, who stood up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, not bad, Zack. Looks like you've won this fight.\" Exe conceded, disappearing through another portal. The darkness around Aerith vanished, along with the barrier. She immediately ran over to Zack, wrapping her arms around his chest, crying into his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought...I'd never see you again.\" she sobbed, as Zack put his arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I promised I'd come back, didn't I?\" he replied. Aerith continued to cry, while Zack held her close. Sora looked up at Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you know him?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack was my friend, before he vanished a few years ago. He promised he'd come back eventually.\" Cloud replied, before Tifa cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's also Aerith's boyfriend she said, siling at Sora's startled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Sora asked, surprised.</span></div></div>",

He then merged Kairi's heart with the Kingdom Stone. The stone began glowing a bright white, before shooting over to the far side of the chamber. The glowing intensified, forcing everyone including Exe to look away. When the glowing ceased, Sora and the others were stunned to see the doorway to Kingdom Hearts before them (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070404025914/kingdomhearts/images/8/85/Kingdom_Hearts.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a>). Suddenly, a glowing ball of light emerged from the doorway, gliding over towards Exe. He grabbed it, before it expanded and changed shape. The glowing faded, revealing the \u03c7-blade (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/171/e/7/x_keyblade___xblade__by_angeldad83-d3jfqpd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/1...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha, at last.

So now, I will reclaim what I lost that day, and put an end to you once and for all!\" Exe shouted. He pointed the \u03c7-blade towards the door, activating it. The doors slowly opened, revealing a bright light beyond. Suddenly, a figure in the black cloak of Organisation XIII floted out, before being laid down on their back. The hood fell away, revealing Larxene's smooth pal skin and blond hair. The doors closed again, as Exe turned to face Sora again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, to end this pointless game.\" he said, creating a barrier that cut himself and sora off from everyone else. Sora tensed, summoning his Keyblade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time, I won't hold back!\" Exe shouted, charging forward. Before Sora could react, Exe swung the \u03c7-blade hard, throwing Sora against the barrier with enormous force. Before Sora could recover, he was thrown into the air by Exe's shadows. Exe leaped up, slicing at Sora from multiple angles, giving him no time to guard or counter. Exe gently landed as Sora hit the ground, his entire body racked with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...\" Leon gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy's in a whole other league.

But it still won't help you.\" Exe taunted. However, before he could attack, Sora blasted him with a rain of lightning (Thundaga), throwing the Nobody back. Sora flew forward, Oathkeeper and Oblivion spinning like buzzsaws. He slashed Exe multiple times, throwing him high into the air. Sora leaped up, As the two Keyblades sliced through Exe from all sides repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it!\" Sora shouted, grabbing both Keyblades. Charging them both with light, he sliced down through Exe, slamming him into the ground. Exe remained motionless as Sora landed, returning to his normal form. Exe slowly rose to his feet, barely managing to lift the \u03c7-blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...bad...Sora. But I'm still-Argh!\" Exe exclaimed, clutching his head with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you again?! I thought I'd supressed you!\" Exe yelled, as he was engulfed in light. When the light faded, Sora and the others were stunned to see Exe, still wielding the \u03c7-blade, and another Exe standing opposite. However, while the Exe with the \u03c7-blade had gunmetal grey hair and red eyes, the other Exe had long silver hair and golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darkness, you've got to stop this! I want Larxene back, but no like this!\" the silver-haired Exe shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, Light. Because I'm in control. I just need to get rid of you!\" the grey-haired Exe shouted. The silver-haired Exe glared, summoning two elegant silver swords (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100429191261/clash-of-the-titans/images/5/53/PerseusSwordFromtheGods.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a>). The two charged each other, their weapons meeting in a rain of sparks. As they exchanged blows, the others rushed over to Sora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is going on?\" Leon wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say this is good. We can destroy them while they're distracted.\" Zack said, gripping his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I cannot let you interfere in this battle.\" The group was startled as another Exe appeared in front of them, this one had grey eyes and white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to explain. There are three sides to Exe. The dark haired one is Darkness Exe. The silver-haired one is Light Exe. And I am Twilight Exe. The Light and Darkness cannot both be equal, only one can be in control. Whoever loses this battle will be destroyed.\" Twilight explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's help Light Exe.\" Sora said, walking forward. Suddenly, he was stopped by Twilight Exe holding a massive blade in his path (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs29/f/2008/069/5/8/Edge_of_Exterminatus_by_Marcus_Talbain.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs29/f/2008/0...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must not interfere in this battle.\" Twilight told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, can't you do something?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot do that. I am twilight; twilight is neutral. I go with whoever wins. that's how it works.\" he replied. \"Also, Light Exe is the only one who can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaiari's heart still exists. If Light Exe is victorious, he can use his power over light to restore Kairi. If Darkness wins, she will be lost forever.\" Twilight explained.</span></div></div>",

We felt like we were somebody when we were with her.

You thought you could defeat me!!\" Darkness Exe yelled out as he jumped up after Light Exe<br>\r\n       Light Exe was sliced from all sides unable to recover. Dark Exe hit Light in the gut sending Light Exe towards the floor. Both of his blades flew when he was hit. The blades hit the floor in front of Sora and the others. light exe coughed.

I will not be able to bring Kairi back\".<br>\r\n       Sora some how heard Light through his thoughts. \"No Light Exe!!\" Sora yelled \"You can't give up! Not yet! Think of Larxene!

Light made the sword that landed in front of Sora come to his hand and blocked Darkness's attack. Light pushed Darkness back and got back up. They started again blow for blow.

Light's other blade came to his hand and it became clear who would win.<br>\r\n        They met again holding the blades together.<br>\r\n        \"This can't be possible\" Darkness said \"I am stronger than you\".<br>\r\n        \"You were stronger than me but this time I will take over permanently!!\" Light yelled as light exploded out of him, and he hit the X-Blade away.<br>\r\n        Light Exe then pulled back and then stabbed Dark Exe in the chest with both blades.<br>\r\n       \"How...can...this...be\" Dark Exe said as he disappeared.<br>\r\n       Light's power went down and his blades disappeared as well. Twilight Disappeared back into Light. For a long moment Light stared at the place where dark had been, and then he walked over to the X-blade and grabbed it. He walked back over to Sora and the others.<br>\r\n        \"Sora thank you for the help\" Exe said \"Now I will repay the favor. And I am sorry for all the trouble that My other half caused to you\"<br>\r\n        Exe walked over to the door and activated the X-blade opening the door. Kairi's heart floated out and floated by Sora. Exe blasted the heart with the X-blade causing the heart to become Kairi again. With out the heart the door again became the crystal again and the X-blade disappeared. Kairi looked around and then saw Sora giving him a hug and a kiss.<br>\r\n         \"I'm so glad your alright\" Sora said after the kiss ended.<br>\r\n          Exe walked over to the unconscious Larxene on the floor.
