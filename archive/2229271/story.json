            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike where browsing through Amazon looking at some intereasting gadgets until he found an weird item on the store. A shrink ray of some sort called the \"Size Manipulation Ray\" and the bio reads \"carrying large objects will be a breeze with this new product allowing the user to shrink the object in size and put it in there pocket and move it where ever. Then return it to size no problem its only $29.99\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be a fake Mike ask himself though he does find cheese rip-off items entertaining and plus it not that expensive so he bought it. So if it does work he can all do a whole lots of stuff and finally he can live out his dream. It's most likely fake but at less he would get a cool looking ray gun he was looking for one as a prop. With in 3 days it came through drone, Mike grabbed the box and went up stairs to his room, looking at the box it look like some high grade packaging so the company is really going the extra mile to make it look real. Mike opens the box and starts throwing away all of the little foam peanuts to then find ray gun of some sort and an instruction mannual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike just thows the mannual aside and then finds something to target, on the gun there are two options G and S. Mike puts the slider to S and then looks at the box, a perfect test item he pulled the trigger and then the a green ray came out of the gun and when it hit the box it started to slowly shrink. He didn't hold the trigger for long so the box only lost a few inches, he looks at the gun with shock. Looking at a green bar on the gun with a battery symbol on it it seems that thats the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike then sets it to G and grows the box back to size, he grabs the mannual and reads it. Don't use on humans, Leave out of reach of childern, This is not a toy the stander warnings, the istructions say that S is to shrink and G is to grow \"well no shit\" Mike said. Grow will only grow an item back to only its regular size, unless you ativate master control which will give the user no restrictions and allow to grow items but power usage will increase. The gun can change forms for a more comfortable handling forms include remote form, ray form, phone form, and tablet form. Lastly the gun has a limited battery life that will deplete when used but will recharge on its own over time and any shrunken items will get increased resistance to prevent it braking when at reduced size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike then ativiated master controls an and then changes the form to remote. In a flash the gun transforms into an average tv remote, then he changed it back to ray form. As quickly it changes into the remote it changes back into the ray gun again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Mike do?</span></div></div>",

We are a corparation fueled by new discoveries and the power to push humanity to the next step. We worked on a handful of things to new programing for many new phones, or new equipment for the military. Though one thing that Omega Labs really try to strive for is size changing products and luckly we just made a brake through. We made that simple dream into a reality and you are going to the first one to experice the first ever size changing product in the world.\" Mike's eyes lite up, hes going to be the first man to change his size.

Many achievements and many goals. This is no joke of a company, then he hears a womens voice coming from the back room \"One minute sir I will be right with you.\" Heat voice was beautiful and calming it makes sence since most receptionists are suppost to make waits easier and calmer. The he hears footsteps and then there she was and the face matchs the voice. \"Hello there sir do you have an appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike pulled out his card \"Um, yes I'm here to test one of your guys proto-type.\" She takes the card from Mike and runs it through a device, and it makes a high pitch ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok you are good, though we are busy right now preparing the test so you can wait here until a representive escorts you to the testing room.\" Mike sat down on the chair and every second felt like a minute and it dead quite.

Funniest thing is you are going to be the one to test it.\" When she said that Mike now felt the pressure, but at the same time flattered. Hes going to test something that could change not only his life but the worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool what is it?\" Mike asked, the women giggles then with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I don't know for certant and also they do like to keep it a suprise to there volianters mostly for the shock value. Though by the sounds of it you will enjoy it, it might be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice oh, I'm sorry but I didn't get your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to smile it seems like she likes the conversation greated if Mike had to stand there all day he will be needing to talk to someone. \"My name is Hana, and on this sheet here I'm guessing your Mike right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Mike then now looks at her shirt and then sees a name tag, at that point he should face palm but at this point anything will do it doesn't really matters since hes just trying to brake the silence. \"Well its nice to meet you Hana you seem rather nice, must get boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly yes but luckly I do have a lot of free time and plus people like you do make my day gets the work shift done faster.\" It seems she does enjoy Mike's company, and as he looks at the clock it has been a hour. \"Though hey maybe once your done we can talk some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya that would be cool. Though have you seen any of the tests that go on?\" Hana then tilt her head and try to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too sure the lab is in a seprate room but I do hear a little bit after the test hat it was about, and also about what the next test might be. Though now maybe when you come back you can share it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smiles \"Ya that sounds cool it was nice talking to you I don't want to distract you for too long.\" Hana then waves goodbye and looks down and starts to type on the computer as Mike goes back to his seat.</span></div></div>",

His teacher Mrs Thompson is someone that is always a intreasting person she wasn't too strict more or less someone who wants to push people. Though Mike questions how she leared those tactics, its most likey some old method that she learned and she just expands it into mordern time. Mike gives her credit though it does work people get work done on time, and people have improved and its because shes a rough teacher. People hope not to have her because her classes is like a college grade course even though the subject should be hard. She just makes it hard, some how and Mike can't find out how thats even works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So class hopefully everyones home work is compele so just pass your home work up and we will get started.\"<br>\r\nMrs. Thompson said, Mike grabbed his home work that he spent one whole night on and passed it foward. \"Ok, class lets begin so...\" at that moment Mike just blanked out he can't pay attention to the leason so but he wrote down as much as he can so he can remeber later. Then Mike just figured that he need to use the bathroom. So with a quick raise of his hand he asked to go to the bathroom, Mrs. Thompson nods and he grabs the bathroom pass and goes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly takes a deep breath and splashed some water on his face whipping the drowsiness from his eyes. \"Ok Mike you got this I'm fully awake.\" He said to himself waking himself up.

Miss. Page man for the longest time you had such a crush on her. Though you try your best to not think about here, but this is why chemistry is your favorite class since not only the experiments awsome, how hot Miss. Page is. She was incredibly smart like way too smart to teach High school, and she one of the youngest teaching staff here shes 27. Man her voice was always so friendly and welcoming, and has a high tone too it. It feels like at times that she knows that most of the boys droll over her and she just plays along with it and not let it faze her. Though she has been giving you a very intereasting stare but its rather quick, you where her favorite though thats what you tell yourself. She really likes you and she doesn't seem to give you a hard time and enjoys when you awnser her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok class, Today we are going to something rather intreasting today I have just got approval to do an cool experiment though sadly not all of you are going to do it. Its more of a one on one thing but I have a work around this the old name in the hat gamble. So put you name in the hat if you want to be part of this cool experiment.\" It seem that Miss Page is rather excited about this experiment must be the coolest thing ever Mike thought and plus a one on one class seasion with Miss. Page. Mike quickly wrote his name down on the paper and when the hat came around he dropped it in there. Then he saw Miss. Page give him a slight happy grin he doesn't know what that means but maybe she is rather glad that he is participating in the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one kid raised there hands \" Is this going to extra credit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss. Page then with a sad joking tone \"No this is not extra credit...\" and then she said with a big smile \"but how ever is the winner of the one on one experiment will have a cool thing that can only be obtained by the experiment and an experince you will never for get.\" Mike than begin to think well that seem cool a once in a life time experince and a rare object, cool. \"Ok thats all the names of people who want to do the specal experiment. So lets get started.\" Her hand reached down into the hat... the tention builds the class is silent. \"The winner is... Mike!\" Mike pumps his fist with excitement, Miss. Page's experimets are the bomb and now a time all to themselves. Miss Page walks up to Mike and says \"So congratulations Mike. Now with that out of the way I will meet you at the end of the school day.\" Mike's heart raced good thing that his girlfriend doesn't know about this or it would be one weird conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the School day Mike makes it back to his Chemistry class room and who else than Miss page. waiting for him outside the classroom \"Well come in Mike and lets get started I always wanted to do this.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked around and see a bunch of beakers filled with different color liquid \"There is a lot here; are you sure that only two people are supposed to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said with a smile \"Yes it may seem a lot but there is very easy to pull of with two. So first I need you to put that blue liquid into this beaker with this green liquid.\" You did what she said you poured it slowly making sure not to spill it. The liquid foamed and bubbled, the liquid truns a light green. \"Great now I will start to turn on the burner, pour the red liquid in.\" Like you did with the last beaker you poured in slowly, the beaker shakes as the liquid turns a deep brown the bubble grow bigger popping more aggressively. \"Perfect don't be scared that is suppost to do that, now one last thing me and you have to spit into it.\" You turn to Miss. Page with a confused look but she spits into the beaker and then nods to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and then you spit into it and then the liquid calms down. Miss. Page picks up the beaker and put it on the hot plate and stirs it, then puts some kind of sugar cube like thing into it and then stirs some more the liquid turns a light blue. Miss Page then put the hot beaker down on the table top to cool off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to Mike \"So how about we talk for a little while it cools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok what make this experiment so specail that you need approvel?\" Mike asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well everything needs to be approved, but this one is a specail case because it's something rather new that scientists are still looking into. I was intereasted with it and so I pulled some strings and now here we are this experiment will give our school major braging rights.\" She awnsered with the up most joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it then?\" Mike awnsered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your not going to get that suprise that easily, but one secret I will share is that I wanted to do this with you.\" Mike was shocked to hear his teacher say that. \"You see I know you have a little crush on me so I know you will put your name in that hat so... lets just say I rigged it. Manly I find your crush cute so I figured to both enjoy it.\" At that moment the beaker cooled down and Miss. Page poured some of it into a test tube. Mike's heart is pounding his teacher he has a crush on also has a crush on him. She slowly walks to Mike swaying her hips \"Well drink up you are going to love this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike drinks it, every last drop he can't even think of the taste hes still in shock this about his teacher. Then he feels light headed for a meoment and then it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe now I should tell you what this liquid does.\"</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Young some how made it rather intreasting, it seems like most history teachers don't go too into it making the subject more of a bore. That's why Mike like Mrs, Young so much she make is fun. Her additued is rather respectful and she doesn't threat her students like well students, but rather treat them like actual people. Shes rather calm but does show some energy to what ever she likes. Shes all around a nice calm person<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike entered class and found his set he just remebered that Mrs. Young was going to bring in some acient artifacts. From where he doesn't know but its rather cool to see something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Young comes into the class with a rather large bag of items hanging out of it \"Ok class sorry I was a bit late but you don't know how much these things weigh all to gether.\" She put the bag on the table and it made a heavy thud. The table shook from the impact, \"So ok we got a lot of stuff here like right here is a ring that was made during ancient Egypt, and here was an old tome about witchcraft that was made during the 1800's. Right here is a neckless that was from ancient Greece...\" Mike look at the items on the table and they seem very old but he sees that something is off about them not as in they are fake they seem very real. It's just the fact he feels something rather weird with all three of them. At this point Mike just toned out Mrs. Young but he wants to know more about those items and find out why they act in such they way they do. Mike turns his attention back on to Mrs. Young \"So they say all of these items had magical powers with in them but that was mostly superstition, but just remeber if you want to know more about these items don't be too afraid to ask me after class about them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Young explaned what each item ment to there respective time period how their power was used. Though Mike can tell she is holding back on some of the detail many it migh just take the whole day to go over at less one of the items. Mike can't shake the feeling on those items and why there are they way the are, it gives him a feeling he can't describe. The bell rang and everyone quickly got up and head out though Mike stayed back \"Mrs. Young I got some more questions about the items... well some is an understatment more like a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at Mike and then with a joyful giggle \"I see you found the little historian inside you well all of these items do hold a lot of history and plus I could really fit all of the detail of every item in one lecture. I will be happy to tell you more about them how about after school I will tell you more about them.\" Mike can't wait to get the anwsers he want but mostly getting up close to them will allow him to find out more about this feeling he has been getting. Both Mike and Mrs. Young walked out of the classroom, with Mrs. Young carrying the heavy bag of items back to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

Its mostly because her calm nature, she is preaty standert but one thing is that she doesn't try to give much work. Mike does find that relly great mostly because he doen't need to work too hard in the class, he does notice that she does have a nice big butt. That's though at times it does block his veiw of the board but with an ass like that he doesn't complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well class we will continue with your book for today.\" Mrs.Matfield said, though reading is not too intereasting to Mike, but he does like it to some extent. If the story can be complete quickly and as well as have an intreasting plot he will read it. Luckly most of the class reads the book aloud so he can not focuse as hard making him think of other things. Though he does notice that Mrs. Matfield carries a dark brown lether book around though Mike aways though that it jst might be a book she really enjoys, but its everyday and how she reads, she reads rather quickly so and the book don't look too long. It looks smaller than Harry Potter book but bigger than any short story book so Mike had made some theories but its most likely something he is over looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class come to a close Mrs. Matfield closes \"Remeber class every book is like a portal to another world. A world of magic and fun.\" As the class leaves you walk out but then you forgot you left a book under your chair and as you enter the room again, Mrs. Matfield quickly closes her book shut \"Ho Mike you suprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya sorry but I forgot about a book under my chair.\" Mike replied but still question why she shut that book so quickly making him start to say with a uneasy but yet sarcastic way as he grabs his book \"So... Ya you are looking into the magic in that portal of yours?\" Mike tryed his best to make light of the situation but making a joke. Mrs. Matfield laughs very nervously but at the same time it seems that she then smiles normaly so it seems Mike just recovered this situation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me you have no idea, this is a really good book.\" Some how Mike feels like that is no ordinary book, but to not to make it awkward again he just walks out but stays just outside the door to take a peak of the book through the glass. There seems to be some kind of crest on the cover of the book but its hard to make out though from where hes standing it does seem rather odd. Mike just pass it off he might just be overlooking it he thought to himself its just a book. So he walks of to his next class, and maybe he can look up the book shes looking at later.</span></div></div>",

No giant men or M/M or m/FM. Just keep this giantess focused. Though I'm not opossed to small women just as long as they are taller then the men its fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Their are no size limites go CRAZY.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n3. No one sentence chapters unless the chapter is to extend more choices, other wise at less a paragraph or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. any under-aged character please don't be overly sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Please write in english.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. No extreme levels of scat or extreme toilet stuff. You can have it but don't go overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. I'm not a huge grammer nazi but please spell check and try your best on using good grammer hell I'm not perfect either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. This is a shrinking/growth story so keep the story on track on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No single choice chapters. Two or more choices this is an interactive story after all it's a lot more fun if you have more choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. You are allowed to add more charaters just introduce them when mentioned (picture(s) is optional).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Don't end the story let the story go as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. Mike can not die its most likely a side effect of what ever is shrinking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. Type in ether 3rd or 2nd person example \"You did\" or \"Mike did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. Lastly and this is a big rule... HAVE FUN and be created, but just follow the story and the path that you choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso check out my other story(s) <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2223452-A-Fairy-Big-Girlfriend\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2223452-A-Fairy-Big-Girlf...</a></td>",
