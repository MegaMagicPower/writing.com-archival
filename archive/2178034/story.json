            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Jon is a 5'10 brown hair that is short just long enough to cover the fingers. He grew up in Minnesota and his family moved around allot. He was slow to let folks in close to get to know him as in 8 months to a year seams like he has to move. He didn't know he would regret keeping folks from getting close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After high school, he ended up moving down south with his older mother. He would spend the next 13 years there. On night in early December he sat at the hospital with his mother who was in and out of it from heavy pain meds. While she was out of it, that gave him some time to think about his past. He sat letting his mind wonder as he kept a ear for any change from the normal hospital sounds. He didn't really like living in Texas, but being his mothers only family. He didn't have the heart to move away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   While sitting there thinking about what to do once his mom is gone. Could he find his old crush from school days? He had two of them. One becoming good friends with him. He was happy to be in the friend zone with Amber. The other crush shot him down going for the bad boy. Soon he transferred to a new school and lost ties with Taya. He didn't live far from her, he could have walked to see her about 6 blocks. The sting of rejection was just to much even tho his family moved closer but into a new school lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He had a friend in Alaska and loved it up there when he visited Ann and her boyfriend. He is also looking at moving up there. He had always loved camping and stuff in Minnesota. He likes the idea of going up there and getting lost living off the grid in the wilds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He sat in the hospital room wondering what to do. Sure he had friends in life. Most of them online. But very few he knew would be there for him in times like this. He had two folks in his life that he knew he could lean on in times that are down. He looked at all the different possibility where to go in the coming year. To save up for the coming move. He locked him self on 3 paths.. Try and reach out to Taya and Amber. See if he can get a friendship going or if time had closed that on him in there eyes, or move into the wilds of Alaska. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When he got home he told a few of his close friends that has been there for him threw the ups and downs of life. One of them was like a sister to him. Years ago when they first met they had a crush on each other, but one of them always seemed to be in a relationship, so they feel into the friend zone. When he mentioned the idea of him moving out of Texas to Alaska, She had asked him point blank \"What about with me?\" That had shocked him. He never thought of moving to Canada. This opened up a new option he didn't think of for the past 10 years. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Jon did what anyone now days dose.  He went to face book and searched Taya's full name. He didn't know what she would look like today after 20 years. He knew some basic info and knew her face. He did a search by name and town and got a few hits. He looked at the list and there she was. As cute as ever. Same dark like tan skin and stunning brown eyes. That face didn't change much over the years and all the core parts he loved as a kid was still there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He didn't know what to say, as a kid. She wasn't into him and now 20 years later it was odd to pop up. So he wrote the truth as its is always the best thing to do. He wrote a message saying \"Hey are you the same Taya that I went to upper elementary school and middle school with? If so I was wondering if we could chat and catch up.\" With that face he was sure it was her. He wanted to ask to make sure tho. He wasn't sure if she would remember him. After all 20 years is a long time. He remembered her as he had a huge crush on her. He wasn't sure how much of a impression he had made on her then and if it would still be in her mind to this day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He could only hope she would read it and respond. There was a good chance she would think its a spam message and wont read it. He could only hope she would read it and want to respond. </span></div></div>",
