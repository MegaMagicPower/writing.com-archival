Eventually after he was done looking, she sighed in weariness. From the shadows crept Giratina, lord of death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What troubles you, Arceus?\" asked the embodiment of antimatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another sigh, the white equine being explained: \"Yveltal, the guardian of death, has just been captured by a stupid trainer by using a master ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giratina, this is no joke!\" Arceus snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is too. I'M supposed to be the guardian of death, remember? That stupid bird is just a poser.\" Giratina rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last freaking time...\" the white god closed its eyes in frustration \"YOU are the guardian of the afterlife, you govern the afterlife! YVELTAL guards death, just death, and not the afterlife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not having this conversation.\" Arceus turned away \"The point is, legendarys are being captured one after another thanks to that stupid master ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is kind of weird that godlike beings like us can be just caught and wielded by ten year olds...\" admitted the serpentine ghost type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something must be done.\" Arceus stamped his hoof, clocking her gaze towards the world once more \"Something must be done... or else the world's balance may fall apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just make a new legendary, one that can't be caught by pok\u00e9balls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that.\" Arceus said back, \"It... didn't work so well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMEANWHILE IN ALOLA<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNihilego: \"GRAAHHBLAGLAR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuzzlord: \"WRAAARGHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKartana: \"SHHSHSHHHSHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trainer gazed upon these abominations in fear, then ran away as fast as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the end they just found a way to capture those as well! Somehow!\" the equine being complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiratina silenced himself, thinking and letting his creator do the same. After a while, Giratina couldn't come up with anything, so he began gazing into other dimensions, silently watching while eating popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... maybe I should create like... a thing with... and it'll be able to do stuff...\" Arceus tried to think, but was distracted by Giratina's portal watching. He stomped over to where the ghost dragon was, demanding that he stop doing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, most of these dimensions run like TV shows! And this ones about to get good!\" complained the guardian of death. Arceus looked into his portal to see what the fuss was about. In there, he saw two humans fighting. One of them was an orange haired punk kid with a sleek black sword, while the other was a butterfly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aizen, Imma kill you because you're an asshole!\" stated the orange haired one in the most brooding voice imaginable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOL I'm too much of a troll for that!\" said the butterfly \"I'm so broken that I can use my shikai to make illusions so great that they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired man then punched the butterfly through several walls. An amazing fight ensued, but for some reason the butterfly never used his broken illusion abilities for the duration of the match, costing him his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" Arceus wasn't familiar with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In some other dimensions, it's actually the humans who have great powers! Isn't it funny how the multiverse works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clicked within God's brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be funny if the human in our universe had those kinds of powers?\" Giratina rambled on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus silenced him just then, \"Giratina... I have an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty Waterflower was still a tomboy even in her adulthood. She was physically active, wasn\u2019t afraid of any dirt, wore the barest minimum of makeup at all times and never could wear a dress. However, as an adult, her body was no longer remotely tomboyish. Sporting a modest bust and wide hips that made even the white guys go \u201cDAY-UMM!\u201d, she had blossomed into a very mature looking woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer orange hair had grown out but was still cropped short, only reaching to her shoulders. Her lips were a darker shade of pink due to her lipstick, her eyes still as green as the depths of the sea. Because she was at that age, her usual gym attire consisted of a dramatic cape coat, a blue sports bra-like top and the shortest, tightest short bottoms ever conceived by mankind. Her hips were one of her best and biggest features, wider than her own shoulders with a great butt to match, so it was only natural she\u2019d show it off as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis elicited a response from the 14 year old male trainer who had just come in to challenge her. And by response, we mean his penis became erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I challenge you for a gym badge!\u201d Said the young boy, blushing at Misty\u2019s incredibly attractive figure. He nearly fainted when she turned around to gather her pok\u00e9balls, giving him a view of her extraordinarily large rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChallenge accepted!\u201d Misty smiled. As was tradition for her family, she had taken over the Cerulean City Gym. She didn\u2019t mind it, wanting to be the greatest water trainer, plus her sisters weren\u2019t even remotely qualified to handle gym leader responsibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, Ivysaur!\u201d the male trainer shouted, summoning the grass type pok\u00e9mon from a pok\u00e9ball. He forced himself to ignore Misty\u2019s womanly body- he had heard rumors that she was one of the toughest gym leaders in the Kanto league, and he needed to be prepared. Luckily, his Ivysaur was a grass type, so he had a type advantage\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, Magikarp!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sent out a weak looking orange fish, who flopped around uselessly going \u201cKARP? KARP?\u201d as if it had no idea where it was or what it was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male trainer narrowed his eyes, a Magikarp, one of the weakest pok\u00e9mon in the world? Wasn\u2019t Misty supposed to be extremely strong? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagikarp, use Tackle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the pathetic orange fish managed to Tackle Ivysaur across the room where it landed painfully into a wall, making cracks in it. His Ivysaur got up weakly, and the trainer knew this was serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRazor Leaf!\u201d dozens of leaves were thrown at the orange fish, who somehow dodged them all by using a Splash attack. Before the trainer could question how a mere Magikarp could be this strong, it Tackled his Ivysaur again dealing massive damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIvysaur, use Sleep Powder!\u201d luckily the trainer thought of using this drowsing move to stall the Magikarp\u2019s movements. The orange fish breathed in the powder, and subsequently fell asleep. From there it was an easy victory with Ivysaur launching many leaves at the fish, causing it to faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did well, Magikarp!\u201d The orange haired water trainer recalled her pok\u00e9mon. This was a standard 2v2 match, and right now the challenging trainer had one victory. Another, and he would win the Cascade Badge. But of course, Misty wouldn\u2019t go down without a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, Starmie!\u201d Misty called her ace pok\u00e9mon, a water psychic starfish like creature with a red gem in its center. This one seemed very well trained, which made the challenger wary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t lose confidence.\u201d he said to himself, \u201cIvysaur can take this, and even if he can\u2019t, I still have my Pikachu. Ivysaur, hit it with a Poison powder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarmie, use Bubble beam!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive seconds later, the left side of the gym exploded, scattering debris everywhere. The denizens of cerulean paid it no heed- this was the fifth time this week. They merely suspected it was another challenger foolishly trying to beat their gym leader and moved on with their lives. Indeed their suspicions were correct- the Ivysaur had been defeated in a single second, while the Pikachu took another three, thus explaining the explosion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, I overdid it\u2026\u201d Misty gazed on the damage to her gym. When the challenger had sent out a Pikachu, instinct took over and she commanded Starmie to launch its strongest attack, subconsciously comparing this electric mouse to another she knew all too well. Nostalgia took over for a split second as she remembered the face of the man she once loved, but shook those thoughts away. That was in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sorry kid, but no badge today. Come back another time!\u201d the gym leader waved cheerfully as the crying trainer tended to his pok\u00e9mon, running to the nearest pok\u00e9mon center which was now a booming business in this city. As soon as he exited..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a few moments, Misty just stood there, not comprehending what happened, until her brain started to work again. Misty was face to face with a ten foot tall white equine being with gray contours. It had a glowing golden dais in its midsection and piercing green eyes that saw all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArceus?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m Wynaut. YES I\u2019M ARCEUS DAMNIT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was awestruck the god of all pok\u00e9mon was standing right in front of her! Instinctively, she bowed out of respect, as well as her Pokemon. Arceus looked upon this with disdain: \u201cOh don\u2019t grovel! One thing I can\u2019t stand it\u2019s people groveling!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Misty said as she stood back up. \u201cI...Im not well practised in how to talk with...God.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t apologize! Every time I talk to someone it\u2019s \u2018sorry\u2019 this and \u2018forgive me\u2019 that and \u2018I am not worthy\u2019\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus noticed that the human in front of her as well as her Pokemon were turned away, only indirectly looking at him. \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...being respectful?\u201d Misty asked, trying very hard to not upset her literal creator. Arceus rolled his eyes and waved his hoof around in a dismissing gesture to stop. Clearing its throat, the god of all pok\u00e9mon began to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me. I have an incredibly task for you. Arceus began his story: he briefly explained that legendarys were constantly getting kidnapped in pok\u00e9balls by ten year olds who had just started their journey, and while capture they couldn\u2019t perform their normal duties as gods of balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempts at making a pok\u00e9mon that couldn\u2019t be caught had failed\u2026 and even the omniscient creator of the world didn\u2019t know whether or not it was even a pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNihilego: \"GRAAHHBLAGLAR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Arceus had another idea. This one would work for sure because the next legendary would be absolutely impossible to catch. To put it simply, Arceus announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to turn you into a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty and her Pokemon were utterly flabbergasted. \u201cNow hold on a second!\u201d Misty said in an effort to remain levelheaded. \u201cArceus, what do you mean by that, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean exactly what I mean.\u201d Said the god back, \u201cYou have been chosen o wield immense power equal to that of a legendary pok\u00e9mon. You will gain those powers as well as turn into a pok\u00e9mon/human hybrid, which will never be able to be capture by pok\u00e9balls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo wait\u2026 we\u2019ll start turning into pok\u00e9mon?\u201d Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no. The transformation will make you half pok\u00e9mon, but you will mostly be in control of how you transform. Unless you\u2019re a furry, you\u2019ll probably look 95% human by the time this is done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Misty was not a furry. Next, the water gym leader had another question. \u201cSo our bodies will transform, but only what we want them to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly. If for instance you wanted larger mammary glands, that would happen. If you wanted to fire laser beams from your ears that would also happen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph\u2026\u201d At the mention of bigger breasts, Misty squeezed her C cups together, making some ample cleavage. Yes, her hips and butt were her most prominent feature, and she always tried to flaunt whenever she could, but she always feeled she felt...well, cheated when it came to chest size. Other girls around the town were humongous H cups while she was almost flat chested. Sometimes, she wished she wasn\u2019t so busy\u2026 and other times she wished she had bigger boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I just realized something.\u201d Misty said, \u201cWhy ME? Why was I chosen- what makes me so special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I first tested this I realized that all humans have a defined \u2018potential\u2019 for this transformation.\u201d further explained the white deity, \u201cThe greater this potential is, the more powers you can amass and attain. So\u2026I decided to go around the world and measure the potentials of different humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 so that\u2019s why\u2026?\u201d May began to put the pieces together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have incredibly high potential. Aside from that, I had to pick people who weren\u2019t evil or would abuse that power. You were the most obvious choice. Of course, I won\u2019t force this on you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m already in. Getting pok\u00e9mon powers sounds awesome!\u201d Misty gave a triumphant grin. So let\u2019s do it! Arceus- please turn me into a legendary please</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nInstantly, Misty was surrounded by a silverlight, quickly turning into something resembling a translucent golden egg. This strange flux of energy surrounded and permeated her very core. The sensations they felt could not be described in words- it was painful, but joyous. It was exhilarating, but expectant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Arceus was altering both her body and mind with pok\u00e9mon DNA, his own energy, and connecting her potential to her powers.This would allow her to become an entirely new life form- perfectly capable of become a legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire process took ten minutes to complete. When it was finally over, a brilliant flash of light broke the metaphorical womb and Misty stood back up, having regained full awareness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're as only one external feature about Misty that had changed during those 10 minutes in the golden egg of power. Misty had gone from well-proportionally bottom heavy, to what you might say, \u201cbusty\u201d\u2026if your vocabulary entirely failed you, that is. Colossal might be more accurate. Ridiculously, massively, unbelievably, and impossibly busty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stood on the linoleum tiled floor of her gym contemplating her life and situation. Her first thought strayed to her breasts. Misty\u2019s colossal bust. Breasts that are each as big as a school bus. Actually, she thought proudly, a fair bit bigger in every way than a school bus. If she set one of her monsters next to a bus, and you stood on the bus side, you would be able to see her breast dimensions in full. The top of her breasts would be visible over the top of the bus, her phenomenal thicker than her leg nipple would be visible beyond the front of the bus, and her personage would be visible behind the bus. If you stood on her breast side, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the bus at all. To think, she might be actually be able to literally conceal a bus in the valley between her BREASTS. At least, for the few seconds she could resist her compulsion to crush the bus between them, she admitted to herself. She bit her lip gently as the eroticism of that thought swept through her, and made a mental note: CRUSH BUS SOMEDAY. That brought her to ruminate on the other aspects of her chest. They aren\u2019t just longer than school buses and tall enough to obscure up to halfway of the second story of a house, but they are also immensely fat at some 5 times wider than a bus. Her areolas alone are 5 feet wide, surrounding massive nipples that are a foot thick in diameter, but short and stumpy. Stumpy relative to their massive surroundings, that is. When aroused, however, look out in front, she thought with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Arceus mused as he eyed Misty\u2019s new assets. \u201cWell...someone is a bit chest focused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing that Misty was in her gym when the transformation happened. There was no sense in owning a house that she could never fit inside now. \u201cHell, my AREOLA are each wider than doorways\u201d, she thought to herself happily. As it is,her breasts had grown to slump into her indoor pool, causing water to splash all around. Her Pokemon eyed the two monsters with awe. She glanced around further and saw her Pokemon gaze at their master with jaws dropped and eyes wide. That was a thought too far and she writhed in the sudden surge of ecstasy. Many of Misty\u2019s thoughts were tending to lead to her breasts, one way or another. She never got over just how MASSIVE she was, and she LOVED IT! It still boggled her mind how incomprehensibly vast she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until a few minutes later that she was stark naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to her honest surprise...she found she didn't really care. All of this occurred in five minutes before Misty spontaneously got a headache. \u201cOh by the way the procedure takes a lot out of you, you\u2019ll probably be very-\u201d Arceus was interrupted as Misty crashed onto her massive boobs, using them as pillows, sleeping. \u201c\u2026 Yes, tired. Hm. Alright. Well enjoy your newfound powers, Misty. I\u2019ll make sure to talk to you tomorrow about how to control them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick warping of the space-time continuum, Arceus was gone, and Misty\u2019s Pokemon started silently at their trainer using her own breasts as pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night, a good six hours since the transformation,Misty slept soundly without complications. While she layed on her own valley of cleavage dreaming, her body slowly began to change\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the headache subsided in less than a minute, thankfully. The yellow duck Pokemon found himself in an familiar room, but at the same time not the room she should be in-it was the Pokemon Gym, his trainer's gym. Panic began to set in as he could not remember how he got there. He should be in his Pokeball right now! But a large yawn made it's way from across the room, somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head, Psyduck saw his trainer, Misty, beached to the floor with two school buses for breasts with her sleeping on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsyduck was wide eyed at what just he saw. Then, his memories clicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. She's part Pokemon now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Psyduck did not understand what happened yesterday, or why Arceus was there, or why Misty seemed to like her newfound body so much, but he did know that she forgot to put him back in his Pokeball before falling asleep. In fact, she forgot to put all of them back inn their Pokeballs! Turning bac around, Psyduck saw that all of her Pokemon had fallen asleep in a huge pile on the floor, waiting for Misty to feed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably, Psyduck was a little miffed at the situation. So much so, that he was determined to march right up to her trainer, wake her up, and demand that he be fed! Well, maybe not demand, but still. With a huff, Psyduck turned back around to face his sleeping goddess slash trainer, but paused as something...began to happen to her right in front if his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Misty's tits were enormous on their own right, it appeared that Misty's behind as well began to undergo a side affect of the new power radiating through her body. Slowly, but most surely, her hips shoved out of her skimpy tight shorts, leaving them to hang out for all the world to see, widening and thickening, broadening by entire feet as the Pokemon/Human fusion's hourglass figure perfects itself, more of her body smothering the tiled floor of her gym. In her sleep, Misty tongue  lolls out of her mouth, and her moans fill the building, rattling the windows and threatening to set off car alarms up and down the street outside. her butt begins to grow - both smooth, globular and perky cheeks expanding; inflating; almost flowing outwards, growing in a single smooth surge of size - rounder, even perkier, larger and larger. Handfuls of supple buttflesh become more than handfuls, then more than that; her skin soft and smooth enough to engulf the hands of anyone daring enough to grope her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not until Misty had acquired the perfect bubble butt did the growth finally stop. Her gigantic rear end gently smooshed into the side of the building, making the place creak and groan in protest. They were perfectly the exact same size as Misty's breasts, that is to say, the size of a school bus. Each. To Psyduck, it was rather curious to see his trainer be like this, sandwiched between wobbling masses that just so happened to be apart of her body. Like a toothpick smashed in between two Wailords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was too tired to put up with another round of Misty being expanded, Psyduck went back to the pile of Pokemon to go back to sleep. He could eat tomorrow. Besides, it was never a good idea to wake up Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next Morning...</span></div></div>",
