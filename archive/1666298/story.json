Pip had stopped coming to her and that had her slightly depressed but not as much as she thought it would. She hadn't had a mission in weeks so she wasn't very active what so ever and she didn't train much because she already had the greatest skill with her guns as she could. But the none activity had started to affect her. Seras felt the very slightest pressure against her uniform, she was slowly but surly gaining weight. But not much. She felt it mainly in the belly, chest, and thigh area from the little weight she had gained. And deep deep down, she kind of liked the extra padding and lazy lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround Seras a few plates of food and bags of blood had begun to pile up, she didn't feel like putting them away till she absoultly had to. A small cute burp exited Seras's lips and she giggled \"Excuse me.\" She said. She could acctually get used to this!</span></div></div>",

Some crumbs were hanging around her mouth and had even fallen on her shirt. She looked up at Ash as he squatted down in front of her, holding his cap in his left hand for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh...eating alright?\" He asked nervously. Misty set her sandwich down atop her bag of chips, then shot Ash an annoyed glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just what do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing...just, ah, just wondering is all...\" Ash said defensively, smiling nervously before putting his cap back on, standing upright and walking back to where he put his own lunch with a brisk pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed as she looked over at her sandwich. She looked down at her stomach, a plump, soft muffin top flowing over her shorts, which were a bit tighter around her sizable rear, wider hips and plump legs. She shrugged and went back to her sandwich, cramming another mouthful of mayo, lettuce, bread, tomato and roasted ham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't take long to set off on the road again. The path was a level grassy plain with a definite dirt path and some rocks and ledges here and there. It was a very peaceful, picturesque scene. The only thing that really bothered Misty about it was the occasional Rattata nipping at her heels. Misty looked up at the sky and enjoyed the peaceful sunny sky...why was that cloud moving so fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" Brock said as she stared upwards. \"I guess we'll be seeing rain soon. If the clouds are drifting that fast, that means rain and fog in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Wait, can't we set up a camp or something?\" Misty queried. Any camping trip or Pokemon journey could have the joy snuffed out of it in a flash by the whims of mother nature it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, don't worry.\" Brock said in his usual affable tone as he waved a hand, pulling his map out of his backpack. \"It says here there's a Pokemon Center just up the road. If we hurry, we can be there before the rain starts falling too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded as she and Pikachu started to pelt off ahead, with Brock following behind. Misty found it a tad harder then usual to keep up, but she was still holding her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little belly fat isn't gonna weight me down! She thought as she kept sprinting, admittedly keeping an impressive pace in and of itself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the Audino took the tray, it shook, some bottles of pills and medicine shaking a bit, the Audino worrying as it tried to regain balance before the deceptively heavy tray calmed. A single, clear bottle that must have been 5 oz. and looked to be filled with water, however, rolled off and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" A single, thick hand caught it quickly before it hit the ground. The Nurse Joy who caught it, a staggering 800lbs or so, stood back upright, her full form wobbling as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a bit more cautious next time. I know, these are a bit more dense then they look, but stuff like this is expensive.\" The Nurse warned in a motherly scolding tone as she held up the jar in her hand. \"Pokeglutrine: a special drug formulated for Snorelaxes who have lost a dangerous amount of body fat due to illness and inability to eat. It's not only expensive, but based on a crash test from Unova, if a human consumes this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, the automatic doors opened up. The corpulent nurse could hear the roar of raindrops falling outside. As she looked out, the sky looked jet black as evening fell with the thick cloud cover and she could hear raindrops fiercely falling off from the roof. Three trainers stepped inside, two young men and a pudgy girl with them as well as a Pikachu. The nurse eyed the redhead, particularly her prominent muffin top. The young man with black hair took his cap off and tried to shake out the rainwater soaked inside, while the slightly tanned young man standing next to him with brown hair took off his green vest and set it in a nearby chair. The girl however had almost no clothes with her, bemoaning her soaked yellow top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" The blubbery Nurse Joy said as she tried to bow, but only slightly. Last time she went all the way down, her skirt split in half and fell off due to her massive, round rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...hi...\" Ash said. He felt almost intimidated by the size of this Nurse Joy, who almost seemed to tower over the young man with her bulk and round, blubbery body, accompanied by large breasts that pressed up against her thick second chin a bit. Brock pretty much passed out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked off to the side as some gurgling resonated from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...is there a cafeteria here I can eat or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the hall and to the right.\" The blubbery Nurse Joy said as she pointed down to the hall in question, raising her puffed up arm to do so.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't a bad person, but was known for her playful pranks. A similar such act already taking root in her mind, causing her to develop a tiny, evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Ash and his stupid questions with his stupid hat and stupid...stupidity. Stupid...\" Misty muttered angrily to herself as she ate another bite of her ice cream sundae, her head lazed against her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if she had a bit of extra fat on her body? As far as she heard fat was becoming more of the \"in\" thing anyway! Elesa had started rocking a hell of a plump body and got a 12% boost in her already stupendous popularity and there were also reports of people flocking over to see this one girl who was so fat she was the size of a town! So what if she put on some weight? If anything, she should just grow like a balloon and show Ash what for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nurse Joy from before stumbled over as she walked by, accidentally spilling some water on Misty's ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's just water. It won't do much.\" Misty said calmly with a smile, waving it off as she went back to her ice cream. As the Nurse walked away, she smiled as she saw Misty start to eat a bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...oh man, why is this ice cream suddenly so freaking good?\" Misty cried as she dug into her sundae. She just kept shoveling mouthfuls of the delicious substance into her mouth. With each bite, however, copious amounts of fat piled onto her body. She grew outwards fast, her top quickly becoming more like a bra then anything meant to be worn as a shirt and her shorts were practically bursting at the sides as they came undone in the front. Her breasts ballooned outwards with fat as her ass in turn bubbled out behind her and her belly cascaded in front of her. Her bulbous form was almost blob like with it's high fat content and Misty barely seemed to care, even as she stood stark naked in the middle of the cafeteria. Then again, it was empty on account of everyone working. Misty's belly shook visibly as her stomach roared aloud. The bulbous redhead placed her thick hands on her belly, her doughy arms squishing against the fat mass as she looked down, her thick second chin, just shy of developing a third, squished down against her round fat breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still so hungry...well no one else is here, so no one would mind if I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's voice trailed off as she looked at the line of food all available, in spite of hers being the only presence here. With a cheeky grin on her plump face and hands outstretched, Misty dug into the line of foods with her hands, cramming anything and everything into her mouth as ravenously as she could manage, which still didn't feel like enough to her and her monstrous appetite. Misty's stomach roared even as food fell down her esophagus, piled in her belly and almost instantly turned into more fat, which piled onto Misty's bulky body. She started to grow more massive, to a point where it seemed like it should have been impossible for her to even move with her massive belly planted on the floor and her thick, puffy legs like massive tree trunks. But, somehow, Misty could still move, possibly fueled only by her own gluttony. And was she ever as she stuffed more food into her mouth, not even caring as juices, gravies and bits that didn't make it in her mouth fell into her folds and her rolls. Belch upon belch stormed out of her mouth with each time she opened her mouth as she continued to stuff her face and billow out further and further. Her massive belly pressed against the cafeteria line, its growing mass pushing it back as Misty ate and grew, rising closer to the ceiling with her incredible bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ulp!* BBBUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPP!! Augh, why am I still hungry!?\" Misty complained as she shook her belly, causing another belch as her now two ton form jostled and wobbled with each movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was too hungry too think and too irritated because of it to think of anything but filling up her hungry belly. Which was evident in her eating the furnishings in the cafeteria next! Sure, she could have just eaten all that food piled in her folds, but the girl's hunger made her mind go out there as tables disappeared down her gullet, tables were chewed up and swallowed like candy bars and of course, the food trays and cafeteria food line was all gobbled up. Misty devoured it all, belching the whole way and moaning in bliss as her fat filled belly wobbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OhhwoooowUUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!! It's like candy Really crunchy hard candy. BBBUUUUURRRRP!!!\" Misty moaned as she polished off another piece of aluminum she was holding in her meaty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the furnishings were gone as well. And Misty's stomach still growled, the blubbery redhead practically packed inside of the room as her fat spread outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nooo... BBBAAAAUUUUURRRRPPP!!! I need more food!\" Misty whined. She knew there had to be more, a stock room or something behind one of those doors. Misty pulled on the metal door closest to her, her thick arms pulling it off like she was peeling tape as she stuffed it down her mouth. Behind it was a massive stock room, filled with all the food this Pokemon Center kept piled high in boxes and packages. Misty felt her drool fall out of her mouth and pool inside of her multitude of chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot!!\" Misty shouted as she greedily charged forth, drool trailing behind from her open mouth as she tried to squeeze her flowing fat through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she decided to just bust the wall down with her girth, a much more successful tactic, as she waddled through the new \"doorway\" and instantly got her hands on a box of meat. Not that she cared by this point as her mind became lost to gluttony, leading her to stuff box upon box of food inside her mouth and gulp it down, fat piling on her billowing bulk, her massive fat breasts resting atop her belly as they ballooned outwards, the perky spheres swelling with fat. Misty's ass swelled outwards, sticking out further and further as it began to creepy closer to the \"door\" and knock down what little of the wall was left, bits of sheeting, drywall and such falling into Misty's flowing back folds. Misty slapped her fat belly as she packed her mouth as full of food as she could, watching it wobble in front of her while it swelled it fat, food and grease flying out was it wobbled. Misty couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pah, wonder what Ash would think now!\" The massive Misty boasted to no one in particular as she felt her grand, swelling self start to break the ceiling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That rains coming down hard...\" Ash mentioned, looking out over the hilltops. The Pokecenter was actually quite disconnected from the nearby town, which was strange all things considered. Even though it was just on the outskirts, the fact it wasn't inside the town itself was what confused Ash.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But I'm more concerned about where Misty is, she's been gone for quite a while.\" Brock stated. He looked down the route that Misty took, noting that Nurse Joy also headed down that way, \"I hope nothing bad happened to her...\"<br>\r\n\"I think she might just be having a good time at the Cafeteria.

But instead of seeing a room with tables, food and other such things, they saw a wall of fleshy fat, covering the doorway.<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Ash wondered, but soon realized it was growing larger! The two backed away, until the large wall of fat demolished the nearby wall and causing the rain to pour over Ash and Brock's head.<br>\r\nThey both looked up, and could recognize Misty's orange, spiked ponytail way up above.<br>\r\n\"But... How did this... Ngh, we need to stop her from growing!\" Ash stuttered, in disbelief he stared upwards, but knew the task at hand.

Misty raised her head, decorated by an abundance of chins and neck flab, to the sky as she collected rain water in her mouth and used her chins as basins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!\" Misty looked down and saw ash climbing through her impressive cleavage. Hey    BBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!!! Ash!\" Misty greeted cheerily with a belch, blowing drool and rainwater from her chins all over in front of her, soaking ash and his clothes with sticky fluid.  \"Hey, think you could dig around in my folds? I think there's still unfinished food in there.\" Ash took a moment to regain his composure, shaking off some of the drool. \"Misty?! What are you doing?! How did you get so...so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat?\" Misty finished his sentence for him. \"I don't know how, but It isn't it great!\" Misty said rubbing her belly, making her breasts bounce madly with ash in them. \"Great? How can you think this is great!\" Ash went on and on listing cons about her size, but misty wasn't listening. She was too enthralled in bliss as her body jiggled without the slightest provocation. Misty opened her eyes and saw ash still blathering on. She wondered what to do with him since he's not doing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lifted herself up, and moved her gigantic body upwards, Tremors spawned each step she took towards the town, while Nurse Joy and Brock look in awe at her massive ass swaying back and forth as it jiggles wildly from her fat.<br>\r\nBrock passed out from how beautiful it was, which meant it was up to Nurse Joy to stop her.

Enjoy!<br>\r\n\"A Pokemon Gaining Adventure\"<br>\r\nby Mistystuffer<br>\r\nChapter 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ash had become a Pokemon Master. He and Misty were heading back to Pallet Town for a well-deserved rest. A<br>\r\nwhile back Brock decided he'd like to head home to Pewter City to see his family so he eventually went back before Ash<br>\r\nhad become a Master. Also over the past while being alone with Ash, Misty's weight oddly shot up from her average<br>\r\nweight to about 150. One day, they were continuing through some woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, when are we gonna be there?\" Misty yelled, \"I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on, we'll be there soon. Then we can all get something to eat,\" Ash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they found their way to Celedon City. After taking their Pokemon to the nearest Pokemon Center, they<br>\r\nwent out immediately to find the nearest all-you-can-eat buffet. When they got there, Misty discovered she was<br>\r\ntotally broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was staring into his face with those cute, huge eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you buy me dinner? I'm broke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh knew he couldn't say no to those eyes and immediately gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ash!\" Misty answered happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a big hug and drug him up to the counter to pay. Within a few more seconds they were at the mega bar<br>\r\npiling food up on their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were seated at the table, Ash was careful not to move too much because he didn't want to get caught up in<br>\r\nthe frenzy that was... Misty eating. Within no time at all both had cleared their plates. After they were done,<br>\r\nthey left to pick up their Pokemon from the Pokemon Center. All the while, Ash was pleased with how he had made<br>\r\nMisty happy. Maybe doing that again would make her more happy, he thought. The stayed the night at the Pokemon Center<br>\r\nand after another meal at the restaurant they continued on. Misty, with a full stomach, was quite happy and as they<br>\r\nwalked along she was smiling, which made Ash happy. Ash decided he should treat her to a big lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we just ate an hour ago, Misty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I want food, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat down on a large tree stump as did Pikachu and he went through his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waa! There's no more food!\" Ash shouted, frantically seaching for something to eat, \"You must have eaten the rest<br>\r\nof it when we had lunch! Again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Ash Ketchum, are you saying that I'm fat and gluttonous?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at Misty. She had indeed gotten bigger since they started their journey back to Pallet. Her pants looked<br>\r\ntighter and her suspenders were beginning to hold back a small new belly she was growing. Misty looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fat aren't I?\" she inquired angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, Misty. You still look great, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked up into Ash's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Now come on, let's go find another town. Maybe there's a nice restaurant there we can eat at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled and her eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty had finally reached Saffron City. It was late afternoon and both were very tired from the walking.<br>\r\nPlus, they were starving. Despite Ash telling Misty they'd eat at a restaurant, they decided they'd eat and sleep<br>\r\nat the Pokemon Center because they were so tired. Misty wasn't tired enough to slow down her appetite, though.<br>\r\nThey soon were ready for bed after they ate. Pikachu hopped up on the bed and quickly dozed off. At that time, Misty<br>\r\nwas also putting Togepi to bed, right by hers. Soon the both of them passed out and woke around 9:00am the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Misty,\" Ash whispered, patting her on the shoulder to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?... Oh, good morning, Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, they're having eggs and bacon for breakfast; Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were downstairs in a flash. Ash had a plate of bacon and eggs but Misty had ten eggs and ten strips of<br>\r\nbacon, respectively, washing it down with half a gallon of orange juice. They soon packed their things<br>\r\nand left. Nurse Joy was almost happy to see her go. About half an hour later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" Ash asked, sweatdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, again! Do you have anything to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't have time to buy much. I have these though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... rice balls,\" Misty said, a bit sickened, \"I'm sick of eating those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't want them then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty had already finished off one and started in on another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely enough to tide Misty over and shut her up for a while, the two went on. It was nearing lunch time, and<br>\r\nAsh knew this. Before Misty said anything, he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's have lunch now,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was confused. Was he doing this for her? But she didn't want to argue, she was hungry anyway. A few minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, these sandwiches are great!\" she said, with her mouth full, \"Did you make these, Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, just for you,\" Ash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty blushed and kept munching. After Ash had eaten his sandwich and Misty ate her share (five),<br>\r\nAsh checked the food supply in his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there goes lunch for the next few days...,\" Ash said, sweatdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't care though. He'd made Misty happy yet again. He looked over at her, where she was sitting on a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa, she's really gotten bigger in the past couple months,' Ash thought 'It's weird I hadn't really noticed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty now had two wider, plumper legs, and her belly, although not too big, edged out just a slight few inches<br>\r\ninto her lap. Ash was surprised he could even see her bellybutton, which was usually covered. Her tank top was<br>\r\neven a bit tighter. Ash enjoyed looking at her now abundant curves but veered his eyes away when she looked over<br>\r\nin his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Togepi and I are ready to go,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we'll leave in a few minutes,\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter filling up their canteens with water they set off yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were soon at Cerulean City, but not before stopping at a few more towns... and a few (or more)<br>\r\nall-you-can-eat-buffets. Misty thought she'd pay her sisters and Pokemon a visit. They went right in<br>\r\nbecause it was also Misty's gym, after all. They walked around until they found three familiar figures (not Team Rocket!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's Lil Sis!\" Daisy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio ran up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, like, not 'Lil' Sis any more!\" Violet commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you sure have gotten big,\" Lily added finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty didn't like their teasing, even though this topic was new. Ash could see it in her eyes and squeezed her<br>\r\nhand. Misty smiled. Later they all caught up on recent events and Ash and Misty were able to spend the night<br>\r\nthere. They stayed in Misty's old room; Ash sleeping on the floor. Misty looked down at Ash from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, thanks for earlier,\" said Misty, \"My sisters can be so mean sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Well, I don't have any brothers or sisters or anything, but they should treat you better. I know,<br>\r\nhow about tomorrow we go out for some ice cream, maybe you'll feel better then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty thought for a second. This was the reason this problem came about, but it was ASH that was asking her...<br>\r\nhow could she say no? She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we'll go after lunch tomorrow. Goodnight, Mist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, he hardly ever calls me that,' she thought, \"Goodnight, Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty happily fell asleep, as did Ash (and the Pokemon!).</span></div></div>",

It also has the Tengu-babe Kurama, Shinobu(Ataru's original girlfriend, and the girl with super-strength for no apparent reason), the stellar biker-chick Benten, the smoking hot ice princess Oyuki, Sugary sweet Ran, the Spice girls(Sorta like a female gang of idiots, Sugar the disappearing yukionna, Ginger the catgirl who plays possum, and Pepper, who can shed her skin), the priestess with the flawless metabolism Sakura, the spoiled little rich girl Ryoko, the sheltered rich girl Asuka, Lum's uncomprehendable mother Mrs.Invader(for lack of a better name), and knowing this series I'm probably missing a few of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Ranma 1/2: The grandaddy of gender-bender comedy, and another one with a long list of characters...<br>\r\nFemale Ranma(also known as Ranco), Akane, Nabiki, Kasumi, Shampoo, Kodachi(also known as the crazy girl that almost no one cares about), Ukyo, Hinako(the mixture of lolita and bombshell, she switches between the two frequently), Mariko(Forgettable cheerleader girl), Akari(the cannon girlfriend of Ryoga, she trains sumo pigs), Azusa(the immature ice skater, who takes cute things for no reason), and as with Uresai Yatsura, I've probably glanced over a character or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Samurai Pizza Cats: Finally one that has a short list of characters... Also, since I, and probably anyone who remembers this series, has only seen the American version(I have been looking for the subbed Japanese version, but no luck), so let's use the American names, `kay?<br>\r\nPolly Esther the pink cat girl with an attitude, Francine the owner of the pizza joint and cat girl version of Nabiki(sorta), Lucille the shy girl with missiles in her hair and shoulders, Princess Vi the spoiled little bunny girl, Carla the crow girl(never watched the episodes with her, but I'm using the wiki, so I'll put her in), Deedee the American dominatrix cat girl, and Princess Vi's mother, who's name escapes me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Ghost sweeper Mikami: One of the hottest misers you will ever see, another series with a long list of characters.<br>\r\nReiko Mikami(the star herself), Okinu(the resident ghost, later on ghost sweeper student), Maria(the android girl made in ancient times), Teresa(the modern android girl), Emi(the rival ghost sweeper with dark skin, deals mostly in voodoo), Meiko(the sweet innocent girl, who controls 12 shikigami, also hinted as being a lesbian, especially for Mikami), Michie Mikami(Mikami's mother, she's still quite young, and can travel through time using lightning), Yuriko Yokoshima(the perverted apprentice's mother, a strict business woman), Hinome Mikami(Mikami's younger sister, still a baby, but we can do the old standby of time-skipping, she is also a psychokinetic, with a tendency for starting fires), Mari Ichimonji(the ex-delinquient girl friend of Okinu's), Kaori Yumi(a strict school girl from a long line of exorcists), Megumi Marin(a restaurant owner and a witch, makes magical food for her customers to fix supernatural problems), Tamamo(a nine-tailed fox girl, loves Kitsune Udon, and has been adopted by Mikami), Shiro Inuzuka(A wolf girl who acts more like a puppy, competitive with Tamamo), Shoryuki(the little Dragon Princess, spends most of her time up on top of a sacred mountain), Hyakume(the all-seeing girl, has a hundred eyes, and claims that nothing escapes her sight), Medusa(A bad-girl Dragon god, looks and acts like a dominatrix most of the time), Mephisto Pheles(Mikami Reiko's past-life, a low-class demon who fell in love with Yokoshima's past self), Luciola(A firefly-turned-demon-babe, controls light and illusions, yet another girl to fall of Yokoshima), Vespa(A wasp-turned-demon-babe, uses mostly her brute force and speed than magic, was in love with the big-bad Ashtaroth), Papilio(A butterfly-turned-demon-loli, treats Yokoshima like a pet dog), Aiko(A demon possessing a desk in Yokoshima's school, she's only interested in getting to know school life), and Kobato Hanato(a poor girl, who's been suffering with the god of poverty her whole life, until that was fixed by Yokoshima and Mikami's intervention, turning the god of poverty into a god of good luck,  the only normal girl to fall for Yokoshima).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ Other series: Need I say more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day Makoto was cleaning her attic when she found a book. It was called \"Recipes of Bliss\" and as she looked through the pages she realized it was a cook book. Though she noticed one page in the front was missing, at the time she thought it nothing of it. Little did she realize, the page missing was a warning. It stated that \"<b>These recipes are fattening, slow down metabolism, and can cause people to change in behavior.</b>\" The reason this book was in her house was because her mother bought the book before her untimely death, but after reading the warning she decided not to use it, but forgot to throw it out. Now it was in the hands of her excellent cook of a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Cool! Some new recipes. I'll use it later tonight for dinner.</i>\" Makoto thought as she took the book to her room. Later that night she did try a recipe for a cake, though she did have to admit that the recipe was strange. It required more sugar than most cakes, lots of butter, and even needed beans, gravy, and lard! \"<i>Weird recipe, but I'm might as well try it.</i>\" thought Makoto as she put the finishing touches on the cake. Soon she took a small bite out of the cake and was shocked by the taste. It was sweet and had a unique flavor that made it irresistible. It wasn't long before she ate the entire cake, even the crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all eating the cake Makoto said to herself \"That was fantastic, I've got to try another recipe tomorrow! BUUURRRRRRPPPPPP!\" normally Makoto would have been embarrassed by such a large burp from her, yet she wasn't. She thought it was because she was alone, but wasn't aware that it was slowly changing her personality. She even went to bed earlier than she usually would, but it was because she was so tired. Soon she fell asleep and began to have a strange dream. In it she was surrounded by food and there was a enormous version of the cake she ate fifteen minutes ago. She began eating all of the food with out a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater... </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Makoto woke up the next morning, with a mighty yawn. When she began to stir she recalled her dream form last night. Her whole dream was about her eating nothing but fattening goodies. She thought it was only a dream from eating her cake last night and nothing more. Even though she chose to dismiss last night\u2019s dream, she admitted to herself that she never had a dream like that before, it as such a bizarre yet surprisingly delightful dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Makoto noticed the clock in her room. Even though Makoto had gone to bed early last night, she slept in until noon. Luckily for her it was early summer so she could sleep in if she wanted to. Still Makoto had never slept in like this before in her life. Yet Makoto was surprising nonchalant about sleeping in. Normally she would never allow her self to sleep in so much and waste part of the day in bed. Today was different though, for some reason Makoto did not feel like herself. It was as if a part of her conscience decided to relax and take the day off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that was different from her normal was that instead of changing into her pajamas last night, she wore her clothes from last night to bed. At first when Makoto noticed this she thought \u201cI never changed!?! How embarrassing. I\u2019d better change into some clean clothes.\u201d she thought to herself. Then another thought entered her head \u201cWait, I don\u2019t need to go anywhere today. I could just stay home and make some more of those recipes. So why should I change my clothes? It\u2019s not like I need to dress up and impress someone. I guess one day of wearing the same clothes again isn\u2019t going to hurt.\u201d Then a growl from her stomach ended Makoto\u2019s previous thought and she walked downstairs to get some more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she pulled out the \u201cRecipes of Bliss\u201d cook book and looked through the pages to find a new recipe. This time a chocolate cupcake recipe caught her interest and she began to cook. The cupcakes in the book were double the size of average cupcakes and the book recommended making two dozen cupcakes. Like the last recipe, Makoto added all the very unhealthy ingredients like beans, lard, and gravy. After a short half hour the cupcakes were done and Makoto tried them. Like the cake, the cupcakes had a flavor that was a mix between tangy, greasy, and sugary and that was too delicious to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen while eating the cupcakes she noticed the TV in her den. She then decided that she could enjoy her cupcakes in front of the TV. She hadn\u2019t watched TV in awhile so it might be interesting to see what\u2019s on the news. When she turned the television on, the news came on. As she watched the news, it got less and less interesting. It was all nothing but updates on the economy and small incidents that Makoto could care less about. Eventually she decided to change the channel and watch something else. Then she changed the channel to some silly cartoon. At first she thought watching a dumb cartoon was a waste of time and was about to change the channel, yet as she watched it she began to enjoy it. The humor was funny and simple to follow and the cartoon characters were entertaining in their unique style. She decided that she would eat her cupcakes while watching this show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the show she enjoyed eating her cupcakes. The taste of the cupcakes and funny cartoon were creating a surprisingly cozy experience for Makoto as she ate her cupcakes. The TV made it hard for her to think about anything but the cartoon she was watching. Her cupcakes helped her enter a state of rapture while she watched the show. She was so engrossed by the television and her food she didn\u2019t even notice what was coming out of her mouth. As Makoto watched the television, drool had formed around her mouth. The more she watched television the more the flow of drool began to increase. Not only was there drool, but whenever she laughed at something funny on the show, crumbs and pieces of food came out of her mouth. Soon her clothes were covered in food stains and small drops of saliva. She also had not noticed that she had gained at least ten pounds from the cake and cupcakes. Makoto didn\u2019t care though, she was too happy to indulge in her food and TV. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Makoto got up out of bed at around 1 PM, excited to see what other foods she would try in the book. She was going to change her clothes, but after she found out her washing machine was broken, she just shrugged and figured she would take care of it later. She hadn't showered since the other day either since she figured it would be a waste of time in these clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the book in her sweaty, dirty clothes, she licked her lips at some of the suggestions. Strawberry cake, candy hot dogs, sweet soda... she knew one of these days she'd have to hold a feast for her friends. But for now, she had to try some of these out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interested in the sugar dumplings today. This recipe required a whole bag of sugar, six bottles of syrup, two servings of olive oil and ten cans of beans! She was surprised at how daunting it was, but had to try it anyways. After getting the ingredients, she mixed it all together, cooked the dumplings for thirty minutes, and took them with her to the couch. With fifty dumplings cooked, she had enough to last her a day, or even more! She flicked on the TV, excited for the marathon of a cute cartoon she had been enjoying. It was made for really young girls, but she had been entertained by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out the first dumpling and took a big bite. She groaned with her mouth full at how good the dumpling tasted. The syrup brought out a sugary flavor and the oily crumbs stook to her mouth. PHHHHHHHHFRT! She blushed when she realized that she farted really loudly, but forgot about it quickly after something funny happened on the cartoon. Finishing the first one, she took another one out and began shoving it into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it wouldn't hurt enjoying myself for another day,\" she thought.</span></div></div>",

This morning was a little different since she did decided that she would try to eat something healthy after eating nothing but unhealthy snacks for the past few days. So she thought \"I can't believe I ate nothing but the food from my recipe book. Those recipes can't be healthy, judging from the ingredients. I should eat something healthy today, like some cereal  with milk.\" Soon Makoto went down the stairs to get a healthy breakfast, even though it's past breakfast time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the bottom of the stairs, she went straight towards the kitchen and grabbed a large bowl from the pantry. Soon she grabbed the milk and cereal and filled the bowl and began eating immediately. When she ate her cereal she didn't use a spoon, she actually dipped her hand into the cereal and pulled out the cereal and brought it to her mouth. Because she ate like this, milk leaked through her hands and spilled on to her clothes, making her clothes even worse since she still hadn't washed them in days. She didn't seem to notice though, for some reason it felt as if she always ate food with her hands instead of utensils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her bowl of cereal in a matter of minutes, yet when she was finished she was still hungry. \"Weird. I just ate a large bowl of cereal and I'm still hungry. Maybe I'm just think I'm still hungry.\" thought Makoto as she went into her den to watch some more TV. Her TV time was interrupted thought when she heard a loud growl come from her stomach. \"Huh? I guess I am still hungry. One more bowl of cereal wouldn't hurt.\" Makoto told herself as she returned to the kitchen. She filled her bowl with cereal and milk again, and just like before she ate with her hands instead of spoons. She finished her second bowl and still wasn't satisfied. She tried again with another bowl of cereal, and again she was still craving more food. She kept trying to give her self a healthy breakfast by giving herself more cereal until the cereal box was empty. \"That box must have been almost empty. I'm still hungry.\" she thought not realizing that the box was new and full when she had her first bowl.\"How about I try some strawberries instead.\" Makoto then grabbed a bag of strawberries and ate them quickly. Like the cereal, by the time she finished them she was still hungry. Soon she raided her fridge for anything healthy, hoping to satisfy her hunger, but nothing helped. She tried various fruits and vegetables or anything else healthy, but nothing filled her bottomless pit of a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can believe I'm still hungry, why am I still hungry? Wait, maybe because it's past breakfast time! I must be hungry for lunch too.\" thought Makoto as she noticed the \"Recipes of Bliss\" book on her kitchen counter. \"Guess I couldn't hurt to try more recipes from that cook book.\" Little did she realize that the next recipe she picked would change her even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter following the recipe exactly, Makoto made some...      </span></div></div>",

She took it out of the oven as she marveled at the large, chocolate cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.... this looks so good!\" she thought. Instead of cutting off a small slice, she cut off a large quarter of the cake and took it out to the couch, without even taking along a plate or utensils. As she watched her favorite cartoon, she took a large bite and chewed on the chocolate cake, as crumbs fell upon her ruined clothing. PHHHFRRRRRT! She let loose a huge fart, but didn't really notice as she giggled at a joke with cake stuffed into her mouth. She at the rest of the cake chunk while watching the show, finishing up with a satisfied burp as she wiped her messy fingers on her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, I'm still quite hungry\" she thought. She got up and walked to the kitchen to get another slice, but felt that it was too tiring to keep walking like that and that she'd rather sit on the couch all day. With a great plan in mind, she took the rest of the cake with her, along with a full 24-pack of coke she had in the fridge. She sat on the crumby couch as she bit into the large cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate through the cake for another hour, her belly protuded quite heavily. Now with 50 extra pounds, the flab was starting to stretch out of her shirt. She was also farting much more, but it didn't bother her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to finish the cake, as she gulped down a can of coke in one take, letting some of it dribble down her mouth to her stomach without a second thought. She burped as she tossed the can to her side. Yawning, she started feeling really tired, even after only being awake for a couple hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a nap...\" she said as she passed out on her couch.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't explain why, it just felt almost like an instinct that took over in an instant. Luckily for her there was a mirror nearby, so naturally she went to go look at herself. After looking in the mirror, she finally noticed how much she had let her self go over the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she realized was that she had gained weight after all that eating. The most noticeable feature of her gain was her belly that had rolls of fat that stretched a couple inches past her waist. Her once flat belly had become a large sphere that was big enough to jiggle with every couple of steps she took. Her face had also become more round with chubby cheeks and the beginning of a second chin. She also noticed that her cleavage had dramatically increased as well. Makoto guessed that she was at least over 200 pounds now. It was shocking that her clothes hadn't rip yet from all this gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her clothes, Makoto noticed the shabby state her clothes were in. There were stains almost everywhere making Makoto look as if she hadn't washed her clothes for a couple of months. Plus even though her clothes haven't ripped yet, it was clear that the clothes were having trouble  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto was repulsed by how disgusting she had gotten... for a about a second! A part of her told her that she looked good like this. \"Wow! Look at me! My breasts are way bigger than before and I've got a soft belly to give belly massages. I might have to go out and get some new clothes though, I have a feeling that I need something bigger for my new look. First I'll get a snack.\" Makoto didn't even question how she got so fat and lazy suddenly or why she liked how she looked now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Makoto finished her latest concoction from the book and sat on the couch and re-continued watching cartoons. Soon Makoto decided...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

They'd probably want to make her lose weight and clean her up. Plus they out number her, so even if she said no they'd be able to over power her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Unless</b> she had at least one person join her! If just one of her friends joined her, it would be much more difficult for the other scouts to try and change her and whoever joins her back to normal. The maybe the two of them could eventually convince the others join them. If she invited one of them over for about a week, they'd probably be just like her by the end of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question was who should join her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Usagi? Usagi does like to eat sweets and isn't very active. She would probably be the most likely to adjust to Makoto's new lifestyle the quickest. Though Luna the cat might try to persuade Usagi against it... unless Makoto uses a recipe  she saw. It was a recipe for cooking fish with lots of butter and gravy.

This ghost was an overweight woman who was wearing clothes that were obviously too tight on her, had very messy green hair, and looked like she never bathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just sleeping!\" the woman said. \"Why are you... *huff*... chasing me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because you were terrorizing everyone who worked there?\" Danny quipped back. \"How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I can't... *huff* have some fun?\" She said, getting very tired from her flight. \"Boy, I need rest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to fly away from Danny, but she was just getting more and more tired while he pressed on. She needed somewhere to hide while she got her strength back, but she couldn't find anywhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw someone, a young girl about the age of fourteen, dressed in black clothes. \"Okay, I'll hide in her until I get my strength back. Now I just need a distraction...\" the ghost said. She mustered up some energy to fire a ghost ray at a streetlight, darkening the entire street. Danny now couldn't see anything of what was happening as the ghost jumped into Sam's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny raised a glowing hand to see Sam. \"Hey, where did that ghost go?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I thought I just saw it...\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever. She wasn't that big of a deal anyway.\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Sam then began to walk back home. Inside Sam, the ghost smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, its nice in here.

I'd better hurry home and get to bed.\" Sam said to herself as she approached her house. All she cared about right now was going to bed, even though it was hours before her regular bed time. The reason why she was so tired was because the ghost was sleeping inside her. This ghost wasn't a very powerful one so it didn't have complete control over Sam's mind, but it did influence Sam by what ever she did in her body. If the ghost was hungry, Sam would also be hungry, if the ghost was sleepy, Sam was sleepy. Anything the ghost did inside her head had effects on Sam, and Sam can't do anything about it. There were only a few things the ghost couldn't make Sam do, like force her to attack people she cared for or alter her memories. Though, that could change depending on how long the ghost stays in Sam's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Sam feel asleep, her dream began to fuse with the ghost's dream. In the dream Sam was in a place that looked like part of the ghost zone. What made this place different from most areas of the ghost zone was that it seemed more quiet and peaceful. That wasn't the only difference though, Sam looked around and noticed she was surrounded by tons of junk food. Then out of no where the ghost from the mattress factory appeared and began devouring the junk food in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! You're that ghost from that factory. Why did you bring me to the ghost zone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't. You're dreaming, we're not in the ghost zone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've never had a dream like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, don't worry it's just a dream. Not all dreams have to make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam did admit that this did seem a little too weird to be real. Why would she be in this place with a ghost that isn't attacking her, plus another strange thing she noticed was that she couldn't help but stare at the food. She would never crave any of this junk food normally, but it just looked so good, it had to be a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost couldn't help but notice Sam staring at the food. \"Go ahead, eat it! I'm not gonna stop you.\" said the ghost as she handed Sam a bag of potato chips from her pile of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Sally Slobby. Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Sam.\" am said in a friendly tone while she thought to herself \"Sally Slobby? That sounds so cheesy, this has to be a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the brief introduction, Sam opened her bag of chips. It wasn't long before she grabbed huge handfuls to consume as many chips as possible. Soon the bag was empty and she reached for any other piece of unhealthy food within her grasp. She also didn't realize that because their dreams had merged, the pleasure the ghost felt from eating was also the pleasure Sam felt. The whole dream was nothing but the two of them eating anything but healthy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough all good things must come to an end. Eventually Sam woke up from her dream, though she did sleep in until noon(it's summer vacation so she doesn't have to go to school for awhile). This morning would be different from normal though because Sam...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

She had joined the Turtles in their hideout as they had another pizza night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, cheer up April!\" Leonardo said, \"You don't have to get dragged into our troubles too much now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know,\" she replied as she slightly nibbled on a pizza, \"But I'm gonna be stuck at home for a while, nobody's hiring news reporters right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rush?\" added Donatello, \"You can relax at home in the meantime! Throw parties whenever you want.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs April chewed on her pizza as Donatello rambled on, suddenly a thought came to her. Her eyes glazed wide open as a big smile came to her face. She got up and grabbed five pizza boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...go to the zoo, buy a dog....\" Donatello continued as April took a box he was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you don't mind me taking these back home!\" she said as she ran out, \"I'll pay you guys back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of the Turtles looked on in confusion to April's odd behavior, as Donatello still chattered on without seeing her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril ran into her apartment excited, closing the door behind her and licking her lips. Finally, eating freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down, opened one box and took out a huge slice, shoving it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't have to worry about what I eat...\" she thought, \"Finally, all that I can eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the news reporter for so many years she had to watch her eating habits and how she ate. Now, she was free to do whatever she wanted. She already finished three slices at this point and was starting on a fourth. Cheese began to drip on her yellow suit, as she devoured more of the slices like a shark. Within a blink of an eye, she finished an entire pizza. Mouth full of cheese, and messy clothing, let her a little blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am a little messy,\" she thought, \"But still more pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened a seocnd box and went straight in...</span></div></div>",

Luckily she had a few slices of pizza left over from yesterday, which were good enough for breakfast. Of course she didn't realize that eating too much pizza can build up some serious gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPFFFFRRRRTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! was that me?\" April had never farted that loud before, then again she never ate five boxes of pizza at once before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she forgot about her fart though as she suddenly realized she was hungry.

But where am I going to go eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril wasn't sure where to go for lunch. She had heard of a new restaurant in town that sounds interesting, but she wasn't sure what food they served.

They must've been off fighting somewhere, she thought. Spitting the gum out and putting it on her suit leg for later, she looked around for any leftover pizza boxes. After several minutes searching, it looked pretty empty around, except for some cans of soda that she entirely drank up while looking. Burping as she threw a can behind her, April sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more pizza here...\" she whined. Suddenly, she heard some footsteps. She hid behind a couch in case it was the Turtles and after the steps walked off, she got up and saw a stack of twenty pizza boxes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be their delivery\" she thought. Drooling at the sight of the cheese and grease, she snatched up all the boxes. Reaching in her pocket, she took out a fifty dollar bill and placed it on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll cover that!\" she smirked as she ran out of the sewers with the boxes, back to chewing on the old flavorless gum.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nora Valkyrie was bored. And if there was anything in the world that she hated, it was that. However, this was not the simple kind of boredom that training, going out somewhere or stuffing her faces with Ren's delicious pancakes would help. No, this was a far worse kind of boredom. Nora was bored of how, despite the lengths that she went to to get her childhood friend and crush, Lie Ren, to recognise that she had feelings for him, he never seemed to pick up on a single one of her hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was tired of booping Ren on the nose and hoping he realised what that meant. She had been struck by inspiration. Nora had decided that, in order to get Ren to properly notice her, she would have to appeal to his tastes more. The only problem was that Nora had no idea what Ren's tastes actually <i>were</i>. Regardless, this was where she'd put her plan into action. Nora's first move would be to sweep Ren's section of the JNPR dorm room and see if there was anything there that would tip her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora reasoned that Ren probably wouldn't have something that would tip her off obviously lying around somewhere, and she couldn't find whatever she was looking for without searching around and causing any onlookers to immediately have questions about what she was doing, which she hardly wanted to disclose,. It would probably be for the best to wait until the dorm was empty. There was one problem, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorm was not currently empty. Nora, despite of her train of thought, couldn't stand the thought of waiting any longer to find out how to best please Ren. Luckily for her, Pyrrha had taken out Jaune to see a show, in a bid to finally get him to realise she liked him, and team RWBY was off on the town for the night, leaving her alone in the dorm with Ren. Nora gulped, trying to best think of a way to get Ren out of the dorm for long enough for her to find out what she was missing. Perhaps she could ask him to make her Pancakes? No, Ren had made so many pancakes for her that he'd got it down to an art, he'd be back in five minutes, tops. Nora needed a surefire way of keeping Ren out of the dorm long enough so that she could see if there were any clues for her. That's when it struck her. The perfect plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Reeeeeeennnnnn?\" Nora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from a book he was reading, Ren responded \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that?\" Nora inquired, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching his head in a confused manner, Ren responded \"Hear what, Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora grinned as she bit her lip, lifted her leg up and grunted, before....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Ripping an absolutely deafening fart. Nora laughed, looking at Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That! Did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen chuckled slightly, before looking at Nora. Nora was shocked by Ren laughing about her flatulence, she'd expected him to be grossed out by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I not hear tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen was interrupted by a cough as TD covered his nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! Nora, that stinks! I'll be outside if you need me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen left the room quickly, as Nora smiled. Her plan had worked perfectly. Now that she had evacuated Ren from the room with her flatulence, Nora shut the door and began searching the room. First she searched Ren and Jaune's shared closet, finding nothing. Nora realised that if Ren had anything to hide, it would not be in such an obvious spot.  Nora decided to skip places like Ren's drawer and instead looked under his bed, finding a safe. Nora took the safe out from under the bed, shaking it and realising that there was definitely something  inside. Nora tried several combinations, before eventually, the lock clicked after Nora entered her own birthday, surprising her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why's Ren's safe combination my birthday? Eh, it's not that weird, we have been friends since forever, I guess. Anyway, Open Sesame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora pushed open the safe, looking inside to find a magazine with a woman in a swimsuit on the front. One thing, however, took Nora by surprise. The woman on the cover had a big round belly that she held in a seductive pose. Nora could tell that she wasn't pregnant and that that belly was pure fat. Nora smiled, cooing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, soooo.... You're into big girls, huh, Rennie? So, all those times you gave me all the pancakes I could eat? Well, if it's what Ren likes, then I'll just have to pack my belly full of food until it's as round as a beach ball! Actually....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora stopped and ran her fingers over her trim abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a big, round belly does sound <i>very</i> nice.... So, Ren wants a girl with a big belly, and I want Ren <i>and</i> I wanna have a big belly, so the only question is what I'm waiting for... Heh, 'weight'-ing for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting away Ren's magazine, Nora decided to...</span></div></div>",
