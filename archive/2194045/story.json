Those are the only things that ever make crazy claims like this flyer for making lots of money and fast. That is all you could keep thinking as the bus continued down the road. You had to at least see it for yourself. Worst case, you go right back home on the same bus. Best case? You stop having to worry about your money for a while. It would be nice to be able to pamper yourself for a while. Heck maybe this can be more than a one off thing if its really worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus pulls up to a stop and there is a jolt rocking you out of your thoughts. You look out the window and see a rather clean and appealing looking building. With how most of these get rich quick offers go, they either do it at cheap buffets or hotel presentation rooms if they are aiming for a richer group. This place was neither of those. You got up and walked down the bus, constantly looking out as you moved. The place had a gated entrance, tall clean looking building with lots of windows, with the sun's glare though you couldn't see into them. Had to assume they were just office rooms, or the richest hotel rooms you've seen in this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get off the bus and approach the gate. There is a little comm system, you buzzed at it and spoke into it \"I'm here about the flyer? Some sorta job?\" With a delay you hear a buzzing as the gates slide open. You see no guards or anything, but it didn't look unsafe, it was really inviting with lush grass and other plants inside the gated area. You walk through and head to the main building. Behind you the gates slide back shut. You go through the main glass doors and up to the front counter, presenting the flyer to the lady behind the desk.</span></div></div>",

Jobs don't want to promote or hire in new people, the cost of living and getting around are soaring higher and higher. You struggle to make ends meet and one day you spot an odd flyer while waiting for the bus. Taking it home, its an offer for a very high paying gig. It seems too good to be true, but it doesn't give much details on the flyer.  The next morning you head on the bus and go to the building listed. How bad could it really be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you don't know is that the place you are going to uses tricky legal wavers that allow them to test different things on you, or basically do any medical test they wish for a time period. Your character will be too impatient to read the whole thing and agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrimary focus is on pregnancy related themes.</td>",
