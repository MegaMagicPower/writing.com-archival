Along the way the Delinquent Teacher becomes the head of a Cooking Club to show her students how to run a Bake Sale at an upcoming Evil Academy Event.

Every Prinni tried to find a hide spot from Demonlord Etna, who was mad as hell. The reason for this was, that Laharl called her flatchest. So the Prinnis hide themself to avoid the wrath of their master. But Etna didn't hunt them down to calm her anger. She went to her room, closed the door with all her might and laid down on her bed. \"Stupid prince and his insults. I'm equaly strong as him, but he still calls me names for my figure. If there is a way to change this, I will use it.\" She looked around her room and noticed, that a book fell out of the bookshelf and laid opened on the floor. So she rose up to put the book back in the shelf, however she didn't put it back, because the pages she saw, wakened up her interst. \"Mh, a genie, which grants any wish you give it. This could be usefull.\" Etna started to pack up her items and equipment for her journey. \"Well time to search for this wishgranter.\" She sneaked out the castle and went to the dimensiongate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo started her journey to get her dreams fullfilled. On her way Etna overcame many hazards. She fought on her quest against demons, dragons and some angels. But after one and half week she reached her goal. It was a cave with many traps inside. However those weren't a obstacle for Etna. At the end of the cave there was a padestol with a small bottle standing on it. She picked it up and rubbed it. After a second the genie came out. It was a muscular man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the genie of the bottle, who grants 3 wishes for his master.\" said the genie.<br>\r\n\"3 wishes? In the book were one wish per person mentioned, but who cares.\" Etna responded.<br>\r\nThe genie ignored this and asked: \"What is your first wish, my master?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I wish for..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw her boobs growing at slow but steady pace. Etna poked her breast to feel, if they were real and was met with the feeling of flesh. However she wasn't overjoyed about this and looked at the genie again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, I don't want to spent the rest of the day here just to grow some breast.\" Etna said in anger.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, my master? Didn't I grant you your wish?\" The genie questioned.<br>\r\n\"Well yes, you did. But could you increase their growth speed a lot?\" Etna answered.<br>\r\n\"I can do it, but it is dangerous, because they can overshoot their size and you might feel something, what you maybe don't like.\" said the genie while scratching his head.<br>\r\n\"Just do it. I don't care, if they get bigger than wanted.\" Etna said and stomped on the ground.<br>\r\n\"You're the master\" was his answer and the genie snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Etna felt something strange in her tennisballsized boobs. It felt like hands were moving under her skin massaging her breast but also pushing her skin and flesh. Her breast grew like a ballon filing up by a air. She had grin on her face, but it faded away and was a replaced by slutty face. Her mouth was wide open with her tongue hanging out and moaning loudly. The reason for this was, that the feeling in her breast gave her so much pleasure, as if she had sex in the way she wanted. And this pleasure got only better with every increace of her breast size, which grew at a rapid speed. At the size of honeymelons Etna fall on her butt and had an orcasm, because her pleasure reached the climaxpoint and her legs lost all their strength. She also started fondling her boobs without even noticing. Three minutes after this her brastrap broke, which showed her now basketball chest in all their glory. Everything felt like an eternity for Etna, who was lost in pleasure. This continued for 8 minutes, while she had three more orgasms. The last one being the strongest, when her chest reached their goal. She was exhausted and panting with her breast moving up and down with every breath she took. After two minutes of resting she looked down. Her eyes widened, when she saw her breast, which were the size of huge pumpking, but they were firm and didn't sag. She stood up, while her breast reached below her waist. Because of this she had to lean against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, you were right, when you said, that they overshoot. Man are they heavy.\" Etna said.<br>\r\n\"Do wish to shrink them, my master?\" the genie questioned.<br>\r\n\"Nope, somehow I like this size. I just wish, that my ass was the size of volleyballs with fitting hips to balance my breast out.\" Etna said as a comment, but realised, what she had said. \"Oh, no.\"<br>\r\n\"Your wish is granted.\"the genie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever within seconds her ass balloned out and her hips widend to their desired size.

Being something close to what humans would call a \"king\" or \"queen\" an Overlord takes hold of the chaos that is their Netherworld and uses their great power to mold it into what they see fit. Though many Overlord's exist to govern and rule over demons within their Netherworlds, only a few have stood out as truly unique among the bunches of noble demonic lords within the cosmos. The legend of Overlord Zenon is one of those unique demon nobles, her ruthlessness shaking the hearts of countless demons and adding 99 of them to the list of Overlords she has slaughtered. This is where one demoness' story begins, the tale of \"Overlord Rozalin\". Born with the soul of Zenon resting within her own, Rozalin held potential to become as strong an Overlord as she was in her previous life. Though, this fate would not be realized until sometime during her youth when a powerful Overlord attacked her village of the Snow Clan. In a fit of panic of seeing her loved ones brutally massacred, the dormant power of the Overlord God awakened as a frightful response to get rid of the powerful demon slaughtering her family and friends. Miraculously, the powerful Overlord was slain from Zenon's awakening but, the ending was far from happy. The demon's raid on the village was catastrophic, the vast majority of the village being wiped out in that short time the assailant ravaged the peaceful snowy residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened, traumatized and alone, Rozalin wandered the ruins of her former home, unknowing of where she should go and where her fate would lie. Fortunately, Rozalin's life would not be spent in the voided state it was in. Followers of the very demon who attacked the village, and claimed to be the True Zenon, would arrive on the scene after realizing their master had yet to return from a raid on the village he set to destroy. Scouring the ruins of the village, the demons would not have to look far to find their late master dead within the destroyed remnants of an oriental mansion. Being the sole survivor wandering the ruins, Rozalin was the only suspect of the murder of \"Zenon\" however, instead of exacting revenge, the demons realized a disconcerting oddity. No mere child could defeat an Overlord . Was the culprit still at large...or was it truly Rozalin who killed \"Zenon\"? These questions buzzed through the minds of the demonic entourage but, no answer to them would readily reveal itself to them without further investigation. Realizing the dilemma of not having an Overlord, it was then decided by the leader of the search party that the lone Rozalin would be taken in and raised in \"Zenon's\" stead as the new Overlord... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years have passed since that fateful day... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rising of the morning, a new day on Rozalin's life as Overlord begins once again as her eyes flutter open from the fleeting loss of slumber that had once embraced her through the night. The blonde noble murmured lazily as she slowly arose from the soft covers of the immense canopy bed she rested within. With a soft yawn, Rozalin set forth to begin her day, seeing as her ability to sleep was now effectively lost to her. Sliding out of her bed, Rozalin made her way to the closest window and pulled open the crimson curtains to reveal the shining visage of the outside world. The view from her high rising window, while wonderful, showed her the unusual crystalline landscape below gleaming and sparkling in the rising sun. It often reminded her somewhat of the icy terrain back at her former home though, thinking back on it usually brought forth gruesome memories she had tried much of her childhood to repress and move forward from. Taking only another moment to bath her nightgown clad form in the morning rays of the sun, Rozalin's pointed ears perked as the sound of a rapping against the oak doors to her bedroom . It seems her servants were already active, their duties normally having them up earlier to rise than she ever could on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Rozalin, are you awake?\" A masculine voice called from behind the closed doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Just a moment and I'll be right with you.\" The blonde demoness responded, hastily making her way to her wardrobe to find a frilled rob of red silk to drape across her buxom frame. The nightwear Rozalin donned throughout the night was quite comfortable during these warm months though, she found it gave very little to the imagination thanks to her large, hefty bosom and wide, curvy hips swelling out her nightly outfit. Not wanting to keep her servant waiting for much longer, Rozalin pulled the door open to peer outside and find one of her trusted guards, a demon of the <i>Bouncer</i> profession. Though not as tall as those who usually took up the class as a Bouncer, the male demon was still dressed as sharply as one. The demon bodyguard being outfitted in a red tuxedo and a long, black tie wrapped across the collar of his white dress shirt located beneath. Unlike most Bouncers within Rozalin's regime, this one sported a tail that was similar to that of a Beastmaster's. The demon's eyes were slit thin and bright orange in color, belaying the usual trait of Bouncers, while his hair was an odd shade of pale green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast is almost ready and I thought it'd be best to let you know.\" The tailed bouncer informed the blonde demoness. \"Though...you look like you're still getting ready for the day. So, I can tell the cook to hold off a little while longer if you want me to.\" The bodyguard rarely saw his superior's blonde hair undone, so to see her with it down usually indicated just how early he was in checking up on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that would be nice. Thank you, Rubicante. Have the chef prepare my favorite meal for this morning when you had back.\" Rozalin nodded with a faint smile, though, she did not retreat back into her room to get dressed. Instead, the Overlord appeared to hesitate in adding on to her request, Rubicante tilting his head slightly as she appeared to ready to speak on something but, looked apprehensive on airing out whatever was on her mind..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\" The bodyguard inquired, Rozalin shaking her head as she brushed a stray bang of her hair from her face. The overlord opened her mouth to belay Rubicante's worries but, her slender tummy roiled with a loud, rolling grumble of ravenous intent. Silence soon befell the atmosphere between them as Rozalin's fair cheeks burned bright red, her hand hesitantly rubbing on her empty belly. Rubicante didn't seem very disconcerted by the gastric calling for food and merely chuckled as he realized the source of Rozalin's hesitation. \"If you're hungrier than usual, I can simply tell the cook to work up more dishes for you. No shame in that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but try not give me <i>too</i> much, okay?\" Rozalin answered, \"I maybe a bit more peckish than I normally am but, I do want to watch this figure of mine. As an Overlord, one must keep up their appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're going to get fat from just having a big breakfast...\" Rubicante pointed out matter of factly, Rozalin's sharp eyes flattening the gaze on him as she placed her hands akimbo.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rubicante...\" Rozalin's stern tone snapped the bodyguard back from his words, his hands raised in defense. \"You can never be too careful with such delicious foods. I could have a big breakfast one minute and the next thing I know, I can barely see past my feet the next day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Lady Rozalin that's not...\" Rubicante began to press the subject how many calories she'd need to consume just to end up as a fatty the next day but, the bodyguard found it best not to question his mistress more than twice today. Rozalin may be a proud and haughty demoness but, her mind was a bit closed up thanks to her rarely leaving the castle. According many of her older servants, Rozalin rarely ventured out much of the castle during her days of growing up here and, overtime, she's somewhat adapted to being confined in her mansion and rarely having much initiative to leave. \"E-err...nevermind. I'll have Zao prepare your meal as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid. I'll be right down once I've gotten dressed for the day.\" Rozalin turned to return to her quarters, dismissing Rubicante and setting forth to begin her day. Her belly roaring for food as she took a few more steps into her room halted the overlord in her tracks, Rozalin pausing to pat her impatient belly. \"...This is most unusual...\" She muttered, rummaging in her wardrobe to find an outfit for the day to come... </span></div></div>",

However, while this appears to be a sound plan, there exists a slight problem that may prove to derail Stella's intentions; the fact that someone around the school is proliferating the growth of a new club known as the \"<i>Junk Food Brigade</i>\" and is causing many of the female students to grow chubby and lethargic.

Is it because Desco is too small and skinny to be feared as a final boss? Or maybe it's due to her not having enough 'minions' and thus requires her to spawn more of them?
