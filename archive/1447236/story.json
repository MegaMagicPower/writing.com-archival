Suddenly, a bandit crept up behind him. \"Erk! Look out behind you!\" You shouted.

Let's get out of here before we get involved, Serra,\" Erk suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to fail to meet Lyn and the others, you refuse, \"But Erk, what if they need our help?

I, it's nothing, Erk... Do you think we should help them fight those bandits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you can refer to them as 'weak,' Serra. There are knights and a pegasi rider. I think they can take care of  those bandits by themselves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you two doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, a man had already shouting behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, they find us.

Prepare to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then charged at Erk with his axe. It grazed Erk's shoulder, before he quickly countered with his fire magic. The man got burned badly and crawling away while screaming in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Erk?\" you said rather concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just a small cut\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, you saw Lyn coming towards both of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You turned on your GBA and start to play your favorite game \"Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade\". Yeah, the game is old, but you didn't care much about that, since despite of being old this game was made in old school ways. It was hard, and despite being published in 2003 this game was really beautifully made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to play 10 chapter of the game,which was the last one in \"Lyn's story.\" Being kind of a tutorial, it wasn't that hard, so you quickly progressed through it. But before Lyn finished off Lundgren, something strange happened to you. Your body turned into a liquid, and you were then sucked into the game. The next thing you knew was that you'd been transported to some kind of a hall. You found that had a full 360 degrees view, as if you had eyes all over your body and... you were a slime. You would surely have screamed if you had a mouth, but then you heard a sound of clashing steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious of what was happening outside the castle, you started moving to window, it didn't take you long to get used to your new appearance, and soon enough, you could move with a pretty decent speed for a creature of your size. Getting to the window also wasn't a challenge, since you could stick to the walls. You got to there right on time to see Lyndis kill Lundgren. Realizing that soon enough they'd all be running through the hall, you decided to hide somewhere safe, so you squeezed your body under the closest door, which turned out to be a pretty small room, with only a bed, a bookshelf, a wall mirror, and a table. You decided that the higher you got, the safer you would be, so you began scaling the bookshelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally made it to the bookshelf, you began to analyze everything that happened to you. 'After defeating Lundgren, the game's story skips an entire year! What am I supposed to do? And why I have turned in to the liquid? This all doesn't make any sense! I need to find a way to return back to my normal life!' You thought in panic. You were so distraught by the situation that you wore yourself out and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you regained consciousness, you realized a few things, first, it's late at night, maybe 1.00 or 2.00 a.m. , second, you were no longer alone, as there was a figure laying on the bed. The one who lay on the bed was Lyn herself. You took some time to look at her, than jumped from bookshelf. If you were still a human, you would have dropped dead, but for a slime, as you now were, it wasn't a problem at all. You started moving up on the bed, and saw Lyndis's face. Here body was covered, so you started to slip through a slit, making your way to her lower half. You stopped when you reached her vagina. Turns out that, that the Lady of the Plains sleeps fully naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt an uncontrollable urge to get in her pussy. You hesitated a little, then decided to move. Slowly, still unsure of what you were trying to accomplish, you slipped inside of her. You heard Lyndis make a quick moan, as you slipped inside her. You trying to move slower so as not to wake her up, but with every move you made, you could hear her moaning from pleasure, the walls of her inside started to squish you harder, and then...you awoke. It took you only a short moment to realize that you could feel your hands and feet again, although more slender, and when you got up from the bed, you felt a heavy weight on your shoulders as a pair breasts jiggled with every move. You were Lyn! You decided to...</span></div></div>",

You immerse yourself in the story, picking up just after the harsh battle upon landing your ship in Rausten. You go about marshaling your troops, getting new weapons for your characters, and before you know, you're engrossed in the game. You're focused so intensely that you only barely notice that your vision is starting to blur around the edges and your body is sagging unusually heavily into the couch cushions. By the time you realize it, your left hand slips off of the D-pad and onto the screen, collapsing into a bright purple liquid in front of your very eyes. You try to scream, but you only gargle as your face falls forward and your world goes black inches away from the small screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain consciousness at the base of a large tree, surrounded by tall grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Odd.' You think, considering that the grass is too tall for you to see over. Only then do you realize that you're looking from only inches above the ground. You cast about, but all you can seem to find are little extensions of the purple goo, not your hands, your feet, or any part of your body. 'I must be losing my mind.' You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay still for a moment longer, but get bored and decide to look around, see what you can see. You need a higher vantage, so you look up at the tree. You find you can move yourself, more by just flowing over the ground than anything else. This concerns you. Up a few feet, clinging to the tree, you take a look around. You're in a small meadow, and nearby is a tent scattered with unpacked bags and clothes. You gasp as you look right, and see a stunning young woman on all fours by a fire ring, strenuously striking a flint with a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is impossible. Is that really L'Arachel?!' You think as you watch her tight buttocks test the squeezing grasp of her orange tights, 'She's even hotter than I had imagined!'</span></div></div>",

You follow your instincts and slime over to where she's bent over the campfire, cursing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad Dozla finally gave me my privacy, but couldn't the bastard have started me a fire? Ugh,\" she complains. You approach her from behind, and although you don't know exactly why yet, you gently crawl up the back of her right thigh-high boot and start climbing the length of it. It's almost as if there's a magnetism drawing you closer to her, always closer to her, almost inside of her. The way the thin fabric of her tights is clinging to the taut shape of her ass, you couldn't care less, either You're so entranced that you barely notice as you crest the top of L'Arachel's boot and slide quickly over onto the back of her calf, then her thigh, and finally over her ass, up to the waistband and under her white mini-dress's hem. She must not feel you, because besides a light shiver running down her spine, the girl shows no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twist and squish under the elastic, heading back down your path from before, except on the inside of her clothes. You're still sliding happily along when you realize you've started slither up into her ass. She notices THAT. Your world shakes and whirls as she jumps up and back, yelping, and falls down onto her side. You squirm even deeper, satisfying your newfound urges to be inside her as she gasps, wide-eyed, clawing the ground and rolling onto her back in a mix of confusion and pleasure, contorting her lithe body. The last of you slurps up into her and her big green eyes roll back into her head. She arches her back and lets out a guttural moan. You feel the sound coming from your mouth, and it changes slowly into a laugh as realization hits you that all this led to you possessing the girl's body, stretched out on the ground and basking in the afterglow of pleasure. You slowly sit up and look yourself up and down, yellow-green hair strewn across your face.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not for long, you were back at L'Arachel's campsite, this time with Tethys following behind. She had a blank look on her face, and looked like would obey your every command. But it's quite stressful for you to not be able to feel her at all.  You started to think of a way to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I give her more of my liquid body...\" you wondered outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to give it a try. You think hard to puke a large amount of yourself from L'Arachel while still having some inside of her. Soon, the dizziness that you felt earlier returned, and you felt something big was working it's way up from your throat. You gagged as a lot of purple liquid went out of your mouth. The massive blob finally landed on the grass, made you could breath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed something. You could feel your liquid body that was on the grass. In fact, you could see what it saw. Its as if you got a new limb with a 360 degrees point of view. You tried to focus your attention to the blob, and you could feel that your view shifted. You still could feel and moved L'Arachel's body, but now you feel that her body was just like your limb, pretty much the same as you felt earlier about your liquid body. You figured out that when you split yourself up, you'd need to focus your attention to one of them and think of the others as your limbs to make things easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind, you moved your liquid body towards Tethys. You decided to have some fun first, so you were slithering around her ass and vagina. Her poker face started to change into that of a pleasure and a small moan escaped her lips. You increased the level by inserting some of yourself into her ass and extracting it quickly back outside. This made her leg went limp and she were lying on her back, eyes closed while moaning and breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you ordered L'Arachel to come forward. With a grin painted on her face, L'Arachel practically tearing up Tethy's upper cloth, revealing her heaving breast. L'Arachel proceeded to massage Tethy's breast, occasionally pinching her nipples with a perverted look on her face. This action only made Tethys moaned louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like this, Tethys?\" you said trough L'Arachel's mouth, followed by a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTethys didn't reply your question since she was busy moaning loudly in between her raging breath. She seemed to be nearing her climax, so you decided to thrust all of your liquid self into both her ass and vagina at the same time in one motion. Tethys half screamed when you did this, since she reached her climax at that same moment. Love juices were squirting out of her vagina, soaking her pants. You/L'Arachel stopped massaging her breast, and start laughing devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, you regained your vision trough a new pair of eyes. Your felt tired, but you could feel pleasure all over your body. You reached up to your new vagina and found that it was soaking wet. You brought your hand back to your face and, after grinning evilly, put it into your mouth, licking and sucking them clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy,\" you said, after you had done cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou licked your lips and looked to your side, and found that L'Arachel was grinning while eyeing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Tethys,\" you made L'Arachel said, \"that looked like fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you answered, \"it sure did, L'Arachel. You should try it later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up, and looked down at your bare chest and soaking pants. You pinched one of your nipples, and a wave of pleasure was sent trough all over your body. A small moan escaped your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get used to this,\" you said outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of you/L'Arachel, you proceeded to stand up. Looking down once more, you realised that you'll need a new change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L'Arachel, can you get some of my clothes in my tent? I feel a little cold,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Just wait here, I'll be right back,\" L'Arachel said before turning back and walked toward Tethys's tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was actually no need for you to speak outloud at all, since both of you shared a same mind. However, it might be useful to practice it. Besides, it was amusing to see that you could control these girls all the way you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later...</span></div></div>",

You panicked, and quickly retreated into L'Arachel's tent. You peeked through the tent's opening to see the intruder. Soon after, you heard the sound of rustling leaves and bushes, and saw that someone was entering the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was seen looking around the campsite. Her eyes then rested upon Tethys's tattered clothes which were lying on the ground. She cautiously walked towards it, then crouched down to inspect the clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you decided to show yourself. You opened the tent's cover and went out of the tent, not bothering to cover your bare breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Natasha,\" you said while smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at your presence, Natasha's eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mi, miss Tethys... What happened? I heard a scream,\" Natasha asked you with a shocked look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened. I just played around with my body,\" you answered while inching towards Natasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Umm... Okay, then. I'll let you have your time alone now,\" said Natasha with a troubled look on her face. She then stood up and turned around, eager to leave quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait a second, Natasha. Let me ask you something,\" you said while still walking closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh, what is it?\" she turned back, but were casting her eyes to her side, refused to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really believe in your god?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she looked at you, a puzzled look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe that your god can save you from grave dangers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes, I do believe that,\" she answered with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped 5 metres in front of her, \"well then, let's see if your god can save you from this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, you puked a lot of your liquid body out. This time however, you didn't feel dizzy. Seeing a purple blob came out of Tethys's mouth made Natasha's face turned into a look of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh, what is that?!\" Natasha started to backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to laugh maniacaly. As soon as you stopped laughing, you mentally ordered your liquid body to attack Natasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Natasha quickly regained her composure and attacked the purple blob which was moving quickly towards her. She seemed to have learned some light magic. The attack pushed your liquid body back a couple of metres, but you didn't feel any pain at all nor the liquid got damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite impressive, but I don't think it's good enough,\" you said with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another series of uneffective attacks, Natasha seemed to grew tired. She then turned back and tried to run away. This was a perfect chance to capture her, so you grabbed one of her legs, tripped her down, and wrapped your liquid body all over her in a snake like shape, rendering her immobile. You also covered her mouth so that she couldn't scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer to Natasha's lying body, you took out a flick knife from Tethys's pants. She always kept it there in case of emergency. With a devilish smile on your face, you flick the knife open and crouched besides Natasha. You rolled her body so that she was lying on her back. She tried to scream and her eyes showed extreme fear, especially after you waved the knife in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is useless to fight back from the start, Natasha,\" you said, \"now let's play a game. First, I want to see what you are hiding below this robe of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then cut Natasha's robe with the knife up to the middle of her thighs. You then discarded the torn fabric, revealing her smooth white legs and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, what a beautiful legs you have here,\" you cooed while caressing her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha closed her eyes and stifled a scream. Tears started to make her eyes wet, probably from embarrassment. You were pretty sure that nobody had ever done this kind of thing to her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's move on, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of your liquid body, you managed to pull Natasha's robe up to her stomach, revealing a white panties. Smirking, you cut her panties with your knife, pulled it out and tossed it aside. Once more, this made her stifled a scream, and tears started to run down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee hee hee... What's the matter, Natasha? Why are you crying?\" you asked while smiling evilly, \"don't worry. When this is over, you'll feel happy and satisfied\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste anymore time, you mentally ordered your purple blob to get inside Natasha through her mouth, her ass and her vagina at the same time. She trashed around and gagged, desperately tried to scream, but couldn't insert air into her lungs to do so. She reached her climax just as you finished inserting all of your liquid body inside her. You covered her mouth with Tethys's hand to soften her scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, you had fully possessed Natasha. You made her giggle uncontrolably like a mad girl between her still heavy breath. After she stopped her giggile, Natasha half opened her eyes and then smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, Tethys,\" she said before giggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" you replied with a grin.</span></div></div>",

She is now your \u2018main\u2019 body, as you decided to call the body that you are focusing at like that. You then sat in your new body and started to feel yourself up. You mentally cursed that Natasha\u2019s modest robe prevented you to do it freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just strip your robe off, Natasha?\u201d you heard Tethys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thank you.

You muttered your gratitude, and then started to dust your robe. A moment later, you could hear the rustling sound of leaves again, but this time you didn\u2019t even think of hiding, since you perfectly knew who was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL\u2019Arachel went into the campsite with some fresh clothes for Tethys on her hands. Upon seeing both of you, she casually walked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that you had decided to join this secret group, Natasha,\u201d L\u2019Arachel said while giving Tethys her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Miss Tethys here invited me. She was so convincing when she persuaded me that I didn\u2019t need to think twice before I agreed to be a member,\u201d you replied while smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the more the merrier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to play this little puppet show of yours a little bit longer, so with Tethys\u2019s mouth you ordered, \u201cHey L\u2019Arachel, help me change my clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Sure, Tethys\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL\u2019Arachel then moved closer to Tethys and crouched in front of her. L\u2019Arachel pulled Tethys\u2019s pants ever so slowly, until finally Tethys\u2019s hairless vagina was shown to public. Some vaginal juices were still flowing out of Tethys\u2019s pussy, probably from seeing an earlier scene of Natasha\u2019s possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, L\u2019Arachel rubbed her right hand across it, collecting the juices with her fingers. This made Tethys shivered and a small moan escaped her lips. L\u2019Arachel then put her hand into her mouth, sucking and licking it. As soon as she had done cleaning her hand, however, you made Tethys slapped L\u2019Arachel\u2019s left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do things that I haven\u2019t given you permission at,\u201d Tethys said, half frowning, half grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tethys,\u201d L\u2019Arachel replied meekly with a sour look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs L\u2019Arachel proceeded to take off Tethys\u2019s pants, you suddenly realised that something was trickling down on your/Natasha\u2019s thigh. You looked down to see white liquids slowly descending your legs. It must be from Natasha\u2019s climax earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL\u2019Arachel, can you please get some towels or something to clean us up?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have some inside my tent. Wait a minute,\u201d L\u2019Arachel replied before running to her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a minute later, she came back with a couple of towels on her hand. You/Natasha murmured your thanks when L\u2019Arachel gave one of the towels to you, but you made it more difficult for her with Tethys, as she ordered L\u2019Arachel to clean her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after you had done cleaning and L\u2019Arachel had also done helping Tethys put her clothes on, you couldn't help not to laugh trough Natasha and Tethys. Seeing the normally proud and quite bossy L\u2019Arachel doing odd jobs for Natasha and Tethys was truly entertaining to you. You made L\u2019Arachel pouted at both of you, but then she also joined your laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then started to ponder your next move. Going back to the real world didn't sound like a bad idea, but there were still a lot of girls who you haven't possessed in here yet, so it looked like a waste. Beside, you hadn't really figured out how to freely going back and forth from real world and this world yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You hadn't played it in a while but your love for the tactical series was reenergized recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you went off to your room, ready to play the Wii game.

However, they didn't have much time, as bandits had started to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got ready as you would be controlling them soon. It was easy when you got in control finally.

Your chest heaves as your eyes dart about; what you see is somehow both familiar and alien to you. Suddenly you're aware of two sets of memories within your mind: Your name is Lucina, warrior princess of the kingdom of Ylisse and daughter of Chrom and Sumia. You have a sister named Cynthia, and you've come with a group of others from the your apocalyptic future to save your parents, taking the guise of \"Marth\" in order to protect your father without revealing your identity. However, that didn't work, and now you're traveling with your parents' party, both of whom have full knowledge of who you are and why you're here. However, you're also Anthony, a regular sixteen year old high-school student who had merely decided to play Fire Emblem: Awakening after coming home subsequent to the merciful end of the school year. You've got many siblings and half-siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Lucina and Anthony's combined wits, it doesn't take you long to figure out who you are and what happened to you. A grin makes its way across your new, feminine face as your hands slowly make their way up the curves of Lucina's possessed body, feeling the soft, supple skin of your host whilst your long blue hair tickles your face and neck. You had no idea that girls felt so... <i>good.</i> A coo of pleasure escapes your lips as you cup the small but firm breasts attached to your body. Suddenly a wave of nausea overtakes you.Your body lurches forward as you feel something rising in the back of your throat.With grace native to your new body, you swiftly maneuver your way our of your tent and over into the forest, fighting to keep the bile from finally escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you can't hold it in anymore and keel over, letting it all flow out onto the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't bile, though, that you find has come out of your stomach. Instead, a blue goo-like substance squats and jiggles beneath you. A wave of vertigo overtakes you, and suddenly a second perspective enters your mind. In the same way that you awoke to two sets of memories in your head, so too do you suddenly find yourself with two sets of eyes. You are looking down at the goo on your hands and knees while also looking up into the adorably innocent and complexed face of Lucina. You are completely aware that you are in possession of two separate and completely disconnected bodies: one in the form of a princess and another (presumably the manifestation of your true body), slime-like body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a grin break across your face, and simultaneously see Lucina's regal face split into a kind, encouraging smile. An idea hits you -perhaps if you could possess one body, you could use this goo of yours to possess another? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little guy,\" you say with a small smile as you scoop up the goo and enter another one of the tents, \"let's see what you can do~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose tent do you end up in?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you walk into the tent, you see Nowi and the Avatar (AKA Game Anthony) talking to each other. Remembering that you decided to marry Nowi this time around, and that you wouldn't wanna bother them during their time together, you quickly turn around. Before you walk out of the tent, Nowi stops you and says \"Oh, hey Lucina! DId you want anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that this would be a great time to get Nowi alone, you reply with \"Yeah, I did. As long as you're not too busy right now... I kind of wanted to play a game with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busy? Of course not!\" Nowi replies, \"I'll be glad to play a quick game with you, Lucina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" You reply, \"then let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nowi both leave the tent, waving a quick goodbye to Game Anthony. You lead Nowi to a secluded spot in the forest where no one should be able to hear you. To prepare for the possession, you put the goo that was originally in your hand back in your mouth. Nowi, being her usual self, is getting rather impatient and quickly asks you if you're going to play a game anytime soon. Suddenly, an idea pops into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Nowi, we'll start pl-\" you say as you fall to ground, pretending to have stomach pains. Nowi quickly rushes over to you and asks \"Are you okay, Luci-\" which is all she can get out before you suddenly get back up and hold her face, kissing her. As you do this, the goo that you put in your mouth earlier starts moving into Nowi's mouth. Sensing this, Nowi tries to break away from the kiss, but it's too late. Nowi keeps coughing, trying to get the goo out of her mouth. Unfortunately for her (and rather fortunate for you), it's already too late to do so and the goo slithers down her throat. Nowi tries to fight it, but she slowly starts to black out. Once she blacks out, you decide to carry her body back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway to camp, Nowi starts to wake up. You lay her down, and as her eyes notice, you again notice two different perspectives. From one point of view, you see what you were already looking at, Nowi lying down on the ground. The other perspective is looking directly at You/Lucina and is from a lower point of view. You quickly realize that this is Nowi's point of view, and that you now have full control over her. \"Yes! It worked!\" You exclaim at the same time from both Nowi and Lucina's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're finally awake.\" You/Lucina says to You/Nowi. \"Of course, I wasn't going to sleep all the way back to camp!\" You/Nowi says, while giggling over the fact that you can manipulate these girls in any way that you wish. \"Well, I guess we should get back to camp. Everyone is probably wondering where we are.\" You/Lucina says to You/Nowi. \"Yeah, I suppose you're right...\" You/Nowi says to You/Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's weird to see and move from two different perspectives, but once you realize that you can use one body as your \"main\" body and view the other body as an extension of your main body, you quickly get used to it and things under control. After a few moments of thought, you decide to make Lucina's body your main body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both return to the camp, you find that everyone was looking for you two. Both You/Lucina and You/Nowi apologizes, and then you both head off to You/Lucina's tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" You think to yourself. \"What's wrong Lucina?\" You/Nowi asks, again giggling at how you can control these two girls. \"Well, I was just wondering, what else I could do with these powers. I can definitely possess other girls if I were to make more of that goo, but we can work on that later. Maybe I could try possessing girls while in another girl's body?\" You/Lucina replies. \"That's an interesting idea...\" You/Nowi says, \"How about we try it on each other?\" \"Sure!\" You/Lucina replies once again. As you concentrate on Lucina's body, it slowly turns to a blueish and clear gooey substance. \"Woah, that's pretty cool...\" You/Nowi exclaims. As the goo, you make your way towards You/Nowi and you climb up her legs. You/Nowi laughs a little because of how ticklish this feels. As you climb up Nowi's body, you decide on entering her through a way that's a little more \"fun\".  You get up onto her shoulder, and then you quickly dive down and enter her body through her nipples, and straight into Nowi's boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels kind of good...\" You/Nowi whispers. Slowly, you black out again. A few minutes later, you wake up and notice that you're in Nowi's body, and that her boobs have grown a little. \"Ah, that must be a side effect from possessing her in that way.\" You say. \"Well, I only have one perspective here, which is from Nowi's body so that must have been successful. In fact, if I just feel around in Nowi's body a little, I can feel Lucina's body in here as well. That's pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a mischievous grin comes across You/Nowi's face. \"So, I can both use pieces of that goo to possess girls, and I can turn the bodies of girls that I'm possessing into liquid to possess other girls as well. This will be pretty fun...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, what shall you do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tent you enter is organized, you notice. While Lucina's tent isn't exactly messy, this one has been well furbished, with every item neatly set in a place where you're sure the owner could find it at a moment's notice. Yes, there's no doubt about who resides here. As silently as you can, you pad towards the occupied bed, taking note of the blonde curls resting near the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" you whisper, and then drop your goo onto Maribelle's face. She awakes with a start and begins thrashing, but you greedily burrow into any and every opening on her face you can find. You hop onto the cot and do your best to hold her down, but she's stronger than you expected and it takes all your might to keep her from bucking you until your goo has completely disappeared into her. Then she falls still and her head falls still on the pillow, her eyes half open and glassy. You don't get off her, however, in case your hypothesis doesn't pan out. What feels like an eternity passes in silence, and then you feel an inexplicable warmth just outside of yourself. And then you blink new eyes and look up at Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh with two mouths. \"Thank goodness it worked...\" Maribelle and Lucina chorus, and then gasp in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" Lucina says, \"looks like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-this will be harder than I thought,\" Maribelle finishes. You grimace. Again, you hadn't meant to do that. It would be very bad for you if you didn't soon get a handle on controlling two bodies separately, so you spend the next ten minutes devoting yourself to honing control of your two forms until they seem independent. Thankfully when you ceased to be human your thinking turned just as elastic as your new body, so it's a quick process, helped along by the sudden absorption of Maribelle's personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's all well and good,\" you have Maribelle say primly once you feel like you can puppet them sufficiently, \"but if you could be so kind as to get off me, Lucina...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Maribelle,\" you have Lucina reply, and then swing off of your newest body so you can sit it up and resettle its blonde curls. You've no reason to say anything aloud, as your two bodies are the only ones here, but it's fun to keep up the charade that they are still entirely them, and it'll be good practice for when you're in front of the Shepards.\"Sorry for the rough entrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally such rudeness would earn you a swift blow from my parasol, but I will forgive you this time, darling,\" Maribelle sighs. \"I suppose if you look at it another way, I should be honored to have been your first selection. Though I am curious whom your second and third selections were.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you weren't here, I would have tried for Tharja or Lissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well if my darling Lissa is on your list we simply must recruit her first. If I am to be part of your little group then she must be with me.\" As Lucina you frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd actually like to go for Tharja first, since... Well, just look at her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree that she does have certain... <i>assets</i> that are indeed appealing, but nevertheless I insist that Lissa comes first. Not only is she my darling friend, she puts people off their guard, making them all the easier to possess. That is your -or 'our' I suppose- ultimate goal, yes? To spread into others?\" You hadn't exactly been planning on her saying that, but now that she does you become acutely aware of the rumbling in the back of your mind. It's subtle, but there is undoubtedly some feeling inside driving you inside these women. No, it's more than a feeling. It's an instinct, a <i>craving</i>. And you hadn't noticed it until just now. That's just as well, you've really nothing better to do than just... spread, at least until you find a way back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, your conversation is entirely pointless. You already knew who your next target was before you even opened their mouths. </span></div></div>",

You open up your 3DS to play more of Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest, a game that you have been thoroughly enjoying since it has mechanics from both the old Fire Emblem games and the newer ones. As you boot up the game, you start to feel weird, but you take no notice of it. After fooling around for a little while, you notice that something is really wrong as your hands start to turn into liquid, with the rest of your body following it. Before you have any time to question this, you whole body gets sucked into your 3DS and you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, you find that you can see in all directions and that you're some kind of tiny liquid-like substance. After getting a feel for this new body, you decide to check out your surroundings. You seem to be near some kind of populated area that for some reason seems really familiar to you... Deciding to check things out more, you enter the tent that's nearest to your location. Going inside of the tent, you see a cute girl that you instantly recognize as Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If that's Ophelia... Then this must be the world of Fire Emblem Fates! But how could this possibly happen?' You wonder to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder how this could have happened, you feel this urge pulling you towards Ophelia, who has yet to notice you. You slowly make your way up her leg and onto her black underwear. At this moment, you dive under Ophelia's panties and straight into her vagina. She definitely noticed that! You wiggle and worm your way up her vagina, causing Ophelia to fall over in both surprise and pleasure. Ophelia keeps squirming on the ground in a mixture of confusion and pleasure as the last of you makes its way inside of her, causing her to black out.</span></div></div>",

You pick up the staff.  \"What happened to me?\" You wonder. \"Last thing I remember was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-earlier-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just gotten home from school and decided to play Final Fantasy X. You inserted the game and began to play as you selected New Game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou played for a while, but you suddenly felt weird for some strange reason, you saved your game which happened to be when Tidus and Rikku were about to dive down to begin the mission that they were given to allow Tidus to stay aboard the ship. You went to lie down on your bed, hoping that a nice nap would make things better. You began to lie down and then started to fall asleep, but as your eyes were finally closing, you could see something a tad weird, your hand had begun to turn into water. You thought that your mind was just playing a trick on you and you continued to fall asleep, unknowing as your body turned into water and then made its way into your TV, which was playing Final Fantasy X, which you had forgotten to shut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on the ship as a puddle of water, then you slipped off and landed in the ocean right as Tidus and Rikku dove into it, and you began to drift until you washed upon the ground in a very familiar, but odd place, a place known as Besaid Island. 'Wait...where am I? Is this a dream?' You wondered, noticing that you couldn't talk as you were. Your answer came as you began searching around, until you eventually came into the clearing with the Save Spear, and you saw a very familiar face. 'Yuna?! But she can't be here...wait this is all just a dream!' You thought, and you would have sighed to yourself in relief, but two things stopped you, one, the inability to do so in liquid form, and two, something told you that that was no dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna heard you moving around, then she turned towards you, and she began to walk towards you. \"Hello is there someone there? Don't be afraid. I'm not a fiend.\" Yuna said in her usual tone, thinking that you were a lost child. Instinctively, you suddenly jumped out of your hiding spot, showing yourself to Yuna. You then began and moving towards her. \"Huh what's with that water?\" Yuna then gasped as you speed up and landed on her, followed by you forcing your way into her body via every open (Ears, nose, mouth, ext...).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-current time-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that is what happened.\" You say to yourself with Yuna's voice. \"Oh, and apparently I am in Besaid now.\" You stay calm as you head back to the village. You walk towards the village, wondering when exactly Yuna would be going to attempt to become a summoner. In the village you see a few familiar faces I.E. Lulu's and Kimahri's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuna? Are you ready to become a summoner?\" Lulu asks, looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, that answers that question.' You think, referring to how you wondering when she was going to go and become a summoner earlier. \"I'm ready, I will become a summoner!\" You say with a smile and a nod as you enter the temple trials section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time to go in then.\" Lulu replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm.' You begin thinking. 'Who knows when I'll get the chance to think things through again and figure out what's happening... Yuna's stubborn enough that I could probably convince them that I'm her, just wanting to prove herself by going it alone for this temple if I try hard enough.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This may be incredibly difficult for you since it is your first time at this.\" Lulu's words faze you a bit, but you remember that these temple puzzles are easy for you to solve so you simply nod in response. \"Alright Yuna, if that is what you want, then Kimahri and I will wait out here by the entrance to the trials.\" Lulu says walking back towards the entrance before she stops a minute later. \"If you find the trials to be more difficult then what you expected, then feel free to come get us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Please wait here, okay?\" You reply and run off into the trials of the temple. \"Alright Anthony, you managed to get away from them for the time being so let's follow Yuna's...er my journey for the time being.\" So you go through, multitasking by thinking about what's going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***A few minutes later***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I have beaten all the puzzles, now let's continue on.\" During the time that you were doing the trial (including the destruction spear), you've learned more about your powers by focusing on it. You head down into the part where the Fayth awaits, giving Yuna control back, and letting her know what's happened since you don't want her to wonder what's happen, and to make sure that everything will work out, you make Yuna your loyal, loving slave who will serve you in any way happily, including letting you possess her. Yuna obtains the Aeon and you leave the room, surprised that Tidus hasn't come in yet. Suddenly you hear footsteps, thinking it was him, but you didn't expect what it was. \"What the heck is a fiend doing here?!\" You wonder, looking around and seeing a few more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them lunges to attack, and you dodge it, backing up. \"I really wish I had a sword...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't let these things kill me!\" You say courageously! You stand up and face your foes, preparing to summon. They start to come after you again when...</span></div></div>",

Tidus? I am so glad to see you.\" You say, surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you know my name but...\" Tidus draws his blade and blocks the next hit from a fiend. \"...I can't let anyone die, especially not by a fiend!\" Tidus slashes with his blade, destroying a few of the fiends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Tidus asks taking your hand and running a short distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am, do you mind if I borrow your blade for a second?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You don't look like you can wield one of these.\" Tidus remarks with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll bring it right back.\" You say, using some feminine charm in the process, which makes Tidus blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright, but be careful with it, after all, it is pretty sharp.\" Tidus replies, handing you the sword he got from Auron that Jecht gave to him to give to Tidus (Tidus doesn't have Brotherhood yet) and turning his face to stop you from seeing him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, now...\" You walk a bit towards the center of the room and then wipe your hand over the blade. \"... LIMIT BREAK!\" You shout. A tidal wave of water then floods into the room surrounding you, but not touching Tidus since you don't want to attack him. The fiends don't know what to do as then begin to panic. You soon were towering above them, and you feel like you are standing on something. You look down to see a shadow under your feet, holding you up. \"Hello...\" You wave your hand in the air summoning up a ball of water \"...and Goodbye!\" With those words you shot the water at the fiends with a slash from the sword, leaving them no room to move or escape. They drown in the water. You then slowly return to the ground with your body being exhausted from using the Limit Break, you finally make it to the ground and begin to collapse, but Tidus catches you in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're okay now, so take a rest.\" Tidus says, and you happily reply with a smile, then pass out in his arms. The next thing you know, you're waking up in a bed with Lulu sitting in a chair besides you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh where am I\" You ask feeling your head due to you suddenly having a headache from probably sitting up too fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there Yuna you should get some more rest.\" Lulu says lying you back down. \"After all you did just become a summoner and somehow tapped into a unknown Aeon, although I have to say, it was surprising to learn that fiends were in the temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'An Unknown Aeon.' You think to yourself? 'Is that what it was?' You look at her. \"Man, this sure is one heck of a head ache.\" You groan out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu walks away, then returns to you shortly afterwards, holding onto a cup which has a brown liquid in it. 'Probably tea.' You think to yourself as Lulu hands you the cup of brown liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" Lulu coaxed. \"Drink up and you'll feel a lot better Yuna.\" Lulu says with a smile. You smell the scent of the tea, and it smells like a cappuccino from your home town brewery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells heavenly.\" You comment making Lulu blush in embarrassment before taking a sip of the sweet smelling tonic. The taste is unexpected, but not disgusting, in fact, it is actually quite good. \"Mmm taste like hot coco on a cold winter night.\" You say enjoying the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it Yuna.\" Lulu says with a cheerful laugh, which is rare for her. \"By the way, what is hot coco?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then come off you high of the taste and snap back to reality. \"Well Hot coco is this really tasty drink that you drink when it is really cold outside. Here let me make some for you. \"You say with a smile. Lulu helps you up and the two of you walk towards what appears to be a kitchen. Alright now please leave the room Lulu.\" You say to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why, Yuna?\" She asks you suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the recipe is a secret, so please...\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I understand. Very well Yuna, I'll leave you to make this hot coco.\" Lulu says, exiting the kitchen. \"I won't let anyone enter until you say it's okay.\" Lulu says before finally exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time to make hot coco.\" You say, spitting out a piece of your liquid self, which quickly turns into your regular body, you then shift your main body to the real you and begin to cook, with Yuna handing you tools and ingredients. After a few minutes, you had completed the hot coco and made enough for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, one for Wakka, one for Kimahri, one for Tidus, one for me, and one for Lulu.\" You say, going over your check list. You put a little of your liquid self in Lulu's cup. Your original body then turns into liquid and returns to Yuna's body. \"Alright everyone, the hot coco is done.\" You say. Lulu is the first to walk into the kitchen, and she picks up the tray that was holding all of the hot coco. You and Lulu then exit then kitchen, and you see that all your teammates are waiting. Wakka is sitting in a chair, fiddling with his Blitzball, Kimahri is near the door, watching some birds outside flying; Tidus is lying on the bed, but sits up when he sees you coming in. All of you then sit down at a table as you start to hand out the hot coco. \"One for Tidus.\" You say, handing a cup to Tidus. \"One for Wakka.\" As you hand the cup to him, he says thank you and smells the scent of the strange liquid which he has never heard of before. \"One for Kimahri.\" You say, walking over to Kimahri who is still by the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimahri just gives a little smile since it isn't at the point where he starts talking. He takes the cup and takes a small sip, and you can tell by the look on his face that he likes it. You smile and return to the table where you pick up Lulu's cup of hot coco and take a small breather. Since part of you is in it, you know you have the right one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Lulu, here's your hot coco.\" You say with a smile, handing Lulu her cup, which if looked at carefully, could be seen to have a tiny bit more in it than the others, but nobody notices. Lulu sips on the coco, and you happily walk back to pick up you own cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pick up your cup, Tidus lifts up his cup and says. \"A toast to Yuna and this delicious drink!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second that man.\" Wakka says taking another sip of his hot coco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I third that Yuna, this drink is delicious! You have to show me how to make it some time.\" Lulu says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some other time, but right now how's about we call it a night and we can set out on our journey tomorrow.\" You say with everybody seconding the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, it is settled, we set off tomorrow.\" Wakka declares, making it official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and finish you cup of hot coco, then go to the bedroom where you then fall asleep shortly afterwards.</span></div></div>",

Who's there?\" You ask to the now silent darkness. You walk out of the inn after grabbing your weapon and proceed towards where you had heard the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer...\" A voice whispers, sounding as if it is coming from everywhere around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh who's there?\" You ask readying your staff. \"I have a weapon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow my voice...\" Whispers the voice, though this time, the voice is coming from somewhere north, which is where you start heading when someone grabs your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you think you're going?\" Lulu asks with a small yawn afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Lulu, did I wake you up?\" You ask with an apologetic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did, but more importantly, what are you doing awake at this hour?\" Lulu asks in a serious tone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard this voice, and it told me to follow it so...\" You begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were just going to run off without telling me or anybody else? That is quiet foolish if you ask me.\" Lulu comments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, I don't have time for this.\" You think as you grip your fist and take a small breath before turning around towards Lulu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuna, what are you doin...Ah my stomach!\" Lulu cries out in pain, clutching her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll all be over soon, just calm down.\" You say, placing your hand on Lulu's shoulder as the piece inside her that you slipped into her hot coco earlier begins to finally take her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute or two, Lulu finally subsided and became yours. \"What do you want me to do for you?\" She asks in a semi-seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow me, and make sure to keep quiet.\" You say shushing her, and then the two of you rush off towards where your main body heard the noise. During the time, you've done what you did with Yuna (turned her into a loyal, loving slave), but you stayed possessing her, although you turned off the link so that you wouldn't have to deal with learning how to effectively control two bodies at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some trekking through the woods you and you/Lulu end up at some sort of ancient abandoned temple. You proceed towards what appears to be the door to the temple, when suddenly, ancient symbols flare to life across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lulu, do you know anything about this place?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, how does she walk with these things?\" You/Lulu wonders aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Do you know anything about these ruins?!\" You ask, getting a tad annoyed by your companion, which is odd since she is you in another body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry about that.\" You/Lulu apologizes. \"But I have no idea what these ruins are, and what is even odder is that those symbols aren't even any known language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even Al Bed?\" You ask to which you/Lulu shakes her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we should proceed with caution, we don't know what's in there.\" You say with you/Lulu agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed into the temple to find the place ravaged with overgrowth. \"Maybe I can burn it away with a fire spell.\" You/Lulu suggests, but you shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry, but it may catch the forest on fire, and I don't want the attention, at least, not now.\" You reply. The two of you proceed deeper into the temple to find a strange ship in the middle of a docking area, to your surprise. \"Wait, what is this?!\" You ask, surprised to see a ship so strange this early in the game, let alone in a temple. The look of the ship is covered in overgrowth from tip to tail wings, if this ship has some which you found odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, over here!\" You/Lulu yelled. \"I think I found the door!\" You quickly run over to her to see a strange looking door, which has a weird symbol engraved over it. \"Must be the mark of who ever owned the ship.\" You/Lulu guesses. \"But the big question is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How do we open it?\" You wonder, placing your hand where a door handle would be. Suddenly, a hand scanner appears on the door, which you instinctively place you hand on. A small jolt of pain shoots through your body, making you whip you hand back in surprise. \"Ow! What was that?!\" You shout shaking you hand to get rid of the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft voice similar to the voice you heard before you took control Lulu begins to speak \"Biological blood sample acquired...scanning...scanning...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it is doing Yuna?\" You/Lulu asks as you use a cure spell to heal your injured hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't exactly know, but whatever it's doing, it took a microscopic piece of my liquid self when it took that sample. What I would like to know is why and how.\" You reply. The voice begins to speak again, this time sounding more femine then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Anthony, my name is Digital-Interactive-Virtual-Assistant, or for short, you can call me DIVA.\" The voice chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay.\" You reply. \"So, can you let me and my friend in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as your friend has a piece of you, then yes, she can. Oh, and welcome aboard Lulu.\" The voice says in a happy tone. The door to the ship then opens up to reveal futuristic equipment like you might see in Final Fantasy XIII, though you are still unsure why you figure that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now please proceed to the cockpit.\" Diva says with a small laugh. You are then lead to a small cockpit area that isn't very well lit, but when you step into the room, the lights instantly flick on, as if on command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was strange.\" You comment, then you look at the captain's chair, which you promptly sit upon. Suddenly, your body begins to shake uncontrollably as it seems you were being separated from Yuna's body. \"What's happening to me?\" You yell scared for your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Anthony. I am just shedding you of this body so you can pilot while your friends occupy the other controls.\" Diva's reply makes you calm down a bit as you exhale and completely separate the majority of your body from Yuna, while leaving a small part in her to still remain in control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your orders Anthony? Shall we go to another series\" Diva asks brimming with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean?\" You ask, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am equipped to go into any Cartoon, Anime, or Video game series.\" We can leave at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, whatever you say Diva.\" You say, shrugging, then you notice you can shrug again and also notice you are now in your normal body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well Anthony, now that that is settled shall we finally get going?\" You/Lulu asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah uh sure let's go to...\" You begin</span></div></div>",

You hear the roar of the engine, although it sounds more like an explosion than anything else as suddenly a portal opened up before the ship. You think of your options. You can go to one of the games made after Final Fantasy X, but there are some great girls to possess in the previous games such as Tifa and Aerith from Final Fantasy VII or maybe not so further back, maybe into Final fantasy IX?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, yeah, that sounds like a plan.\" You say snapping your fingers as you suddenly have a brainstorm. \"Alright Diva, take us to Final Fantasy VII, and make it snappy.\" You say with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye Anthony! Setting course for the weird and interesting world of Final Fantasy VII!\" Diva's voice says with a cheer as the ship begins to enter the portal. You find yourself in your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Won't people see the ship and freak out?\" You ask Diva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to fear, Anthony.\" She replies. \"This ship is unable to be seen to anyone without a piece of you inside of them, and even machines that don't have a piece of you inside of them can't detect you, and can't be touched by anything or anyone but you.\" You are satisfied, and you, Yuna, and Lulu (both of who you have given control to) then you use a device to beam all three of you into your room, since you arrived outside of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that Final Fantasy X is paused at the point that you left, so you reset and check the saved files, seeing that the point where you saved was still there, which you knew for sure since Yuna and Lulu were the only characters shown on the list of party members; even Tidus wasn't shown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn the PS2 off and replace the game with Final Fantasy VII, making sure to put the PlayStation Memory card instead of having the PS2 one in. You turn on the game and select one of your save files that is in part one; you don\u2019t even pay attention to the characters on the team.

Why are you crying?\" Yuna asks, concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sniff* Sorry, bad memories of this place.\" You wipe away your tears and begin to walk off towards the temple doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony...\" Yuna begins to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm fine, it's just a few tears, that's all. Now come on, or I'll leave you girls behind!\" You reply, cutting her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait for me!\" Diva yells as she sends out an electrical impulse that hits your left arm, which forms a strange red gauntlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you doing Diva? Aren't you supposed to stay on the ship?\" You ask Diva, who seems to have shifted her consciousness to the gauntlet now attached to Anthony\u2019s arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry Anthony it is only temporary, and this way I can keep a protective eye on you while you are outside of the ship.\u201d Diva chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Diva, whatever you say.\u201d You shrug and then proceed inside with Lulu and Yuna following closely afterwards. When you enter the temple, you find what you expected, except that a strange elevator has appeared beside you, which seems to be a quicker way to get to the lower levels, instead of having to go through the maze of the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s convenient.\u201d You say, going towards the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little too convenient.\u201d Lulu says, pushing the elevator button. Nothing happens, surprising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on!\u201d You say, annoyed, before pressing on the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllow me...\u201d Diva says as an electronic pulse leaves the gauntlet and goes into the elevator control, and soon finally, a loud clunk is heard. \u201cBottom floor: Food, weapons, and mysterious women.\u201d Diva chuckles reentering the gauntlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator door opens to reveal Aerith praying at the same spot where you thought she would be praying at. You and the gang then walk out of the elevator door and approach Aerith. As you approach Aerith, she turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh my mistake. I thought you were Cloud, but I guess I'm just getting a tad antsy.\u201d Aerith says with a sad look before turning back to her praying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second...\u201d You say sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, what is it?\u201d Aerith replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d You then suddenly can't speak a single word as your eyes begin to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Why are you crying? Is something the matter? Did you lose someone?\u201d Aerith asks, concerned.  Lulu and Yuna turn to you, both with concerned looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnthony, are you alright?\u201d They both ask at the same time, you but you don't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I may know what\u2019s wrong with Anthony, ladies.\u201d Diva says in a saddened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Diva? Why is Anthony so sad? Is it because this place makes him sad or something?\u201d Yuna asks, more worried than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'm not able to tell you, because Anthony hasn't allowed me too but...\u201d Diva pauses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what Diva? Tell us what is wrong with Anthony.\u201d Lulu demands in a calm voice, showing a small noticeable amount of anger and sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d Diva still remains quiet and then you speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has to do with Aerith...\u201d You manage to say in a somewhat calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith me? Did I do something wrong? Did I hurt you somehow?\u201d Aerith asks, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it wasn't you.\u201d You reply wiping the tears from your eyes. \u201c...But...but you are going to be killed right here! Where you just were praying in only a few minutes, someone is going to stab you through the heart in front of everyone's eyes.\u201d You say collapsing to the floor balling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, there.\u201d Aerith says, walking up to you and kneeling down beside you. She places her hand on your shoulder and you look up to her as she takes your left hand. \u201cIt'll be alright...\u201d Aerith then embraces you in a soft hug which Lulu and Yuna then join in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll always be here to protect you.\u201d Lulu, Diva, and Yuna all say at the same time. You then stop crying and accept the beautiful hug from the three women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel better now?\u201d Aerith asked, ending the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d You reply, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, that's good Anthony.\u201d Aerith says with a small chuckle before walking back to her original position, where she begins to pray again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! I never told her my name!\u201d You suddenly realize that something is a tad weird about Aerith that you can't exactly put your finger on. After a few minutes, the rest of the Final Fantasy VII gang arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, who are you?\u201d Cloud asks, readying to pull out his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there, my friend, I am only here to observe, and nothing else. I'll be leaving now, so goodbye.\u201d You say, walking off, but leaving a small part of your liquid self behind, which they just think is water. Tifa looks closer at the liquid, while the rest of the gang walks on towards Aerith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this stuff? It appears to be water, but something tells me it isn't what it seems.\u201d Tifa says aloud. The water like substance then begins to move. To Tifa's surprise, it suddenly shoots up into her mouth to her dismay. Tifa tries desperately to cough it up, but the liquid substance won't come out. She tries screaming for help, but her voice is muted by the liquid substance which seems to be trying to get into her stomach. All of her friends are focused on Aerith for the moment, so no one bothers to look back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, it will all be over soon, so please don't resist.\u201d A voice says, which turns out to be yours, but Tifa doesn't know whose voice it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of me!\u201d Tifa tries to scream, but it is muted by the liquid as it is finally making its way into her stomach. \u201cLeave me alone, fiend!\u201d Tifa tries to scream, but nothing comes out. Tifa gasps for breath. \u2018It's no use, I'm a goner.\u2019 Tifa thinks as she begins to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it will be alright.\u201d A soothing voice says. Tifa turns to see a woman in a white shirt and blue dress who turns out to be Yuna, but Tifa doesn\u2019t know this. Yuna approaches Tifa and calmly places a hand on her shoulder. Tifa tries to say something, but Yuna hushes her, saying \u201cDon't worry, once that piece takes hold of you, everything will be all better.\u201d To Tifa's protest. Tifa tries to punch Yuna, but instead collapses to the floor as the liquid begins to fuse with her stomach. \u201cAlmost done.\u201d Yuna comments. \u201cDon't worry, you'll be welcomed into our little family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bitch.\u201d Tifa manages to gasp before finally succumbing to the liquid part of you. Yuna waves her staff into the air and summons up Valefor, who she pats on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor little Tifa.\u201d Yuna says in a slightly saddened tone. \u201cResilient till the end, but ultimately, you too must accept Anthony into your body and heart.\u201d Yuna lifts up Tifa, and places her on Valefor, before climbing on herself. Valefor then flaps its wings and takes off out of the temple through a small exit hole used by fiends of this world.</span></div></div>",

Aerith turns to greet them when suddenly the expression on Cloud's face changes to dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out!\u201d He yells as suddenly Sephiroth descends from the ceiling and tries to impale Aerith, who to the surprise of everyone had been ready to dodge, and then did so. Sephiroth is surprised that she dodged and is stunned for a moment. Aerith suddenly rushes at Sephiroth, punching him in the gut incredibly hard, which sends him flying into the water, leaving his sword behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith reaches down and takes the blade in hand; suddenly her eyes become blood red and she jumps into the water, which seems to be knee deep on her dress. Sephiroth has started to get up, showing that he is bleeding internally by coughing up blood onto his soaking wet outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can't possibly be human.\u201d Sephiroth groans, coughing up more blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I am, nor will I ever be human.\u201d A voice that was not Aerith\u2019s but came from her body said. \u201cYou are an enemy of Anthony and Anthony wishes for your destruction.\u201d Aerith grips the sword tightly. \u201cSo you must be eliminated permanently!\u201d She lifts the blade in her hand, but Sephiroth blasts at her with a fire spell, which she dodges again somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 impossible.\u201d Sephiroth manages to say with a cough as Aerith brings the blade down on him, killing him instantly. She walks over to Sephiroth's still freshly bleeding corpse and removes a simple object from the now dead villain's inventory, a simple, but sacred katana which is smaller than a regular sized sword, but it seems special or at least to Aerith it is. Aerith climbs out of the water and walks by Cloud who is in complete shock at what he just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAerith are you...\u201d Cloud manages to say before Aerith suddenly lifts up her left hand to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will forget! You will forget what you just saw and instead remember that Aerith had died and was killed by Sephiroth, who you will believe is alive and also that you had never met Yuffie, and you Cloud will believe that Tifa died after she tried to take on Sephiroth, while none of the rest of you will remember meeting her! You will continue on your mission and save the world like fate tells you to, no questions asked.\u201d Aerith' words make everyone except Yuffie freeze in a strange hypnotic state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie looks at her allies worriedly. \u201cGuys are you alright? Hey Baret are you in there?\u201d Yuffie asks, waving her hand in front of Baret's face, which like the others has a blank expression on it. \u201cCome on guys, this isn't funny! Stop being such zoned out zombies and talk to me!\u201d Yuffie yells as Aerith approaches her. \u201cAerith! What did you do to them? How did you kill Sephiroth? Why are you looking at me like that? No! Stop it! Let me go...\u201d Yuffie cries, gasping for breath as Aerith has covered her mouth, Aerith staring at her with a dark stare. \u201cWhy are you doing this Aerith? What are you doing to me?!\u201d Yuffie cries as a jolt of electricity passes through Aerith\u2019s arm and goes through Yuffie\u2019s brain, the jolt changing her thought process to how Aerith wants it. Aerith lets go of Yuffie, and she drops to the ground gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe reason why I did this was because I will do anything to make Anthony happy, even if it means killing someone! Now, come to me, and accept your place as a loving slave to Anthony.\u201d Aerith says as she begins to walk off, with Yuffie following behind her as soon as she caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait up, Aerith!\u201d Yuffie yells a few minutes later. Aerith stops and turns to her former friend. \u201cHey, thanks for waiting for me Aerith, you're a real friend.\u201d Yuffie says gasping for breath after the long run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, I guess I am.\u201d Aerith chuckles at someone saying that after having their brain messed with and being enslaved. \u201cNow come on, we don't want to make Anthony wait.\u201d The voice that came from Aerith\u2019s body says, it but is, in fact, Diva's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, don't want to keep him waiting.\u201d Yuffie laughs cheerfully as the two exit the temple and make their way towards the ship. After a few minutes go by of walking, Yuffie asks \u201cHey Aerith, what is Anthony like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiva/Aerith takes a small breath, and then replies happily \u201cAnthony is kind, intelligent, smart, hansom, and incredibly strong willed. He won't let anything harm us or any of his friends, so I guess that makes him incredibly brave hearted. He loves swords, which is why I am bringing him this small katana sword.\u201d Diva/Aerith holds out a small blade that looks similar to the one she got from Sephiroth\u2019s dead body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that looks finely crafted and very well made.\u201d Yuffie comments. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I just found it in the temple a little while ago before you and I met up\u201d Diva/Aerith replies happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh I wish I found something as cool as that to give to Anthony...\u201d Yuffie sighs, disappointed with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it's alright.\u201d Diva/Aerith says, comforting Yuffie. \u201cI'm sure you can find, or maybe steal something that you can give to Anthony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but not as good as that sword you\u2019re going to give him.\u201d Yuffie interrupts, sighing even deeper in sorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Time will tell, so don't doubt yourself so easily.\u201d Yuffie looks at Diva/Aerith and smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you're right, Aerith.\u201d Yuffie hugs Aerith in a playful hug \u201cThanks Aerith, you're like a big sister to me.\u201d Yuffie chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, a big sister.' Aerith thinks to herself before the two walk on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I think I can see the ship!\u201d Yuffie cheers, running ahead before stopping a short few feet away. \u201cHey! Come on slowpoke!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I'm coming.\u201d Diva/Aerith says before rushing towards Yuffie, and then both of them walk the rest of the way together back to the ship where you and Lulu, are waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! There you are Diva! Oh, and I see you have brought a friend as well.\u201d You say, smiling. You approach the two and kiss Diva/Aerith, then you look at Yuffie and say \u201cWelcome to the family, my little Ninja-Thief.\u201d You say, rustling Yuffie's hair with your hand, which she blushes at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is nice to finally meet you too Anthony or would you prefer I call you something else\u201d Yuffie asks? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... how's about you can call me honey like boyfriends/husbands and girlfriends/wives call each other, or something like that\u201d You reply smiling. Yuffie gives you a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright honey.\u201d Yuffie says happily and then the four of you proceeded into the ship where Tifa (who you have just gotten around to changing her into a loyal, loving slave) and Yuna are waiting, and are already seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the party Yuffie.\u201d Tifa says with a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig sister Tifa!\u201d Yuffie cheers and instantly runs up and hugs her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem! Now that everyone's on board, let's set out to a different dimension.\u201d You say, sitting in your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye aye honey!\u201d Yuffie says saluting and then hoping into one of the seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll systems are ready to launch, engines all powered up, dimensional portal is opening, and all of the crew members are strapped in. Only one thing left to do Anthony...\u201d Diva states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, choosing our next destination which should be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Final Fantasy will you choose?</span></div></div>",

'What if we go into, say, another video game world, like Crystal Chronicles or something? I wonder if I should try my life as dark lord and take over Mira.' You think for a minute, but the you hold off on that idea for the moment since there are only two or three girls in that game. \u201cMan this is irritating.\u201d You say, scratching the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey honey, what if you let me choose the next place to go?\u201d Yuffie asks. You think for a minute, but then nod after words having the ship take you to your house. You all pile out of ship, except Tifa and Lulu, who choose to stay on the ship. You, Yuna, Diva/Aerith, and Yuffie all enter you room and you show Yuffie the games you have which is a lot for each consol. She looks at the Wii games, then the Play Station games, but stops when she finds a PS2 game called Kingdom Hearts RE: Chain of Memories. Yuffie shows you the game, and you insert it into the PS2, then you load a file where you are at the Traverse Town made from Sora's memories, then you all turn into liquid and go into the TV as the ship follows after you all by opening up a portal, then entering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself in an abandoned alley and reform. \u201cHuh where are the girls?\" You look around, unable to see the girls or the ship, and you figure that they are somewhere else in the castle. You exit the alley, and suddenly, you are blasted back by a ball of fire, followed by a voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop right there Heartless!\u201d A voice says. You look towards the voice to see Leon, who has his Gunblade aimed right at you. You clench your shoulder, which is hurting due to the surprise attack, but it is recovering due to your powers. You get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what the heck was that for?!\" You shout. \"Do I look like a Heartless to you?! I'm a human, just like you!\" Leon looks at you, and gives a look that you can tell means that he is embarrassed, although he tries to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I saw something moving in the shadows, and I thought it was a Heartless.\" Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, make sure it's a heartless before attacking! I mean, seriously!\" You shout. Sora catches up with Leon, and then looks behind you in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Sora yells. You begin to turn around to see what Sora saw, but something hits you on the back of your head, knocking you unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up and see Aerith standing in front of you. You almost think it is Diva, but you realize that it isn't, for a few reasons. These differences between the Kingdom Hearts Aerith and the one that Diva are: The color of the dress that the Aerith that Diva is possessing is a different shade of pink than this Aerith, Diva/Aerith wears a red, unzipped jacket, covering her shoulders, while this Aerith isn't, leaving her shoulders bare, Diva/Aerith wears bands on both wrists, while this Aerith is wearing only one, on her left wrist, not on both, and it is a different kind as well, this Aerith is wearing a purple belt around her waist, which Diva/Aerith doesn't, and Diva/Aerith's boots are different than this Aerith's boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d She asks you kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be ok; I've got to go, though.\" You reply, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you need to rest.\" She says, pushing you back down. She blushes upon doing so, and you resolve to figure out why later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find my friends.\" You say. \"So I need to g-\" You begin, when suddenly Aerith pushes her lips to yours, and begins a make out session with you. As soon the two of you part, you look on, surprised. \"Where did that come from?\" You ask in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, but upon seeing you, strong feelings of love swelled up inside of me, until I just had to act on them.\" She says, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why does this have to happen?' You wonder, knowing that she is just a memory, given life temporarily. Suddenly a burst of knowledge of your powers comes in, and you find a way to allow her to continue on. \"Aerith, I'll have to leave soon, possibly to never come back.\" She looks depressed. \"Do you want to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think hard, you may never see your friends from here ever again.\" You inform her. She looks sad, but then cheers up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll miss my friends, but I would miss you more.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" You reply. \"There is something that binds you to this world, but I have a way to negate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What is it?\" Aerith asks. You turn part of yourself into liquid, and bring it to your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink this.\" She looks uncertain for a moment, obviously wondering how it is staying in your hand, but she takes it into her own hands, then puts it into her mouth and swallows. A moment later, you find yourself looking out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that better?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'm happy to be in your little harem.\" You/Aerith says with a small giggle as she kisses you on the lips. You want to stay in direct control of her for a while. You both leave the building, and you see an army of Heartless looking at you and you/Aerith, ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring it on.\u201d You say. \"Lend me your strength.\" You shout, pyreflies surround you, and creature that aided you before appears, and you realize who it is. \u201cLeviathan!\u201d Leviathan roars at the Heartless and creates a tidal wave, which slams down on the Heartless, destroying them instantly. You and you/Aerith hop onto of it. Leon and the others appear to find out what the giant creature they saw is, and several Shadows form on Leviathan, but you and you/Aerith begin to kick them off. As the shadows begin to fall, you soon find yourself surrounded by different varieties of flying Heartless, even though they shouldn't be in the world you're in. You try to attack them, but they are just out of reach, until suddenly, you hear the blasts of a machine gun and also a familiar sonic blast as bullets shoot down some of the rather smaller Heartless and the sonic blasts wipe out some bigger ones. You turn to see the ship with its left door open, and someone who is wearing a facemask sticking out with a sub-machine gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Honey!\u201d The person yells, making you realize that the person is Yuffie, using the facemask to hide her identity. \u201cCatch me!\u201d With those last words Yuffie jumps out of the plane, and you almost miss catching her as she falls, managing to catch her by running to the end of Leviathan's tale. When you catch Yuffie she comments. \u201cNice catch!\u201d She kisses you on the cheek, which you blush a bit at. You and Yuffie then run back to Leviathan's head and begin to fight off some more flying Heartless alongside you/Aerith, Yuffie handing you her machine gun, and you/Aerith using a lance like her Final Fantasy counterpart, while Yuffie uses her giant shuriken and other ninja throwing stuff, like kunai and paper bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like forever, the waves of Heartless begin to diminish, and you think you have achieved victory, but Yuffie taps you on the shoulder then says \u201cUh, honey, look at that!\u201d You turn around to see that Guard Armor has appeared, and rammed into Leviathan, who used his Overdrive right as he got hit, taking each other out  at the same time. Leviathan then completely fades and the three of you begin to plummet to the ground below. You close your eyes, but you feel two people grab you, then suddenly the falling stops. You open your eyes to see Yuffie and you/Aerith have one arm each around you. You look up to find that Yuffie is using a ninja kite to slow the descent, which is working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you aren't afraid of heights.\u201d Yuffie jokes, hoping to lighten up the mood a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry I'm not, just don't drop me...\u201d You suddenly slip from the girls' grasp, and begin plummeting to the ground below. You hit the ground hard and everything turns black. You later wake up to a pitch white room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I, and why does my head hurt so much?\u201d You ask yourself, but to no answer. You get up and walk towards the door, as you slowly open, it you hear some people talking nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho do you think he is?\u201d A male\u2019s voice asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just felt like I needed to save him.\u201d A female\u2019s voice says. You kick the door, and run for it, hoping that the two you just over heard weren\u2019t Larxene o Marluxia. You run, and run then duck into a room as the two who are following closely after you fly past you. You breathe a sigh of relief, until suddenly, you find that a bladed weapon is now at your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person whose weapon is at your throat is that of...</span></div></div>",

You smile a small amount which Larxene notices \u201cHeh I admire those that smile in the face of death\u2026\u201d She withdraws her knife, then walks towards her bed and sits down. \u201cHow\u2019s about we play a game?\u201d She asks you in a somewhat wicked voice as a cold smile crosses her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA game huh, well than bring it\u2026\u201d A knife suddenly flies just mere inches from where your head is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t finished.\u201d Larxene says shaking her head. \u201cThe game will be that of a match to see who the winner via combat, if I win, then I'll do whatever I want with you but\u2026\u201d She pauses trying to make you shake with fear. \u201cBut\u2026 if you win then I won\u2019t kill you, and you can do anything you want to me!\u201d She says with an evil, laugh thinking that she can never be beaten by the likes of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, anything!\u201d She nods still laughing a bit. \u201cI\u2019ll even let you have sex with me if you win!\u201d She jokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs one of my good buddies would say.\u201d You pause for a minute taking a deep breath \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m going to win, and you better keep your promise!\u201d Larxene chuckles at this. \"Oh, and for the record, your bluffs don't scare me, I overheard you talking to Marluxia about feeling like you had to help me, so you know that I haven't snuck in to attack you, and I know you won't kill me if you wanted to help me so bad.\" She looks very flustered. Then the fights begins. You rush at her, and try to punch her, but she easily dodges, and throws a knife at you which lands in your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice shot you got there, but\u2026\u201d You rip the knife out of your shoulder, and then throw the knife back at Larxene like Yuffie would if she was throwing one of her kunai. The knife whirls right past Larxene, slashing a small cut on her cheek, before it passes her. Larxene is shocked; nobody has ever thrown a weapon at her with such precision before, and with her own weapon none the less! Larxene is enraged, and carelessly rushes at you, her blades charged with electricity. You dodge each of her strikes rather easily on account of having some of the skills of the girls you've possessed. You know what is coming next, as she tries to quick kick you, but you merely grab her leg and put her into a choke hold like Tifa would if she was here. Larxene roars out in anger as she tries to break free of your choke hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go, darn it!\u201d She screams. You tighten your hold and swear you hear some bones crack as Larxene screams in pain, surprised she can hit so many high notes. You put your foot on her back, let go of her right side, and kick with all of your might, which sends her flying into the wall, while you still hold on to her left side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou give up?\u201d You ask her. Larxene digs her face out of the wall and you notice a small trace of humility in the look on her face. You see that weak feeling, as if she is helpless to stop you, but you also see something else\u2026fear! You don\u2019t understand why, or even how, she is afraid, is she scared of what you\u2019re going to do to her? You let go of her left side and Larxene falls to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d She coughs. \u201cFinish me off! I\u2019ve lost, now kill me!\u201d Larxene demands. You walk away from her, and sit on her bed, your legs bent so that both feet are on the floor. Larxene doesn\u2019t move; she only lies there staring at you with, a look of confusion on her face. She wonders why you haven\u2019t finished her off, and why you just sit there. After a while of sitting there, waiting to see how she is, you get up from the bed and approach Larxene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down in front of her and ask \"Are you ok?\" You then hug her. Larxene is stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this what compassion is?' She thinks inside her mind as the teenager before her continues to hug her. 'Why do I care about how he feels? I thought that these kinds of emotions were impossible for Nobodies to have, but\u2026but he makes me feel like I matter. He makes me feel as if I\u2019m human...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes go by, you let go of Larxene and walk towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Larxene says to you as she stands up. She walks over to you, then hugs you, and after a few seconds, she kisses you on the lips and you feel a loss of time and place. The next thing you know, you wake up to find yourself on Larxene\u2019s bed with, you look over to see that she is asleep, and that the two of you are naked. You take a small breath, and begin to slip on your clothes quietly so as not to wake Larxene. You find an extra cloak like the ones that the Organization members use, and you put it on, hoping to use it to help move undetected like Mickey and Riku do later. You leave a note on the stand beside the bed as well as a small glass that you put a part of yourself into.</span></div></div>",

As you open the door, you hear moans of pleasure right beside the door. You look around to see a small girl, who you know to be Namin\u00e9, fingering herself, and moaning in pleasure, she doesn't even notice you have come out. You walk up to her and crouch down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\" You ask, to her shock. Namin\u00e9 opens her eyes and blushes extremely. She tries to get up, but you grab her by the hand and make her sit back down. \"It's alright...\" You whisper into her ear, taking your hand, and bringing it close to her vagina. You begin to rub her clitoris and she moans in pleasure. You place your hand over her mouth so she doesn't make too much noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... stop.\" Namin\u00e9 gasps between moans of pleasure. You pause for a second, but Namin\u00e9 grabs your hand and makes your fingers go into her vagina. Faster and faster, she makes your fingers go in and out of her vagina several times before she finally climaxes. You catch her as she passes out from the orgasm, as it seems that was her first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are delicate, aren't you...Namin\u00e9.\" You say, picking her up in your arms and walking back towards what you find is her room after putting a piece of yourself in her long enough to scan her memories to find it, and afterwards, you take the piece out. Once you make it to Namin\u00e9's room, you open the door slightly to see no one inside, and you proceed inside. You lie her down on the bed, and do as you did with Larxene, leaving a note on shelf beside the bed and leaving a small part of yourself inside the glass. As you are about to leave you hear a faintly weak whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave...\" Namin\u00e9 cries out. You turn around to see Namin\u00e9 getting up from the bed, and then walking towards you, gasping for breath. Just as she reaches you she begins to collapse, but you catch her before she can hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" You ask her, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just a little drained...\u201d Namin\u00e9 replies, gasping for breath.

She picks up the note and reads it to herself before slipping it in between her breasts. She looks at the glass on her stand and gives it a concerned look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he mean by \u2018you will be one with me, body and mind.\" Larxene wonders aloud, but to no answer. She figures that she'd best get answers first, and puts the liquid into a glass vile, then corks it. She walks out of her room, looks around, and then rushes off down the hall. She runs towards the prison room, thinking that her love might have been captured, as she opens the door, she sees no one except a few heartless, which are imprisoned behind white caged bars. She closes the door and rushes of down another hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way to the room on the top floor of Castle Oblivion, where the above ground section of the Organization members in the castle usually meet up to discuss plans. She enters the room to find Axel talking to Marluxia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Larxene, what's up?\" Axel asks upon noticing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do look like something is the matter, what\u2019s going on?\" Marluxia asks, pretending to actually care, something that wasn\u2019t lost on either of the other two above ground members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Larxene hesitates as she is rather new to trusting others but she tries to ask something that might lead to the answer she was looking for. \"Hey have you guys seen someone running around here? He has dark hair, and is wearing a dark blue jeans and a red shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Axel replies. \u201cI thought that I saw someone wearing one of our cloaks, but he was gone when I realized and took a second look. I thought I was imagining things, or that maybe it was one of the underground members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn\u2019t you mention this before!?\" Marluxia asks. \u201cIf it was an underground member, then they would have most likely reported to us so that we knew! We can\u2019t take any chances!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, sheesh, I\u2019ll go look for him.\u201d Axel replies with a sigh. Larxene worries about this (which she finds odd, since worrying about something is caused by emotion), since she doesn\u2019t know what Axel would do to her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll find him.\u201d Larxene replies. Axel and Marluxia look at her oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ok?\u201d Axel asks. \u201cYou\u2019re acting really odd today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine; I just want to blow off some steam.\u201d Larxene replies using a sarcastic tone to make the other two think she is just pretending to have emotion. \u201cWhere did you see him?\u201d Axel looks sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNear Namin\u00e9\u2019s room.\u201d Axel replies, scratching the back of his head the way someone would when they would be embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou idiot!\u201d Marluxia shouts. \u201cWhat if he takes Namin\u00e9 away?! There goes the Organization\u2019s plans for the Keyblade Wielder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to find him quickly then.\u201d Larxene replies. \u201cI\u2019ll check Namin\u00e9\u2019s room first.\u201d She uses a Corridor of Darkness to arrive outside of Namin\u00e9\u2019s room. She hopes that, at the very least, maybe Namin\u00e9 has seen her love. Larxene knocks, but to no answer. She knocks again but this time harder, as she is getting more anxious, but still, she calms herself, and waits for a reply, but yet there is still no answer. Larxene is starting to get angry and kicks the door to find that the door is actually open; Larxene mentally slaps herself at the sight and then proceeds inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she finds Namin\u00e9 passed out, but also notices the note and glass of liquid on the bed rest, which she quickly picks up and examines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere an exact match in handwriting, and even the liquid is the same, though this is a smaller amount.\u201d Larxene says aloud, pulling out the vile of liquid from in between her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must have left them when he left, but I don\u2019t exactly know when he left.\u201d A voice says. Larxene turns to see Namin\u00e9 sitting up in bed with her head turned towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you and he meet?\u201d Larxene asks Namin\u00e9, placing the note back down as well as the glass of blue liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Namin\u00e9 is hesitant to reply as she still remembers that her panties are still off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you meet him?\u201d Larxene replies, grabbing onto Namin\u00e9\u2019s shoulders rather tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me!\u201d Namin\u00e9 groans as Larxene seems to be tightening her grip on her shoulders, which feels like they are in a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you meet him?!\u201d Larxene asks again, this time sounding angry. Namin\u00e9 is silent for a moment, but Larxene tightens her grip even more, making Namin\u00e9 begin to cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! I heard you two when you guys were having sex, so I couldn\u2019t help myself, and started to masturbate outside your door. After a few minutes, he came out and fingered me, then took me back here, and left after about five minutes. Then I fell asleep, and when I woke up, you were looking at the note he left as well as\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Larxene replies, letting her go. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry if I hurt you.\u201d Larxene apologizes, sitting down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026apologized?\u201d Namin\u00e9 says, shocked a bit, as Larxene has always been known to be savage, as her nickname implies. Larxene sighs and Namin\u00e9 says to her \u201cYou really feel for this guy, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is the first one to make me feel\u2026well human, since I became a Nobody.\u201d Larxene replies. \u201cBut why do you think he\u2019s interested in you, or for that matter, me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for me, he was my first, but I don\u2019t think that mattered to him.\u201d Namin\u00e9 exhaled \u201c\u2026I wonder where he is right now.\u201d As Namin\u00e9 wonders this, suddenly, as if clockwork, an explosion sends a cloud of white smoke everywhere. Larxene takes Namin\u00e9 in her arms, and ducks under the bed, as suddenly, several beings are now in the room, each of them being female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he here?\u201d One of the women asks, sounding rather impatient, she appears to be shorter than the others in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, Yuffie.\u201d Another of the woman says, this one is dressed in a dark black dress which has fur around the top area of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright, as long as we find him.\u201d Another voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I believe he has been here rather recently, as that liquid on the bed will tell us.\u201d The woman dressed in black says, as the owner of the third voice walks over to the glass of liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarxene can\u2019t stand being under the bed and being a coward any longer, she thinks that these women are after the person she loves, so she decides to act by grabbing onto the leg of the woman who just spoke as she makes it over to the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck?!\u201d The woman screams as Larxene climbs out from the bed. The woman tries to step back, but Larxene grips her leg as tightly as she did when trying to get an answer out of Namin\u00e9, although this time, she did it for a separate reason almost entirely, love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way am I going to allow you to hurt him!\u201d Larxene yells, sending an extremely powerful jolt of electricity through her victim\u2019s leg which makes her collapse to the ground, twitching a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiva!\u201d The other women yell, the shorter girl, Yuffie, rushes towards her fallen companion and takes her in hand as Larxene stands up, Namin\u00e9 still hiding under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find him! Because\u2026because I am going to get to him first!\u201d Larxene declares, summoning up every one of her knives. The air crackles with electricity as the battle begins, Larxene sending down a hail of electric attacks at the remaining women. Though she managed to knock out one of their number, she is still having significant trouble, especially on the black mage in the black furred dress, AKA: Lulu. Every time she sends an attack at her that is magic, the woman manages to dodge it as if she knows where the attacks are going to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are very foolish, girl.\u201d Lulu taunts. Larxene throws a knife at her head, but it is dodged, making the wall be blasted open, but still the battle continues, even after several rather huge holes are blasted all over the walls, leading into other rooms. The ninja girl is also showing a good fight, taking Namin\u00e9 hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do now that I have your little friend?\u201d Yuffie taunts, but this doesn\u2019t affect Larxene that much, as she simply smiles rather evilly, then throws three knives right at Namin\u00e9, who Yuffie, thankfully is able to dodge. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with this chick?\u2019 Yuffie thinks. \u2018Doesn\u2019t she care about her friend?\u2019 Suddenly, Yuffie is elbowed in the gut by Namin\u00e9 who then brakes free, and kicks her in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNamin\u00e9!\u201d Larxene shouts. \u201cThe glass! Drink the liquid in the glass!\u201d Larxene yells, hoping that her lover left behind something that would help them in case of danger. In a matter of seconds Namin\u00e9 grabs the glass, and Larxene pulls out her vile of the stuff. They both then chug the liquid.</span></div></div>",

Her vision begins to blur, as well as her sense of awareness, as a feeling of vertigo suddenly makes Larxene collapse to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's happening to me?\u201d Larxene wonders out loud, feeling nauseous as she desperately tries to stand back up, only to fall back to the ground.

She sees her own body lying motionless, and she feels afraid, afraid of being alone in this void-like space. The feeling suddenly disappears as she feels something touch her arm, a gentle touch, like that of kindness. She looks to her left to see a familiar face, but she can't place who it is. She had long blond hair and is about the age of sixteen. Larxene tries to remember who the girl is, but the memory is just out of reach for her, when suddenly, a male figure approaches Larxene. The figure, though a dark silhouette, seems warm and inviting, Larxene wants to go towards the figure, but the sixteen year old girl holds her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!

Larxene turns to see her younger self turn into. She hugs him in delight as she had almost given up hope that she\u2019d see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you here, my love, and what happened to my younger self?\u201d Larxene asks, before she kisses her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was actually me. I used your memories to take that form, which I could do since you drank my liquid self.\u201d Anthony replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Larxene asks, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll understand soon.\u201d Anthony informs her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I got my heart back at least.\u201d Larxene says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t that easy, the part of me inside of you is actually being a stand-in for your heart.\u201d Anthony says as Larxene wakes up to find herself on a soft, plushy mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Larxene is no longer dreaming***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarxene leans up, noticing she feels completely human again, and that she is the age that Anthony took as her younger self, with the knowledge of everything that\u2019s going on, including that the part inside of her partially merged with her, changing her body to around his age, but not decreasing the size of her breasts, if anything, they are bigger. She also notices, that with her new age, that her cloak is a little too big for her. She blushes as she remembers that the guy she loves is currently being her heart. She wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference, as he was beating inside of her like a normal heart. She gets up from the bed to see that she is all alone in the room, and quickly exits it via the door. Now out in the hallway, she hears sounds of excitement coming from a little bit farther down the hall way. She proceeds there, finds a door labeled \u201cAnthony's room,\u201d and then proceeded inside to find...</span></div></div>",

Lulu and Yuna are playing a game called Final Fantasy: Four Heroes of Light on two DS systems. You, Diva/Aerith, Tifa, and Yuffie are playing a GameCube game on the Wii, called Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. There is no sign of Namin\u00e9 anywhere, but Larxene figures that she is close by, possibly downstairs. No one notices Larxene has come into the room as she makes her way behind you, quietly, so as not to disrupt your game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watches as you and Tifa are fighting a giant tentacle plant monster, as Yuffie is attacking it with a small humanoid, though it is a smaller creature with a large lance. Diva/Aerith is serving as the mage of the party, as she is equipped with a couple magicite orbs in order to use spells, as she is casting Cura, as well as other stat based amplifier spells, allowing the party to not be poisoned by the monster\u2019s venom strikes. Larxene watches as Anthony is about to strike the finishing blow, and can barely contain herself, as she watches you kill the monster, and then suddenly hugs you alerting all of her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Larxene. When'd you wake up?\u201d You say, somewhat shocked to find her up and about so early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust now, and congratulations on beating that monster.\u201d Larxene says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it really wasn't that hard.\u201d Yuffie says, interrupting the two. \u201cI mean, this is only, like, the third boss. It really couldn't have gotten easier if that thing simply just poisoned our part, but since Diva over here was banking on the heal spell, we pretty much kicked that thing's butt! No questions asked!\u201d Yuffie smiles smugly and then Diva/Aerith speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now that Larxene is awake, how about we go find some more girls to posses?\u201d She suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, maybe after lunch...\u201d You all walk downstairs to find Namin\u00e9 and You/Aerith both in kitchen aprons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you guys like sandwiches!\u201d Namin\u00e9 says, and then brings out a tray full of grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a few baloney and turkey sandwiches. You grabbed a grilled cheese; Larxene does the same, as do Diva/Aerith and Yuffie. Yuna and Lulu grab a baloney sandwich each, and Tifa simply grabs a turkey sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half an hour later you all had finished lunch, you say that the sandwiches weren't half bad, which Namin\u00e9 and You/Aerith blush at (although you/Aerith are just doing so to stay in character, since you feel it is fun).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that that's over with, I say we go and get us some new companions!\u201d You say.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, now let's go bag us some new girls!\u201d Yuffie says, and then you enter the game you chose, along with everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken to find that you are just outside a castle, Castle Baron to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are we?\u201d Yuna asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCastle Baron, the home to our first target Rosa, and are second target, Rydia is also here.\u201d You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how are we going to do this?\u201d Lulu asks curious of how you are going to storm an entire castle.</span></div></div>",

I made sure that we are in about the middle of the game, just after the party of Rosa, Cecil, Rydia, and Kain got away from the enemy forces by sealing the entrance to the underworld.\u201d You say. \u201cAnd while doing this, I\u2019ll send part of me out to find and possess Rydia.\u201d You then proceed towards the front gates, where two guards greet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalt! Who are you and what is your business here?\u201d Guard A asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Anthony. I wish for an audience with King Cecil.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing Cecil?\u201d Guard B asked. \u201cMaybe knight or paladin, but Cecil isn't a king, not yet at least.\u201d He continues. \u201cAlthough since everyone in Baron is calling for him to be king, I guess the mistake is understandable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be alright, but what about those women behind you? Are they coming with you?\u201d Guard A asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, will that be a problem? I am a traveling mistral, and these lovely women are my dancers.\u201d You say as you materialize a small flute from your back using a piece of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really now? Than how's about ye play us a toon, mistral.\u201d The two guards say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, this one is called Grand Cataclysmic.\u201d You begin to play your supposed flute as the sky around you grows dark, full of thunder clouds. As you continue to play, lightning strikes around you, though you know this is Lulu and Diva/Aerith, who are using electric based attacks in the background to put on a good performance. The Guards watch in awe as Yuna and Tifa dance around the lightning like that of would be demons. Amazed that this is actually working, you continue to play the flute as more lightning and thunder roll in as well as bits of rain, which quickly turn to ice thanks to Lulu and her blizzard spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes go by as more guards gather around the front to see the show, and eventually, the performance ends, and all the ice, thunder, and lightning go away the second you stop playing your flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBravo! Bravo! Encore! Encore!\u201d The crowd of guards cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay you now be so kind as to let us enter the castle now?\u201d You ask humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, go right ahead.\u201d The guards say as you and the girls enter, several of the guards give the women lust filled looks, but that is it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed towards the throne room, and find Cecil, Kain, as well as Rosa all standing around, wondering what all that commotion was. As you enter the room they turn to see you. Right before entering the room, you separate a part of your liquid self, and send it to find Rydia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Cecil asks, wondering if these new people are intruders, as does Kain, who readied his lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Anthony, and I am humbled to finally meet you Cecil, but more importantly, I wish to speak with Rosa, if that is alright.\u201d You request sincerely. Cecil and Rosa look at each other, and she nods, showing that it is ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm you would have to get rid of your guards, as well as get rid of any weapons you have on you.\u201d Cecil says, sounding rather official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d You snap your fingers, and have the girls wait for you outside. \u201cThere, now if you would be so kind as to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem aren't you forgetting something.\u201d Kain says as he begins to glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, my weapons, do for give me.\u201d You say and empty out your pockets as well as pad yourself down to show you have nothing else on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine then.\u201d Cecil says. \u201cYou can have five minutes with her, but no more! We will break the door down if we hear anything suspicious.\u201d With that Cecil and Kain exited the room, leaving you and Rosa alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is it that you wished to talk to me about er...Anthony was it?\u201d Rosa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right.\" You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, alright then. What is it you wished to talk to me about Anthony?\u201d Rosa asks once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see my I was passing through, and heard of a gorgeous looking beauty of the land. I decided that said beauty would be great for my traveling troop of dancers.\u201d You say rather inconspicuously. \u201cWould you like to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, but I have to decline.\u201d Rosa replies rather sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh why so? Is it because you are in love with someone and can't bare part with them? That Cecil, maybe?\u201d You ask Rosa, who seems stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did-\u201d She begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know? Well, the simple fact of that isn't what you'd think.\u201d You reply with a deviant smile. \u201cYou see I have set my eyes on you long before I ever entered this world, Rosa. I knew that you would be here, as I did know that were interested in Cecil. Now please hear me out. After all...I just want you to join me and become my white mage.\u201d You have at this point discreetly separated a part of your liquid self, and are having it move towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean by 'entered this world?' Are you from the moon? Are you a partner of that brute who kidnapped me?\u201d Rosa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo my dear I am not. I'm just a simple human being who wishes to be surrounded by beautiful woman.\u201d You say. The piece of you leaps up and enters her mouth. As it goes down her throat, she tries to scream, but it is muffled through the piece of you in her mouth. As you take control, she passes out, and an urge that you didn't notice before begins to subside a little. Soon you/Rosa begins to awaken. \"Well, what do you say to my proposal now?\" You ask, acting like she isn't you in control of that body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have reconsidered, and I would love nothing more than to join you.\" You/Rosa says as you help her stand up. You make her blush as you say this. You then feel Rydia come under your control. The liquid part from earlier went into a drink she got while she wasn't looking, and she ended up drinking it. Cecil and Kain then re-enter the room, and you take your weapons back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you talk about?\" Cecil asks. You/Rosa look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He asked me to join his group of traveling dancers.\" You/Rosa replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you refused.\" Kain states, sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I agreed.\" You/Rosa says. They both look at her in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Both say in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Cecil, Kain, but I'm going with him.\" You/Rosa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Cecil asks, unable to wrap his head around the fact that the woman he loves is leaving him for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've fallen for him.\" You/Rosa replies as the two of you leave, leaving Cecil and Kain in shock. When you get outside, you meet up with your other girls and you/Rydia. You've taken direct control of all of them except for Larxene, Yuffie, and of course, Diva/Aerith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the family, Rosa.\u201d Yuffie says, being the first one to greet her new sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh thanks for such a warm welcome.\u201d You/Rosa replies shyly. You then exit the game, only to return to that world moment later at a different area. \u201cHuh where are we now?\u201d You/Rosa asks, although you already know.</span></div></div>",

You then turn from defensive to offensive, and begin to destroy the bombs left and right before they get the chance to self-destruct. You think that you have gotten them all, when suddenly, out of some rubble, a Bomb shoots out and attaches itself to your back. It laughs manically as it begins to self-destruct as you try to get it off. You smash it into a busted up building, but it doesn't work. You try and cut it off, but it doesn't work either, and you can now see more monsters coming, this time in greater numbers.

You smile seeing that they are getting along, and then walk into the kitchen to find something that makes you blush, you/Tifa in nothing but a black bra and matching panties.

Well, I hope.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I did Lulu, but how about you girls, how'd you all do after I fell asleep.\" You ask. You can find out from checking memories, but you feel like doing it this way.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou/Lulu smiled slightly and chuckles a bit, but then she replies \"After you fell asleep, Namin\u00e9 and Yuna went to bed right after, since they felt like sleeping in your bed. Tifa, Rosa and Yuffie all decided to look around the house and even played a little dress up *chuckle* I can't believe some of the things your sister Sarah wears. Such strange outfits and odd jewelry. Rydia, young Rydia, Aerith, and Larxene went and had pieces of you possess Anna, Zoey, Mia, and your mother respectively. I looked through the computer in order to read some stories on the internet. When Megan came, Anna had a piece of you possess her as well. Another piece of you is heading to possess Katherine. Your father didn't come home as he left for his assignment while you were at school yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down at the dining room table, and then begin to ponder various ideas in your head, such as 'what do I do next? Should I stick with who I have for right now?'</span></div></div>",

You groan, having just slept on the most uncomfortable bed you've ever slept on, and look at Lulu with exhausted eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t sleep well?\u201d Lulu asks with a small stifled chuckle. You groan and look away as you stand up, wiping off your dress on impulse. You walk towards a sink and look into a mirror to see that you had a rather bad case of bed head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ugh how do women stand having long hair?\u2019 You groan inaudibly to anybody\u2019s ears but your own. Lulu walks up behind you and looks at you in the mirror. You haven\u2019t really taken control of her yet; you really had no reason too, well not at this point at least. Besides if you did you\u2019d probably just let her run on autopilot right now anyway until you'd feel you could work two bodies without drawing suspicion to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Looks like you\u2019ve got a bit of bed head, shall I brush it for you?\u201d Lulu asks as you turn away form your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Sorry, I wasn\u2019t listening...\u201d You reply, still rather tired. Lulu sighs and raises her hands in the air as she shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuna, you need to be more aware of when people are talking, how else will you become a great summoner otherwise?\u201d Lulu explains in a bit of a scolding manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d You frown and are about to apologize but Lulu stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...I suppose, it\u2019s alright, just this once. Now how about we fix that hair of yours?\u201d Lulu asks sincerely. You rub your eyes and nod, taking a seat on the bed from last night. Lulu grabs a comb from a nearby shelf and soon begins brushing your hair. At first it is weird having someone brush your hair for you but you quickly get used to it, and after a few minutes, your hair now looks how it is supposed to. Lulu pulls the comb away one last time and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, much better.\" Lulu says as she turns away to put the comb away. You look into the mirror from before and smile, you do look a lot better, granted your eyes still seemed exhausted, but you figure you'll take a nap on the boat to Kilika. Lulu soon returns to you, and asks you if you are ready to go yet. You nod and walk with Lulu to join the rest of group up on the pass by the save sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you arrive at the boat to Kilika, having seen Tidus receive his Brotherhood sword from Wakka, as well as his fight with Kimahri. You even preformed your first summoning which made you rather proud of yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh!\u201d You chuckle to yourself as you near the boardwalk, recalling the memory. It felt awesome, and you puffed your chest out a bit in triumph when you ordered Valefor to strike the killing blow. Tidus even complimented you which made Yuna\u2019s body blush in response. You yourself didn\u2019t blush but regardless you felt awesome as you strut your stuff down the boardwalk and onto the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes you and the rest of the gang set off, you smile as you walk to the edge of the deck, leaning on the guardrail as you feel the salty air push up against your cheeks. It feels nice, yet, at the same time, it stings a little. You don\u2019t mind, when suddenly, you notice something behind you. You turn around to see several various people, women and children, sailors, ext. all standing before you. They seem to be asking you various questions and also seem to be expecting you to answer them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026well I guess\u2026umm\u201d You don\u2019t know what to say, so you decide to let Yuna take over, just like before in the temple of Besaid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019ll\u2026do my best\u2026for you, Anthony.\u2019 Yuna thoughts reply to you in her usual soft tone. You smile and nod in the midst of switching places as Yuna takes over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes pass, and soon the crowd around you disbands, leaving Yuna, and in turn you, alone. Yuna smiles, and readies herself so you can regain control, when Tidus suddenly walks up to you. You decide to let Yuna proceed as she normally would as Tidus climbs the stairs up to her, stretching his arms and giving a small yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus leans on the guardrail and looks out to the sea. Yuna tries to think of something to say, when you tell her to say that the weather is nice. Yuna nods, and speaks those exact words, albeit a bit slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe weather\u2026it\u2019s nice.\u201d Yuna says. Tidus nods in response, and Yuna smiles. The two then begin to laugh a bit, possibly due to finally having broken the ice together. Yuna then inquires about Tidus being a blitzball player, and it goes off from there.  You kinda zone out in the midst of this, and when you finally do return from wherever the hell you went when you zoned out, Tidus is about to walk away, when suddenly, the ship suddenly shakes violently. Yuna slips and ends up falling, but luckily, Tidus grabs her before she, and in turn you, fall off the ship. Tidus pulls Yuna up, and you take control. You grip the rail and watch as huge waves almost capsize the boat as the boat continues to rock and shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ship shakes once more, this time causing you to fall forward, causing Tidus to lose his grip. You roll forward and slam into the harpoon gun that, in a moment, will be used in a fruitless attempt to steer Sin away from Kilika village. Kimahri sees you hit the harpoon gun and jumps to your side. You look at the blue Ronso and nod, saying you are okay. Your attention then turns to see a huge dorsal fin erupt from the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSIN!\u201d Screams a random passenger behind you, causing you to jump. You watch as Sin moves along side the boat, seeing first hand how monumentally big Sin is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-incredible\u2026\u201d You mutter to yourself in fearful awe. A crippling fear begins to over take you as Sin makes it to the front of the boat. You are only broken out of your trance of fear when Kimahri grabs you and pulls you back as the random crewmember from before runs before you and grabs the Harpoon gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the harpoon shoots out and nails Sin right in the dorsal fin causing it to begin pulling the boat. And here you thought the trip to Kilika would be smooth sailing. It would make you laugh a little if you didn\u2019t know you were about to fight a giant celestial being of mass destruction! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon scales begin to fly toward you, you to ready your weapon and, in a moment of just pure instinct, you grip your staff like a baseball bat and jump on the guardrail. You hear someone, probably Tidus or Wakka, ask just what you were doing as you wind up and swing causing the sin scale you hit to go flying back at Sin! You smirk as a feeling of power replaced your earlier feelings of fear as you jump backwards; Kimahri easily catches you and helps you ready yourself as everyone watches you in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gleeful smirk quickly grows on Tidus face as he readies to repeat the same action as a sin spawn comes barreling at him\u2026 only for it to land on deck, resulting in Tidus just whacking it in the face! You chuckle as Tidus backs away from the now enraged sin spawn foot trooper, Tidus groans, now embarrassed that he screwed up in front of you, as he gets into his normal battle stance, raising his sword before him. Kimahri takes a step in front of you, standing ready to protect you as he twirls his lance before letting out a loud bestial roar causing you, Kimahri, and Tidus to charge forward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip your fist and twirl your staff in your hands just as the first Sin spawn runs toward you, Tidus was about to strike it when you smack it with your staff and deliver a rather weak punch that results in your hand getting a bit scratched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u201d you cry backing away, your hand bleeding a bit due to the enemy\u2019s scaly, armor-like skin \u201cI think I just broke my finger!\u201d However while you were momentarily stunned from tending to your injury the sin scale shot forward and, just as it was about to hit you with it\u2019s wings, Kimahri stepped in and impaled the thing through one of it\u2019s three violet colored eyes causing it to fade into pyre-flies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Kimahri\u201d you say with gratitude, Kimahri nods and holds out his hand to you. You nod and hold out your own as Kimahri drops a potion into your hand. You look up at Kimahri and he nods before jumping into the air, probably to use his <i>Jump</i> command on another sin scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the potion in your hand; it was a small corked bottle with a strange green liquid inside of it. You bite the cork and it opens with a pop. You quickly pour the liquid onto your wounded hand and watch as the scratches on your hand magically seal up, fully restoring your hand to its former beauty. You smile and return to the fight, seeing that Wakka had taken your place up at the front lines. You look and watch as everyone focuses on the foot troopers while the big fin still remained undamaged, well unless you count that sin spawn you sent back at it. You looked back at your comrades and ran forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta go for the fin!\" you shout, at first Tidus was about to raise a question but when a sin scale nearly tackled him he quickly shut up and started using his cheer spell to raise everyone\u2019s strength and defense. Soon he and Kimahri were knocking out the sin scales in little more then one or two hits, but once one scale was destroyed another took its place. If the enemy didn\u2019t turn into pyreflies when they died then the entire deck would\u2019ve been covered in corpses. You try not to think about it as you focus on summoning Valefor while Lulu and Wakka cover you. For a few seconds you twirl your staff and spin around as pyreflies gather around you. Soon the pyre flies ascend into the sky and gather at a particular point as a small twinkle glows in the sky. Soon the mighty Valefor descends fro mthe sky, landing on the deck beside you. You smile and give it a gentle pat on the head before whispering something into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, fight with us\u201d you say and Valefor immediately nods taking to the sky. You smile and shoot your staff forward, pointing at Sin\u2019s massive dorsal fin. Valefor nods and begins her attack! You nod as well and look back at Wakka and Lulu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakka aim for the fin! Lulu use your spells on the fin too!\" you exclaim as you start to cast cura on the party, healing their wounds. Tidus and Kimahri feel themselves being healed and at each other as they turn back to fight the off the seemingly infant amount of sin scales with renewed vigor and strength. Within minutes Kimahri let loose another roared as he drove his spear into another sin scale while Tidus cartwheels forward and preformed his very first overdrive, <i>Spiral Cut </i> on one of the sin scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Valfore with a single command from you, flies off towards Sin and uses her <i>Sonic Wings </i>attack causing a lot of damage, at least a good three hundred point of damages by your guess. Soon you hear a loud monstrous cry as Sin moves around in the water causing the boat to tip towards the right causing everyone to try and catch himself or herself on whatever was closest, Tidus unfortunately lands on his back and starts to roll backwards towards the open sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah\" Tidus screams before suddenly seeing Kimahri shooting his hand forward as he himself grabs onto the guardrail for balance. They lock hands and Kimahri pulls Tidus back onto his feet just in time for Tidus to strike down a sin scale that was about to slash Kimahri in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimahri smiled and nodded, returning the favor by slamming his spear in the ground and using it to pole vault over Tidus and jump kick a sin scale in the head, sending it overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job\u201d Tidus says with a cheer as Sin lets out another roar of pain due to Valefor using a fire spell on its dorsal fin. Sin once again moves causing the boat to tip once again, you grip the guardrail hard but due to the entire front deck now being covered in sea water thanks to Sin\u2019s thrashing around, your grip on the guard rail slips, causing you to fall over board!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuna!\u201d everyone says in unison, minus Kimarhi of course, as you fall over board into the chaotic sea.  Tidus and Wakka run forward just as the rope tied to the harpoon in Sin\u2019s dorsal fin breaks sending the ship into an almost capsizing motion. Tidus fumbles forward and ends up landing in the water with a back plant while Wakka managed to jump ahead of time and dives into the water the proper way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly start to black out as water begins to fill your lungs. You\u2019re vision fades as you watch Tidus and Wakka swim towards you before suddenly just passing out when something exceptionally hard shot through the water and smashed you in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Is she going to be okay?\u201d is the first thing you hear upon waking up from what seems like near death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Tidus?\u201d you say weakly before under going a coughing fit. You hack and cough as seawater is purged from your lungs. You hack and cough like an old woman for at least a few minutes before you feel a gentle hand on your back. You open your teary eyes to see none other than Tidus at your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm h-hey\u2026\u201d Tidus says with a friendly smile \u201cyou alright?\u201d You nod and cough once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling, Yuna? That was a very hectic battle we were just in. Are you alright?\u201d Lulu asks walking up to you. You look up to her, you felt that you were somewhat in control of her; maybe it was automatic while this body was in control but that didn\u2019t really matter now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m *cough* alright. Thank you *cough cough* Tidus\u201d you say between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey~! We\u2019re back\u201d called a voice. You look up to see Wakka and Kimahri walk in; Kimahri was holding a basket of rather juicy looking fruit, which made your stomach growl. Wakka then noticed you were now awake and smiled a wide happy smile \u201cYah! Yuna, glad you\u2019re awake. Can\u2019t be sleeping on the job now can yah?\u201d Wakka joked making you smile. You try to stand up but you\u2019re legs were still a little unresponsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, here. Let me help you up\u201d Tidus says spontaneously. You look at him and give him a cute smile as he helps you stand up wit ha little bit of help from Lulu. The two walk you up to walk and you do a slight bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry for making you all worry.\u201d You apologize much like how Yuna does across most of this game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, umm...no need to apologize. You really helped out\u2026in that last fight I mean\u201d Tidus explains trying to cheer you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah. Besides if you hadn\u2019t called that Aeon when you did we all would\u2019ve been goners for sure\u201d Wakka explains patting you on the shoulders and giving you a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take yourself for granite Yuna.\u201d Explained Lulu \u201cyou are after all the daughter of High Summoner Braska.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah what she said. Now how\u2019s about we head to the next temple and-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has to perform the sending ritual first,\u201d Lulu explained rather blandly, cutting Tidus off in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Alright. Where\u2019s my staff\u201d you ask looking around only to see that it was in Kimahri\u2019s left hand. Kimahri looked down at it and then back at you. He nodded and handed you the staff. \u201cThank you, Kimahri.\u201d Kimahri then sets the basket of fruit down on a nearby table and goes back outside. You hear your stomach growl when you look at the food, your mouth waters. Man why didn\u2019t you eat before leaving on your epic quest to defeat an eldridge abomination the size of a flagship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu chuckles openly for once, getting a odd look from Tidus and Wakka, before she walked over and grabbed a piece of fruit from the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can have this but you\u2019ll have ot eat it before you perform the sending\u201d Lulu explains handing you the fruit. You nod and take a large bite out of the fruit, quickly finishing it in a minute before leaving what you now realize was the inn.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, you remove all of your clothes, and find a good spot to lay down on your back, with your legs spread apart. You shiver slightly as the cold ground touches your body. Everything seems to have double the effect that it did when you were a guy. It is as if your skin is super sensitive. You rub your breasts together and a strange feeling flows through you like you have never felt before. Pleasure. Your nipples grow hard and you feel a wetness increase between your legs. Your left hand reaches down and skims your vagina. Another wave of pleasure blows through your body. It is seriously like nothing you have ever felt before. Your fingers move and insert themselves into your vagina and the wave of pleasure is so strong, you unconsciously let out a moan. Moving your fingers inside of yourself, your fingers touch your clitoris and the pleasure is once again taken up a level as you grind your legs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't remove you fingers from your clitoris anymore. It is addictive. Your fingers begin to move around harder and faster as you squeeze your beasts together, a feeling of tightening goes through your body until everything feels too tightly strung, as if everything is going to come apart, and it does, as your first female orgasm is released. All the while you moan quite loudly, grinding your crotch into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you finish, and you feel incredibly tired, as if you had just run a few miles or something. You don't move as you soak in the after-glows of the orgasm. It is a wonder girls don't masturbate more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your clothes back on after cleaning yourself as best as you can, and you begin to plan your next move.</span></div></div>",

You made sure to avoid everyone down in the part of the pit that Yuna was in except for Lulu, who you possessed while you were down there. Tidus, Rikku, and Wakka haven't seen you, so you stay hiding, and you have a little bit of your liquid self leave Yuna's body and possess Rikku's body so quickly that she doesn't have time to notice what's happened. You have Rikku sneak off without Tidus or Wakka noticing, then all three of your bodies leave Bevelle in secret. Then, afterwards, you can't help but to merge all three of their bodies, so you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have Yuna's main shape, the breasts of Lulu, and the thin waist and butt of Rikku. Your face mostly resembles Yuna's, but Yuna's green eye has a reddish tint to it. Your hair is still Yuna's, and your clothes are mostly like hers, but the shirt is the color of the top part of Lulu's dress, with the fur lining that Lulu has on the top of her dress, and without sleaves. You have Rikku's light brown, elbow-length glove on your left arm, and a dark brown, fingerless glove that on your right hand that is covered with a metal claw over the top half of the glove, with the exception of the wrist, and an orange guantlet is covering the top half of that wrist to half way in between your elbow and shoulder, with dark brown straps on the bottom half of that arm hold the guantlet in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?

You get past the point where Mika reveals that Yevon doesn't follow its own rules, and that he is unsent, then has the group thrown into the Via Purifico. As Tidus, Rikku, and Wakka meet up again and begin talking, you suddenly turn into liquid and land on the floor in a puddle and you could see all around you without moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no!' You think in panic. 'What happened to me?' Suddenly you gain a little bit of knowledge about what you can do, and that you can figure out the rest by thinking about it hard enough. You head towards the TV and enter it, putting yourself in the game. You land in the water, but none of them know about it since you blend in perfectly with the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where should we look for Yuna?\" Rikku asks. You start heading towards her, and no one knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is going to be too easy.' You think as you get right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should wait at the exit?\" Tidus suggests as he begins to swim towards the exit. Rikku leans back for a minute. You then see your chance as you go into her mouth. She shakes a little in surprise, but you have her mouth full so she can't speak and can't scream loud enough for anyone to hear, which is a good thing, because she starts screaming. She tries to spit you out, but you won't come out. You start going down her throat as she struggles more and starts gagging, trying to get you out. It is in vain, as you get all the way down and take control, blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up a couple seconds later to find that you're floating on the water, not seeming to be part of it anymore, you also have a physical form, your body feels smaller in most aspects, and you can't see in every angle while staying still anymore. You get up and feel a weight on your chest and look down. You see that you are wearing Rikku's clothes, and that they are covering up your/her breasts, then you look at your reflection in the water and see Rikku's face looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! it worked!\" You exclaim with Rikku's voice. Suddenly you hear Tidus's voice from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rikku! What's taking so long?\" He asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'm coming!\" You reply. You use the save sphere, and then you begin swimming towards the direction Tidus went, and you are happy. You've never been a very good swimmer, but Rikku is, and right now you are her, and have all of her abilities. Before you can swim too far, the Evrae Altana swims by and goes after Tidus and Wakka, but it doesn't see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Go help Tidus and Wakka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Leave them on their own and have some fun with Rikku's body; you can leave the game and then reset if anything happens anyway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also tell her to let her hair down, so that people won't recognize that she is actually Rikku from the game, you don't want to let anyone get suspicious about your and her secret. She nods at you and lets her hair fall down until it's at the back of her shoulder, she is extremely cute as she put her hair down and you just stare at her for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, please don't stare at me like that, it's embarrassing.\" She tells you, and you notice her face blushing, looking down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow' You thought to yourself. You never thought anything like this would happen, Rikku, blushing, somehow you see her as a 2nd version of Yuna with blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her to dress herself with the clothes you have chosen for her to choose, and you leave the room and head to the living room.

You look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that looks really good on you.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, Thanks... \" She blushes again, and turns her head to the other side, keeping eye contact away from you. She walks down the stairs, and you just stare at her body, completely blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, can we go now?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! Ok, lets go.\" You pick up your car key and head towards your car outside of the house. You start the car, and get ready to head to the mall. You look at Rikku as you are driving. You thought to yourself, 'Wow, she's hot, she's like a completely different person in the game, wow, this is so cool.' After a short while, you reach the mall, you park your car at the parking lot, lock your car, and head inside the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you plan to do with me when we're inside?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to take you to buy some clothes for you to wear, after all, those are my sister's clothes you're wearing.\" You reply. You tell her to head to the clothes store. When both of you arrive, you ask the saleswomen to help Rikku find some clothes for her. She tries different clothes on in store and shows you how it looks, but all you do is nob and say 'nice' to her, because whatever she wears still look good in her. You help her choose some of the clothes and have chosen around 10 sets of clothing, even with bras and panties (You don't go in with her, though). After you're done shopping with her, you decide to play around with her, because she is starting to feel happy after what you have done for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you go around the mall, eat something at the restaurant, watch a movie in the cinemas, and have fun bowling at the bowling center. You feel like this is a date with Rikku, but that ends here, as both of you are tired, and ready to head home, but something hits you before you get into the car, how are you supposed to explain this to your family, she is known as a game character from Final Fantasy X, there is no way you could tell them that she is someone else, and and you'd like her to stay at your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a really bad feeling about this, but you still need to head home with her.</span></div></div>",

Rikku is shocked when she sees your transforming stage on your face uncontrolled. After a while, the pain stops, and you breath heavily. Rikku look at you in surprise as she saw something horrible, you quickly rush to your car side mirror and look at yourself, you shocked as you look at it. You see another Rikku inside the mirror, but something is different, the Rikku you saw, it was you, and you're still wearing your own clothes and your body remains the same as normal. \"Oh My God!\" Is all you can say, and you feel that your voice has changed to Rikku's itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you come up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rikku, I've got an idea, but I need to test if it works or not.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I don't mind if you've got any dirty tricks on your mind, but as long as we can pass your family about this problem, I'm in.\" She tells you with a little giggle, and a grin on her face. You tell her secretly at the side of her ears, no one is able to listen except Rikku. \"What?!\" She shouts as you are telling the plan, and you continue to tell her what would happen too. \"What's that suppose to mean?! Are we really going to do this?! I mean, can it even work?\" She asks you after you've completely told her the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could go for a try, I know it's risky but it won't lose meat, am I right?\" You explain further. After a while she nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, just don't do anything stupid!\" She exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you decide to go for the plan, and you drive off to your house....</span></div></div>",

You both start the plan. You undress yourself, and transform yourself into the liquid form. Rikku opens her mouth, and you slide yourself into her, this means that you are going to possess her again, but this time is different. She accepted to let you have control over her. Last time she struggled for a while as you were taking over her, but this time is different because she doesn't resist you at all. You feel the exact same feeling that you did when you first went into her body and had begun to take control of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you black out as you completely take control of her body, but as soon as she is about to fall down, you wake up in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get back to business.\" You say. You start off by morphing your face again, but with you in Rikku's body. You find it hard at first since it isn't your natural body, but you soon get the hang of it. You start off by transforming her nose, and soon you get it slowly. Her nose changes in shape slowly to yours, and the other parts of her face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around 10 minutes you slowly open your eyes, now you see your own face, covering Rikku's, but somehow you feel strange. You look below yourself and you see Rikku's body has remained the same, a female body, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crud!\" You exclaim. You panic a little, but you slowly calm down. You think that it maybe wrong, but it is the only way to get through your family, so you undress yourself and dress up your own clothes, but you leave the underwear on, since your body is still a female body. You dress yourself up nicely as you look at yourself in the side mirror of your car to see if anything is suspicious about the body you are in now. You can manage to trick your family with the idea that if you bend down a little, that they won't notice the big chest that you have now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work out for a little bit, and it's time to go into the house. You walk up to the door and use your key to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home!\" You shout as you get inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi dear, welcome home!\" Your mom greets you from the kitchen, shouting back at you. \"What are those things inside the plastic bags?\" She asks when she turns around and sees you holding some of the shopping bags that you have the clothes that you bought for Rikku in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing mom, I just went to the mall.\" You tell her, and then you and rush into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut the door, lock it up, and start to transform your face back to Rikku's, a moment later you quickly vomit yourself out and transform yourself back to your original form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was easy.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for you.\" Rikku replies as she holds her head. \"I can't remember anything that happens when you're inside me.\" She is dissoriented from having you inside of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going down to get my dinner, and bring it up here.\" You tell her. She nods at you immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the stairs and to the kitchen where your mom has left your food, since you all usually eat by yourselves. You rush to your room with your dinner, you lock the door again and you just slide down on the door with your back and are eventually sitting at your door, exhausted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's dinner.\" You tell her, you sit beside each other as you eat. \"Well, I feel like I am lucky.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From when I was small up until till now, I haven't had a chance to sit beside a girl alone and have us share the food with each other.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does that means I'm the first person who do something like this with you today?\" She asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I'm feeling very happy.\" You laugh softly as you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you Anthony, for everything, I think I'm feeling better now already.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no problem, if anything happens, then I'll help you out.\" You proudly tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lies her head on your shoulder and wraps her arms around yours. You feel very happy, and very peaceful, everything is so quiet, and the both of you fall asleep sitting on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up, and you see Rikku's sleeping face lying on your shoulder. You slowly move her onto the bed quietly so that you won't wake her up, you go to the bathroom and have a nice morning shower like you usually do, and then you go back to your room, but while you're walking toward your room, you see that your door is already opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is bad, I'm gonna get busted.\" You though. You sneak ahead to your room and watch inside, it is your sister Anna inside, she is staring at Rikku's sleeping face as she wonders why she is on your bed. 'Oh no, what to do! What to do!' You panic and start to lose control of yourself, and when do you realize that you have turned into your liquid form. 'Double Oh No!!! I am going to be so busted!!'</span></div></div>",

What am I going to do?!\" You look at yourself through the mirror beside the door-step of your room, you see the reflection of your blue liquid form lying down on the floor. 'Why does it have to end up like this?' You think to yourself, before anything worse happens, you quickly rush toward your sister, she doesn't notice you as she is focused on Rikku's sleeping body on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no time for playing around since you need to find a solution as quick as possible, you decide to try entering your sister through her mouth, taking possession of her. It may sound risky as you don't know if it'll work on real humans or not, but you need to at least try because it is an emergency, you waste no time sliding yourself under her leg up from the bottom to the top of her body. As Anna is staring at the sleeping Rikku, she also notices that something is crawling up her body and checks it out to see what it is, she rolls up her skirt and sees a blue liquid like thing going up from her bottom part to the breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!! WHAT IS THIS?!\" She shouts loudly, trying to grab you to avoid having you getting to an even higher part of her. But she can't, she only touches you, but can't grab you with her bare hands, because you are a liquid now, just like plain water. As you crawl forward, you reach the front of her head, she struggles hard to swing you off, but it is useless, and you start to move into her mouth as she starts screaming out loud, good thing that your parents have gone to work in this early hour, so nobody can hear anything around this area. You move into her to shut her up and quickly force yourself into her body. Then, you also feel the same thing you did the first time you possessed Rikku. Anna is using all her energy to try to force you out of her body, but it useless since you're already completely inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also find that it is harder to get control of her body because she struggles so much that even though you're inside of her, you can hardly move around in her body. A few seconds later, Anna feels completely lost and falls to the ground, as if she is dead or something. You're completely lost inside of her body, you don't know how to get out of her, and you don't even know if you can get control of her body, you also feel a strange feeling, different from when you were inside Rikku's body, you're frighted that you might have caused Anna's death, and that you're stuck inside of her body and can't come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now in total darkness inside of Anna's body and don't know what to do, but for some reason, you also feel something warm around there, as if Anna's life force is covering yours, and you're also gaining her memories. You flash back into one of her memories. You are inside of a big forest that you regconized that when you small, you always liked to hang around. You also see a boy that is bigger than your current self looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anna, come here quick or you'll be left behind!\" The boy shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D..Don't run so fast big brother, wait up!\" You hear Anna's voice coming from your mouth, as if you're the one who is talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This must be her memory of the past, and she said 'Big Brother', so that must be me from the past.' You think. You had also forgotten how you looked when you were a kid, along with Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here quick Anna! It'll start soon!\" 'You' shout. ( I use 'You' as \"the younger you\" inside of Anna's memory)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Brother!! Ahh~~!\" She falls down onto the floor. \"It's hurt.\" Her leg had a scratch from when she felt down, and started to bleed slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Anna?\" 'You' ask as 'you' turn back and run toward Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really hurts!\" She started to cry as she finished the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it's only a little scratch, here, I'll help you clean it up.\" 'You' use a wet handkechief and rub off the blood that is covering her leg, and tear off some of 'your' shirt into one small piece and tie it up where the injury is, \"There, all done.\" 'You' say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you brother.\" Anna smiles weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, come on, I'll carry you there.\" 'You' carry her up and walk forward slowly deep into the forest. A few minutes later, both of you reached the destination, it was your secret place that you usually went to when you felt bored. When 'you' put Anna down, there are fireworks blown up into the sky, they are really amazing fireworks. Now you remember, it was five years ago when both of were you still very small, it was the first day that you took your sister to your secret place to see the fireworks that she always wanted to see, she was so happy that she just keeps smiling, sitting beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwhile later, you begin to flashback again, but you come back to your sense of where you were before you went into Anna's memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, hello? Are you okay?\" You hear Rikku calling you. You awake and slowly get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...yea, I'm fine now.\" You say, but something's different, it's not your voice, it's your sister's. When you come back to yourself, you notice that you are inside of Anna's body, you what just happened. It was a success, you took possession of your sister's body, and it's time to get this mess cleaned up.</span></div></div>",

And what just happened?\" You feel strange because Rikku asked how the hell you were with that voice of hers, it was like she didn't even know you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the one who screamed just now and woke me up in the first place, and why are you in Anthony's room? Are you his relative of something?\" She is even more suspicious, since she knew that a lot of people know who she is, she can't hide the fact that the girl in front of her might know who she is too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that question confuses you even more, \"Huh? I screamed? Did you hit your head or something?\" You ask, then again, she really doesn't have a clue that you are Anthony and you are inside your sister's body, and are controlling her. Since that happened, you play along with her a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should ask you that first in the first place, who are you, why are you in my house, and sleeping in Anthony's bed? You look really familiar, with that face of yours, do I know you somehow?\" You ask her looking stupid as like you didn't have a clue what happen that was drawn at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I...me.....\" She blushes and hides under the blanket. 'that hit the spot.' You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you hiding under my brother's bed? Get off it!!\" You shout, but for unknown reasons. Maybe your sister's consciousness is still there and she had no idea that you are inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What am I going to do? Anna's conscious is still awake, I need to find a way to put her to sleep, if not this is going to be a hell dream for me.' You think. 'Wait, a dream?.... Oh I have an idea now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is a dream, this can't be real... This Is Only A Dream.' You tell Anna's subconscious which soon makes her believe it, and at the same time, you try and succeede in regaining control of her body, \"UHHHH~~~~~~!!!\" She falls down again, and this time, you really are in control of her body, and make her consciousness go into sleep state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that was close.\" You tell yourself, and call for Rikku who is still hiding under your blanket. \"It's ok now Rikku, come out, it's me Anthony.\"<br>\r\nYou told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly rolls down the blanket and looks at you.\"Huh? You're the girl? You can't be possible are Anthony!?\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think I am? Don't you remember who brought you here?\" She is silent as she hears what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you scream at me if it was you Anthony?\" She asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is....because I lost control of her body and she regained control.\" You looks at the floor scratching your head, looking confused thinking. 'How did she do that?' \"We'll talk about this later, I feel extremely weird down here.\" You press on your belly, your sister's belly. Rikku stared at you for a moment, and then she laughs. \"Hehehe, I think it's because your sister's body is having a period. I can see though it since I am also a woman.\" She giggles as she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? A Period? No Way!! I do not want to handle my sister's period date!! Ugh!!\" You suddenly feel pain. \"I think I'm going to die if I keep this body any longer, I'll take her back to her room and make her think that this is all a dream.\" You rushed to Anna's room, altered her memory a little, and make her think it is normal for Rikku to be here and that she is a friend of yours, making no connection to the video game character, and put her body to sleep. When you've done it, you relax on her bed, and eventually feel that you are no longer feeling any human sense, you slowly crawl out of the tiny hole that is your sister's mouth, and out from the tiny hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you jump down to the floor in your liquid form, you slowly rematerialize yourself to your human form, as you do Rikku shouts and says she will make the breakfast for three, that includes your sister's since she is still at home. When you finish becoming yourself again, you slowly walked outside the room and close the door silently so you won't wake Anna up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you do so you look into the alarm clock that is in her bedroom, it is already 10 in the morning, 'Wow, how long did I pass out in her body? Oh well.' You think to yourself, and you walk to the kitchen to help out Rikku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily your parents are out, so I don't need to hide like a thief in your house. Hehe.\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not really that lucky anyway, we were almost discovered by my sister that you're here.\" You tell her, then you tell her about how you changed Anna's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Anna comes down and looks at the two of you.</span></div></div>",

Brianna would be okay with meeting Rikku.' You think. Brianna is one of your best friends. She plays games with you all the time, takes you to A-cons, and is an overall cool gal. Would she be okay with meeting a girl from FF. Maybe she could help you out with the whole situation... but what if she takes it wrong... and does something you'll regret... well you could always possess her... and erase her memories... so this might just work! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around you call Brianna downstairs.

Rikki and Brianna square off for a moment before Brianna steps forward, always the aggressor and taps Rikki on the nose. Rikki flinches for a moment and smiled at Brianna. Suddenly Rikki's smile fades as Brianna turns around and give you a look that completely shocks you.</span></div></div>",

She sits there for a few more minutes, before she clears her throat, stands up and looks down at you and Rikku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

She takes her hand and holds it out, locking eyes with her. \"Rikku... please... let me live your life... for a small... nearly limited... short... short short... amount of time... pleeeease.\" She says in a pleading tone. Rikku just smiles up at you, like a lost child and Brianna turns giving you the puppy dog eyes as well. You're kind of taken aback as Brianna stands up, brings Rikku over to you and squeezes your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... Anthony... let me be Rikku... I will... I will stop calling you Nathan... for the rest of your life... I will... I'll be your wife... I'll marry you... and make love to you... every day... if you make me Rikku.\" She says with love in her eyes. Rikku looks over her shoulder at you, with fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be making that love to him... in my body?!\" Rikku asks trying not to freak out too much. Brianna just smiles at you. You are going to decline her the chance to be Rikku, not because you are trying to be mean but because it might cause too many problems. You open your mouth to say your decision but then Brianna does something that totally shifts your thoughts. She grabs the back of your head and kisses you. It is crazy. You have the occasional thoughts about her, and now she is wrapping her tongue around yours. You close your eyes as you let Brianna have her way with you. About 3 minutes later she pulls herself off of you and licks her lips. You just smile at her as Rikku gives you what looked like a look of disappointment. You try and clear your thoughts as Brianna steps up to you again and whispers in your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me Rikku... and there'll be much more of that...\" She says trying to make you even harder. Rikku steps up to you and stands at your other ear trying to dissuade you, but you've already made up your mind.</span></div></div>",

Brianna starts jumping up and down with joy as Rikku stands at your side, eagerly trying to change your mind. You just take Brianna's hand and looked into her still extremely giddy face. You take Rikku's arm as well and take a deep breath as both of them become silent. \"Okay look, Rikku. This is only temporary. She'll have your body for 24 hours. After that I'll take her out and you'll have your life back.\" You then turn to Brianna and begin on her speech. \"Look... Brianna, just remember that Rikku is going to have to live with her life after you leave, so don't do anything stupid in her body. Also, don't go around acting like Rikku, while in her body.. your name is gonna be Rikki, and you're my friend from out of country... Okay?\" You ask trying to set all the basics. She just nods vigorously, upsetting her hair. You take a few steps back as your hand turns to liquid. \"Alright, Let's go.\" You say, trying to sound as bad ass as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna just stands by your water hand, which was slowly spreading to your entire body, shrinking you down to liquid. Brianna just stares down at you in surprise. If you had lips, you would curl them into a smile as you slowly creep up Brianna's leg. You can feel her entire body shiver as she feels the wetness of your body, but she can't see any actual water running down her leg. Eventually you make your way up to her shoulder as she shakily opens her mouth. You can see Rikku smiling at Brianna with a twinge of malice in her eyes, almost enjoying Brianna's uncomfortable face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... Maybe we shoul...\" Brianna tries to say before you ram your liquid form straight into her mouth and down her throat. She tries to scream and sputter to get you out of her body, but this being your 4th possession, you are beyond prodigious at this. Faster than usual, you take over her nervous system. Opening her tight eyes, you look around and see a still smiling Rikku. Stretching in Brianna's body, you get used to the way she moves and the particular taste of her body. Not exactly a taste, but each body has a different essence to it, you wouldn't think so but they do. Walking your way towards Rikku you're stopped by her putting two arms up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony... wait... before you do what you're about to do... listen to me. You don't have to put her inside of me... you can just alter her appearance... I'm sure you've wanted to practice it more. Alter her appearance and make her think she's me.. and then change me into Rikki, and let everything progress naturally from there.\" She says, smiling a bit as her idea seems to make you stop and think. You just look at her for a second as you roam through your thoughts, trying to siphon out Brianna's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Open your mouth... and we can get this started.\" You say, admiring how Brianna's voice sounds coming out of your own cherry flavored lips. You feel a spot somewhere near your thighs get softer and softer the more you think of how you are in Brianna's body, even to the point that it starts feeling a bit wet . Rikku opens her mouth, honoring your choice. She is being really cool with this, which is why you are going to press forward. And besides, this is a cool way to see what would happen if you put someone who didn't have your power, in a non-realistic body. Taking a deep breath you try to return to a liquid form  You go through a familiar process and turn your entire body to liquid. This time it's easier around than it was trying to morph Rikku's body into yours. Brianna's body seems to take on the liquid process easily, and you slip through Rikku's mouth and and run down her throat. You soon feel yourself taking hold of Rikku's body, but something's extremely wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony... what is going on... I ow... my head hurts... ah... ow. Make it stop... Make it... Make it stop!!\" Brianna screams from somewhere inside your mind. You don't know what to do. You make the guess that since Brianna has been possessed and then possessed someone else, all rapid fire she can't get used to the fact that she has two different minds merged and then one dominating her own, she just can't take it. You just take a deep breath as you focus on exiting yourself from Rikku's body. It is a rough trip, trying to get out. Rikku herself wants to help get you out, and yet Brianna is trying to hold you in, trying to keep you there to heal her pain. You have managed to turn yourself to liquid inside Rikku, and are climbing your way out of her throat, when Brianna goes limp inside of Rikku, and your mind is flooded with memories that aren't your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!

You understand some words, but you don\u2019t understand them all. But that isn\u2019t the point. You don\u2019t know where you are, you can\u2019t see Rikku or Brianna anymore, just the girl and a few other students around her age, and for some other reason you are extremely sad. In retaliation to the girls remarks, you yell back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream back as you feel tears run down your face \u201cCallarse Marivi! Usted no sabe nada sobre mi madre!\u201d <i>(Rough Translation: \u201cShut up Marivi! You don\u2019t know anything about my Mother!\u201d)</i> You are shocked at the fact that you are speaking in another language, and can't understand all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just grins at you as she turns around and scampers around the class yelling in Spanish, which you seem to be understanding more and more of. \u201cMomma de Brianna dej\u00f3 le!

You run into a bathroom and sit there crying for what seems like hours. Eventually you hear a familiar voice calling out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnthony\u2026. Anthony wake up! Anthony\u2026 Anthony!!\u201d You hear an incessant voice call out before feeling a strong hand strike you across your face. Jolting awake from what seems to be a dream you look up into Rikku\u2019s smiling face. You shake yourself awake as you sit up and shake your head. Looking around you, you see the familiar setting of your backyard. Running a few fingers down your face you don\u2019t feel any tears or the grooves you\u2019d get from crying nonstop for hours. You just look up in Rikku\u2019s bright face for a moment when the reality of the situation comes back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god\u2026 Brianna\u2026 What happened\u2026\u201d You say, still waking up.

The gloves -which you somehow know to be made of leather- cover a large part of your arm, reaching the elbows. \u201cI don\u2019t wear gloves...\u201d Again, the mature, cool, womanly voice comes from your lips.

While the credits were playing, I turned into liquid, entered the game, and blacked out. When I woke up, I was in a room that I recognized as Princess Peach's room, and I realized that this was after the game, I noticed that I saw Princess Peach, but she hadn't seen me yet, obviously, she hadn't been in there long, and she was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a hurry to hide, I decided to go hide in her dress, but also be careful so that she wouldn't feel me. I slithered up to her, went under her dress, and got on the under side of her dress. She then moved and part of me landed on her leg. She didn't seem to notice, and began walking to a bathroom. I slid up her leg, being careful not to be noticed, and soon I found myself up close to her vagina. I got the urge to go into her vagina instead of just being on her skirt, so I slithered up to into her vagina. She screamed, but no one could hear her, and then everything went black. I awoke feeling weird, as well as lying on the ground. I got up and noticed a heavy feeling on my chest, so I looked down to see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is going on?!\" I shouted, because I saw that I had boobs, and that I was wearing Peach's dress. Then I realized that it was Peach's voice that came out, and I realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do next?</span></div></div>",

You can control both women as if they are merely an extension of your own body, like your arms. Deciding to have some fun with this new information, you have Candice's body kneel down with a smile on her face, hand extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Cynthia?\" You have her ask, voice laced with amusement and faux concern. With Cynthia, you take her hand and Candice pulls you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks for that.\" You reply through Cynthia, straightening out her clothes. \"Adding me, I mean.\" You add with a grin, but you already know what you mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Candice replies nonchalantly, waving you off. \"It wasn't a big deal, though I feel kinda guilty for scaring you like that.\" You say sheepishly through the Gym Leader, rubbing the back of her head in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you can see, that's not a problem anymore, now is it?\" You say with Cynthia's mouth, placing her hand on her hip. \"It feels nice to be a part of this little gang, even though it's only just the two of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it won't be for long.\" You reply through Candice, crossing her arms in front of her chest, and pushing out her breasts, which you've enlarged slightly by putting some of your liquid self in that area and expanding it, and you have done for Cynthia as well, although they were a descent size to begin with, as the anime made them smaller than they normally are, and this is the game world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get some more members, but the question is: who?\" Cynthia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep both of your hosts silent as you ponder the question, and you make them look like they are too; it feels nice to be able to talk to yourself through your puppets, and using them as a means to sort out your thoughts, while having a little fun at the same time. A few minutes pass before Cynthia breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's not think about that right now, let's just have some fun with our new boyfriend and master before we start expanding our circle.\" She coos as they both spit out a piece of you, both of which form into a copy of your original body, so that you have one for each. Both of them begin sauntering up to one of the copies of your normal body and stood there, letting you are getting a feel for it by running your hands up and down their bodies and squeezing their breasts lightly, causing them to moan. You then had Candice and Cynthia return the favor by having both clasp one of the copies of your original body in a hug and then leaning in to give the copy they were with a long passionate kiss on the lips. Soon you have all four stroking and cuddling each other on the floor, whispering sweet nothings incoherently into each other's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, having your own set of girls to play with is nice. It also relieves a lot of stress he had been feeling lately, especially with girls (Amy, Brianna and Katherine above all others). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in control of both the girls, you knew what felt the best for both of your bodies and where to touch and stroke for optimum pleasure. You continued this for a while, every so often making out with the body they were with, but you eventually stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get back on track, shall we?\" You suggest through Cynthia, having standing up to straighten herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You have Candice say in mock disappointment, standing her up and having her straighten herself up as well, making sure she looked good enough using Cynthia's eyes and vice versa, followed by both copies of your original body fuse back together and also standing up and doing the same as your other bodies did, by using both of their eyes. \"So we can get...\" You trail off, running through Candice's memories, which have been steadily revealing themselves to you since you've been inside her, and coming faster with you trying. \"Nurse Joy from the Pokemon Center, there's also Officer Jenny, and that's probably a good starting point.\" Cynthia seems to contemplate this before turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one do you want to add, master?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it look like you are thinking about it, then you open your mouth to speak, however, this entire conversation has been pointless, because you've already chosen your next addition.</span></div></div>",

You nod and shift a quick smile before turning towards the kitchen where you find some hot chocolate already made, as if Candice had made some before you possessed her. You grab the two cups and walk into the living room where Cynthia had put her feet up and was lying back in the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do I do?' You ask yourself. \"I could easily possess her now, but maybe I should play it safe for now and keep things going.\" You look at Cynthia, who was starting to nod off when you approached the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it me?\" She mumbles in her sleep, with tears going down her face. You wonder what she's talking about before she continues. \"Why is it that I'm the one of the only girls I know that's never had a boyfriend... Am I destined to be alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the hot chocolate down on the living room table, and then you walk to the hall closet to find a few blankets, which you happily take. You walk back and lay the blankets on the couch before Cynthia rolls over in her sleep which startles you for a moment, however, she soon she begins crying even worse. You decide it is best not to possess her for the time being and just merely comfort her in her time of need.

You pick up the phone and dial in you own number or at least you pretend to and then begin to talk into the phone with nobody on the other line. \u201cHello Anthony\u201d you say. \u201cYeah long time no see\u201d you chuckle \u201cwell I was wondering if you were still single and also was wondering if you would like to come over for breakfast?\u201d A small pause goes threw the air before you continued the fake phone call \u201cSo will you? Yes, okay so see you in about thirty minutes. Alright goodbye\u201d you hang up the phone and Cynthia is ready to jet for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo did you tell him about  me\u201d Cynthia asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo but I have a feeling he already knows what he is in for\u201d you say smiling suspiciously but Cynthia doesn't notice as she is wrapped in her own little worlds think about well you(No not Candice/You the regular you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes go by you say to Cynthia that you were going to step out for a bit leaving Cynthia alone with Anthony when he finally gets there. As you leave the front door you quickly dart into the bushes and separate a piece of yourself from you and make it turn into your original body then switching over your main body to the original.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell better not be late\u201d Candice says to you chuckling as you start towards the front door \u201cHey one last thing...\u201d You turn around and suddenly lock lips with Candice \u201cWait what are you doing\u201d you say pushing Candice away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry my mistake I thought you had something on your lip oh well\u201d Candice says shrugging you off. \u201cI'm going to the store for a few supplies because I seem to be out of food.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I looked at myself for a moment longer then began to walk towards dry land. However, being unaccustomed to the unfamiliar weight on my chest, I accidentally lost my footing and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" I cried out in Dawn's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fell into the water. It was not very deep but I hit my head on a rock and found myself too dizzy to get up for a minute. Once the spinning in my head faded, I was able to get up again, but all of Dawn's clothing was wet to the skin. I could feel a chill as a cool spring breeze picked up. I picked up Dawn's beanie, which had fallen off when I slipped, and continued to walk more carefully to dry land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a stroke of bad luck!\" I thought out loud. \"If I don't get out of these wet clothes soon, I'll catch a cold. So would Dawn, if I'd decide to leave her body like this.\" I mentally kicked myself, then thought. 'I should have known boys and girls have different centers of gravity because of their body proportions.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a low sigh, shivering from the cold, and began to search for a suitable place to get undressed for a while. I found a large clump of bushes at the edge of a nearby tree grove and hurried over to it. I carefully searched to be certain there was no poison ivy or ant hills then looked about to ensure I was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will not be good if someone sees me without any clothes on.\" I said, quietly. \"With my luck today, it'll be some pervert or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, pushing the thoughts out of my mind, then placed Dawn's bag on the floor and opened it. I was hoping to find a change of clothing or, at the very least, a towel to wrap myself in. No such luck. I was stuck in the open with no fresh clothing and nothing to dry myself with inside of a girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI again sighed and thought, \"I better get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unzipped the short pink skirt at the side and carefully stepped out of it, revealing Dawn's pink lace panties. I blushed, seeing them then forced my mind to focus upon the task at hand. I took a loose branch from the ground and used it to brush off a low, sturdy branch before neatly hanging the pink skirt onto it to dry. I then hung up the beanie and removed the scarf.  I took a moment to look at it, hoping it was not as wet as the other clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can use this to dry myself off with...\" Unfortunately, the scarf was just as drenched and I hung it up as a frustrated sigh escaped my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then pulled off the black shirt and wrung it out before hanging it up as well, and then I slowly pulled off the white T-shirt underneath. As I did, I heard a rustle in the bushes. I let out a low gasp and turned, using the white T-shirt I had just removed to cover Dawn's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was expecting a young boy or a man to come out and see me stripped down to Dawn's bra and panties. Instead, I saw a wild Magby step out of the tree grove. It turned to me, curious as I let out a low sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You startled me, little guy.\" I said in Dawn's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an idea formed in my head. and I slowly hung up the white T-shirt, so not to frighten the Magby, and knelt down in front of him. The Magby tilted its head slightly, still curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little guy.\" I said, in Dawn's voice, trying to sound as friendly as I could. \"I'm afraid I fell into the water over there and got myself really wet. Do you think you can help me out before someone sees me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magby scratched his head, looking confused. \"Mag?\" It said, as if asking a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, frustrated. 'I might have guessed.' I thought. 'The little guy doesn't understand a single word I'm telling him. I'm wasting my time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another cold breeze came by, forcing me to shiver. I sneezed then shivered again, more harshly as I felt a pounding in my head. The Magby looked at me then hurried off, back into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm catching a cold already.\" I said quietly. \"And the Magby ran away. This is just not turning out to be a very good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crouched down, hoping the bushes would offer some protection from the wind but, again, no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I should have just watched TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to cry in Dawn's body. Then, I felt a warmth near me on one side, a moment later, I felt a warmth on my other side. I looked up, tears still flowing from Dawn's eyes and was surprised to find two Magbys warming me with flames they created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did understand me.\" I said, in Dawn's voice. \"And you brought a friend to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wiped the tears from Dawn's eyes and smiled. \"Thank you!  Thank you so very much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magby returned my smile, as did the other. \"Mag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed the side's of Dawn's arms, then her legs, speeding up the drying process then looked up at her clothes. They were not dripping as much as they were earlier. I figured they would be completely dry within a few minutes. Then, I spotted some movement and was about to gasp but one of the Magbys placed a reassuring hand on Dawn's shoulder and pointed. There was a third Magby keeping watch so I would not be disturbed while I dried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'These wild Pokemon really do care about others, even in the game world.' I thought. 'I guess there is a lot I still do not understand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, Dawn's clothes were dry and I was able to slip back into them. I thanked the Magby again and they all gave a quick wave of farewell, then ran off, back into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So many things go on in the game world that players just do not see.' I thought. 'I wonder what other surprises are waiting for me.'</span></div></div>",

I took my time taking my underwear off because I wanted to savour the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found a mirror in Dawn's walk in wardrobe and looked at myself naked, I saw Dawn looking back with a perverted look on her face.

I shoved Dawn's fingers up her vagina and it instantly felt amazing. I decided that I wanted to stay as Dawn for a long time, but I decided that I should focus on the task at hand.

I went under her skirt, then I melted into her tights and went into her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever is going on, it tickles!\" She said as she giggled despite herself. \"Help me!\" I finished entering her, and then she fainted. After a couple of minutes, I awoke in Rose's body, and I looked at her body, her boobs weren't too big, so I expanded more of myself into them to make them bigger, and they grew, it felt amazing, but that wasn't what my task was. My task was to have sex with myself. First as Rose, then as Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was looking forward to the sex, as I felt my newest vagina get wet, so, I took off Rose's clothes, the bra and the tights were the hardest to do, but after three minutes, Rose was naked. I'd already undressed and I already had a boner, so all I had to do was to shove my dick up her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like having the whole package, so I started with the sex. As I shoved my dick up her vagina, I screamed in pain for a moment as I felt her body lose her virginity, but I soon started moaning as I pumped my dick up her vagina, in and out, in and out, it was wierd feeling it from both perspectives, but it was fun. Then I moaned with her body in that sexy way a girl does, and I felt like pumping it harder, so I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, I flipped Rose's body around, and did some anal work by shoving my dick up her butt, while holding on to her hips with my normal arms, and bracing her body against a wall with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I did the oral sex, and slammed my dick into her throat so forcefully that it touched the back of her throat, making me feel like I was going to choke from how sudden it was, I then used her mouth to suck on my dick as I used her tongue to lick over it, and it felt amazing, both sucking someones dick as a girl, and getting my dick sucked by someone. I had an idea of what to do next, but I didn't know if I was going to do it.</span></div></div>",

Then if I leave and reset, would there be another Dawn on here whose body I'd be in?\" You decided to try, and mentally bring up the option menu, and then you select save and go through the whole process. \"It worked.\" You said with a grin, being careful not to be too loud so that the other people in the Poke Center don't hear, because that would draw attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the PC and began taking out all of the boxes that have Pokemon in them. You began grinning. You left the game, which caused all of the people in the building who were around to look around in surprise. When you got out, you grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time to erase any evidence that anything odd happened.' You said with Dawn's voice as you pressed the power button, turning the DS off. You then turned the DS back on and selected to play Diamond. As soon as you begin playing you instantly start seeing things from two different pairs of eyes, and felt two bodies, although they were exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, it worked.' You had the Dawn body in the game say, but once again, you are careful to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, it did!' You said through the Dawn body in your room, practicing having conversations between your bodies so that people won't get suspicious. 'You go through the game and find more girls to possess, and I'll start playing through other games for the same reason.' You had the Dawn body in the game nod as that body began walking, although, since you had no experience of being in two bodies at once, you had a hard time controlling both. That, along with the fact that you still weren't used to having the extra weight of Dawn's breast on both of your chests, made it so you began stumbling. You started to fall, but the nurse caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you ok?' The nurse asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, thanks.' You said with your face pointing towards the ground. You had split the part of yourself that was inside your second Dawn body in two, and were bringing some of it up your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why are you facing down?' The nurse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, no reason.' You said with a grin. You looked out of the corner of your eyes and saw that no one was looking in your direction. You quickly turned your head in her direction, and then spat the new part of you out. It hit where you wanted: Right inside her mouth. She tries to scream, but can't get it out since you had her mouth full. Before she could put up a fight, you had gotten all of the way down and taken control. Your new body blacked out, but your second Dawn body woke your nurse body up fast enough so that no one noticed. Both of your bodies grinned at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to heal your Pokemon?\" You asked through your nurse body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you mam.\" You replied through your second Dawn body politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will your next body come from?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Controlling three bodies at once was difficult, but after a fair amount of practice, it became easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what about transport? You needed a way to get around, maybe make an army, or whatever you want. One place you can do that. The cops sure do have good cars... and Officer Jenny was no exception, although, you don't want to raise any questions about why she'd be driving a couple other people around in her police car when it is meant only for police officers and the criminals the arrest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(As Dawn) You left the Pokemon Center, and headed to the nearby police station. Once inside, a receptionist quickly directed you to Jenny's Office. Well, that made it easier. When inside, you closed the door, and she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes... In more ways than you can imagine...\" You replied. Giving a direct stare at Jenny for two seconds, you spat at her, your 'liquid' went straight into her slightly opened mouth. She tried to cough it out, but you were quite simply, too powerful, and once that part of you had gone down her throat, she was yours. You then had four bodies of three (considering that two of the bodies were of the same girl) rather hottttt girls... Lucky guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that be all?\" You smiled to Dawn as Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\" You replied as Dawn. As Jenny, you grabbed the keys to her motorcycle from her desk and had both bodies walk outside to it. Luckily there was a spare helmet that your Dawn body could use, which you put on the head of said body, and after making sure that both bodies were on the motorcycle well, you took off. You, as Nurse Joy, who had thankfully finished for the day, left the Pokemon Center and went to the house of your Officer Jenny's body. All three bodies got in her normal car, with Jenny driver's seat, Joy in the front, and Dawn in the back. Things were starting to get TOTALLY awesome. And the best part? You were all of them AT ONCE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, where too now? You had a choice. Either, take control of Misty all of the way in Kanto, or return to real life for some 'testing'...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Misty...? Neaaaa... Maybe later. You returned your focus to real life. This was cool... except no one would except you knew who you were. Oh well, there were two 'friends' that you could invite around (there were others, but you knew they were all busy at the moment)... Amy, for starters. She WAS kinda hot, and since you could more/less control girls lives, well, your bonus! Amy wasn't really your friend; the girl (who appeared to be a goth) had just recently moved in nearby, and she kept to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out the mobile that was conveniently in your pocket, (As Dawn, remember) left Dawn's body for the most part, but keeping some of you inside of her, and called. \"Amy, it's me, Anthony. Can you come around for a second? I got something you might like...\" You said in a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever.\" Amy said in a bored tone. \"There's nothing to do at my place anyway.\" After about two minutes of waiting on your part, she was knocking on the door. Happily opening the door now, you let Amy in... \"Alright, whats so amazing Anthony?\" She asked in a very bored voice. You took one look at her, and the instant she opened her mouth, you launched a part of yourself in liquid form into it. It grew VERY quickly until it covered her mouth. She was screaming, (although no sound came out past the liquid) but there was nothing she could say or do, you were forcing yourself down her throat, and then she collapsed to the ground as she fainted. It wasn't long however, till you, as Amy, woke up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... These boobs are better than I thought!\" You said, as Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, review of whom you control: Two Dawns, one in Pokemon, one in real life, a Nurse Joy, an Officer Jenny, and now Amy. That's five people! Wow... talk about a serious 'fan club'... However, when you stood up as Amy, you took one look at yourself (And saw yourself looking back) and pushed your normal body against a wall with your Amy body, kissing yourself hugely. The amazing thing about that was that you could literally have sex any way you wanted, being in control of both bodies at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** Temporarily, for some scenes, I will refer to the characters in Third Person, referring to a character as the body they're in, just to make it easier. I revert at the end of each chapter ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony pulled all of Amy's clothes off, and he discovered that what he thought was a black dress was really a long black jacket, and that she was wearing a blue shirt underneath it. Amy liked where that was going. Anthony literally had the full job with Amy, and this whole sex lasted over 10 minutes of total joy for Anthony, while using his abilities to make it so that Amy wouldn't get pregnant, but once he was sitting on the couch, pants open, he thought, 'I wonder if I can alter her memories...?' Suddenly, as Amy, it was almost as if a whole G.U.I of her life came up... He could even see the most recent part about the sex, but there was something else interesting that he could change. Her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** Okay, now I revert back to original... ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone. She was now, quite literally, your mind slave. To do your loyal bidding. Leaving her body and returning your liquid to yourself, you quickly had it recombined with your normal body. Amy was staring at you, awaiting your command, which was odd for her to take commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy... make me something to eat, will you?\" You said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Anthony! Absolutely! Thank you so much for this wonderful task!\" Amy replied, unusually happy at the task. She ran to the kitchen (still naked since you had taken her clothes off, luckily the kitchen windows were closed and you had a large amount of land, so no one should be able to see inside) and started cooking... you only wanted a sandwich... yea, you were getting more than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccidentally, you had taken your notice off what was happening in the Pokemon World. The girls, sitting in the car, were slowly driving to Cerulean City, a quick glance at memories revealed that they got to Kanto by way of teleportation by the Mewtwo you'd sent from Fire Red (who, by the way, knows the truth about you, but since you were the one who had been playing the game, he considers you his trainer).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, if I'm correct, did I mention two people to invite over? Yes I did. Picking up the phone again, you punched in the one person who would go insane over the idea. Michael. He was about the same height as you, brown short hair, and LOVED Pokemon. Like most other guys, he liked women as well. And most of all, he liked the girls FROM Pokemon. His dream = about to come true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, you like Dawn right?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" Michael replied over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to my house... I have a SUPRISE!!!\" You said quite happily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... this better be good...\" He said in disbelief as he hung up. You thought of a prank to pull, and went back inside of Dawn completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Michael did arrive, you greeted by opening the door, and giving him a kiss on the cheek. When he finally came to terms with WHO kissed him, he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Is Anthony around... Dawn...?\" He was wide eyed. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing even more confusing, you replied by saying \"Yes, actually. Guess who's piloting Dawn...!\" You replied, inviting him in, he was very stunned as he realized that it was you<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"How did you DO that?\" He asked in disbelief, before his eyes went wide. \"I was kissed by another guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I dunno how to explain, it's a long story, and I'm a girl right now, so there's no problem, and it was funny to see your reaction.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" He replied to what you said about being a girl at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, want to go to the Pokemon World?\" You asked. He was getting more worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU can DO that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, how do you think I got this body?\" You asked, taking him by the arm. You grabbed your Nintendo DS, and then you sent both of you in. Two Dawns in Pokemon. Sweeeeeeeeet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you were all in the car. Michael in the middle back seat, Jenny in the drivers seat, Joy beside her, and both Dawns on either side of Michael, the main you being on the right side. All the girls (You as them), with the exception of Jenny, who was still driving and had to keep her eyes on the road, turned around and said \"Hi Michael!!!\" Directly afterwards, both Dawn bodies kissed him on the cheeks at the same time, just to mess with him again. He blushed. Jenny laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Anthony... let me get this straight, we are in the Pokemon World, and you are controlling Dawn? One of them?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one Michael.\" You replied with your first Dawn body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm controlling all four bodies!\" You continued with your Jenny body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And its gonna get better!\" You continued as Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna be Misty?\" You asked with your second Dawn body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, from this Michael was stunned. Being Misty? WOW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second, what was his response?</span></div></div>",

The conversation there though, was rather interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Anthony, wait, what should I call you?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call the characters by their real names, with the exception of the main body, which I'll be keeping as such for now...\" Dawn replied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Might make it kind of easier...\" Joy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Jenny replied. (Far out! Driving while controlling four people was hard!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one would that be?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be me.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't call you Anthony like that, can I Ton-\" He began teasingly, before he was interrupted by you as you glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Toni, and I won't let you possess anyone.\" You said. The only thing that annoyed you more than being called Tony, or Toni in this case, is how Brianna kept calling you Nathan. \"Just call me Anne, in case you begin to slip up and come close to saying Anthony.\" Michael nodded, then turned to Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Joy... can I have sex with you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over my flaming dead body... This body is too perfect...\" Joy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Jenny?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Dawn? What about you?\" He wasn't foolish enough to ask your main body with how you were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not having sex with any male aside from my original body.\" Dawn replied. \"I can let you do a good bit if I put this body on autopilot, but no sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good with that, I guess, I'll have my own female body soon.\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut off the connection with Dawn and put her on autopilot. She then took off her seat belt and started making out with Michael in the backseat. When your group finally reached Cerulean City, you had Dawn stop, then re-opened the connection, and she calmly sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here! Ready for it Michael?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last question... can I be her in real life?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but you cant change back without my help.\" Joy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or mine!\" Dawn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget me!\" Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it was kind of a silly question since you saw me in this body in the real world.\" You stated, causing him to sweat drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the girls walking into the gym, Michael trailed on behind, slightly afraid actually. Jenny approached Misty, who was sitting on the edge of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty! You're under arrest for not being possessed!\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Posse-...? Wha-?\" Misty began, totally confused, but Joy, Dawn, and Jenny manhandled her and brought her over to Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your punishment is to be possessed!\" Jenny stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to Michael, took his hand, turned him into liquid, and then placed him on Misty's hand. Within seconds, Michael had slithered over her hand, her arm, and into her mou-... Nope, he started going down, straight into the vagina! After about a minute of an unconsciousness for Misty, she woke with a start, but Michael was in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony...? Is that you? Oh my gosh... its not a dream! I'm Misty!!!\" Michael said in shock and joy. Michael stood up, Jenny and Joy letting go. Michael looked herself over. \"Dangit! These breasts are flatter than I thought!\" You placed your hand on Michael's new breasts, stirred up the liquid form, and made it cause the breasts to expand, luckily Misty had been wearing a stretchable swim suit when she was possessed. \"Wow! That feels weird! Could you make me a DD Cup?!\" You enlarged the breasts to a DD cup, and let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say about you two getting back to real life?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a choice. Return to real life again with Michael (As Misty), with your other bodies finding more girls to add, or stay here and do something else!</span></div></div>",

I think that by the end of this, a small car isn't exactly going to be... well, big enough.\" Michael said with Misty's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose we could wait for a passing bus to come...\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, and how many of them have you seen in the Pokemon games.\" Michael retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, true.\" Nurse Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first and foremost, I think that Nurse Joy is wearing way too many clothes. We should get her to find sometime a little more plain, white and pink and stuff, but more plain.\" Officer Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pokemon Center should have a few things.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's the plan then, Anne can go back, get Amy, and bring her in (How fun!!). Nurse Joy can get some plainer clothes, maybe something like a wilderness uniform or something that the nurses wear when travelling to sick Pokemon out of the city. Officer Jenny, Dawn, and I can go looking for a bus.\" Michael suggested. \"If we're lucky, we might even find a Pokemon that can use Secret Power and hey, who knows? We could rival Team Rocket in size by building our own underground base!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good plan to me.\" Officer Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That counts for the rest of us!\" You, Dawn, and Nurse Joy said. So the plan was carried out. Nurse Joy went to the Pokemon Center, said hi to the other nurse, and proceeded behind desk to find a wilderness outfit that was still white and pink, but didn't flow outwards so much to make it hard to sometimes fit through doors. She then went back to wait outside the Gym for the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the game and brought Amy back in (after packing up the meal she made). You gave her a little more freedom over herself (enough so that she can function for herself), and slightly less die hard for you, otherwise it would probably cause problems. You and Amy then went back to the gym to wait for the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael, Jenny, and Dawn went looking around town for a bus. Unfortunately, it wasn't as if there were any places that just happened to sell them. Eventually, they found a person working on a grey bus that looked fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there! I was wondering if you could help us please?\" Officer Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Officer. What's up?\" The young woman asked, getting her head out of the bus's engine. The girl had dark brown hair, green eyes and was wearing a grey worker uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bus here, is it fit to use yet?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman slammed the bus bonnet down. \"It is now\" She replied casually. \"Did ya need it for something, or what?\" Dawn looked first at Officer Jenny, then at Michael; they both gave a slight, yet evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, we do need it, and you're going to give it to us...\" Michael said. When the young woman gaped a bit, Dawn took this chance to spit a bit of herself onto the woman. Dangit! You missed! But never mind. The woman suddenly let out a yell and jumped back, but it was too late, your goo had spread out all over her body, covering her from head to toe, then it forced it's way into her mouth until it was all the way down. The woman almost fainted, but Michael caught her, and you, now fully in control of the woman, had control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's her name?\" Dawn asked. You went through the memory of the woman, and found that she was Abigail Teresa, and she owned a small house in Cerulean City, fixing vehicles for people. The keys for the bus were in her pocket so you unlocked the bus and let everyone inside. Then you had her get in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the bus is ours! Awesome!\" Michael said, sitting down on one of the seats, Dawn and Abigail sitting down as well, and Officer Jenny taking the driver's seat. You started up the bus, pulled out, and headed for the gym. Luckily, it was full on gas so you wouldn't need to worry about filling up anytime soon. When the bus arrived at the gym, Abigail opened the door and let you, who by this time had bought and put on a a pink headband and a pink, skintight bodysuit that was high heeled (which you learned how to walk in by accessing the memories of your female bodies), along with having your hair in a ponytail, on, as well as Nurse Joy and Amy, the only girl in this band of people who wasn't either being possessed, or possessing someone (even though she is under your control) on the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do now?\" Michael asked. \"I'm feeling optimistic about this whole base thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all for it. We're going to need someone to build it though. Got any Pokemon that can use Secret Power, Dawn?\" Abigail asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... I got a Pidgeot in the computer with it...\" Dawn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky I got it out for you then!\" Nurse Joy replied, holding up a Poke Ball and tossing it to Dawn who caught the ball in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize that I've got all of my Pokemon with me too.\" You said, pulling a large bag seemingly out of nowhere (Note from Starfighter364: This is a joke based on how in RPG's, including Pokemon, you can store several large objects in a small backpack or pockets) and opened it up, revealing dozens of Poke Balls, all marked in some way to tell which Pokemon was in which Poke Ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas on what else we could do?\" Michael asked.</span></div></div>",

We'll 'relocate' them if they're in the way.\" Officer Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she drove the bus right up to Mt. Moon. Defying the laws of physics by driving up and over small cliffs (In the game remember, when you get out of Mt. Moon, it's a one way trip down to Cerulean until you get the HM 'Fly').<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you arrived at the entrance to the tunnel leading through, underneath, the bus was at least a little dented underneath from the ride.

Dawn let her Pidgeot out and it flapped around unhappily at being stuck in such a small damp place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pidgeot! Use Secret Power on this rock wall and make us a nice, smooth, large, rectangular shaped tunnel!\" Dawn said to her Pidgeot. It settled down then started flapping it's wings madly at the wall, suddenly great beams of light shot out from them and enveloped the walls, when the Pidgeot stopped triumphantly, there was a nice corridor extending down the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn proceeded to continue making the entire complex. The small tunnel was enlarged to be more of a large garage that could hold about six vehicles and had a loading zone. (Remember that everything right now was just rock. You would later cover it over with concrete and steel) Dawn had Pidgeot create many more smaller rooms and passages based on three levels. The upper most had a window looking out into the shed. All in all, it was pretty impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being satisfied with the outcome, you went back to town alone. The others stayed in the large cavern/garage thing for you. Upon arriving at Cerulean, you found exactly what you needed, a large builders shop. Making a small piece of yourself come out, then expand and split into multiple pieces, you slowly took control of all the girls working there, including the very nice Asian Secretary at the front desk. Rather than being in them and suddenly coming to terms with A LOT more girls, you messed with their minds and gave them EXPLCIT instructions to do whatever you told them, without having any ability to say no. (So if you wanted, you could make them beat each other up, and mate, they would be vicious!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the reception desk, and talked to the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there! I'd like to request a construction over at Mt. Moon please?\" You requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman there smiled and answered \"Certainly, what resources do you require?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steel, concrete, plumbing... the lot. Oh, and make sure that only girls work on it. Ha ha.\" You replied. The receptionist laughed and made the arrangements. Within half-an-hour, all the woman in the company were driving up towards Mount Moon with everything they needed. Concrete, steel pipes, wires... you name it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing them to the new cavern, they immediately set to work. After two hours, they had already fully completed the large garage. (Being under your power, they worked at full capacity, without breaks, etc) Moving onto the corridors, they finished them as well quickly. Everyone was impressed by their speed. After about four hours, they were half done, and after another four they were done, and had packed everything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underground complex had a large door covered with rock that was three inches thick. No one could get through there easily. The door opened to the garage, and that was fully done up with lights. In your 'control' room, you had state of the art equipment, all designed to show where everything in the world was, for tracking things, security cameras, everything. You and the gang wandered from room to room, admiring the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've done a real good job, on this.\" Michael said, liking her new quarters which opened up to a large pool area. Everyone else had nice rooms with adjacent things that they would find useful. Nurse Joy had a large clinic like place that was probably better equipped than most Pokemon Centers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you like it Misty? You asked, eventually turning to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it so much! This is even better than home!\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now have a couple of options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You can redo the minds of a load of girls (Preferably either good looking ones or intelligent ones) and make them 'run' the base for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Get some cool looking vehicles for the base. (Then get some workers later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Separate a part of yourself, and a part of Michael, and go to town on your girls.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well Jenny, what do you think?\" You have your Dawn body ask your Jenny body as they walk down the illuminated corridors of your new secret HQ; it is a new day, and you have your main body keeping Michael-in-Misty company at her new pad, and you have Joy tidying up her clinic, so you are keeping yourself entertained with a faux conversation between your Dawn and Jenny bodies, debating on whether or not to take over a multitude of women and have run the base with them, or get some sweet new rides, then take over some workers. Of course, you used two of your puppets to do it, arguing with yourself on which would be the best course of action. Of course, more hosts won out in your mind, and you began arguing with yourself about who to capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we take over some gym leaders.\" You have Dawn argue. \"They will be great if we ever need fighting force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Your Jenny body concedes as you both round a corner. \"But with more workers, we can have them run the base for us while we look for the gym leaders, and besides, we've already wormed ourselves into those worker girls who were so kind as to make us this base.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmm...\" You put a contemplative look on Dawn's face before saying \"I guess you're right, but we should probably take it slow, we don't want to shock ourselves too much.\" Even as you say this, you are slowly taking control of the ladies you had previously hired to build your base, new perspectives swimming into your mind with each few seconds. First, it's a hot Asian secretary, then it's the builders, and within a minute, every female body and mind within the building belongs to a collective intelligence: you. You pile them onto Abigail's large bus and begin the two-hour long road trip up to Mt. Moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your Dawn and Jenny bodies have left Mt. Moon, and you have Dawn send out Pidgeot. You have both bodies laugh when notice that Anna, who is in the pool in Michael's room with her, has splashed Michael and dived under the water to avoid Michael's wrath once he's recovered. After some time of flying through the air as Dawn and Jenny on Pidgeot's back in a random direction for the fun of it since you are contemplating who to get, you finally decide on  a target...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should we fly to?\" Dawn asks, glancing at Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about... Celadon City?\" You suggest through your policewoman body. \"I think Erika would be more than happy to become part of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Pidgeot, to Celadon City!\" You say energetically, pointing a finger in a random direction, since you have no idea where the heck Celadon City is. The bird Pok\u00e9mon caws an affirmative, altering its course to follow your command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes of soaring on the new route, Pidgeot begins to slow, gradually descending towards the city. When you're close enough to the ground, you hop your two bodies off of its back, wincing as Jenny's high heels smash into the ground. You open the Pok\u00e9 Ball, and the Pok\u00e9mon returns to its Pok\u00e9 Ball in a beam of red energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get us a gym leader!\" You say happily from within Dawn as you shrink the ball and put it in her pack, and are just about to go walking around when you stop yourself with Jenny, placing a gloved hand on Dawn's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, why don't we split up? I'll get the local Jenny and Joy, and you can get Erika.\" You both look to your right; you have landed in front of the Pok\u00e9mon Center, which you note looks much more like its anime counterpart than you expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Your Dawn body says. \"You go get Nurse Joy and the other Officer Jenny, and I'll get Erika and the trainers from her gym.\" You nod Jenny's head in agreement, and your bodies head their separate ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenny, you walk into the Pok\u00e9mon Center, and watch the people walk around before strolling up to the counter, where the city's Nurse Joy is standing dutifully at the counter, staring absentmindedly into space until she notices your Jenny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jenny!\" She says, perking up slightly, thinking that this body is the one of this city's Officer Jenny. \"It's nice to see you, but what's the occasion? I almost never see you during work hours.\" You shrug Officer Jenny's shoulders nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets kinda boring in that office all day, you know,\" You have Jenny say, resting her hands on her hips and smiling. \"I just had to get out for a few minutes; besides.\" Her smile widens, and you dig through her purse before bringing out a small, blue, squishy ball. \"I tried this new candy, and it's so delicious that I knew you would love it.\" Nurse Joy takes the ball from your palm and looks at it curiously. \"It may look kind of weird, but trust me, you've never tasted anything like it.\" You reassure her as she plays with it in her hand before looking up and giving you an appreciative smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's certainly thoughtful of you, thanks!\" With that, she pops it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news: You were in her mouth, not inside her like you'd be soon, but inside her nonetheless. Bad news: She keeps chewing that part of you, so you can't get down. She soon swallows, and you bolt down her throat. The pink-haired woman gives a shocked look as you go down her esophagus. She stares at your Jenny body with wide, panicked eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" She never has the chance to finish, however, as the part of you in her body takes hold, and her body tenses, eyes rolling back into their sockets as her knees begin to buckle. Thankfully, you react fast enough to see her wobble, and hold her up with your gloved hands under her armpits. There's a moment of silence as her head falls forward, and then she comes to life as you take control of her nervous system, raising her head and smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to the world of the living.\" You tease with Officer Jenny's mouth, releasing her from your hold and allowing your new body to stand. \"How was the candy?\" You smile gently through your new nurse recruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was certainly like nothing I've ever tasted, thank you,\" You have your new mouthpiece reply, gratitude evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing, really.\" You make Jenny shrug. \"Just getting a new recruit for the gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was awfully kind of you to draft me. I feel quite honored.\" You have Celadon City's Nurse Joy reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still one more thing that you need to do before you can be fully accepted.\" You give yourself an inquiring look with your new nurse's eyes, although you already know since they both have the same mind. \"Take these.\" You hand another two worms to your Celadon Joy puppet. \"And give them to two other people. After that, you're in.\" Joy beams, clutching the goo in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure to give them to someone special.\" You nod Jenny's head, and exit the Pok\u00e9mon Center to repeat the procedure with your policewoman's local counterpart as your nurse body resumes her pretense, assuming proper posture to play receptionist. Jenny's body has barely walked twenty paces when a woman strolls into the Pok\u00e9mon Center. She has knee-length blonde hair and gray eyes, her left one covered by side-swept bangs. She was tall, about as tall as your Joy body, and her black high heels probably put her a good inch or two above your conquest's eye level. As she approaches the desk, you notice her outfit in closer detail: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is wearing a black blouse, the top half of which is covered by a long, black jacket that contours to the curves of her waist before flaring out and ending below her knees, but has a V-neck so large that it reveals a bit of her cleavage. It is lined with black fur on its cuffs, collar and hemline, and has a tear-shaped zipper hanging just below her breasts. Her legs are covered by black, boot cut pants, and as you continue the facade of Nurse Joy as she walks up and begins making conversation with you, you can't shake the feeling that you've seen her before. As you mindlessly talk through the Celadon Nurse Joy, you wrack your mind for where you've seen this beautiful woman from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hits you like a Machamp's Focus Punch: how could you not have seen it?! It's Cynthia! As in, the Sinnoh champion! But why the heck is she in Kanto?! These thoughts, and many others, bolt through your head. However, it doesn't matter; you've got two worms, and she would be a more than perfect puppet.</span></div></div>",

I'm going to have it be the Oreburgh ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to talk to Cynthia through the Celadon Nurse Joy, all the while trying to figure out how to get her to take the \"candy\" and eat it somewhere where no one would see her pass out. As you think, you suddenly feel the Celadon Officer Jenny's body come under your control. Cynthia wraps up the conversation, and begins to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, ma'am.\" You say through Celadon Joy. Cynthia turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What is it?\" She asks. You hold out Celadon Joy's hand that is holding the piece of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not often we have such a famous visitor.\" You say. \"Please take this, it's really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Cynthia says, taking what she thinks is a piece of candy, and heading up to her room. She enters the room she's been given, and sits on her bed, then she plops the piece of you into her mouth and begins chewing. Meanwhile, you feel Erika's body, as well as the bodies of every girl in her gym come under your control, however, you put the girls that aren't Erika on autopilot, intending to slowly assimilate their minds like you did the workers in order to avoid overloading yourself. You finally feel Cynthia come under your control as she swallows the piece of you. You're well on your way to your plans to get the female gym leaders and other girls who can help run your base, however, there is a problem that needs to be addressed, you can't have all of the girls go with you yet, as you have no way of getting them back where they are needed when they are needed. However, you have the perfect solution to your problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your base at Mt. Moon, you get out of the pool in Michael's room and dry off, after explaining that you have something that you have to do. You wring the water out of your original Dawn body's hair, and go into the dressing room, where you change out of the bathing suit you are wearing on her body, and put the outfit you had on her body earlier back on. You have the Mewtwo belonging to your first Dawn body teleport to Saffron City, you have your second Dawn body, after picking up Oreburgh Jenny, fly on Pidgeot to Fuchsia City in order to get Janine and the female trainers in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo teleports you to Saffron, and you head to the gym. You enter, and see that it is seemingly empty. You search through the gym using the warp panels that were your main reason for coming here, as they can be used for instant transportation if need be. You eventually come to the point that Sabrina usually waits at, and you find her there, which you are a little surprised at since everyone else seemed to be missing. She looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you finally arrived, Anthony, is it?\" She asks. Your eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How did you know?!\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sometimes receive visions of the future.\" She says simply. \"I saw you coming, and this entire conversation happening. I also know how this ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do?\" You ask, ready to fight if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, the only thing I can do in this situation.\" She says with a sigh. \"Go ahead and take my body.\" You do a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why are you just giving up?!\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, thanks to you being here and not part of this world, you can make many different futures.\" She replies. \"I've seen all of them, and in all of them, I either end up possessed or in the insane asylum due to telling people about this. I'd rather have my independance ended than spend my life in the insane asylum, so there's no point trying avoid it.\" She opens her mouth wide for you to enter, and just so she can't possibly pull anything sneaky, you get right up to her before having your liquid self enter her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Oreburgh Jenny and second Dawn bodys have just arrived in Fuchsia City. You have the Oreburgh Jenny body perform the same process that you did in Celadon, while as your second Dawn, you go into the Fuchsia gym. You see several girls who look like Janine, remember that they are disguised. You would simply go for them all normally, but you remember that one is actually a guy. You let out that body's Mewtwo, which you have put all the people in the gym into a trance. You have Mewtwo command the male to leave the gym, and forget that he was ever one of the gym trainers. You then have all of the girls in the gym line up and open their mouths to each receive a piece of your liquid self. You soon have them all, but use the same process as you did with the workers and Celadon gym trainers. Your second Dawn body meets up with your Oreburgh Jenny's body, who you have had complete her task by that time, and the two fly off to Mt. Moon, as you have your first Dawn body's Mewtwo teleport that body back to Mt. Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at your Mt. Moon base, you have your worker bodies working on the warp panels to the places your bodies would need to be using the knowledge of how they work that you got from Sabrina, and afterwards, you place the corresponding ones at the places so that your bodies can warp back afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/4/4a/HeartGold_SoulSilver_Erika.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/4/4a/H...</a><br>\r\nSabrina: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/65/HeartGold_SoulSilver_Sabrina.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/65/H...</a><br>\r\nJanine: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/9/9a/HeartGold_SoulSilver_Janine.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/9/9a/H...</a></span></div></div>",

You have just arrived home you instinctively go to turn on your TV, but decide instead to play your Nintendo DS. You reach into your pocket and take out your red DS, which is covered in Kingdom Hearts stickers. You turn the DS on and see Kingdom Hearts: Chains of Memories is in your DS, which you happily start up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game starts you load your save game. You suddenly feel weird and feel like your body is turning into liquid, which, to your surprise, it is! You collapse to the floor and turn completely into a puddle of water as your new body flows into your DS and into the Kingdom Hearts: CoM game. You land in the top floor of Castle Oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, what happened?' You wonder as you regain consciousness. You look around to see you are in a pure white corridor with several rooms in it. You then hear someone come near and you try your best to find a place to hide, but to no success as the being who is wearing a black cloak walks right by you after muttering something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, this place is getting leaks now, just great!\u201d The being says annoyed with a feminine voice before proceeding on into the closest door. You instinctively follow the being feeling that she may be your only safety in this place, but you don\u2019t know why as you make your way under the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you make your way into the room the woman in the cloak has walked up to a chair that a female figure is sitting in, although the cloaked woman is blocking your view of the figure, so you can't tell who it is. Neither noticed you come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Namin\u00e9.\u201d She grins evilly. \"Your hero is on his way, are you ready to see him?\" The woman asks. You get a good look at that point and see that the girl is, in fact, Namin\u00e9. You also realize that the woman is Larxene. A tear runs down Namin\u00e9's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\" She say, although by the look on her face, and her tone of voice, you can tell that she's really sad about what she's being forced to do to Sora. You look at the girls before you, and then suddenly a strong urge overtakes you, making you shoot out of your hiding spot, split your liquid body in half, and plunge both pieces into both of the girls. Your main piece goes into Namin\u00e9 through her vagina, and your other piece forces its way into the hooded woman via her mouth, much to her protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you see Larxene looking over you, her hood down. \u201cTime to get up, Namin\u00e9\u201d She says with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, who are you talking to? My name is Anthony\u2026\u201d You pause as you realize your voice has changed into that of Namin\u00e9's voice. \u201cOh my god! What happened to me? Why am I a girl? And why did I turn into water and enter this girl\u2019s body?!\u201d You began freaking out, but Larxene grabs you by the shoulders and tells you to take a deep breath, but you're panicking too much to listen. Larxene slapped you across your face making you scream in pain, but also snapping you out of your panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! What the heck did you do that for, Larxene!?\u201d You scream at the woman, before the situation catches up with you, and you put your hands up to protect you from another slap, which doesn't come. Then you feel a liquid on your cheek, and touch you wipe the liquid off and look at it to find that it's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Larxene apologizes as she brings out a first aid kit. She prepares to put a big bandage on your face where a small gash had appeared due to her slap. \u201cI must have cut you with one of my knives when I slapped you. Here maybe this will help.\u201d Larxene then kisses you on your wound like your mother would if you got a cut when you were a little kid. Ironically, your abilities began healing the wound, and Larxene puts the bandage away. You suddenly realize that you are looking out of her eyes too. In your shock, you hadn't noticed it, but you now realize that you are in both bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you smile and laugh, but suddenly a knock comes at the door with someone calling \u201cHello! Are you two okay?\u201d The person continued knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

You look at yourself to also find that you have small, but noticeable, A-cup breasts, and that you are wearing a long black cloak that feels oddly comfortable. You then touch your face and find that your skin is soft and baby smooth, which you kind of enjoy the feel of it a small bit. You want to look in a mirror, but it don't seem like there is one in your current room, so you decided to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the bed that you are in and stand up, your new breasts making you feel off balance, and take a step towards the door, but you didn't realize one important thing before that, you are wearing heels! The combination of the heels and your new breasts causes you to trip and fall to the ground. You slowly get up, and you slowly continue walking towards the door, getting better at walking like this in the process. You exit the room and soon find yourself in pathway without a roof above it. You look back up to the sky to find it even more cloudy and dark then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why the sky is like that...\" You wonder out loud as you continue on your way, hoping to find someone else. You walk onwards and find that you suddenly feel a tad sick, and you begin to vomit, but what comes out isn't what you expect, as what leaves you mouth is a strange, blue liquid that soon takes the shape of a puddle. With this new sight, your perception begins to split as you find that you are now seeing from two spots, one from your current body, and one from the puddle. You can now see what you actually look like. You have short black hair with blue eyes, and appeared to be somewhat short, or maybe you are just the right height? You recognize this body, though. \"Xion...\" You whisper in surprise, and then you flash back to a few moments, or maybe a few hours, before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Flash back time***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Anthony; you are tall, with dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. You were wearing dark blue shorts, black shoes, and a shirt that is completely dark blue with the word Nintendo written on the front. You had just gotten home from school, and were just about to watch some TV, but you found that the power was out. You turned on your Nintendo DS, and you begin to play Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. You had just gotten to the middle of the game, but still had a while to go before you beat it. You began to play and found that your current mission was to defeat an imposter who had surfaced in Twilight Town. You began the mission with Axel (you being Roxas of course) and quickly found the intruder. You attacked the target, but suddenly it was revealed to be Xion, who was soon knocked out by Axel. You suddenly felt weak. You stared in horror as your body began to turn into liquid and then was being pulled into the DS. You tried to stop it, but the second you touched the body part that was turning, the other part began to turn as well. You blacked out after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Back to current time*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize what has happened, and then suddenly you run into someone. This person has long blue hair with yellow eyes, and an X-shaped scare across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move out of my way, puppet.\" He says in a nasty tone, which instantly ticks you off. You realize that this person is Sa\u00efx, the character you hate the most in the entire series because of how he treats Xion, who you are currently possessing. You grip your fist and then turn back around to face Sa\u00efx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, jerk!\" You yell. Sa\u00efx turns around.</span></div></div>",

Sa\u00efx looks at Xion, and then at the strange liquid beside her. \"What is that?\" He asks, but suddenly a being begins to rise from the liquid (I.E. you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be the biggest jerk I've ever seen!\" You yell angrily via Xion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" Your original self begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It time for you to pay!\" Both of your bodies say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou summon up a Keyblade via Xion and copy use your ability to copy any abilities from girl(s) you've possessed to copy Xion's abilities to summon a Keyblade and to use spells, then you summon your own Keyblade. You make your normal body your main body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This can't be possible!\" Sa\u00efx exclaims, fear seeming to sink into his mind. \"But I will not lose here! Not to any puppet or monstrosity!\" Sa\u00efx's eyes glow golden, meaning that he has gone into his berserker state, which always made you worry in the game, but this time you have help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your bodies charge at Sa\u00efx and your weapons collide with his, creating a huge explosion which shakes the very foundation of the Castle That Never Was. The smoke clears and all three of you are sent flying though both of your bodies and Sa\u00efx manage to fight a bit before landing. You manage to break his berserker state, which has left him open to attack. You shoot out a few fire spells, then dual uppercut him, which makes him land with a hard thud. As you land, you notice a few other faces I.E. the other organization members such as Axel, Roxas, Xigbar, along with the other remaining members, besides Xion, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel and Roxas charge at you, but you block both of their strikes and knock them off balance with a drop kick while Knocking Roxas's Keyblade out of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no quarrel with you, or any of the others of this Organization. I only wish to destroy Sa\u00efx!\u201d You explain showing a small tone of anger and annoyance. Nobody notices a liquid part of yourself land on the ground and head towards Roxas's Keyblade. You walk towards Sa\u00efx, who has managed to get back up, and also managed to recover a small amount. The other members look at their leader Xemnas to see what he wants them to do. Xemnas smiles a small amount and chuckles a little bit before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if his quarrel is only with Sa\u00efx, then let him. I don\u2019t want anyone to interfere, nor do I want anyone to help.\u201d He commands before using a Cura spell on you and Sa\u00efx, returning you both back to full health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Xemnas\u201d You say, readying your Keyblade as you/Xion backs away. Sa\u00efx looks betrayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why-\" Sa\u00efx begins, before Xemnas glares at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I am ignorant? I know that you gave Axel orders to eliminate everyone else at Castle Oblivion, I just haven't been able to prove it, so I have no problem letting this boy fight you. The fact that he also has a Keyblade helps as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if there are no more problems, let's do this!\" You say, ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not lose to you, you fool!\u201d Sa\u00efx states, pointing his weapon at you before the fight begins anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you run at each other with the intent of a death blow, but your weapons collide, forming another explosion, but this time you aren\u2019t sent flying, but instead land a few feet away. You fire off a few spells, which then chase after Sa\u00efx, but he blocks them with his claymore, which leaves him open for a frontal assault. You seemingly teleport in front of Sa\u00efx to everyone except Xemnas\u2019s surprise, and then you knock Sa\u00efx's claymore from his hand, grab it, and then bring it down on him. Before he can recover, you stab him through his non-existent heart and run a Fire spell through it, burning him to death. You/Xion walks over to you and gives you a peck on the cheek, you notice how odd it feels to receive the kiss and give it at the same time since you feel everything from both bodies. You also notice Roxas looking jealous at the fact that you got kissed by Xion instead of him getting kissed by her. Xigbar give a cat-call at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, dude!\" Xigbar says with a grin. Roxas has picked up what he thinks is his Keyblade, but it is really a copy of you, imitating his Keyblade as you have brought it back to your world. You and you/Xion go back to your world, and you pick up Roxas's Keyblade, claiming it as your own since he doesn't exist in your world. Then you have the copy of yourself return to your world and combine with you. You and you/Xion fall asleep on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up about an hour later, and see Xion's body right beside you, still asleep. You run your hand through her hair, and then begin to change personality, making her your puppet who likes to be played with by you, and only you with the exception of people you allow to play with her, then you let her regain control, at least for the time being. Then you proceed to get up and begin to think of what to do next...</span></div></div>",

Your search doesn't take long as you find two unsuspecting females standing outside, you turn into water and begin to proceed towards them, but instead, you revert back to your normal form to make this a small bit more fun. You fall to the ground with a thud, nearly missing the girls, who you now know for sure are Tifa and Aerith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's the big idea kid?\" Tifa yells at you, annoyed that you had interrupted her conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I just wanted to ask you something.\" You begin, closing your eyes and then taking a small breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" Aerith asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well would you like to fight?\" You suddenly summon up you Keyblades and get in a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on.\" Tifa laughs a bit and cracks her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's begin!\" You grin then say \"Prepare to join my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you can't breathe, as in the next few minutes you have managed to defeat both Tifa and Aerith with relative ease, but yet you still want to test out more of your power. You separate two small parts from yourself, and insert them into the two unconscious girl's bodies, making your urge not so bad, although you can still feel it, and can barely resist completely possessing a girl's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

You/Tifa look to see that it is a pair of keys. \"Cloud said you could use his bike.\" Leon and Sora's group walked away, with Leon carrying you/Aerith, who is still asleep. You begin searching Tifa\u2019s memories to find where the bike is. You find it a little while later in a garage besides the HQ. You/Tifa inserts the key and starts it up as you climb on behind her. You let Tifa have free will, seeing as you have made her and Aerith your loyal loving slaves already, for now and just figure to enjoy the ride since you\u2019ve never road a motorcycle before. Tifa drives out of the garage, and you feel the wind in your hair, along with Tifa\u2019s hair in your face, which she apologizes about as she pushes it into the opposite side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop after a few minutes of biking. You'd continue, but since a part of you is in the real world, time will be going by normally, and thus, you had to make sure you got home before your family, so decide to head home.

You feel like you were in heaven and continue on for what seems like hours, but are actually five minutes.

She looks at you. \"Anthony, why are you in that girl's body?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I'm outside of a female body for long enough, I seem to get the urge to possess a girl, so I decided to stay as Namin\u00e9 for a while since I didn't want to be in the back of your minds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be.\" Tifa says in a sing-song voice. \"Don't forget, my body is here for your use at any time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, he could be in control of me just as easily, I'm his puppet if you'll remember!\" Xion says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he want to be in control of your body instead of mine when you're not as developed as me!\" Tifa replies drawing attention to her breasts. There are some sparks in their eyes at this point.</span></div></div>",

Xion looks at her confused and asks her why she was smiling like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cXion, something just occurred to me\u2026\u201d Tifa begins. \u201cWhy bother with words, when actions speak much louder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t understand\u201d Xion says, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see, instead of bickering and arguing, maybe we should have a bet.\u201d Tifa says with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion nods and asks. \u201cSo what are the terms of this bet, Tifa?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about this, we have a spar, and whoever wins gets Anthony to use her body.\u201d Tifa cutely chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Xion begins. Tifa reaches out her hand for a hand shake, which Xion happily does. Xion summons her Keyblade and Tifa and back flips away, and then the two get into a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to fight! Now Xion don\u2019t hold anything back!\u201d Tifa jokes. Xion grips her Keyblade tightly in response; she didn\u2019t want to lose and wasn\u2019t going to pull her punches (so to speak). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready Tifa I\u2019m not holding back! I won\u2019t lose!\u201d Xion yells before charging at her advisory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither will I Xion!\u201d Tifa replies, firing off a punch, only for Xion to dodge, elbow Tifa in the gut, then quickly spin attack her like some legendary pointy eared hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa grunts in pain, but quickly grabs Xion by her arm, and throws her into the air, unaware that she has an ability called glide, with allows her to as its name implies, glide around, or while staying still, levitate. Tifa thinks that she has done something good, but her strategy quickly turns on her as Xion quickly recovers, and then dive-bombs Tifa with an aerial combo, followed by an ax kick, sending Tifa face first into the concrete. Tifa groans in pain as she groggily stands back up, blood draining onto the ground thanks to Xion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Xion take it easy. We're not trying to kill each other\u201d Tifa explains to her foe, not that they could kill each other with a piece of you inside each, which wasn't healing this current damage for your own reasons. Tifa tries to rush her, but before she could Xion shot out her hand and sent a ball of fire at her, knocking her back. They begin clashing again, taking out any Nobodies that got in their way, until they suddenly can't move, which happened right after the Nobodies were finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What the heck?!\" Xion exclaims, struggling to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that.\" You say, walking up to them, a frown on the face you borrowed from Namin\u00e9. \"I let that go on because you were taking out enemies, but now that they are gone, I'm putting an end to it.\" Both girls looked down, since they could do at least that much, embarrassed. \"I like all of my girls, and I don't want you fighting each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry.\" Both say guiltily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm putting you two on time out.\" You say. They look at you in confusion. \"I'm taking over both of you, but you won't be aware of what's going on.\" You explain, knowing full well that they planned on you having them still remain aware of what was happening. These were the last words they heard before you directly took over the two of them. You have all three girls go to meet up with Aerith, Yuffie, and you/Fuu, who separated from Seifer's crew while they were tending their injuries, back at the town square.</span></div></div>",

You have Xion go off to continue searching for Kairi while you are doing this. It has been a while since you had time to relax. After all, ever since you had gained this strange urge inside of you, you really haven't taken much time to relax. You were always hunting down more and more girls to satisfy this strange urge inside of you. You let a small sigh escape Namin\u00e9's lips as you stop in the middle of the street. It is then that an interesting thought pops into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I should take a vacation from this whole possessing girls\u2019 thing?' Since you are inside of a girl\u2019s body the urge has subsided enough for you to barely notice its presence. This is fine with you as you don\u2019t have to worry about the urge making you possess any nearby girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou round the next corner and find a park with several people, all of which are doing their own individual thing playing in the street, including the trio of Olette, Hayner, and Pence. You smile as you watch them play and slowly approach the group from the shadows. You were taking caution due to Ollete being with among them. You watch the trio from afar and observe what they are doing; Hayner is carrying a blue Styrofoam bat/sword in his right hand and seems to be dueling with Pence, though Pence really isn\u2019t doing so well. Hayner has more experience for fighting since he has been training for the tournament that a simulated version of him and Roxas had entered prior to the current events. Hayner quickly knocks the bat out of Pence\u2019s hand, ending the duel as you finally approach the trio. You clap your hands like that of an audience member and that is when the trio finally notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTee hee, well done.\u201d You say with a femine giggle, acting as if you are really a teenage girl just for the fun of it. Hayner blushes a bit at this and takes a bow and you swear that Olette is pouting behind him most likely showing a bit of jealousy towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you liked watching me win, right?\u201d Hayner asks in a showboating tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was quite amusing to say the least. But how\u2019s about you fight someone a bit more skilled this time? I know just the person.\u201d You boast. Hayner is quick to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to! Hurry up and go get him!\u201d You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually what I meant was fighting me.\u201d Hayner is a bit confused, but smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll fight you, but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go easy on you just because you\u2019re a girl!\u201d Hayner declares as he gets into a fighting position. You smile and grip your fist as Pence throws you a struggle bat as he is rubbing his head due to getting injured in the last fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTee hee, don't worry about me.\u201d You say, before switching to a more serious one. \u201cWorry about yourself!\u201d You quickly charge in to attempt to verticality slice Hayner across the chest, but just as you are mere inches from him you slam the struggle bat into the ground as if by accident. Hayner smiles and backs away a bit giving you some time to take your weapon out of the ground; you quickly do so and ask him why he didn\u2019t attack you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair of me to hit you when you couldn\u2019t fight back. I mean, where\u2019s the honor in that\u201d Hayner\u2019s words make you smile and you quickly resume the fight. Hayner and you clash swords a few times before Hayner gets the upper hand and hits you in the arm causing you to drop your struggle bat. \u201cI win!\u201d Hayner exclaims in victory, letting his guard down, during which you quickly grab the struggle bat and hit him several times in succession, causing him to fall back and land on his butt..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever let your guard down, or your opponent can take you down easily.\u201d You say as you help him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure are good!\u201d Hayner says, causing you to blush a bit and smile since you are acting like a normally shy girl. \u201cSince you won, I guess you can hang out with us. That is if you want.\u201d Hayner says as he and Pence blush, both obviously hoping to get you to like him so you'll be their girlfriend, making Ollete jealous. You smile, graciously accepting the invitation, but with no intention of being the girlfriend of either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyway, I guess we should introduce ourselves.\u201d Olette begins. \u201cMy name's Olette. This guy to my left is Pence.\u201d Pence waves and says hello. \u201cAnd that knuckle head who you just creamed is Hayner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you all seem really nice. My name's Namin\u00e9. Nice to meet you.\u201d You say with a cheerful laugh and a curtsy. Hayner and Pence look at you oddly, having no idea what a curtsy is, but then look at Olette who does the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what the heck are you two doing?\u201d Hayner asks confused and Olette quickly smacks him over the head. \u201cOw! Olette, what was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was for being rude!\u201d Olette scolds him, still jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRude? How was that rude? You two were the one\u2019s doing something weird.\u201d Hayner groans back and Olette gives him another smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I think that\u2019s enough Olette, Hayner just didn\u2019t know what a curtsy is.\u201d You explain to Ollette and she sighs in response. \u201cAnyway how about we go for some ice cream?\u201d You ask with a smile. Pence smiles, as does Hayner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you insist.\u201d They say in unison, before you all leave for ice cream.</span></div></div>",

You smile as you watch the trio eat and as Hayner and Pence both try to make a move on you, only to make Ollete more jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHayner you\u2019re such a jerk, can't you see she doesn't like you like that!\u201d Ollete shouts at him before she smacks him once more across the face, annoyed  causing his ice cream to fly into the air. You watch as it soars into the air and then come crashing back down on Ollete\u2019s head. Ollete screams out, enraged at Hayner, but before things get out of hand, you get up, walk over to Ollete, and offer her a handkerchief made from a piece of yourself. This power of yours is actually pretty useful, even if it does have a downside. You hand her the handkerchief and Ollete gladly takes it. Of course, you don't want to possess her yet, you just want to help her out. After all you, are on vacation, and are letting your other girls do it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Namin\u00e9.\u201d Ollete says with sincerity as she begins to clean herself off. It only takes a minute for Ollete to wipe herself off, and then she hands the handkerchief back. You smile, but shake your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, you keep it Ollete.\u201d You say with a smile. \u201cThink of it as a token of our new friendship.\u201d Planning on using it later to make your friendship deeper, after all, how can it be deeper if you share the same mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I will.\u201d Ollete replies, and then she turns back to Hayner to give him a piece of her mind. Suddenly a bunch of Nobodies appear. You grip your fist in in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck!?\u201d Hayner shouts, surprised by the sudden appearance of the monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNamin\u00e9! We have to run!\u201d Ollete cries as she quickly grabs you by your arm. You snap your arm away from Ollete\u2019s grip and then summon your Keyblade. Ollete looks at you with fear and tells you once more that you have to run. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d You reply solemnly and walk towards the horde of Nobodies. \u201cI am one of the few people who can harm them.\" You glare at the Nobodies as you get into a battle stance similar to Xion's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a bomb going off, the battle begins with an explosion of destructive power as you charge headfirst at the powerful Dusks Nobodies and begin to cut down several of them at once. You stab at a Samurai Nobody right between the eyes, but then are sent flying back as it uses its sword to push your Keyblade back. You land several feet away at the base of the clock tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNamin\u00e9! Are you alright!?\u201d Ollete shouts, alerting the Nobodies to the trio\u2019s presence. Several of the Dusks rush for them as they close their eyes, preparing for the end, but suddenly just as they come in contact with Ollete, they are sliced to pieces by your normal body, using your two Keyblade's. You had spit out a liquid part of yourself, which reformed into your normal body, but your main body is still Namin\u00e9's for the moment. Ollete opens her eyes to now see your normal body standing before her. \u201cW-who are you?\u201d She asks, but your normal body doesn\u2019t reply. He turns his head to look at you, and with a nod from you, he quickly grabs Ollete and the other two and runs away, with several Dusks chasing after them. However, you quickly leap in front of them and cut off their pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour fight's with me, monsters! Leave them out of this!\u201d You say and then suddenly unleash a blast of light magic that decimates them. \u201cNow feel the power of my Keyblade!\u201d It was then that you rush the horde head on, Keyblade in hand.</span></div></div>",

You have so many memories of this game and how it was the best game you ever played as a kid. You also remember your most favorite character in the game, Saria. She is Link's childhood friend and the Sage Of Forest and in your opinion the best love interest in the game based on their chemistry alone. You never thought that any of the other girls where interesting heck, you even remember having the biggest crush in the world on Saria. So, seeing her for the first time again reminded you why you loved her so much. After playing for a while you go back to Saria to learn her song and feel the love you had for her from when you were a child. After that and you are about to save and turn off game you start to feel weird, you feel like you are melting andthe world around you look at your hand and has turn blue and look like a blob in fact your whole body is just a small blue slime blob. Seeing this you try to scream but as you have no more mouth you find it impossible. As you are panicking a single thought pops into your mind, Saria. For some unexplained reason you have the biggest urge in the universe to be close to Saria so, you try to figure out how to move and with some attempts you figured out how to move. Now your crawl towards the TV in the urge to be with Saria although when you touch the TV screen you see a white flash and you black out.  When you wake up you see both Link and Saria talking to together and Link leaving. You figure he is off to play Saria's Song for Darunia. All of the sudden the urge to be with Saria is back so you slowly move your way over to her. Along the way Saria happens to spot you. \"Hello there little one.\" Saria says as she proceeds to pick you up and places you on her lap seeing as though you are only one third her size. I was just about to Play my ocarina maybe we can You can stay to listen?\" she says as she pets you. You then feel a new urge stronger than the previous one, to be in Saria. A prmial urge to satisfy your desire causes you to go into her tunic and up her pussy. \"No! Don't go in there!\" Saria screams trying to grab you but going through you as you slither further in. \"No! Stop!\" she moans as your body rubs the inside of her vagina. When you go all the way in you black out. When you wake up you feel smaller, you lookdown and see you possessed Saria. Looked into a nearby puudle to see your new body. \"This is like a dream come true!\" you say with Saria's voice coming out. You start to walk around getting used to your new body. \"Boy, Saria wears really tight clothes.\" you say as constantly adjust them so they are more roomy. All of a sudden you start to get new memories of Saria's life. After that you wonder what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Eventually you lose your senses and lay there waiting for the transformation to end. When it does, you're still laying in your room... but you have no form... you're... a puddle!? You have no time to think about it when you're pulled by an unseen force into your TV. Not into the circuitry.. but the imagery shown on your screen. You were literally pulled into the game and you land at the Princess's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing... Seeing Zelda up close... actually feeling the warmth from her body and the reality of this dark scene. You had to get closer... So you inch closer to her body and begin climbing up her leg slowly. Her leg twitched slightly and she looks down at a puddle climbing up her leg. She jumps back as you hear a growl and a girls voice. You squirm up her leg faster and reach the waist of her legs. You see her satin panties and her belly button. You're water now... so you might be able to hide in her sacred spot... but should you risk it.. or go for her mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You feel Zelda's body jump and twitch as you slide into her end zone. Zelda calls out as you slowly move into her body, caressing her walls and rubbing the entirety of it. She falls forward onto her knees as you feel her hand move towards her vagina, trying to pull you out. Wait... you feel her arm!?

I'm fine.. did you see where that water creature went?\" You try and keep your composure up as you lead them on, hoping they'd leave and give you a chance to escape. You fail to notice that at this part of the game.. Midna is near death and fading away. Yet she seems to muster all of her strength just to comfort you. 'That's so sweet..'

Link and Midna turn to fight the adversary but you can't let her do that. \"Midna... I can't restore your health.. but if you absorb enough twilit creatures.. I think you will gain new stamina.\" You are lying through your teeth, you are pretty sure Midna can't get health for that, but it doesn't matter. You need a way out, and now. As Midna thanks you and escapes with Link, you walk by the window and gaze outwards, watching them escape. \"God... I wish I was back home.\" You turn around as the guard enters your room and bares down at you. You almost fail to notice the glowing insignia on your right hand.

Long flowing dirty blond hair, darker skin tone, bigger... breasts... but.. you're shorter... less aged.. by your face.. at least... your natural age. \"Wicked... Teenage Zelda...

Against yourself, you went up and hugged her, placing her head on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Zelda... I never meant to hurt you... Just.. enlighten you.\" You said.

As she finished, a blinding light radiated throughout the room and you felt sleep's loving embrace push itself onto you, submitting to her will you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, you were lying on your bed, T.V. on and Twilight Princess on. Headphones in your ears and \"Kryptonite\" blaring into your head. Taking off your headphones, you stood up and shook your head. For some reason you could hear... something like a flute being played. Following the sweet melodious tune you see the guest room door closed. Opening it up you gaze upon something odd. A light pink room, with gold engravings in the shape of the... Tri-force... Looking at the bed you saw a blond haired girl, reading a book and playing what looked like an Ocarina. As you looked at her she stopped playing and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Anthony.. did you have a nice sleep?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda...\" You began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Zoe now.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe... did you do all of this... the room... everything?\" Looking around once more you hear a soft hum from Zel..

Zoe rolls over you and stands up on the floor. She pulls a bow and a quiver out of her closet. She nocks an arrow, and aims directly at you. \"Zoe...\" Without another word, she releases the arrow and all you can hear is a soft thud, as the arrow hits the wall behind you. \"Are you trying to kill me!\" She lowers the bow and points to the wall. You sit up and turn around, seeing the arrow, piercing through a flies wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant shot... Don't you agree, Anthony?\" She a laughs at you and dropped the bow and arrow. \"Next.\" She raises her hands into the air, and a shimmer of light falls over her, engulfing her entire body, leaving only a silhouette. When the light falls, you don't see Zoe standing there, but a taller girl, with burning red hair, red eyes, and reddish skin. She is wearing a red halter top and she has red wings.

You stop by the kitchen to grab a sandwich, and then you proceed to your room, turning on the Wii before plopping onto your bed. You grab one of your Wii-remotes, which is decorated with a LoZ: Twilight Princess casing which you had gotten when you preordered the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the rest of your sandwich, you begin to play LoZ: Twilight Princess, which you have already beaten, but you still enjoy the story and characters, especially Midna. After about an hour, you decide to take a nap, and quickly pass out afterwards, not noticing your body turning into a liquid. You then wake up in a panic, having had the worst nightmare of your life, which somehow involved you getting sucked into LoZ: TP, and then being attacked and killed by Ganon. You want to wipe your forehead to get rid of the sweat there, but actually, you can't move at all as you notice, to your surprise, that you have turned into a puddle of water on the floor of your room, and are being sucked into your TV.

Wakey wakey!\" The voice laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018It can't be.\u2019 You think to yourself still in a dreaming state. \u2018Is that Midna?\u2019 You flash open your eyes to see that you are sticking out of a bush, with Midna hovering over you while staring at you while speaking with a strange tone. For some reason, you have the urge to enter her body. You notice that she seems to be rubbing her crotch and that she is moaning lustfully. You quickly close your eyes to keep her from knowing you\u2019re awake, since she wasn\u2019t looking at your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah\u2026 Why did I get like this when I saw this guy?\" She mutters to herself between moans. \"Why do I feel like he and I belong together? Why do I feel so lustful when I'm around him?\" You then suddenly feel yourself getting an erection, just from memories of the sight of Midna masturbating, which Midna notices, although she still thinks you are unconscious. \"Heh, naughty boy.\" Midna chuckles in her usual tone, she places herself on your chest, and begins to unzip your pants, exposing your erected penis, which she then begins to suck on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Man, that feels so good!\u2019 You think, trying not to reveal that you are awake (you moan, but make it seem like you are doing it in your sleep), thinking about what Midna may do to you if she found out you were awake this time. You think she may kill you or something, which makes your erection begin to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't! I'm not done yet!\" Midna says, quickly placing your penis inside of her vagina, moaning with pleasure. \"Oh, I'm gonna cum soon!\" Midna moans in pleasure. You then feel yourself ejaculate inside of Midna, feeling like a part of you went with it as she gasps for breath before collapsing onto your chest, falling asleep.

The village turns out to be the exact same village that Link is living at during this period of the game.

You begin to panic and hide Midna behind your back so that none of the villagers see her, then one villagers approaches you, one who looks really familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who are you?\" The villager, who you recognize as Link asks.<br>\r\n\u201cThis here is a friend I found while out on patrol. He says he is from a far off place called Nintendo and... Oh, my bad, I never asked you your name, stranger.\u201d He turns towards you.<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Anthony.\u201d You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, alright Anthony how's about you sleep at the barn up by the ranch? I'm sure that...\u201d Link begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh he can stay with me if that is alright.\u201d Ilia replies as the crowd moves aside to reveal her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, Anthony, you'll be staying at Ilia's house tonight and then tomorrow we can probably talk more.\u201d Link says, after which, the crowd begins to disband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, shall we be off?\u201d Ilia asks you, and you reply with a nod, taking Midna out from behind your back. \u201cSo who's the little girl?\u201d Ilia asks suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my little sister Mi...uh... Mina. Yeah my sister's name is Mina.\u201d You reply. \u201cThat was close and hopefully 'Mina' doesn't wake up any time soon.\u201d You think to yourself. After about two or three minutes, during which you got the strong urge to enter her body like you did with Midna's body, you arrive at Ilia's home and proceed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to freshen up, there is a bathtub upstairs.\u201d Ilia tells you. \u201cOh and if you want to go to bed you can have mine, and I'll just sleep down here tonight.\u201d She says, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... are you sure that's okay? I don't want to be rude or any...\u201d You begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, Anthony, you are my guest, and I will not let you sleep on the couch. I insist you sleep on my bed.\u201d Ilia says pushing you towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine if you insist, then I am obligated to take you up on your hospitality.\u201d You sigh and proceed upstairs, where you place Midna on Ilia's or and carefully check to see if she is still sound asleep, which see is. You then tuck her into bed and then proceed into the bathroom to see that the bath was already drawn for you. \u201cIlia must have made this while I was tucking 'Mina' in\u201d you say Mina because you think that someone might be eavesdropping on you while you are staying here. \u201cOh well I am after all an outsider not from here and they have good reason to suspect me if something were to happen.\u201d You sigh. \u201cBut oh well, at least I have a clean bath to use to wash up with, and such a kind hostess.\u201d The urge has really gotten bad, and you, without realizing it, separate a part of yourself, which heads towards the room that Ilia is in. You then proceed into the tube, after removing all of your clothing of course. You find the bath rather relaxing, and begin to think of your most recent fight with Sarah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier you had just picked up a new copy of Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks since your sister Sarah flushed your last one down the toilet because she said. \u201cVideo games are for nerds and you're too stupid to be a nerd, so I guess you're just retarded.\u201d She then dropped the game cartridge into the toilet and flushed it away. \u201cWell there it goes with the rest of the shit! Hahaha!\u201d She laughed as you began to get angry due to you paid for that game with your own money and you had almost beaten the game. Fortunately, your parents found out and grounded her, then made her pay for the replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Knock knock* hello? Anthony? Are you alright in there?\u201d You heard the voice of Ilia ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, fine!\u201d You reply, coming up from the water when you hear the door open. \u201cHuh what are you doing, Ilia? I'm nude!\u201d You shout. To your surprise, you see that no one is at the door. You climb out of the tub and quickly shut the door before anyone can see you, then you proceed back into the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What in the...\u201d You say, noticing a small orange haired thing sticking out of the bathtub as you were climbing back in. Then, suddenly, the thing moves to reveal Midna who happily hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so glad that you're okay Anthony!\u201d Midna says, rubbing her face across your chest. \u201cI was starting to get worried when I woke up to find that you weren't beside me, and also that I was in someone's room.\u201d Midna says hugging you tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name, and why are you so happy that I'm ok?\" You ask quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, you possessed me, but the part inside me has let me regain control, albeit with some changes.\" She then let's you go and submerges under water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what are you...\u201d Suddenly you feel you penis beginning to be stroked. \u201c...doing?\u201d You moan a tad bit, not any louder as not to alert Ilia who is just downstairs, but that wouldn't matter anyway as she is currently getting possessed by the part of you that separated. You hear a familiar giggle, then feel your penis suddenly get hard as a rock which Midna smiles at and begin to suck on, to your pleasure. After a few seconds, you cum inside Midna's mouth and she surfaces for some air, coughing a small amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidna? Are you okay?\u201d You ask her, and she smiles, then opens her mouth showing your semen that is filling her mouth. She then closes her mouth and gulps a few times then reopens her mouth showing that she drank all your semen, which you think was a tad cute and a bit disgusting, but you don't reveal that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI drank all my milk!\u201d Midna chuckles and then smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess you did.\u201d You say, smiling as well. Midna then hugs you and you get out of the tub, wrap yourself and Midna in a towel, and proceed to bed after putting on your underwear. Durring the night, that part of you entered Midna's body subconsciously since the urge came back and got too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you see Ilia is beside the bed. \u201cWell, welcome back to the world of the living sleepy head.\u201d She says with a small laugh. You notice that your body feels weird and smaller and that you're alone in the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long was I asleep for.\u201d You ask her leaning up from the bed, and wondering where Midna is, before your eyes go wide and you realize that you spoke with Midna's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's about noon right now, so I'd have to say a good fourteen hours give or take a few minutes, and don't worry, focus on the connection.\" She says. You wonder what she means, then you realize that you can feel like you're in her body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so...\" You begin, mostly leaving Midna's body, but leaving a part inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, we've possessed Ilia.\" You/Ilia replies. \"It was around the time that you were in the bath. I separated from the main body and possessed her. Anyway, here are some new clothes for you and Midna.\u201d You/Ilia hands you a pair of clothes that appear rather similar, if not exactly like that of Link's rancher get up, and a small dress that looks rather similar to Ilia's. \u201cI'll leave you alone for now.\u201d You/Ilia then proceeds down stairs. You quickly get dressed then look to Midna, who you see is beginning to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWakey wakey, my little Twili Princess.\u201d You say with a small chuckle as Midna wakes up and greets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Yawn* Good morning Anthony.\u201d Midna yawns. You help her up and put on the dress for her to wear, to which she comments \u201cI don't really like this type of garb, but I guess it's best not to run around naked everywhere.\u201d She chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I think you look good in anything.\u201d You reply giving her a small kiss on the lips which she then blushes at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then proceed down stairs to see...</span></div></div>",

Midna has partially merged with the piece of you inside of her to make herself appear to be a young human (It was dark the night before so Ilia and the man you'd met didn't realize).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast will be ready in a few minutes, so take a seat at the table.\u201d You/Ilia says with a small cheer, doing a pretty good impersonation of her, which you soon find out is necessary as you nod and the both of you walk to the table to find Link sipping on some herbal tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d He says, greeting you. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You reply. \u201cIlia has a comfy bed.\u201d You smile, and so does Midna. \"This is my sister, Mina. You say, keeping up the charade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is good.\u201d Link replies. \u201cHate to have people go with out sleep, and nice to meet you, Mina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds pass before You/Ilia enters the room, holding two bowls of soup. She sets them down in front of you and Midna, and then a strange growl goes through the room. You laugh a small amount and apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry guess my stomach really wants some food.\u201d You laugh and Midna chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, dig in.\u201d You/Ilia replies, and you happily do. You find that the soup isn't bad, in fact, it is actually kind of good, though normally you don't eat soup for breakfast, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d Link begins. \u201cCan you tell me about your kingdom?\u201d He asks, and you nearly choke on your soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy kingdom uh...\u201d You stutter, unprepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur kingdom is like no other.\u201d Midna explains \u201cIt is extremely advanced, and possess great military, as well as economic power. Our kingdom, the kingdom of Nintendo, is said to be the most powerful of all but, we are better known as the most peaceful kingdom. Our king, Anthony makes sure that we are well fed as well as kept safe from danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait your, king is named Anthony?\u201d Link inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he is.\u201d Midna replies, taking another scoop of her soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen are you the king of which your sister spoke of?\u201d You/Ilia asks to make sure that Link doesn't get suspicious as to why Ilia is staying silent when she normally wouldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is.\u201d Midna replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidn...I mean Mina! We're supposed to keep quiet about that.\u201d You scold at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, calm down.\u201d Link says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe won't tell anyone.\u201d You/Ilia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d You reply. \u201cI just don't want anybody to find out we left. Our kingdom has recently been...*gulp* wiped out.\u201d You say regretfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u201d You/Ilia gasps, pretending to be shocked..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Link asks angered that his guest, who he believes to be a king, had his own kingdom wiped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happened late at night while most of the towns people were asleep.\u201d You begin. \u201cA lone being, no not a being, but rather a creature of which possessed strange dark magic powers, somehow entered our castle town without using the gate, nor one of the other entrances. He just appeared in the center of town out of a strange black portal. My loyal solders and I were no match for him as he simply transformed my men into hideous beasts. I managed to escape by the skin of my teeth back to the castle but...when I got there the castle was ablaze. I heard the cries of Mina and found her outside in some bushes. I took her in hand and ran. We're now running from that...that thing. So, now you know.\u201d You finish. Link gripped his fist in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonster!\u201d He said, angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, just let me be on our way and we'll leave so that that thing doesn't come here looking for us.\u201d You plead, trying to get Link to leave you alone so you can leave this game world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but no.\u201d Link replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But if you don't he'll come and destroy your village like our kingdom, only he'll probably burn it to the ground!\u201d Midna shouts back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Link slams his fists into the table \u201cI won't allow such evil to go around, freely destroying kingdom after kingdom until nothing is left, I'll find some way to stop it.\u201d As Link says this, you notice that Link's hand is glowing slightly with the Triforce of Courage, though no one but you notice, not even Link himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so determined?\u201d Midna asks, angered by the man's stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just can't sit back and let something so horrible happen!\" Link replies back. Link calms down and gets up from the table. \u201cI'm going to go for a walk, so just... just stay here for a little while I'm gone.\u201d Link then leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he's gone.\u201d You say breathing a sigh of relief. \u201cNice job with the little story Midna.\u201d You tell her and she smiles defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like I planned.\u201d Midna chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we can head back to my room now.\u201d You say, and then turn back into liquid as do You/Ilia and Minda, and the three of you return to your room. You find that the game is still on and you decide to turn it since Link would eventually be able to find out that he was tricked. You shut the Wii off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are we going to do now?\u201d Midna asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reply \u201c...\u201d</span></div></div>",

You find yourself in a save room right before facing the final boss, and found Samus resting at the save point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s time to finish this.\u201d Samus says as she steps out of the save point. You quickly attack her, and try to possess her, though she does fight back, hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSystems detect a possible parasitic enzyme like creature.\u201d The armor says informing her of your presence. You rush at her, and swarm around her head, but she somehow manages to rip you off and throw you against the wall. Samus aims her light beam at you and shoots, but you dodge it with relative ease, though her next shot isn't as easy to avoid, as she readies her annihilator beam. She open fires on you, forcing you to dodge extremely fast but one shot landed a hit on you. You would scream out in agony if you could as the shot hit you, but you soon recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fine if I can\u2019t get her like this, then I will use my normal body.' You think as you and transform back into your original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? It can transform!?\u201d Samus exclaims in shock, and then begins to fire at you. You lift your hand up and begin to use abilities copied from Midna, though you do attempt to put a little of your touch on them. You summon up a twilight hand, and have it block the attack. \u201cWhat!? It can summon up monsters as well!?\u201d Samus says, thinking that your weird hair/hand thing is a creature, and then begins to fire off several seeker missiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dodge, then run at Samus, and punch her in the face, knocking her back, but she lands on her feet and spin jumps at you. You get hit and land on your back as Samus walks up to and charges up one final shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the end for you creature.\u201d She says, ready to fire her gun, but you quickly turn into your liquid form and shoot up into her gun, and then enter into the circuitry of her suit, and reprogram it to be under your control. The suit locks in place under your mental orders, and Samus can no longer move, since the suit is stronger than her, you have the suit lift up her arms, grab her helmet, and then take it off. She looks shocked as she struggles, but you go onto her face and begin to go down her mouth. She tries to close her mouth, but you have the suit take her fingers, and put them inside her mouth to hold it open as you slip inside. Samus tries in vain to move her arms, and tries to keep you from getting of yourself in by moving her head around, but to no success as you merely slip in faster until you are completely inside her body. You make it into her stomach, and then dissolve, taking full control of her. You black out, but awaken to find that you are now in control of Samus. You aim your arm canon at various spots, testing how your new body works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decide to exit the game and turn your whole body into liquid as you leave the game for home. You exit the TV to find no one in your room, and quickly take off the suit, seeing as it is kind of stuffy in there, as well as restricting. You are now in control of Zero-suit Samus, which in all honesty, she is hot. You like how your hair is up in a ponytail, but feel that you will look better if you undo it, so you take out the hair tie, and your hair falls down on your back strait, which looks a lot better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, much better.\u201d You say happily. You decide to look at yourself in the mirror to admire your new body a little more, and found a standing one in your sister's Mia's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the room, and then begin to wonder out loud \u201cWhere are Midna, Ilia, and my copy?\u201d As if on cue, you then begin to hear the phone ring. You leave Samus's body, but leave a portion of it stay in Samus to remain in control, and you pick it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, who is it?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Anthony, it's me.\u201d The voice on the phone says, and you recognize it as Midna's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you guys?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we went out for ice cream.\u201d Midna says happily. \u201cWe'll be home in a bit so don't worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You went out in public!? What if you cause a panic, since you don't exactly look normal!?\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm you, I found out that we can merge with whoever we possess, so long as we take traits from both our normal form and the body of the girl we've possessed, the problem is that we are in control, while merged, the girl's mind basically doesn't exist, but we'd have her mind.\" You/Midna replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you/Midna hangs up the phone, and you put the phone back on the charger. You decide that while Midna's group is gone you'd figure you'd get some alone time with Samus. You do the same as you did to Ilia, but remain in control. You/Samus begins to strip. You make a seductive comment on how soft her breasts are as you gave them a small squeeze. You/Samus blushes at this and replies with a sexual comment of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re ready to rock 'n roll.\u201d She comments seductively as she strokes on your penis, which is beginning to poke its way through your pants. You blush a little bit and take off your pants and shirt, leaving only your underwear. You/Samus smiles, slowly slips off your underwear, and then begins to lick the tip of your penis, which sends a wave of pleasure up your body. You moan in pleasure as you/Samus begins to suck on your member, as well as watching you/Samus finger herself while sucking your cock. You feel yourself ready to ejaculate, but you/Samus stops sucking suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy'd you stop?\u201d You ask her, pretending not to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I was getting jealous of you being the only one who was getting the pleasure.\u201d You/Samus says seductively, despite the fact that you are both feeling the pleasure that she gave you, and turned around, revealing her dripping wet pussy. You look at it for a few seconds, and then begin to lick it as she moans in pleasure as you do also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you enjoying this?\u201d You ask, despite knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d She replies. \u201cDon't stop licking my pussy!\u201d She moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then stand up and begin to prod you/Samus with your still fully erected penis as she moans out in even greater pleasure. You/Samus then begs you to stick it in, and you do so as you ram your dick into her wet pussy, her pussy juices spilling out onto the floor as you rapidly ram into her. You feel as if you have reached Your/Samus's womb, and are about to cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! Cum inside me!\u201d She begs, and so you do so as your sperm enters her womb like that of a fired gun, although it comes out longer though, seeing as a gun only fires one quick shot. After a few seconds of this last moment of ecstasy, you pull out of Your/Samus's vagina, and then both of you take a shower and begin put your clothes on after drying off.  Before you could put on your pants you/Samus walks up to you, kisses you on the cheek, and then proceeds to do the same with your now non erect penis, although this time with a small chuckle afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the wonderful time.\u201d You/Samus says to you, and then proceeds to lie down on your bed and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're welcome,\u201d You whisper into her ear and then cover her up with a comforter before proceeding to put your pants back on, and begin to put your shirt back on.

Midna takes the game you have chosen and slips it inside of the Wii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game is Mario Galaxy, which in turn holds two gorgeous beauties, each of great caliber, though one is better than the other (by that she was actually useful in the game). These two women are Princess Rosalina and Princess Peach. As you are about to go in to the game, you/Samus begins to awaken. You look over and walk back to your bedside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's up guys?\u201d She asks cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing much.\u201d You tell her. \u201cThough we're about to go into Mario Galaxy. Wanna come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re going into space, your best bet is to bring me with you.\u201d You/Samus says as she gets out of bed and puts her zero-suit back on. \u201cDo you want me to bring my armor with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, but realize you're just going to snatch and grab for this one, and no real fighting will be needed, so you reply \u201cNah, we won't need it. Speed will be better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou/Samus nods, and then hugs you. \u201cThanks Anthony.\u201d She replies, and then whispers into your ear semi-seductively \u201cI guess you really like me in this outfit.\u201d She chuckles seductively, and then gives you a small kiss on the cheek, before letting go of you, and then raising her arm in a cheer. \u201cLet's go!\u201d<br>\r\nin a cheer \u201cLet's go!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You take out a DVD, put it in the DVD player, turn it on, and select to watch the first episode. During the intro, you suddenly feel weird, and then you turn into liquid and enter the show. When you land, you see that you are right beside Kushina, with Minato and Naruto nowhere in sight, but with dead bodies of the people who were helping Kushina nearby. You figure that this means that Minato is currently fighting Obito, who is pretending to be Madara Uchiha. You suddenly feel the urge to enter Kushina's body, which you quickly begin to do. As you slither towards her, she notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the- what's that!?\" She wonders out loud, trying to sit up, but with her diminished strength due to the recent extraction of Kurama, she is unable to do so, and you soon begin to enter her through her vagina, since she is wearing a dress, so nobody would notice if they would happen to come by. \"N-No! Get out of me...\" She says with a moan as you begin to enter. You soon get completely inside, and are soon fighting for control as she fights against your influence. Her body spasms as she fights. \"Can't... let... this... thing... win!\" She declares, before, against her will, she gives a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no choice, I'm in control now.\" Her voice says, with you in control of the words, You completely take over, and then you pass out. You later awaken in a room, which you realize is the one Naruto was left in after Minato saved him, but neither are in the room. You sit up, feeling a jiggle on your chest, which you know to be Kushina's breast, and look out the window. You see Gambunta fighting Kurama, with a siloet that you know is Minato's, on top of him. You quickly stand up, and begin running towards the exit, only to trip and fall with your new center of gravity. You get up and frown. \"What can I do? I need to get out there and try to change things so that I get some of Kurama's chakra.\" You realize then that you can put Kushina on autopilot and also gain access to her memories. You put her on autopilot after making changes to her to make her your loyal servant, and have her head to Minato as you search through her memories. Kushina gets to Gambunta and jumps on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minato!\" Kushina shouts as he turns to her and looks on in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kushina!? What are you doing here!? You were passed out!\" Minato exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the Uzumaki Clan's healing ability, it's part of why I'm still alive after the removal of the Nine-tails.\" She replies. \"Are you about to do what I think you are?\" She says, showing displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean sealing the fox in Naruto, then partially, I'm sealing half it's chakra and its consciousness inside him.\" Minato replied. \"And don't even think of asking me to re-seal it inside you, your body is still too weak for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I can handle half of it, so seal the other half in me!\" She says, since you've given her the mental command not to sacrifice her life. Minato looks on in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing you, I thought you were going to seal it alongside me.\" He says in his shock. Kushina shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if everyone finds out that Naruto is a Jinchuriki, then his life will be misserable if he has no parents to help him, so I'm going to stay around to watch over and help him grow.\" Minato looks torn about putting part of the fox in her in her weakened state, and he opens his mouth, most likely to refuse, but a glare from his wife shuts him up before he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but will you please finally agree to sign the toad contract, so that it isn't up to Jiraiah-sensei to do so?\" He asks. Kushina, with a mental command from you, agrees, and after signing the contract, and getting Gambunta's blessings since he is there, Minato completes the Reaper Death Seal, and half of Kurama's chakra is sealed in Kushina's body, along with half in Naruto's. Naruto has the fox's consciousness, while you don't. Minato dies with a smile on his face about the fact that Naruto will have a parent to watch over him. Kushina goes over to Naruto and picks him up, cradling him in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kushina.' You think to her, having finished going through her memories. 'I'm done with your memories, and I'm taking over now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish master.\" Kushina whispers as you take over. The third Hokage then gets there and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kushina, did Minato-\" He begins, knowing about the jutsu. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sealed half back in me, and the other into Naruto at the cost of his life.\" You inform him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that means I have to come out of retirement.\" He says with a sigh. You shake the head that until recently belonged to Kushina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! In case you forgot, there's a prime candidate who wants the position right in front of you!\" You state, glad for her desire to be Hokage, as that makes it so that he doesn't question you. \"If go back into office at your age, the council will walk all over you since you are most likely tired in your old age.\" You say, remembering easy Danzo and the adivers managed to pull stuff behind his back, and knowing with how Naruto was hinted at being treated in the series that most likely, the part of the council made up of civilians, who were ignorant of ninja arts, pulled some stunts do hinder Naruto. The third Hokage looks hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" He asks. \"You know about the paperwork since your husband was the fourth Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know a way around it.\" You say simply. He looks shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How!?\" He exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two words: Shadow Clones.\" You say, making him face palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm called the professor, and I couldn't figure that out...\" He said with a sigh. \"Alright, I agree, you will be fifth Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-12 years later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Village Hidden in the Leaves prosphered with you in charge, the arrogent members of the civillian council and the elders soon found that they couldn't bully you into letting them have their way, as proved when you stopped them from accusing Naruto of being Kurama reborn, after revealing that Kushina has been his Jinchuriki since she was young, and to believe that Naruto is Kurama due to Kurama being sealed in him would be to believe that Kushina is Kurama, meaning she would have given birth to herself, which is ridiculous; his father being the fourth Hokage, who was considered the greatest hero the village ever had also helped. You also revealed that the person who caused the attack had the Mangeku Sharingan like Madara Uchiha, and claimed to be him, stopping the Uchiha from being mistrusted due to people thinking they were behind the attack, making it so they had no reason to rebel. During the time you were in charge, you stopped the kidnapping of Hinata, keeping the perpetrator alive, and using his testomony to force the Raikage to bow to your wishes after the Daimyo found out about it. You had him send over Yugito Nii, the two-tailed container, and possessed her as well, along with Anko when she returned to the village, destroying the taint of the Curse Mark that would cause her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found proof of Danzo keeping Root around, along with all of his other dealings that caused the village trouble, some of which incriminated the other two elders, giving you an excuse to kill them off. On the 11th year, you had a part of yourself exist Kushina's body and become a member of the hidden leaf village, altering your appearance to look like you are 11 so that there is no suspison. The teachers are shocked at how much you knew, and how good you were, curtisy of Kushina, Yugito, and Anko's experience, not that you told them that. You also revealed that you could turn into liquid, calling it a bloodline, but didn't mention the possession ability, saying that your ability to copy skills and bloodlines from females came from an ability of your bloodline, and it is caused by females falling for you. You also mention that said females gain the ability to turn into liquid, but not the copy abilities (you don't reveal that Kushina's body has the abilities, but you do with Anko and Yugito). With your support, Naruto wasn't dead last, as his learning wasn't sabatoged. Next to yourself, he was the top student, although you didn't teach him any jutsu above acadamy level other than Shadow Clones, telling them that he isn't ready for the other jutsu. There are only a few weeks left until the graduation exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://xxjauntyeyes28xx.deviantart.com/art/Kushina-297720141?q=sort%3Atime%20kushina%20uzumaki&amp;qo=70\" target=\"_blank\">http://xxjauntyeyes28xx.deviantart.com/a...</a> (her hair is a darker shade of red)<br>\r\nAnko: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th01.deviantart.net/fs18/300W/i/2007/212/3/5/mitarashi_anko_by_spletje.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th01.deviantart.net/fs18/300W/i/2...</a><br>\r\nYugito: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/207/6/a/yugito_nii_by_fidjera-d41pngz.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/20...</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're walking down the street in your normal body. Class at the ninja acadamy had just finished for the week, leaving you with one week to go. Naruto is still a prankster like he is in the actual series, but with his mother around to give him love and support, and to acknowledge his existance (although not actually his real mother), he never became a class clown, and isn't so desperate to have people acknowledge that he exists that he clings onto a girl who hates him and abuses him, not that Sakura would in this timeline. Your blood boiled upon thought of the pink haired fangirl. With Naruto being the top of his classes before you entered, and being the son of the Fourth and Fifth Hokages, she had been fangirling over him instead of Sasuke, since Sasuke had only been second best. Luckily, you as his mother, had steered him clear of potentially liking her, since you remember the cruel things she did in the actual series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list of things she did in part one includes: harming Naruto for complimenting her since it was him and not her precious Sasuke, as well as doing so when Naruto would do something that she wanted to do, or eventually would do, and when he would have an idea, while calling him an idiot, but if Sasuke would agree, she'd act like he was the smartest guy ever, completely ignoring that it was Naruto's idea in the first place, trying to abandon the Leaf village to be with Sasuke after he went traitor, after which, she claimed that Sasuke was kidnapped, even though he left willingly, so as not to put him in a negative light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list of things in part two includes: Giving giving Naruto a false confession of love to make him believe he had a chance to be with her (luckily he didn't fall for it), only to try to betray the village again when she knocked out the team she put together so they couldn't stop her from joining Sasuke, basically letting him have a kunai that she coated with a poison that was potent enough to kill an Uzumaki despite their healing (and since Naruto was the only one she knew that had healing that powerful, she most likely planned to have it used on Naruto), when he fell unconscious, she freaked out in a manner not becoming a medic as skilled as her, which with just as serious cases, she stayed calm, and if Kakashi hadn't told her to heal Naruto, she would have let him die, then when he later passed out from it again (showing that she didn't finish the job, which is odd since she made the poison, so with how she has been shown to treat poisoning, she'd make sure to have an antidote that would completely heal him, implying that she didn't want him healed) she tried to punch him, before Karin pointed out that it was her fault. What really makes you mad is that Karin is the only person in the series who has ever called Sakura out on any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are currently planning your take-over of three more girls: Sakura, Hinata, and Ino. You pass by a training field, only to see Sakura and Ino having an argument about which one of them will get you, acting like you are just a prize to be won. You twitch a little in annoyance, before heading over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls!\" You call out. They both look over at you, get hearts in their eyes, and rush at you, Ino starts hugging your right arm, while Sakura starts hugging your left. Of course this starts their arguing even fiercer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go, piggy!\" Sakura growls out at Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way forehead! Anthony's mine!\" Ino snaps back. By this time, you've separated a part of your liquid self from your main body, and have it slither towards Ino, unseen by either girl, then have it shoot up her skirt. Ino instantly drops to her knees, spasming as she feels your liquid self entering her body from her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong piggy? Have you finally realized that Anthony belongs with me?\" Sakura says in a cruel tone. You take Sakura, spin her to face your face, then plunge your head down into a kiss, which she returns. She opens her mouth, hoping for a make-out session, but you wrap your arms around her tightly enough to keep her from moving away as you shoot some of your liquid self down her throat. Sakura spasms, and if you weren't holding her body up, she would have collapsed on the ground. Both girls fall unconscious as you take control of their bodies and minds. You wake them up, but leave Sakura's mind conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on?' Sakura wonders, before noticing that she didn't say it out-loud. 'Why can't I talk!?' Her face stretches into a grin under your control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why simple, Sakura, I'm in control of your body.\" You say through Sakura's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wh-What!? Who are you, and how did you do that!?' She demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm insulted, Sakura.\" You say through Ino. \"You and Ino have been chasing after me for a year, and you don't know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait!? Anthony!?' Sakura asks. All three bodies grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Sakura.\" You say through your original body. \"I've taken control, and just to punish you for your cruelty, I've left your consciousness aware, so that you can spend the rest of your life in the back of your own head, watching someone else live out your life, with absolutely no say in what happens. Basically being a prisoner in your own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cruelty!? What cruelty!?' Sakura questions, which causes you to show her every cruel thing she did to Naruto in the actual series, along with the knowledge of the fact that it was in another timeline, before cutting off the link, so that she can't bother you with her thoughts, being completely isolated in her own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-elsewhere-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been having Kushina use the crystal ball in the Hokage's office in order to keep track of Hinata, who you're heading to with Yugito's body, while you're having Anko's body keep Kurenai busy at a restraunt. While Kurenai isn't watching, you spike her drink with some of your liquid self. You, as Yugito, run into Hinata, quite litteraly, causing the girl to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, s-sorry, I-I didn't mean to get in your way ma'am.\" Hinata appologizes as she gets up and gives a slight bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, so, where are you off to?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My father wants me to spar with my little sister today.\" Hinata replies with a small sigh. \"I always l-lose to her since I c-can't bring myself to harm my little sister, and my f-father thinks that I'm a failure. I-I'm also too shy to tell the guy I love h-how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you don't have much confidence.\" You reply, as you feel Kurenai come under your control. \"Here, take this.\" You say, handing her a piece of your liquid self. \"This is made to help people relax and give them confidence. It will allow you to be brave enough to confess to your crush.\" Although you don't tell her that the person she has a \"crush\" on will change. She takes the piece of your liquid self, and with a moment of hesitation, plops it into her mouth. Hinata chews, during which you separate your liquid self in a way to make it seem like the chewing is causing it, she soon swallows, and just like that, you are now in control. Since she swallowed you willingly, not that she knew what she was swallowing, her body doesn't pass out. You put a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much.\" You say through Hinata, making her body bow politely, then rushing off as her, eager to show Hiashi and Hanabi that \"Hinata\" isn't the failure that they think she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich point of view will you follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: The three of them aren't wearing the headbands at the moment since they haven't graduated yet.<br>\r\nSakura: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img-cache.cdn.gaiaonline.com/ebc7244c878a3217d5fd4b5e55d35f8e/http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w53/ST-chan/Naruto/Sakura%20Haruno/Long%20Hair%20Sakura/cutesakura.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img-cache.cdn.gaiaonline.com/ebc7...</a><br>\r\nIno: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kF3J2soAXgo/TKlT7Q_C4ZI/AAAAAAAAADg/wMD4WHzr0ag/s1600/ino.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kF3J2soAXgo/TK...</a><br>\r\nHinata: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/129/64874-naruto_hinata0033.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/129...</a></span></div></div>",

After the cool intro, the character select screen popped up. He soon selected Sonya Blade, but then he felt dizzy. His hands started to shake, the room seemed to be moving around him and he felt really light, almost as if he was air itself. Anthony looked down at his hands and noticed they looked like water. Before he could even put a thought together, Anthony was pulled into his T.V. and he blacked out. While this happened, he dropped out of the sky, right above Sonya. Sonya looked up and saw the liquid Anthony had become falling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is tha-\" She began to ask before Anthony landed in her mouth and went down her throat, knocking her out. When Anthony came to, he could feel that he was on a rocky ground. Slowly he started to open his eyes and noticed he was outside, but there was something yellow in front of his left eye, so he couldn't see as well with that one. As he started to stand up, he felt a weight on his chest, and that he was wearing really tight jeans. He looked down, and to his surprise, he found that he had huge breasts, and that he was wearing a tight white tank top, dark green pants, and black fingerless gloves that went almost to his elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap ....I'm Sonya Blade?!!\" Anthony/Sonya said in a very feminine voice, she realized that it was hair covering her eye, so she moved that piece of hair out of her face.

As she swayed her hair around she didn't notice that Kitana had approached her position from the north entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing? We have a match right now!!!\" She yells at Anthony/Sonya. This sudden confrontation kind of freaks out Anthony, due to the fear she felt in Sonya she closed her eyes and focused on getting back home. This set him back in his room, but out of Sonya's body, completely unharmed, and at 3:30 in the afternoon. The exact time he started the game was the time that he re-emerged from the game. Looking around the house, it was just him still in his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Odd very odd.\" He stated to himself. As Anthony looked back at his TV screen, he saw that Sonya looked different than she normally did. Her beret was off and her hair down, the pause menu was up, so nothing else was happening.

'Wait a minute, I turned into liquid before being sucked into the game the first time, then I wake up in Sonya's body. I wonder...' The battle begins suddenly. Kitana charges and tries to slash Anthony, who dodges. 'I have to try!' Anthony charges at Kitana suddenly and tackles her to the ground. Kitana accidentally drops her fans when that happens.

There is constant flux in their super human powers, but one thing that stays the same is that if they had super strength then it doesn\u2019t diminish. If they have protection against magic, which she does, then it won\u2019t diminish either, but the gullible are always going to be gullible. Your body is about the same size as mine is, but you have far more strength and tactics for combat, plus, lets not forget that if she suddenly thought I was attacking her, she would have no care in the world and underestimate me, or someone who looked like me, long enough for us to get the drop on her.\u201d Catwoman explains her plan in full details that make perfect sense to Anthony/Sonya who would of thought of this if she had the mind of a criminal mastermind to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh wait, I do, in the form of Catwoman.' Anthony/Sonya realized, but there seems to be a slight delay for some reason in the logic of this plan. It is interesting to think of, but right now the plan goes ahead. Anthony/Sonya starts to take her clothes off behind one of the huge generators. \u201cJust toss suit over!\u201d She says to Anthony/Catwoman, who is on the other side of generator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anthony/Catwoman starts to remove her leather gloves, she says \"Well...as long as I have this body, I might as well have some fun with it...\" She twirls about and removes her gloves, sliding them over to Anthony/Sonya who was exchanging clothing at the same time. Anthony/Catwoman unzips her cat suit\u2019s zipper, which is right under her massive breasts. She feels how tightly the leather is gripping her body, and squeezing her breasts is really arousing her. She fumbles with the belt, and finally, after much squeezing and erotic moaning, slides it off of her fine body. With also a bit of effort, she begins sliding her tight leather cat suit off, feeling her ass being squeezed as she slide her suit past her very tight ass. Anthony/Catwoman is getting very frisky with her new naked body, she rubs her breasts and struts around with only her boots and mask to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please hurry up over there? This suit is so tight, are you sure we are the same size?\u201d Anthony/Sonya shouts over at Anthony/Catwoman who keeps hearing Anthony/Sonya grunt and groan as she was putting on her new suit. Anthony/Catwoman tosses her boots over as she gently removes her mask and goggles. Anthony/Sonya slides her clothing over for Anthony/Catwoman to put on. </span></div></div>",

With out any words between the two Anthony/Catwoman and Anthony/Kitana decide to trade clothing as well. The two change clothes rather quickly, almost to surprise Anthony/Sonya when she comes out. \"How does everything fit now?\u201d Anthony/Catwoman asks as Anthony/Sonya finishes putting her new mask on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is so tight, how do you even breath in this thing?\u201d Anthony/Sonya asks as she slowly starts to walk out from behind the generator.

Lets see how that looks... Perfect!\u201d Anthony/Sonya states as she backs away after making the adjustment to the mask that Anthony/Catwoman is wearing. Anthony/Kitana puts her clothing on with no problems, and agrees to follow just a few steps behind them. Anthony/Sonya is still adjusting to how to walk in heels, but it will be no problem once they get the drop on Wonder Woman. </span></div></div>",

She takes out her whip and began to practice. As she twirls around and snaps her whip, she realizes that the fight would be won with her mitts, not this whip.

Do you have PS3?\u201d Anthony asked, now a little bit interested in what she had to say, not much just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t have that \u201csystem\u201d per say, but I knew you did.\u201d The gothic Amy replied while giving an almost deadeye look at Anthony. He noticed that with her thick make-up around her eyes, she was concealing an actual pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, umm what?\u201d Anthony asked confused by her odd response, plus he really was getting lost in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t normally talk to people who are normal. I saw through your window that you have a P...S...3.? I thought you might enjoy some company. That\u2019s when my aunt forced me over here.\u201d Amy\u2019s voice was getting less monotone and more feminine, if Anthony didn\u2019t know any better he would be infatuated with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon't you come in then? I've just started, so I\u2019m not that far in yet.\" Anthony gloated to his new neighbor. Amy glided in; the bottom of her dress hid her feet. Normally when you enter a room for the first time there is a hesitation, but Amy had no hesitation. \u201cI've only started off with Sonya, she was one of my favorites back in the day, but I'll pick someone else if you want.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Sonya was the first Vessel for you then? Super!!!\u201d Amy grinned, Anthony just booted up the system. By the time he realized what she said, it was too late. Amy grabbed hold of Anthony\u2019s hand and soon they both were liquid forms being sucked into the screen.</span></div></div>",

Anthony thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d Anthony/Kitana said, walking towards Anthony. Anthony quickly looked to see where his other bodies were. Where did Sonya and Catwoman go? For that matter, where did his newly acquired Wonder Woman go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least I still have Kitana's body.' Anthony thought as the rest of him he entered Kitana's body, who was still sporting Sonya\u2019s Uniform. As Anthony let the downpoor of himself flow into Anthony/Kitana\u2019s mouth, She closed her eyes for a second. Anthony/Kitana soon opened her eyes; she whipped off the access water from her mouth. \u201cThat feels better.\" She felt her chest. Ouch, wow I didn\u2019t realize that I was bigger than Sonya in most places.\u201d Anthony/Kitana said as she felt her uniform now gripping her body. In a second, her memories of her drones came back to her, and she remembered everything from Anthony/Kitana\u2019s point of view. She started sorting through the memories to figure out what happened.

Then Sonya looked at Anthony/Kitana and smiled. \u201cYeah, you did a great job so far, I can\u2019t wait to create my own drones.\u201d Amy/Sonya said to Anthony/Kitana, who was shocked to see the former body of the woman he spent so much time building up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were originally all going to stay with your grandparents but your grandparents couldn't support more than two so Megan was elected.

GLUB! GLUB! Your liquid form was quickly falling from Sailor Mercury's mouth, to the floor. You were half way out when a soft knock came to your door.

It was a safe bet that people would see her as a mysterious friend and start asking questions. This would especially be true with Kat, who still had a huge crush on you. Then there was Megan, who decided to visit you at a bad time and saw you in mid transformation, if one could call it that. She was intelligent and knew how to keep a secret but you were concerned that she might want to visit an Anime world. You somehow knew that you could do this but you were concerned that you and she may become separated or she may end up getting hurt, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony?\" asked Ami, pulling you from your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you will be a friend I had talked to online for a while, here on a surprise visit.\" you said, turning to her. \"Megan came to visit and fainted for some reason. I put her in my bed to rest up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that could work.\" replied Ami. \"I am from Japan.\" she looked over at Megan as she began to stir. \"Megan is starting to come around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to her.\" you said, walking over to your bed. \"If anything, to get our stories straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled a chair from your desk then sat down by your bed, just as Megan opened her eyes. she looked around for a moment then spotted you and Ami.\" How did you do that, Anthony?\" she asked, slowly sitting up. \"Who is your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Ami.\" you replied. \"She is sailor Mercury from the Anime cartoon, Sailor Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's eyes widened, surprised. If you had told her this without her seeing your transformation, you knew that she would have thought you were crazy. She opened her mouth to speak but you quickly cut her off, knowing what her next question would be. \"I really don't know how I got these powers, Megan.\" you told her. \"I just know that I now have them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on to explain what you had figured out through experimenting with your new power and what you had done with it so far. As you explained your new found power, Megan's eyes began to tear up with a touch of hope in her eyes as she pulled the covers off herself and sat up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If... If you were to go into one of these Anime worlds, could they effect this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seriously doubt it.\" you replied to her tears. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan began to sob a little louder. \"My dad... he.... he.... (gulp/sob!).... he was murdered last week in Europe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned slightly pale, as did Ami, and you both bowed your heads slightly. \"I'm sorry.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been very hard to take.\" said Ami, tearing up. \"I am very sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came down to Megan's level and offered her a hug, which she gratefully accepted, crying quietly on her shoulder while you contemplated how to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I take it that your mom is now doing the traveling.\" you said, trying to be gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is.\" replied Megan, talking more than she usually did. \"The family has been broken up. Jacinta and Hannah are living with my grandparents but they can only afford to take on two, I've been sent here to live while mom is away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will help you unpack.\" you said, standing up. \"The spare bedroom is still open.\" you turned to Ami. \"Care to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi nodded. \"I'd be happy to.\" she replied. \"Come on, Megan, we can all talk while we get you unpacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded, getting off the bed and followed as you led them out of your room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It surprised Anthony that Megan had so little as it all seemed to fit inside two large duffel bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this all of your possessions?\" asked Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan shook her head. \"It's all I could carry.\" she replied softly. \"The rest had to be left behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you were moved out of your house in a hurry.\" said Ami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded. \"Mom packed them, just the bare essentials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnzipping the first duffel bag, Megan pulled out what Anthony guessed to be her most prized possession. He had expected it to be a doll or teddy bear but instead, it was a photograph of her father. Anthony and Ami teared up slightly, seeing her give the man in the picture a kiss and placed it onto the bare nightstand by what was to become her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to unpack your clothes?\" asked Ami, stepping forward. she grinned. \"I don't think you want Anthony touching your unmentionables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony blushed slightly as Megan smiled slightly, the first smile since she woke up in Anthony's room. \"That's fine.\" she said, pointing to second duffel bag. \"\"I like my undergarments in the top drawer, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi nodded and got to work as Anthony then peered into the first bag and found a small rag doll. \"Is this your friend?\" he asked, pulling it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded and gently took it from him. \"Her name is Lilly.\" she said. \"Dad... took her with him when he.... traveled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the tears flowing from her eyes again, Anthony pulled her into a gentle hug, which she accepted. It took a moment for her to regain her composure but she smiled upon breaking the hug. \"Thank you, Anthony.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what family is for.\" replied Anthony with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unpacking went smoothly after that and soon, Megan was settled in. \"I must ask you not to tell anyone about what I able to do.\" said Anthony, firmly but kindly. \"If word got out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded. \"I won't tell anyone.\" she promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving Megan in her new room for the time being, Anthony and Ami walked towards the stairs to hear someone arguing behind a closed door. Anthony recognized the voice as Mary, his 21 year old sister, who was home on vacation from college. \"If you think you can intimidate me like that, you are mistaken!\" came her furious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\"asked Ami, curious \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony shook his head, confused. \"That's my sister, Mary, visiting from college.\" he replied. \"I can't be sure but I believe someone has gotten under her skin, not an easy task, I might add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me of the case, show me you're not involved!\" said Mary's angered voice before the sound of the receiver slamming down reached their ears. \"It's not like Mary to be that upset with anyone.\" thought Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened and Mary spotted toy and Ami before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a certain awkwardness in her step, as if she really did not want to be around anyone she did not know, which worried Anthony greatly. <i>\"I need to find out what's going on.\"</i> he thought. \"Ami, can you knock my sister out without hurting her?\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi nodded and Anthony motioned for her to do so then watched as Ami walked up behind Mary and touched her shoulder in a particular way, causing her to sigh before crumbling to the floor with Ami softening her fall. \"Just gently hold her there.\" said Anthony. \"I'm going to have a quick look at her memories and see what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Anthony transformed into his liquid state and entered Mary's mouth while Ami gently held it open. Mary, although unconscious, fought the sudden rush of liquid into her mouth but Anthony made his way in and possessed her. Opening her eyes, Mary stood up and turned to Ami. \"We better get into Mary's room, the rest of the family will be returning home soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and followed Mary into her bedroom where she sat down onto the bed as Mary took a chair while, inside, Anthony searched her memories. What he found, however, sent a chill through his mind as the first impression he received from her memories was an overwhelming urge to end her own life. Fearful for his sister, Anthony resolved to discover why..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a week ago when Mary was looking through a number of cold cases and found one her uncle Hank had been working on in Europe. It was a multiple murder case, involving an entire family. The bodies were discovered in a shallow grave on the grounds of of a factory, owned by a powerful industrialist, named Devlen Zeus. This made him the primary suspect as he was known to threaten people who got in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anthony dug deeper into Mary's memories, he saw Mary investigating the case from her end on campus as Devlen Zeus owned a factory only a few miles away. At first, Anthony thought Mary to be foolish, taking on such a case alone until he discovered the murdered family was her best friend who had vanished with her family. Two days after starting her own investigation, she received word that uncle Hank was found murdered in his hotel room in Europe and his family was sent threatening notes, moving them to flee into hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is insane.\"</i> thought Anthony, inside Mary. <i>\"Whoever killed uncle Hank must be trying to warn Mary off. But why does she have this urge to commit suicide?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came to him with the next wave of Mary's memories. He saw through her eyes as a man attacked her in a park on campus and proceeded to strip her of her clothing. \"You are way over your head, little girl.\" said her unknown attacker. \"Consider this bit of fun a warning, get off the Zeus case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary screamed, fighting the man but he only slapped or punched her viciously with each attempt to resist. The man had her completely naked within a minute and was pushing her legs apart when a number of hands grabbed his shoulder and pulled him off. A group of students had heard her screams and rushed to her aid, chasing the man off after a struggle. Only, these students were all in Mary's class and Anthony knew that Mary did not like anyone to see her naked, let alone looking helpless....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen enough, Anthony retreated from Mary's body and returned to his solid state. As he did, he considered the option to keep a part of himself within Mary to keep an eye on her due to her desire to end her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Anthony keep a part of himself within Mary?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean come on.. who wouldn't pick Ryu? You start off fighting M. Bison, (Vega in Japan). The Psycho powered juggernaut bares his fists and stances up as you crack your neck. Simple fight. Ryu can mop the floor with Bison any day. \"FIGHT!\" The word rings out as you lob a Hadouken at your opponent, knocking him back and doing damage. The fight progresses normally, until a shock runs through your body. It's insane... a deep pain, ringing throughout your entire body, rendering you useless. The controller falls to the floor and Ryu takes a wicked beating on the screen as you convulse in pain, feeling pain in the exact same places... that Ryu is being hit. You pass out as Ryu becomes incapacitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's dark... and cold... You wake up in a small laboratory, you are dropped into a vat of some liquid as you enter the game. You see Ryu trussed up in electrodes and strapped to a metal table. \"What the hell.. wha.. I\" He stutters a bit angrily as he wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to the world of the living Ryu.. how are you feeling?\" A dark voice calls out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bison... Is that... how did I..\" He stutters on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for chat.. my dear girl... there is work to be done.\" Bison calls back.. and you can hear laughter in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl.. What.. argh!!\" Electric shocks course throughout his body, rendering his speech useless as he's dumped into whatever you're in. Electricity courses through the you, shocking you both in certain areas, filling you with immeasurable pain. Eventually the pain stops and you're raised out of the vat. Bison walks up to you, cocky as he could ever be as he stares at you. He stops and asks a simple, simple question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"</span></div></div>",

You have come to really love the PSP recently due to receiving Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Tag Force 4 (or simply Tag Force 4), which you have managed to achieve a massive advantage by teaming up with each of the Signers and then in turn the Dark Signers, which has given you access to some of the stronger cards. Currently you are focusing on completing the game with Carly's Dark Signer version, having completed the game already with her regular form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as you and Carly are walking around the Downtown District in the game, you feel yourself becoming less and less solid, until finally you turn into a liquid puddle, the PSP floating on you. Before you have a chance to freak out about these turn of events, you feel the PSP sink into the puddle that is you and absorbs you into the game. Soon enough you find yourself falling from the sky, landing right next to where you and Carly are, away from anyone else's prying eyes. Carly raises an eyebrow \"What was that?\" She remarks. \"Too fast and short to be rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someone dropped a bunch of water out of a plane?\" Your character, who will be named Antione for simplicity reasons, suggested, as both of them crouched down to investigate you, unaware of power that at the moment even you were unaware of. Of course, since Antione is the game version of you, he knows that it is you, but he is currious about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure this is just going to be a waste of time.\" Carly remarks, prodding you experimentally. As soon as she touches you, you immediately snake up and around her arm, causing her to unceremoniously freak out about what appears to be water snaking up her arm. Due to your position, you only really have two places you could go, either dropping down and soaking through both her dress and her panties in order to hide in her vagina, or put yourself in her mouth.

He spun his chair around, and it hit the desk, causing a game case to fall out of the above rack which had stacks upon stacks of games (some of which were his sisters') on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game case hit the floor and Anthony knelt down to pick it up. It was Dungeon Siege 2: Broken World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yea.\" He smiled lightly. He hadn't played Dungeon Siege in a while, and he still had an unfinished game. Inserting the disk into the drive, the all too familiar menu screen appeared. Clicking on the 'continue' button, the game faded to the loading screen, and before long, his party was standing at the remains of the town of Amanlu, right outside the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony wasnt much of a person for pets in the game, so his party consisted of his main character (male), Eva, Taar, Lothar and Finala. He moved to the inside of the tavern, to check if any worthwhile equipment was available when he suddenly started to feel a little lightheaded. Suddenly, everything blurred around him as the computer screen got brighter and brighter until his whole world was pure white. There was an explosion of colour, and then he found himself in an unfamiliar place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he saw the sign above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was the sign for the Amanlu Tavern. His eyes went wide, or they would have, because he suddenly realized that he didn't have eyes. Or anything. He was a solid mass of blue liquid flat on the ground. He wasn't very big, about the size of an average foot. He didn't know why, but he was able to move. Sliding quietly along the grass and then walls, he moved into the tavern where he noticed his own party browsing an assortment of weapons, armour, shields and spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is werid.\" He thought. Suddenly, Eva grunted loudly in dissapointment and stormed outside. Finala rolled her eyes and looked at Taar, who went out to console Eva over the fact that the shop didn't exactly have what she wanted. Lothar continued to browse the goods, oblivious to what was happening behind him and trying out a broadsword which Anthony really didn't like the look of. Thankfully, Lothar put it back down as if on cue from Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony slid back outside to see what was happening, Eva was sitting on a low wall with Taar beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bp0.blogger.com/_XMMbo_EHbwA/R9mGjpYbDpI/AAAAAAAAC18/4Lr1_yolBao/s1600-h/EvangelineDungeonSiege.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://bp0.blogger.com/_XMMbo_EHbwA/R9mG...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pathetic. We're trying to save the whole world from the Overmage, but we can't do it without proper equipment!\" She said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people have suffered much. Be thankful that they at least still have something to sell.\" Taar said sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Eva said quietly. Anthony didn't know why, but Eva resembled Anthony's frustration at not being able to find the right gear in shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid up to Eva. Taar gave Eva a pat on the shoulder and walked back inside. Eva was by far the most attractive woman in the game, with a ponytail sticking out behind her and a large rack with some shapely hips as well as killer body. She was epic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as to how much more werid this game could get, Anthony wondered if he could get inside Eva. He slid up her leg, but she didn't even seem to notice him. Anthony headed straight for her mouth, right over her chest, yet she still acted as if he didn't exist, well, until he started sliding into her mouth and down her throat, then she spasmed. Suddenly, he blacked out, and when he awoke, he found that he had two arms, two legs, a head, and was lying face up on grass with his legs over a fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, 'his' legs? He brought his legs down and sat up, looking over himself, noticing that, among other things, he had breasts, he found that he had actually POSSESSED Eva!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" He cried out. His voice had changed as well. He stood up, well, 'she' stood up and climbed back over the fence. Taar came back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Eva?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Anthony asked. 'Oh no! Uhh... What do I say?' She thought. \"Uhh yea, just fine!\" She said with a smile. Taar raised an eyebrow but went back inside the tavern. 'That was close'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony, now in control of Eva, sat back down on the fence. 'I wonder if I can get back to the real world.' She thought. Suddenly, everything went bright and white, after the explosion of colour, Anthony found herself back in her own room at the computer. Except, there was a difference. She was still Eva. Not only that, but Eva's portrait in the game was grayed out and when she clicked on it, nothing happened. (Usually it would move the game camera to where they are)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony stood up. She walked around the room, admiring Eva's poise and stunning good looks. But what now? Find out more about Eva, or go back into the game?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anthony sat down on her bed, considering this unexpected situation. She was now officially in possession of one of his favourite characters from Dungeon Siege. Even though she was sure it couldn't get any stranger, she was curious as to see just what was possible. Lying down on her bed and looking up to the ceiling, she thought about what she knew about Eva, her past, what she wanted to do in the future, that sort of backstory infomation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she found her vision fade to a blurry dark blue scene, with what looked like trees around him. Flashes of Eva's life appeared between the trees, they all showed different parts of Eva's life, when she was born, her sword practising, and various other things that looked unfamiliar. Anthony walked up to the image that showed Eva being born and touched it with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Wouldn't it be hilarious if I was watching it happen...\" He murmured. The image suddenly flashed, and there Anthony was, staring down at baby Eva herself in the picture! Anthony stood back and gasped. \"So... This is her mind! Whoa!\" He said. Anthony thought about what he could do to change things for her, to make some... 'improvements'. He walked along the misty path and found some more images, and some other things, including a long piece of parchment attached to a tree which detailed everyone she knew from the game and her thoughts on each person. (Including Taar, Lothar, Finala, etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony thought for a second, a smug smile appearing on his face. He took the pen that was attached beside parchment and added his own name to the bottom. He added a few extra lines of documentation to describe more about him. By the time he was done, Eva would treat Anthony as the most important person in her whole life. She wouldn't care about the fact that she didn't know where she knew him from or how, the most important thing to her would be to serve him in anyway possible. Anthony made it so that she thought the best way to serve him was to be possessed by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony finished writing, and suddenly she found herself lying back on her bed still in Eva's body. She sat up, looking around, still taking in the fact that she was now a young woman in her early twenties. Anthony concentrated a bit more again, and suddenly found her vision black out. He had returned to the blue sticky mass from before and was crawling his way up through Eva's throat and out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe splashed out of her mouth onto her legs and the bed, seperated into two parts, but still feeling as one (But with split vision). He looked around as his larger part, and then up at Eva. Then he looked around as his smaller part, though being difficult, quickly adjusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way...' Anthony thought. Meanwhile Eva had already stood up and was walking around Anthony's room, trying to adjust to a completely different enviroment. She looked around the room, and then back towards the bed where she spied the blue mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Anthony! How good to see you! Please, help me achieve my goals and possess me again! It feels so great to have all this weight of my body completely off of me!\" She said, smiling and showing her perfect white teeth. Anthony sorta smiled (or would have if he still had a face to smile with), and then crawled over to Eva, who took the larger part of him and promptly thrust him down her throat. She gagged a bit but Anthony quickly found that he was back in control of Eva, and now still had split vision with his/her smaller mass part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony thought about what he/she could do as multiple parts and two ideas began to form in his/her heads...</span></div></div>",

She walked into the tavern to find that the group had sat down at a table to wait for some drinks. Anthony pulled up a chair from an empty table, and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eva.

Did you order for me?\" Anthony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ginger Beer like always.\" Taar smiled, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony put her elbows on the table and her hands over her mouth, and while it might have seemed quite normal for the average person, what Anthony was really doing was splitting herself again. A part of her climbed out of her throat and down her arm, where nobody could see him. The mass that formed a part of Anthony slid onto the ground and moved over to the nearby bar where he slid into Taar's mug, forcing the foul smelling liquid out onto the counter while the bartender's back was turned. The bartender turned around with the last mug, placed it on a tray with the rest and headed for Anthony's table, where he promptly gave the cups of drinks to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaar let her's sit for half a minute, making Anthony wonder if she was even going to drink. However, to her relief, Taar picked up her mug and downed her drink in a single go. Anthony took Taar over almost instantly, with the only trace of him doing so was her gagging a small bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaar: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.gamekapocs.hu/media/galeria/jatek/0/118/234/157866_normal_taar2.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gamekapocs.hu/media/galeria/j...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's vision blurred through her 3rd perspective. It refocused and she found herself looking out through Taar's eyes. A lock of green hair blocked her left eye and she pushed it to the side, smiling lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Taar smiled and stood up. Anthony, in control of Taar, walked outside with Eva walking slowly behind. Anthony figured that the best thing to do to get used to controlling multiple bodies was to have a conversation with herself. (Even if that did sound a little weird)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm in control of you?\" Eva asked Taar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea. Weird, isn't it?\" Taar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" Eva said, sitting on a fence. \"To think that I have the body of a really hot woman from an epic game, and now I have the body of another hot girl, you, Taar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but Eva, you sure are the hottest girl around!\" Taar laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva joined in the laughing. \"I wonder who else I should take control of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about someone from real life?\" Taar asked. \"We can always return to the game to get a few more girls, but you might be able to take control of... your twin sister perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia?\" Eva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck yes!\" Taar laughed. They both concentrated for a split second and found themselves back in Anthony's bedroom. Now that Anthony was getting used to controlling three separated parts, (Remember the bit he left on his bed), he/she gave up on talking to himself/herself. After all, why bother when he/she can communicate practically telepathically?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that Taar wanted to try was a few spells. Anthony had always kept Taar's spell book and inventory stocked with spells, even if he didn't need them, he was sure he would find a use for them eventually. She took the 'greater icebolt' spell and used it, sending a small, fast ball of ice pounding into his/her bedroom wall. The bolt connected with the wall, freezing against the wall almost instantly and causing a slight inward depression layered with cracks. Another spell caused the ice to dissappear, and the wall fixed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way cool.\" Taar laughed. Taar and Eva headed downstairs, to find Mia playing some unfamiliar game on your Playstation 3. They both leaned against the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mia, you busy for a second?\" Eva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfamiliar with the voice, Mia paused the game and turned around on the couch, only to drop the controller in shock. Here were two girls from a game that she easily recognized. She didn't know what to say, and it was quite fortunate that she didn't faint...</span></div></div>",

As Eva, you pick up the bit of yourself that was outside your girls-the bit that you left on your bed- which had migrated from its previous location to the living room, and hold it close to the PS3. Then, you feel a familiar pulling sensation, and your goo disappears into the game.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your goo enters the game, you are quite pleased to find yourself in the world of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You rush downstairs, and nearly fall, but you end up being caught by your sister, Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright Anthony?\u201d Your sister asks, worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You say as you stand back up. \"But why are you home? Weren't you swimming at a friend's house?\" You ask your sister, who has her swim suit on, but you now notice that she seems to be paler than usual, and her nose seems to be rather runny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta-\u201c suddenly Anna breathes in heavily and lets out a loud \u201cACHOO!\u201d You run over to the kitchen, and grab a paper towel for her to wipe her nose. You have always been a nice brother to her, unlike how you act towards Sarah, and with good reason, she despised you and all of your friends, and you disliked her for a better word. \u201cThank you Anthony.\u201d Anna replies as you hand her the makeshift tissue. She blows her nose. \"I left early because I started getting sick.\" Then you walk with her to the kitchen to fetch her water, however, you accidently slip your finger into the water but figure that the water will still be okay to drink. Unknown to you, a small liquid is now in the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go sis.\u201d You say as you hand her the glass, which she downs in mere seconds. She smiles and blows her nose once more. You then head to Brianna's house, barely noticing that the urge has lessened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took so long?\" Brianna asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna's sick, so I helped her out before leaving.\" You reply, to which she nods in understanding. The two of you begin to play video games for a couple hours, but you soon have to go home. Before you leave though, you get the urge again, and feel like you have to vomit. You head to the toilet and begin to do just that. You flush, wash your mouth out, stumble out of the bathroom, unaware that what you had vomited up had stuck to the side of the toilet, and is beginning to take form. You apologize and head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, about half way from Brianna's house and your own, you hear faint, yet clearly close footsteps as they approach you, you look up and behind you to see that you are staring in the face of Sarah, who is in what must be one of her sluttiest outfits of all. During all of this, you feel the urge lessen slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here Anthony? I thought you were just going to stay home and play your stupid video games.\u201d Your witch of a sister sneers at you with evil eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were any other person, and weren\u2019t related to her, then you\u2019d probably kick her butt, but unluckily you are so all you say is \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d and then continue walking home, but Sarah jumps in your way and continues belittling you. You eventually have enough, and as the urge comes back, you spit at her, to which she jumps back. You head on home again, not noticing that the \"spit\" has begun moving towards Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it home to find all quiet, and that Anna is passed out on the couch. You decide that since you\u2019re so nice, that you\u2019ll carry her upstairs and bring her to her room. You are surprised, as oddly enough, she is relatively easy to pick up, and I mean she was like picking up a small dog, rather than a full hundred pound human being. You make it up to stairs, when you feel the urge lessen slightly again. You continue to walk towards Anna's room, then gently lay her down, and cover her up. You then get a chance to notice Anna\u2019s face, and find that she no longer looks as pale as she did before, and it even looks as if she is getting better. Looks like that water you gave her actually did the trick, or that\u2019s what you think anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the urge hits you as you go to your room and begin playing a certain game, trying to ignore it. You are so intent on ignoring it that you don\u2019t even notice that your body is beginning to transform until your whole lower torso is transformed into some strange bluish liquid. You can\u2019t believe what is happening to you, and yet, here it is, right behind you in broad dimly lit daylight. You fall, and feel something else fall with you, the thing that fell is your Nintendo DS system. You begin to descend into the game. You feel as if you are being pulled in against your will, and yet, there is nothing you can do. You reach out your right hand, which is almost completely liquid like the rest of your body, and beg for someone to help, yet no one does as you black out into digital darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken later, but realize that you feel completely different, you are now female, and the urge is gone. You can't believe what has happened, and yet, still you wish that it is a dream. You pinch yourself, and that is the first time you hear your new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! That really hurts.\" You say as you stop pinching yourself and rub he spot. You sigh and then examine your new body. You find that you are wearing a small blue bra that is covered up by a spaghetti string pink shirt. You are also wearing a blue skirt, and also pink sandals. You sigh once more, and get up, but quickly stumble forward, as you are unaccustomed to the new weight on your chest. You apparently also have about b-sized breasts. You stand back up, and steady yourself, as you carefully begin to get used to this body, though it is rather slow progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely manage to walk a few steps without falling, or stumbling, but you eventually get it and then proceed to actually take a look at your surroundings. You are standing before a large building, which seems to be like a bank, or maybe a museum. It didn't really matter as you notice that the sky is ablaze red and seems to have a weird portal opened up in the center of it. \"What's happening here?\" You asked yourself, only to run into someone, a girl.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Watch it will you!\" A young sounding female voice cries as both of you fall on your backs. You groan as you look at the girl before you who you might have injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I wasn't watching where I was going. My bad.\" You say as you help the girl up. The girl dusts herself off and then you finally manage to get a good look at her. She has long purple hair, and light blue eyes that go rather well with her pink glasses, she is rather cute, or at least, that's what you think. You then examine what she is outfitted in, and it seems to be large pink dress, with a small white blow that she is wearing underneath the dress as it opens up towards the bottom. You also note that she is wearing black stockings and pink high heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you maybe help me with something? I wanted to help out a friend of mine, and with your help we could most likely do it.\" She says. You want to question her, but figure you should just follow her lead for now. She looks around quickly, and then pulls out something from her pocket, a small device about the size of your DS from back home, though this is pink and yours is a different color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" You ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...\" Suddenly, three black bolts of lightning explode behind her, and then out of the cloud appears several strange individuals, one looks like that of a snake, though it has several heads, all of which are attached to only one body. Another of the creatures is like that of an elephant, though it is garbed in armor, and is wielding a curved sword, possibly a cutlass, from what you can tell. The other demons seem to be different from the first two, but they seem to be going elsewhere, and you don't really get a good look. \"Even better, I get to show you-\" Before the girl can do anything, you charge in front of her and rush at the demons. You punch the closest one, which is the elephant demon, in the face, only for it to simply bat you off like a gnat, and then it stabs you in the chest, before flinging you through a nearby store, which had definitely seen better days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the girl yells out and asks if you are alright, but she can't get a reply, as it is blocked out by the elephant monster's roar, and then snake monster's movements. She begins to fight the snake monster using her pink DS-like device to summon up two monsters of her own that look like cat swordsmen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, you have finally come to a crashing stop as you smack against the wall. You are pain, but then feel it go away rather quickly, though you have no idea why. You don't even notice that the stab wound on your chest is gone, and that all that is left is the ripped clothing and some bare skin. You look around and find that this place is actually a weapon store, though most of the weapons are either destroyed, or too damaged to use. You dig through some rubble to find that of an old ancient katana that is completely unscarred, and looks well maintained. You smile, as you can finally fight back against these abominations to nature. You pick up the sword, and quickly duck, as the elephant monster has found you. This time you are ready. You stand back up and unsheathe the blade, then take a defensive stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish to fight me mortal!?\" The elephant monster asks, then chuckles \"So be it!\" The monster charges at you, but thanks to your training with swords in the past, as well as your knowledge of the topic, you realize that if you can get this guy in a small bit closer that you can quickly chop him and finish him off. You allow the monster to move closer to you, and then, thanks to your slick and light weight body, you easily dodge the attack, and quickly slice the monster's head off as his blood gushes out like an explosion. You end up getting your clothes kind of dirty, as are blood splotches all over you and your blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk outside of the store to find your new friend and then she runs up to you and hug you, glad that you are alright. You smile and say rather toughly while sheathing your katana \"That monster was no match for me!\" Your friend smiles and then laughs happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's a good thing that I chose you as my friend then.\" She chuckles. \"Oh, by the way, I never told you my name. It's Midori, Midori Komaki.\" She curtsies before you, and you do the same. While doing this, you try to figure out how to greet her, since you can\u2019t give her your real name, and you don\u2019t know whose body you are in, when suddenly the name comes to you, along with many of your host\u2019s memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Midori. My name is Yuzu Tanikawa.\" You say, to which Midori nods. \"So what is it you wanted me to do again?\" You ask as you begin to walk with Midori through the ruble of the city? Midori crosses her arms, and then makes a pouting face, which you find even cute than what she normally looks like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidori begins to speak, though this time, in a more serious tone \"Yuzu... could you fight a friend who has saved your life, and then chose to do something you don't approve of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Midori? Like what, drugs or something? If not there's always-\" You begin, but Midori gives you a glare that scares you to the core. \"Sorry, I thought what you meant was something kinda minor, or at least easy to handle.\" You apologize. Midori sighs and exhales slowly like that of a cocky smoking anime character, though Midori isn't cocky at all, in fact, it seems like she is actually...scared. You can't explain, or even know how or why you know, but she is scared of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuzu do you remember those monsters we faced a little bit ago?\" She asks in a low tone. You nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do, why?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Midori slowly exhales once more, then continues to speak in a serious tone \"\u2026a friend of mine wants to get rid of those monsters-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great Midori!\" Midori continues talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My 'friend' is going to become an overlord, and control all of them, but to do it...\" Midori pauses, and then turns towards you with a fear filled look on her face. \"He has to cast away his humanity!\" Midori seems even more scared now, and you don't know why, but you do as well. It is as if every fiber of your being tells you that this is bad, really, really bad. You take a small breath, and then look at Midori, who is now crying. You hug her softly, and allow her to continue to cry for a few minutes, until she stops crying, and you ask her if she is feeling better now, to which she nodded and speaks once more. \"I'm alright, but those jerks Naoya and Kaito are going to turn my friend into a monster, and I can't do anything to stop them!\" You look Midori in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to let anyone turn anyone turn into a monster, especially if it's a friend of yours, Midori.\" You say happily, which causes Midori to hug you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you Yuzu!\" Midori repeats, over and over again. You smile as she continues to hug you, but then tell her to let go of you, as you were starting to have trouble breathing. Midori lets go of you, and apologizes, before you say it\u2019s alright and then begin to...</span></div></div>",

You nodded and gave her an odd look as she seemed to be posing like a would-be super hero. You shrug and then ask her \"where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidori makes a angered face as if she was mad at someone and you apologize since you figured you did or said something wrong but she said \"No it's not what you said it's just that...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Midori? Isn't there anyone that can help us\" just as you say this someone suddenly stumbles across. The girl appeared hurt and a clear gash was slashed across her upper face. She seemed to be bleeding rather badly as you and Midori run up to her. \"Are you alright\" you asked rather stupidly as she clearly wasn't. She was about to answer but she fainted from most likely blood lose. Midori begins to panic but you stay calm though be it for some strange reason, as it seemed that strange urge from before had oddly returned. You couldn't explain it but it seemed like the urge wanted you to spit into the open wound. You thought it was strange but there wasn't anything else you could do but watch her die. You gulped and just then you spat into the open wound as your saliva blended into the girl's blood but what was actually happening was your 'saliva' was actually making its way into the girl's body. It first went to work by making its way to the girl\u2019s brain, and then it enveloped it and began to regenerate the damaged parts of brain. After this the wounds on the girl quickly healed up to your astonishment. The girl\u2019s eyes began to twitch and then they slowly opened as she let out a groan of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa she\u2019s still alive\u201d Midori said in amazement but quickly stopped being star struck and then helped bandage the girl up. As you touch the girl you feel something go back into you like a piece of yourself had returned but you didn\u2019t notice much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what happened\u201d groaned the girl as she began to fully awaken? You smile knowing that she would be alright and then carefully help her stand up. She seemed to be rather confused as to where she was and also kept muttering to herself saying things like \u201cRemiel? Remiel where are you?\u201d As you hadn\u2019t the slightest of what she was talking to or about you simply gave her a strange look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay\u201d Midori finally asked the panic stricken girl? The girl snapped back at her as if she had no recollection of what had happened to her for the past several hours or perhaps days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u201d the girl snapped back still panicking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must amnesia, Midori\u201d you deduce and then walk up to the girl and embrace her in your arms. \u201cDon\u2019t worry if you have lost someone we\u2019ll find it and if you are defenseless than I shall protect you!\u201d You whisper into her ear and she calms down significantly because of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d she replies and you let her go \u201cplease tell me\u2026your name.\u201d You smile once more and then tell her that your name was Yuzu. She smiles slightly and nods \u201cI see\u2026 oh sorry where are my manners? My name is Amane, Amane Kuzuryu. So now that we have formalities out of the way\u2026what do you want us to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I figure that since you have amnesia maybe we should try and clear that up first\u201d you reply \u201cdo you remember anyone that could maybe help us out? We\u2019re trying to save someone and defeat these guys named Naoya and Kaito-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait did you say Naoya\u201d Amane snaps back curious of what she heard was correct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but what does Naoya mean to you? Did he do something to you\u201d Midori asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t k-\u201csuddenly Amane grips her head in pain as if something hard hit her. She grasps at her face as if it were going to fall off and then returns to normal a moment later though her face was covered in sweat. \u201cI\u2026I remember him, Naoya\u2026\u201d Amane stutters as if a memory was on the brink of coming back into being. \u201c\u2026he\u2019s the one who hurt me like this\u201d Amane\u2019s words strike you cold as begin to grow angry. You grip your fist in anger and punch a nearby rock and to your amazement it\u2019s reduced to rubble under your strength. You ignore it and walk back over to Amane and Midori who hadn\u2019t noticed what you had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuzu are you alright\u201d Midori asked as she noticed that your hand was bleeding slightly. You notice and then tell her that you were fine but she shakes her head and says \u201cNo it\u2019s hurt so we should bandage it up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Amane speaks up somewhat shyly and you two turn towards her \u201c\u2026oh well I can heal it for you with my magic.\u201d You shrug and tell her to give it a shot which she does though as she gets closer to you, you noticed that your wounds were already healing themselves anyway though you kept your cool and allowed Amane to heal your wound. She takes your hand and calmly exhales as if nervous then slowly mutters a world so low that you barely understood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDia\u2026\u201d Amane said under breath and a small pink light shined around both your and Amane\u2019s hands then it faded mere seconds later. Amane removed her hand and then noticed that your hand was completely healed now and smiled slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job Amane\u201d Midori cheered and hugged her which Amane blushed at due to the surprise hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026thank you Midori\u201d Amane replies and Midori lets go of her \u201cI guess that even without Remiel I can still be of use\u201d Amane frowns slightly as if saddened, possibly due to the loss of Remiel. You walk up to her and gently kiss her on the forehead while embracing her in another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever doubt yourself Amane\u201d you whisper into her ear thought this time Midori was able to hear. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about anything. I\u2019ll protect you from Naoya if need be\u201d you say and Amane smiles as if new hope was flowing into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Yuzu\u2026you\u2019re a true friend\u201d Amane says as a smile grows on her face. You let Amane go and then asked Midori where to go next. She passes by a few times before you and then an idea comes to mind of where to go next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s this strange place where my friend once told me that some special forces were at maybe we should try going over there\u201d Midori replies and you pull out your katana and slice it through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go than\u201d you say and then fall behind Midori as you stay close by to Amane keeping your word.</span></div></div>",

Several rounds of machine gun are heared as they are fired, all aimed directly for Midori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidori\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuzu but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you say or do but I won\u2019t allow anything to happen to my friends so-\u201cas the smoke clears from the surrounding area it turns out that you had somehow ended up in front of Midori which put you in the line of fire instead, as shown by the several bullet holes in your back, arms, and legs. You collapse to the ground before Midori and Amane rushes towards you but suddenly she gets shot in the head and ends up collapsing, most likely dead or soon to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmane\u201d Midori shouts and then suddenly the sounds of footsteps are heard heading towards her and her downed companions. Out of the shadows walks a woman with bright orange hair and eyes who was wearing a SDF officer uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but no one can escape here alive\u201d she replies back and then notices your body and gasps in horror as if she had done something terrible which in fact she did though it was all for her mission. \u201cIt\u2019s that girl from before who was with that boy with the head phones. Dam it! I don\u2019t want that bastard in green going near me\u201d she said punching a nearby wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026maybe you should come with us\u201d you say as you manage to stand back up to both Midori and the woman\u2019s shock. Suddenly the sounds of small metallic objects dropping on the ground come from you as bullets fall out of your chest before your wounds quickly heal up much to everyone\u2019s shock. \u201cI mean what\u2019s there to lose right? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a worse place to be besides by yourself with monsters running all over the place\u201d you smile and then stand up. You wipe the blood from your face as a small blood trail was running down the edge of your face and down towards you chin. You reach out a hand to the woman but she stands there spell bound. She looks at you then at your hand then does a double take before speaking in a stutter tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what are you\u201d she stutters as if afraid though she\u2019s trying to hide her fear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look yourself over and besides finding everything normal except for the bullet holes in clothing on your back. You smile figuring that you were one lucky guy/girl but something told you that this wasn\u2019t just luck. You shrug it off like it was a minor scratch and then reply to the woman.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2026I am just a normal human girl\u201d your reply scares the woman even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t normal!

You turn aroudn to see the woman from before with her gun slung over her back as she was running towards you. She managed to make it half way towards you but tripped and fell. You, being such a nice guy, walked over to her and help her up. \"Thank you\" she says in a strange apologetic tone \"I'm sorry about before\u201d she apologizes. You service to say didn't trust her but when Midori and Amane walked over you figured to allow them to decide if she should be trusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided to join our team\" Midori asked and the woman nodded \"Well than...\" Midori smiles and then shoots her hand up into the air \"...you are now a part of team Yuzu!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Yuzu\" the woman questioned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Yuzu\" you repeat in the same matter of asking tone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Team Yuzu! I figured that since you're the one that helped me out along with saving Amane here that we'd name the team after you. Since it was a unanimous vote than we're going by the name of team Yuzu\" Midori declares with Amane chuckling in the background. You shrug and smile then the woman behind you speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Misaki Izuna, Lieutenant of special forces posted in the Tokyo Lockdown! My mission was originally to contain the lock down with my superior Fujin but things changed when that guy in green and his friends talked to Commander Fujin. They told him that if we didn\u2019t raise the final options\u2019 time than they would kill us and what could we do? He had the power of a god on his side or something. I don\u2019t know what he said exactly but I knew for one thing is that he could summon demons and control them\u201d the woman said informatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what\u2019s this about a final option\u201d you asked confused? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe final option is what we are being forced to use since the demons and their tamers are so wide-spread that we can\u2019t contain them anymore so we have to\u2026\u201d she pauses and takes a breath \u201c\u2026we have to use a neutron bomb to annihilate the whole lockdown before anyone can get out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidori and Amane gasp in shock and it takes you a second to realize why. You remember from school that a neutron bomb has the power to level a whole entire city while causing minimal property damage. You feel your blood boil as you realize this and punch the ground in anger, as you bring your fist back you look back at Izuna and then ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long till the bomb goes off\u201d you asked in an anger stricken tone? Izuna is hesitant to answer but you asked once more and this time you scream it at her \u201chow long till we get bombed! Tell me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe only have about five hours till it\u2019s set to go off and even then I\u2019m not so sure if they\u2019re right\u201d Izuna replies sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u201d you asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe angels\u201d Amane replies for Izuna as if a part of her memory had returned \u201cRemiel was one of them before Naoya destroyed him!\u201d Amane seems saddened by her own words and you notice that and quickly walk up to her and comfort her the best as you can and tell her not to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I won\u2019t allow that to happen\u201d you declare \u201cI won\u2019t allow my new friends to be killed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what are you going to do? You\u2019re not going to challenge him are you\u201d Izuna asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t than hell will come to earth so\u2026yeah\u201d You pull your sword out and then asked Amane if she remembered where to find Naoya? Amane thought hard but could exactly remember anything except for someplace called the Hill\u2019s building. You nod and hen rush off towards the building only to be stopped by Midori who had a question that she was itching to ask you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Midori? We don\u2019t have time for idle chitchat\u201d you yell at her, worried about how much time you had left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuzu\u2026\u201d Midori begins and you calm down a bit and apologize for yelling at her. \u201cYuzu\u2026how did you survive getting shot so much in the back? And why did Amane survice after getting shot in the head? Why do you seem like one of those demons we\u2019ve been trying to get rid of and why do you seem so\u2026so\u2026 distant\u201d Midori franticly asks and you frown sadly of what you were about to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to know why I\u2019m not human, huh? Or why I survived getting shot in the back so many times? I survived because I no longer can die? I received this gift or curse or whatever it is before I suddenly woke up here. I didn\u2019t want to tell you because I didn\u2019t want to believe it myself! The reason Amane didn\u2019t die from that head shot was because I somehow inserted a part of myself into her. I only did it because I was worried about her and I couldn\u2019t stand to see her get hurt! There does that answer your question\u201d you yelled! After this you continued towards the Hill\u2019s building as somehow you remembered where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived you found the place deserted as if the area had been wiped clean but in a mere minute later the air around you became foul and stank of rotting corpses and garbage.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm it seems another morsel has entered my realm\u201d cackled a malus and despicable voice. Suddenly you could feel the air as if suddenly began to transform into that of poison. You coughed extremely and if it wasn\u2019t for this power of yours you\u2019d probably be dead by now.  \u201cOh I see that not all mortals are as weak as those from ages past. Oh well I guess I\u2019ll plant my eggs inside of you and spawn my children.\u201d A large black shaded figure appeared before you as you looked up. The poisonous fog moved away from the being as if repulsed by the figures appearance and soon you knew why. The being was that of a large monstrous fly creature whose staff was made out of human bones and to top it all off he reeked like that of blood drenched corpses who\u2019ve been left to rot in a burning trash heap! Dam he smelled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus you smell\u201d you gasped for breath. The demon cackled blissfully as he \u2018smelled\u2019 the air. He then smiled from what you could tell and replied<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you mortal I am pleased that you find me so repulsive\u201d the demon said happily \u201cI am the right hand of darkness, Beelzebub!\u201d You could\u2019ve sworn that when the demon said his name he curtsied though he wasn\u2019t wearing any type of human garb at least you couldn\u2019t see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah well you\u2019re about to become the next jerk to die by my blade\u201d you spoke with an intent as if you were the devil himself.<br>\r\n\u201cHa I like you mortal and so I shall make sure to devour you whole, bones in all. You should be honored\u201d Beelzebub said as he got into a battle stance with one of his hands on his staff and the other three forming what seemed to be hand signs. He waved one of his arms to signal you to attack him and you happily did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRage chant\u2026\u201d Beelzebub chanted and suddenly you could feel yourself suddenly be taken over but quickly fought back via using you gift. Beelzebub was stunned for a moment as his attack left him open and you quickly sliced off one of his arms and half of his left wing, cutting the skull and crossbones in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere a little something that I recently thought up\u2026 Agidyne\u201d you shout and suddenly Beelzebub was lit ablaze as he screams/ screeches in pain before suddenly she shoots his staff up into the air and chants another spell this time something called \u2018Dead Rain\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sky above you transformed into that of storm clouds and soon out of them black rain began to fall and when it touched your skin it burned. You shout out in pain and quickly retreat towards the building to find cover but Beelzebub blocks you off and smacks you across the face with his remaining left arm whose claws were razor sharp that torn into your face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Through your massive blood lose your body still clings to life thanks to your power as your wounds begin to heal up. You blink a few times and are amazed that you are still alive and feel your face to find that new skin has grown over the previously scratch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m still alive\u201d you questioned as Beelzebub laughed thinking that you had died. \u201cThat attack should\u2019ve killed me but-\u201d you pause and examine your body. All the spots where the black colored rain had touch were quickly healed to your astonishment. Then something clicked in your brain, something primal, as if this new power was simple instinct now. You smiled as if a madman and then picked up your blade that had also slid with you when you where cut. Beelzebub was unaware as he still was laughing victorious and then suddenly you stood up and shouted at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeelzebub\u2026\u201d the demon turned towards you as if he had heard a ghost but rather than being afraid he was angered that you still were of the flesh rather than of the bone as he put it.<br>\r\n\u201cI was sure that my attack was deadly enough to kill you but even if you survived the scratch you should\u2019ve been killed by the poison in the air. How is it that you, a mortal like you are still alive even though you\u2019ve suffered such indescribable damage\u201d Beelzebub yelled angrily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple insect\u2026\u201d You raise your blade though instead of being pointed at Beelzebub it was pointed at your stomach. You bring the sword down and stab yourself through your chest cavity piercing your heart as well as left lung. You stand there, blood seeped out of you and yet you still stood as if nothing had happened. Beelzebub was amazed that such a power as yours existed! He watched as your wounds from before were healed as if they were never there. Beelzebub was quick to realize he was facing something far beyond that of a mere mortal female. In fact he believed that you were a being of as might caliber as his holiness Lucifer, who he himself was on par with the mighty YHWN. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed your katana from your chest and then quickly ran up to Beelzebub. With a mighty slash you slice one of Beelzebub\u2019s right arms clean off making him now having an even number of arms on each side. Next then you do is make him loose a eye as you gouge out one the huge red eye on his head before you and rip it out and toss it to the ground. Beelzebub screamed in agony then tries to chant another spell, possibly one that would heal his injuries but the pain was far too much for the right hand of darkness to bear. You quickly take advantage of this opening and hack off his head, killing the Right hand of Darkness once and for all. Blood gushes out of the now headless corpse, burning your skin with its touch but you don\u2019t move or even flinch. You stand there as the blood drenches you, burning your clothing and skin. It only takes a moment for your skin to regenerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a breath of clean air as you watch the old poisonous verity takes its leave, just as its master had. You stand there motionless as for a few minutes before you notice movement a few feet away. You quickly ready your sword and get ready for another fight. However when you see who it was that was coming towards you stop and lower your guard. In fact you were on the verge of tears as she stops in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuzu*gasp* I finally*pant* caught up to you\u201d Midori exclaims gasping for breath. You don\u2019t move as you notice two other people approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmane and Izuna as well\u201d you whisper as the two approach you. Amane quickly runs past Midori and embraces you in a sorrowful hug. You look at Amane to see her eyes filled with tears as she cries headfirst into your chest. \u201cAmane\u2026\u201d you begin but she cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Why did you run away?\u201d Amane yell at you still with tear filled eyes. \u201cWhy? Why? Did you think we\u2019d hate you because you\u2019re not human? Did you?\u201d Amane asks hitting you in a fit of emotional distress. You sigh and hug Amane lovingly and then speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry Amane\u201d you begin \u201cI just thought you\u2019d hate me, just like you hate the demons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not true Yuzu-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually my real name\u2019s Anthony\u201d you explain and back away from Amane. \u201cYou see this body isn\u2019t actually my own. I\u2019m just borrowing it.\u201d You begin to gather what seems like saliva in your mouth but is actually a liquid version of you or rather part of you. You let part of it fall to your hand and form into a small piece of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026? What is that\u201d Izuna asks you slightly panicked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see this is what I used to control this body, as well as what I used to heal Amane. However because of that piece inside of her I can assume absolute control of her at will. The \u2018candy\u2019 turns back to liquid form and returns to you via your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Midori exclaims in a bit of star struck amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnreal\u2026\u201d Izuna comments returning to her normal calm mindset as she removes her hand from her gun and places it back into its holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuz- I mean Anthony\u2026\u201d Amane says stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow do you see why I ran away? No one wants to love a monster like me\u201d you reply but suddenly Midori and Amane hug you. You blush slightly and Midori speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re some sort of monster. We still like you! We like you just the way you are. Who cares if that isn\u2019t your body? Even if you change bodies! We\u2019ll stand by you always.\u201d You smiled at Midori\u2019s words and lovingly kiss her on her forehead then you do the same for Amane. Midori chuckles \u201cYay! Team Yuzu\u2026er I mean Team Anthony is back together again\u201d Midori cheers and you give chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway I\u2019m tired can we go home now\u201d you ask them as if you didn\u2019t already have the ability to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what about the dead line!\u201d Izuna replies in a panicked tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh don\u2019t worry about it-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-don\u2019t worry about it! We\u2019re all going to die if we don\u2019t-\u201cyou interrupt Izuna and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust down one of these and we\u2019ll be safe\u201d you say tossing Izuna a piece of candy that was similar to the one from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d Izuna says hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine\u201d Midori explains as you hand her another piece of candy. \u201cAfter all what\u2019s a team without trust?\u201d Izuna still hesitates so with a move of your hand the piece of candy transforms into liquid and shoots its way down Izuna\u2019s throat, much to her surprise. You feel it take root in her stomach but instead of taking control of her you allow her to remain in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere now we can go\u201d you begin and suddenly you transform into liquid and reappear outside in your room. The three look around in wonder as they adjust to their new surroundings. Izuna nearly passes out but you quickly help her stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t expect something so\u2026normal\u201d Izuna says exhausted. You lead her to your bed and she sits down. \u201cThank you Anthony\u201d Izuna says. You quickly run down stairs and then return with a glass of water and hand it to Izuna. \u201cHeh well thanks again\u201d Izuna says giving you a small chuckle and then downs the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t blame you if you all feel tired. After all you\u2019ve been threw a lot\u201d you say taking a seat besides Izuna. Midori lets off a yawn and though she tries to hide it so does Amane. \u201cIt seems you are all tired. I\u2019ll give you guys my room. I\u2019ll just sleep downstairs\u201d you say walking out into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no we can\u2019t\u201d Midori replies grabbing you by the arm \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could let you sleep on the couch, even if we\u2019re your guests.\u201d You sigh tiredly as you walk back inside. You lean against the wall but before you can speak you pass. Midori looks at you and gives a sigh of relief then sits down besides you. Amane does the same and lays down so that her head is on your legs.</span></div></div>",

Now instead of saying something (and me being lazyXD) I shall use wikipedia to fill in her bio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: A popular internet cosplay idol who calls herself \"Dolly.\" She was in Tokyo for an event and couldn't get out due to the barricades. Eventually, she acquires a COMP and takes it upon herself to \"rescue the innocent\" out of a sense of justice. Her father constantly taught her to protect people and defend her beliefs, even if no one else does; as such, she constantly risks her life hunting demons, protecting people who misunderstand her due to the fact that she summons demons to protect them. She would've met a untimely death, if it wasn't for the Hero and his party stepping in to save her from a mob of humans marking her as a witch. Realizing the error of her ways, she joins with the party to see what real justice is. Refers to herself as \"Magical Dolly\" and speaks and behaves in a very mah\u014d sh\u014djo manner. (pretty much in a nutshell she is a good guy, does good things. Can be missunderstanding sometimes, and is fun to play with in the game).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and here is a picture of Midori...<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img201.imageshack.us/i/midori400no9.jpg/\" target=\"_blank\">http://img201.imageshack.us/i/midori400n...</a></span></div></div>",

But that doesn't so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atsuro, be quiet!\" Keisuke snaps back and grabs your hand then quickly makes his way around the corner with you following. You follow Keisuke for some time, until you finally stop at a park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keisuke what's up? Why did you bring me to the park?\" You asks with a whine in your new voice to make things more believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midori, why were you being so careless? You were attacked while your guard was down, and you're lucky to be alive!\" Keisuke yells at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sheesh, I think I'm now officially deaf.\" You groan, covering your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are you talking like that?!\" Keisuke asks while still yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah it's just...uh...Hey look over there it's Belder!\" You shout. Keisuke looks over to see nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midori, why are you stalling?\" Keisuke asks as he looks back to find you are long gone with a cloud of dust left behind. \"Ah darn it! Where did she go?!\" Keisuke yells out in anger as he tries to find you but finds that you are nowhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop to catch your breath and duck into a nearby alley as you hear Keisuke run by you so fast you can't believe your now female eyes. \"Ah thank god.\" You breathe a sigh of relief, then sink to your knees and sit on the ground. You then begin to realize what the heck just happened and scream in your head so that you aren't found. 'Oh my god! How the heck am I a girl? Why am I in a girl's body? Oh my god!\" You start to freak out and begin to cry the usual anime style tears, but quickly snap back to normal... well, as normal as you being in Midori's body as can be that is. \"Hey it isn't so bad, I'm in one of my favorite video games, though I figured if I'd of become anyone, I would have become my game self, but I'll figure out how to become normal later.\" You laugh and stand back up. \"Now, time to figure out how and why I was brought here.\" You say with a laughing cheer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

At the park you stop to see some people dressed in strange orange outfits, along with a woman whose face you can see, who you find very familiar. You walk towards them and smile a casual smile as you approach the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello there!\" You say to the woman. The woman, who now that you get a better look at her, appears to be around the age of a teenager looks over to you and introduces herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Amane Kuzuryu and you are?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my name is...\" You begin. 'Crap can't tell her who I am, but wait!' \"...oh my name is Midori, Midori Komaki!\" You reply with a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see, nice to meet you.\" Amane replies, and then she begins to walk towards the other orange clothed members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Hold on! Can I show you something first?\" You ask. Amane turns around and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I guess so.\" She replies. Amane follows you to an area of the park where no one else is around, and hopefully, not watching. \"So what is it that you wanted to show me?\" Amane asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanted to...\" Suddenly you fall back, and pretend to be pain, causing Amane to be surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on I'll help you!\" Amane says in a small, almost panic tone. Amane places her hands over you as her hands begin to glow, but then you separate a part of yourself and shoot it out of your mouth; it hits home as the piece of you makes its way into Amane's mouth as she tries to cough it up, but to no success. Finally, Amane is silenced as the piece of you finally gets all of the way in her and Amane collapses to the ground, unconscious as you take control. A short amount of time passes, and you/Midori sit back, waiting for her to wake up. She eventually does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey, wakey, sleepy head!\"  You/Midori says as she helps you/Amane up to her feet. \"Good to see you're up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I feel soooooo much better!\" You/Amane says with a girlish giggle. Both of your bodies are still feeling tired, so you go and find a safe place to rest, and when you find it, you lie down and start to go to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nighty night Amane...\" You/Midori says to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Midori...\" You/Amane replies as the two of you fall asleep and begin to dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

You/Amane pat her on the head and then walk a bit away from your other body when you notice some people approaching you. You freeze in place as a panic starts to occur in your mind as the people approaching you are Hero, Yuzu, and Atsuro. You begin to whistle to make it seem like you are the normal Amane as the three finally make their way to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Amane how are you doing?\" Yuzu asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh fine.\" You hesitate which makes Yuzu give you an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling alright Amane?\" She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, fine.\" You quickly reply and take a step backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amane, didn't you want us to defeat that demon of Bel inside of your mind?\" Atsuro asks which makes you sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah.\" You say with an odd smile. 'Crud I don't even know how the heck to do that!' You think to yourself, but then you begin learn how to as you search Amane's mind for the information. \"Alright so...uh let's begin!\" You say as you raise your hands into the air, then you mutter some strange words and suddenly, you/Amane, Hero, Atsuro, and Yuzu are transported inside your/Amane's mind to find it oddly different from when you went there while playing the game normally. Inside Amane's mind, you find the place like that of... well, a video game store (on account of you possessing Amane).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I didn't know you liked video games, Amane.\" Yuzu says surprised with Hero's and Atsuro's eyes shining with delight as they smile in pure joy, and you are likewise happy. The two of them quickly run up to the walls to see multiple titles lining the walls, ranging in various consoles like PlayStation to X-box to Wii to handled games. Atsuro picks up a copy of a video game and quickly reads the title aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survi...\" He begins before you cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atsuro no!\" You shout, then you run up to him and snatch the game out of his hand before he has the chance to read the rest of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amane! What did you do that for?!\" Atsuro asks with a bit of a wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry, but this game is very...uh special to me so please understand.\" You say as Yuzu gives you a strange look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I understand, but I just wanted to look at it.\" Atsuro tries to take the game back but you refuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atsuro! Leave Amane alone!\" Yuzu yells at Atsuro, but he still tries to get the game from you. Hero grabs his arm to try to stop him, but Atsuro gets out of his grasp and go after it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Atsuro!\" You scream, and then you punch him clear in the face and send him flying back into a rack of games.  Yuzu runs over to him and helps him up as you begin to apologize. Yuzu finds that Atsuro now has a bloody nose. \"Oh no! Atsuro I'm so sorry.\" You apologize. \"Please forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Atsuro begins laughing. \"You must really love that game, Amane.\" Yuzu quickly gives him a punch on the head, and he replies with \"Why did yah do that for Yoowhoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you just got punched half across the room, pissed of Amane when she told you no, and now you're laughing about it! Atsuro you make me so mad sometimes!\" Yuzu shouts back angrily.  Suddenly you begin to hear a rumbling in your ear and push Atsuro out of the way as a tank like creature bursts from the wall and smashes into you before it and you collide with the wall to Yuzu and Atsuro's shock. \"Amane!\" Yuzu and Atsuro cry as they try and run towards you, only for the tank to aim its gun at them and charge a shot. Hero grabs the two and pushes them aside making him be the target instead as the beam of energy fires at him sending him into a rack full of games which then fall on him. \"Anthony\" Yuzu cries as she runs over to his aid to find him unconscious, but alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human! Humans must be destroyed!\" The tank roars as it suddenly transforms into a monstrous beast. As it transforms, you/Amane are shown to reveal you are alive though unconscious, with some of yourself leaving her body through her mouth; leaving Yuzu as the only one awake and able to fight, much to her dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap I'm the only one left to fight!\" Yuzu says in a scared tone. \"Anthony, Atsuro...\" Yuzu looks to see her friends are unconscious, making her even more scared. \"Amane...\" She looks again to see you/Amane still unconscious. \"Please, I need your help! Anybody? Somebody, help me!\" Yuzu begins to cry as the beast approaches her and readies its claws to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" A voice shouts from another part of the room. \"I won't allow this!\" The monster looks around the room to see no one but then suddenly gets shot in the back of the head by a bullet. The monster turns around to see your normal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?!\" The monster roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name doesn't really matter as you are going to learn soon enough.\" You say as you walk over to the still unconscious you/Amane and pick her up. You then walk over to Yuzu and tell her \"Keep her safe.\" before turning around and pulling out a sword from a pile of knocked over video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to fight me, is that it boy?\" The monster asks as it flexes it's claws. \"Well then, I hope you made a will!\" You charge at the beast and quickly deliver a drop kick to the monster as it tries to strike at you. The monster falls to the ground and you jump onto the monsters back and stab it right in the head with the blade. It cries out in pain and throws you off and knocks you against the wall, stunning you for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuzu! See that liquid near you?\" You shout, as some of your liquid self is near her. \"You have to swallow some of that and then you can beat that thing!\" Yuzu nods and manages to get some of the liquid into her mouth then swallows hard to the monster's shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No this can't be! I won't allow you to beat me! I forbid it!\" The monster summons up a giant pink glowing ball of energy and levitates into the air! \"Now die!\" it shouts and throws the ball at Yuzu, but before it hits she turns into liquid and dodges it. \"No!\" the monster screams in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, Finally! I can beat you now!\" Yuzu shouts and readies her COMP, as you have given her free will, allowing her to control her own body for the time being. Yuzu summons up a demon know to her as Loki and tells it to destroy the demon before her. The Loki demon shoot out its arm and knocks the monster back as you shoot a part of yourself out at it, and to its disgust, the blue liquid hits home and goes down the throat of the demon as it begins to take control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! It's over!\" Yuzu cries in joy as she collapses to the ground, exhausted, as the world begins to turn black to her. You/Amane wake up and confront the new addition to your team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jezebel, finally you are under control. Now if you would be so kind as to...\" You/Amane begins, knowing full well that you are in control of her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" You/Jezebel as you/she sends everyone, excluding you actual body, which re-enters Amane's body, back to being outside of Amane's mind. You/Amane smile as you/Amane return to outside of Amane's mind. The first thing you see is you/Midori, who has helped the others wake up as Yuzu walks over to you/Amane and hugs you/Amane while whispering something into your/Amane's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know now that you are not Amane. Thank you for letting me have control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" You/Amane reply. \"I shall let you continue to have free w...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just want to be with you.\" Yuzu says softly so no one else hears but you. \"I want to be your servant or slave.\" Yuzu says with no help from the piece of you inside her, surprising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you truly want this?\" You/Amane ask her, still embraced in her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She replies. Tears beginning to fall from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will.\" You say softly, which makes Yuzu smile. You end the hug, and Yuzu wipes the tears from her eyes so the boys don't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Yuzu asks. You/Amane begin to think and decide...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The group chooses to rest and make you/Amane a place to place to sleep since you/Amane are the most tired, then you/Amane to lie down and rest as the rest of the group stand guard, as Hero had noticed some demons moving around the area earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes go by as you/Amane have finally gone to sleep, with you making Midori your main body before you go to sleep.

Atsuro and Hero apologize, and the three walk back over to the main group. Yuzu and you  greet her and show that the other you (you/Amane) is sleeping so they both told her to keep her voice down. \"So are you guys playing babysitter or something?\" Haru asks, trying her best to whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...uh.\" You hesitate as what to tell Haru, but Yuzu gives you a small smile and you exhales a sigh of relief. \"Well, we are currently headed over to Hero's cousin's place so we can talk to him about the lockdown.\" A few more minutes go by but nothing seems to be going on but something seems to be off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst, Midori...\" Yuzu whispers to you. \"Hey are you going to possess Haru as well?\" You think for a moment, but decide maybe not to at the moment, although something seems odd. You look over to Haru to find her smiling, which you find a tad bit creepy. A thought of shock shoots threw your mind as suddenly you see the group begin to pass, out with only you and Yuzu staying awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony what's happening?\" Yuzu asks quietly, with only the two of you and Haru, who begins to laugh maniacally, still being awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru stands up and her eyes begin to turn black and her hair becomes pure white. She raises her hand into the air and her black gloves begin to glow with ancient blood red symbols. \"How unfortunate.\" Haru laughs \"Weak little humans. Trying to survive this ordeal but only two remain.\" You are suddenly shot in the chest by some sort of red energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Yuzu shouts in fear as she goes to check on you, but is backhanded into a wall, knocking her out. You cough heavily as your liquid abilities begin to restore your body, and you see the demon approach you slowly with an evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How foolish you are human, but your suffering will end now!\" The demon's hand glows with a dark twisted power as you finally black out from the pain.

You then find something even strange than that as you notice the room you are in has a strange eye ball like thing in the corner of the room and it seems to be watching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello test subject Alpha.\" A voice that appeared to be coming from the eye like camera thing says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" You yell, somewhat scared for your life. \"Where am I, and why have you brought me here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah such an angry one you are.\" The voice laughs as another voice goes over the eye camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, my little mouse.\" A deep voice says. \"If you want to know where your friends are, well then, take a look!\" Several screens appear before you showing multiple people, including your friends, and even the other you (you/Midori). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What are you doing to them?!\" You scream as you then notice they are hooked up to some strange machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Calm yourself, child! Your friends are quite safe, though there is the thing...\" The voice pauses \"You see your friends are going to become demons, and quite soon as a matter of fact.\" The shock sends you into a blind rage as you grab the bed and smash it into the camera. You have a part of you leave Midori's body, and you make that part the main part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a silver door before you and you decide to open it and escape, with you/Midori behind you. Outside the room, you find the place ravaged with some sort of organic compound on certain parts of the walls. You avoid most of it and then notice something beyond you. You look to see two demons, who appear to be like werewolves, standing guard of a room labeled \"Room 666!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to try and find a weapon of some sort, only to find nothing usable, so you pretty much felt screwed, but then remembered you could turn into liquid and easily slip under the door, which both bodies begin to do, but suddenly, a female demon approaches the two. She looks as if she is about the age of 16, but there is something strange about her. You look at the demon's hair to see it the color blood red, and you notice her eyes are the same color, but then you notice that she is wearing a pink top under what appeared to be a strange mystic dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait it can't be, can it? Yuzu?!\" You question in shock, which makes the female demon turn around to the sound. She fires off a blast of Bufu, which makes you freeze for a moment (you/Midori had already turned to liquid, and hadn't been seen), but you quickly thaw out and both bodies proceed towards the door. You manage to sneak your way in as the demon Yuzu walks in, with you still wondering what is going on as you can still feel a connection with Yuzu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah how I find this so bizarre of master Lucifer.\" Demon-Yuzu says with a sigh as she begins to brush her hair. \"I mean why would he try and turn humans into demon? Demons are much stronger than those pathetic excuses for test subjects.\" You take this time to make your way towards Demon-Yuzu, and manage to possess, her but something is off as you notice inside of her mind that she only seems to be a hollow shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this...?\" You ask yourself. You begin thinking, trying to make sense of everything, as you can now feel control of two Yuzus, one normal, and one a demon with a hollow mind, soon your mind begins to piece together an idea: Maybe Demon-Yuzu is an experiment, a clone! Content with that for the moment, you focus back on controlling Demon-Yuzu's body. Suddenly you hear a voice contacting Demon-Yuzu (The voice is unaware of the fact you are in control of Demon-Yuzu, and received her message instead).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yuzu, I wish to speak with you in the lab. Come quickly, and see our next experiment.' The way the voice says experiment makes you uneasy as you proceed towards the door, with you/Midori still as a liquid following you.</span></div></div>",

You enter to see the room covered in blood. Though dried, it still gives you the creeps as you walk towards a demon with red horns who is wearing a bloodied lab coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah princess Yuzu I've been expecting you.\" The demon says in a raspy voice as if he just had the wind knocked out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day Mitra where is my father?\" You ask the demon, relying on Demon-Yuzu's memories to identify him. The demonic scientist approaches you, his hands covered in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why he is just in the next room with our next test subject.\" He replies as he points to another door at the other side of the room, which you promptly walk towards, but he stops you a second later getting blood on your dress, which infuriates you. \"Sorry princess, but I just wanted to ask you a few questions, then you can proceed to your father, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip your fist in both anger and impatience as you want to see who this 'Father' is and what he is planning, but you turn around and then sigh before saying \"Alright, what do you want to know exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would like to do a diagnostic of your current state so that I can send this information to your father.\" Mitras says with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You reply, and just like that, the checkup begins. First he does the usual stuff like blood pressure, pulse, ext... then the tests become more of a work out as he starts to ask you strange questions that you would only know if you yourself were a demon, which in this situation you are. 'Thank goodness.' You say in your head for the fact that you can use Demon-Yuzu's memories as the checkup goes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more questions Mitras then asks you to remove your shirt, which you find quite odd, but none the less, you do as you are told, and he presses his stethoscope in between your breast to check for a heartbeat, which makes you surprised that demons even have hearts. He then grabs your left breast, and readies a needle which is filled with some type of liquid. You then feel that something incredibly wrong as Mitras brings the needle closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice him say under his breath breath \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Yes! Now for you to become my new slave!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You creep!\" You shout, but not completely you as you lose control of Demon-Yuzu. You realize that you accidentally gave her free will for a moment. She then blasts Mitras across the room; his body lit a flame via an Agi spell from Demon-Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try that again and I will burn you to death, and then I'll let my servants feast on your bones!\" Demon-Yuzu shouts, before you retake control and walk through the door which leads to your 'Father.' Inside you find a horrific sight as one of your friends, which is Atsuro, has been strapped to a lab table, and hooked up to a strange demonic machine, which appears to be pumping some type of liquid into him. Beside him was what appeared to be a white human male with bleached light blond hair who was wearing a purple suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, daughter, I figured that was you but...\" He pauses for a moment. \"Where is Mitras?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back there amongst the rats, and may he burn to death.\" You reply with a bit of indirect anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" The man asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He tried to inject me with a mind control serum so that I would be his sex slave.\" You reply as you begin to growl in anger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That insignificant...\" He mutters then looks back to you. \"He shall pay for that with his life, but then again, you did stop him...\" The man begins to think, and then looks at you with an evil grin. \"Ah I've figured out what his punishment should be!\" The man snaps his fingers and a small orb appears before him and you showing Mitras chained up to a wall with his arms bent backwards so far that you swear you could see his bones, and that a small demon was before him most likely his punishment. \"Let him experience torcher for a day, then let him back to the lab.\" The man before you says and then the orb flashes and disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now daughter about this human...\" The man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father.\" You reply turning to Atsuro who still remained unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should do about this one?\" He asks you, asking for your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we...\" Your mind goes blank as you can't bring yourself to have them experiment on Atsuro, but maybe this means that if you play along some more you can find your friends and free them as well, but at what cost? Does Atsuro have to die for the greater good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man notices you are in great thought and chuckled a bit. \"Calm yourself daughter.' He says in a soothing voice. \"If you want, we can try this tomorrow.\" He says, and you quickly nod, knowing this may give you more time to think about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we shall continue this experiment tomorrow, so please get some rest.\" The man says. \"Oh and another thing...\"The man begins.  \"...please say hello to your new sister on the way back to your room.\" With that, the man before you teleports away, leaving you alone in the lab with Atsuro. You want to rip him out of that machine right here and now but something stops you, not fear, not courage, not another demon, but you/Midori, who finally returns to her normal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get some sleep.\" She says, then she turns back into a liquid, and enters Demon-Yuzu's body. You walk out the lab doors, outside the office where Mitras formerly was, and out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you make it to your room you...</span></div></div>",

The person before you appears to be Midori, but not quite Midori as her dress is as white as snow and her left hand is like that of an ice claw, with her other hand being just a normal human hand, which is holding a black frost demon plushy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Midori what are you doing here?\" You ask her, doing your best to keep your cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I just thought I would come and see my sis.\" Demon-Midori says with a smile and gives you a playful hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay Midor...I mean sis.\" You say embracing the hug, and you notice that Demon-Midori still seems to be kind of like the original, though with a few added icy parts (I.E the ice claws and the frost dress). \"Hey, sis...\" You start and she looks up to you. \"Do you know what father was doing with the boy in the lab?\" Demon-Midori lets you go and sits back on the bed with a worried look. You sit beside her and ask her what's wrong, but she doesn't reply, instead she merely snuggles up to you and lies in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father was trying to turn that boy into a demon like us, but...\" Demon-Midori pauses for a second and you hear faint whimpering. You place your hand on her head, pick up a nearby hair brush, and begin to brush her hair. After a few more strokes with the hair brush Demon-Midori speaks up in a small cry. \"...Father wanted to turn the boy into a demon, but what he wants to really do is to devour his soul and turn him into a mindless soldier.\" Demon-Midori then begins to cry in your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there sis, it'll be alright.\" You say trying to comfort her. Demon-Midori stops crying for a moment and looks up to you. \"It's okay, we can save that boy if you want.\" You say, hugging her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu... but wouldn't father get angry with us if we did? After all, he might punish us if we get caught and we might...\" Demon-Midori tries to continue, but you calm her nerves with a small hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay sis...\" You embrace her in the hug and say something in your head. 'I won't let anything happen to you! I will protect you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break the hug and Demon-Midori asks you \"Do you mind if I sleep in here tonight? I don't want to go back to my room.\" You nod and tuck her into your bed then follow her and both of you fall asleep shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemon-Midori says something to you before she passes out \"Thank you, Yuzu...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Midori...Goodnight.\" You reply as the both of you fall asleep and begin to dream.

Your plan was to find your other bodies i.e. Amane and Yuzu (You still had Midori with you though you absorbed her for the time being). You felt the connection to Amane was the clossest and decided to head towards the east wing which you were suprised when yo usaw it, it was pitch white as if bathed in the light of heaven. The sigh hurt you eyes as it was so bright, you blasted one of the lights in a atept to darken the room if not dim it but instead the lights absorbed the magic like a sponge and grew even brighter. You felt like you were goign to be burned alive when Midori handed you something, a pare of glasses i.e. sunglasses which kinda looked cool on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Midori walked through the room and it eventually leads you to a special cell which is marked \"The angel's tomb\" you open the cell door and enter the room to find Amane curled up in the corner scared for her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want\" she cries out \"Come to experiment on me and try to take Remiel's powers? Or have you come just to screw with my mind and watch me cry out in agony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you a downer\" you say suprising Amane as you had spoken in your normal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony is that you\" Amane slowly gets up and tears begin to form in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Amane it's really me.

Pathetic.\u201d The demon says before she raises her hand and says one word \u201cMabufudyne.\u201d which sends a hail of ice down at you and your friends.

Now, prepare yourself, for in this world, I can unleash my true form, which you have no hope in hell of defeating. Well, that is, if you can make your way through my horde of demons.\" Haribel's voice laughs and then suddenly disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like there is only one way out of here.\" You groan and then stand up. You look up to see several dark purple glowing orbs circling in the air, and then they separate and implant themselves into the dead bodies that are hanging on the crosses, making them come to life. The bodies fall off the crosses and then transform into some sort of zombie like creatures, though they each have two pairs of devil wings sticking out of their backs and their hands have turned into blood red machine claws which seem to glow with a malevolent aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call these creatures Slaughters, oh and just so you know, they do not have a gender, although I see no real point of you knowing that, although I wonder how you got in here. Anyway, prepare to die!\" Haribel's voice laughs and fades away again, signaling the creatures to attack. Three of them dart their way at you, and are mere inches from you when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stay away from me!\" Yuzu screams, and suddenly, your body switches to the body of Yuzu, and then you shoot out a blast of pink light, which vaporizes the Slaughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yuzu, calm down!\" You say, making your body return to its original form (the form you entered with). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Anthony I'm just...\" She begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's going to be alright so calm down and just let me handle this, okay.\" You say and Yuzu calms down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Anthony just keep those things away from us and we'll do the rest.\" Yuzu says before returning back inside your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do.\" You say smiling, and then materializing two white beams of light which you then turn into swords. \"Time for some fun!\" You say smugly and charge at the remaining five Slaughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill the human!\" One of the creatures screams before you slice its head off, and then kick its body into another Slaughter, killing that one as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three left! Man this is a piece of...\" You are stopped in mid-sentence when the remaining Slaughters suddenly combine forming one giant Slaughter, which seems to be drooling blood and muttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food...Foood! FOOOOODDDD!\" It screams, licking its supposed lips, and rushing at you, trying to eat you. You jet out of the way to avoid the new creature's attack, but are smashed into the wall via a swipe from its arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony are you alright?\" You/Amane asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, just got smacked into a wall, but fine none the less.\" You say with a small laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're done joking, summon us!\" Yuzu says with a smug voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wouldn't that undo the fusion?\" You reply, climbing out of the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wouldn't, you would just give us temporary bodies that you will still have control over.\" You/Jezebel explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So pretty much like old times.\" You say with a small smile. \"Alright, summon: Angel Amane, Demon Jezebel, and Healer Yuzu!\" Three columns of light appear in front of you, blinding the creature for a moment, and made you cover your eyes. After the lights fade three females are now standing where the columns were, one of the three women is wearing a dark pink outfit, which seemed to have healing effect just by looking at her. Another one of the three woman appears to be human, though her hands have razor sharped, if not sharper nails, that are at least three inches in length, which are colored dark purple, the woman also has a dress except it has two colors instead of one, black and dark purple. The last of the three women appears to have the outfit of Amane, although she has two pure white angel wings sticking out of her back, and also seems to be carrying a bow made of frozen water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the knights of peace and love! We will protect Anthony no matter what the cost! We will destroy all in our way that opposes Anthony so long as we are alive.\" The three say in unison, then turn to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice entrance, ladies.\" You comment. \"Now, about our current situation...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" You/Jezebel says, raising her claws into the air before yelling \"CHARGE!\" and jumping onto the monster's back and slicing off its left arm. You/Amane then takes off into the air and sends down a hail of holy arrows, which burn the creature on contact. While you/Jezebel and you/Amane attack the creature, you and Yuzu hang back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt anywhere?\" Yuzu asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you mention it, I seem to have broken my left arm, although my abilities are healing it.\" You say with a small chuckle and groan as you realize your arm is broken. Yuzu places her hand on your broken arm and suddenly, your arm begins to glow with a small pink light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diarahan!\" Yuzu says in a soothing voice as the light begins to brighten, helping out your healing abilities, and then disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you done healing Anthony yet?' You/Jezebel asks. \"Because me and Amane just finished and we were wondering if you guys are still up for kicking Haribel's butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're all set.\" Yuzu replies as you and her stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, let's go bag us a demon chick.\" You/Jezebels declares, materializing a gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go!\" You say, and storm into the chapel area of the church...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, so we all know how the beginning goes: Getting home from school, deciding to do something you fall asleep, yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah. Boring stuff, right? Right. So let's just skip ahead, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shoot open as a wracking cough forces its way out of your chest, and you sit up straight on top of your bed. You pound your chest ease the pain, but the spasms have already subsided. What happened to you, you think while rubbing the sleep from your eyes, blinking into the darkness of the night. You can hear the door click open softly, and a head  pokes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Nabiki? I heard you coughing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, sis,\" you answer without thinking, waving the girl off. \"I just got something in my throat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then. Good night, Nabiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, Kasumi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't until the woman closes the door that you realize exactly what was wrong with that exchange: First of all, your name (despite what the first layer of your thoughts say) isn't Nabiki, it's Anthony. Secondly, while you have sisters, none of them are named Kasumi. So why did you respond the way you did? Too curious and inquisitive to fall back asleep, you begin your investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kasumi, I found this in my room this morning. You know what it is?\" you ask, showing the older girl the gooey thing in your hand. She looks at it curiously, then back to you. She shakes her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I've never seen anything like it. I'm sorry, Nabiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, sis. You'll know in a bit.\" And then you shove the worm into an unsuspecting Kasumi Tendo's face, where it quickly crawls up her nose and dissolves into her. She falls limp for a few moments -and you have to hold her up by the armpits to keep her from collapsing to the ground- and then she comes back to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, Nabiki, that was quite an experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank me later. Right now, I'm gonna need you to get some of that into our baby sister,\" you tell her, coughing out another worm into your hand and handing it to her. \"Think of it as an... initiation for you. This club's too exclusive to let just [i]anyone[/i] in.\" Kasumi nods in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Akane will enjoy being part of it as much as I have, once she joins.\" Of course she will, since you'll be the one animating her, just as you've been animating Nabiki and now Kasumi. Without saying anymore, you quickly walk Nabiki out of the kitchen while you set Kasumi to preparing breakfast, hiding the worm like a dagger. Not long after, Kasumi's ears pick up the light steps of Akane as she hops down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akane, can you come in here, please?\" you ask in Kasumi's kind voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! What's up, Kasumi?\" the youngest Tendo asked as she entered the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking of adding something new to your breakfast,\" you say, showing her the worm in your hand. She barely has time to look at it before you shove it into her face. It darts up her nasal passage before she even has time to react. In Nabiki's room, you smirk victoriously as you feel Akane's muscles warm up to your control and a new pair of eyes open to see Kasumi. She smiles kindly at you, and you smile back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wake up!\" A voice yells. \"I said wake up!\" Suddenly you are punched in the face extremely hard, which feels as if someone just dropped an anvil on your head. You cry out in pain as you open your eyes cupping your nose as you try to hold back the bleeding, although you are quickly healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was that for...Jeane?!\" You say, shocked. Before you is a woman who is dressed like a martial arts fighter. She is wearing a white top, has red stripe like tattoos running across her arms, she appears to be wearing a red thong, but you might mistake them for some shorts (You aren't really sure), and she is wearing white boots which, you're sure have small bits of red on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't answer my question!\" She yells at you, kicking you in the rib. \"Who the hell are you?!\" Jeane readies her fists, and throws a punch which seemed to send you flying, but you stayed put. You look to your left to see the body of a familiar character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Travis!\" You rush over to the body to confirm that it is indeed Travis Touchdown, although he is now dead. \"Crap, he's dead, but this can't be happening! This has to be a dream.\" You then remember your nose and how much it hurt, although no longer since you have healed, due to Jeane's punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a dream!\" Jeane yells. \"You're as pathetic as my brother beside you!\" She commented, which makes you mad. \"You see, when I beat him up enough he just passed out. Though oddly enough, he isn't dead, even though I'm sure you think he is. He is only unconscious, so I recommend you leave before I have to kill you.\" Jeane says in a somewhat sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it come to this?\" You ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that you were in your room after you got home. You were playing no more heroes, had gotten to the final boss (Jeane) but got killed by her signature attack. You then took a nap and woke up here... well... after your body suddenly became water and was sucked into your TV, much to your surprise. You think for a moment and think that this sounded quiet stupid, but heck all this is actually real as noted by the pain from earlier. Jeane approaches you and lifts you up by your throat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're going to die now, so I recommend you say your prayers\u2026\u201d Jeane suddenly is suddenly silenced as your body suddenly turns into water and begin to enter her body. \u201cGet out of me you son of a bitch!\u201d Jeane screams, punching herself in the ribs to try to force you out, but instead, you merely slip deeper in. Suddenly everything goes black and you seem to feel a sharp pain in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What happened?\u201d You wonder out loud, noticing that your voice has changed, it sounds like Jeane's voice. You try to stand up, but notice that you now have a somewhat noticeable amount of weight on your chest. \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d You ask to no answer. You look at yourself all over, and discover that you're wearing Jeane's clothes. This makes everything come together, and you realize that you're in Jeane's body You walk over to Travis' body as you decide to help the guy out since his is, after all, the 'hero' of this game. You begin to pick him up, but suddenly you cough up blood, much to your surprise. You then suddenly black out again and wake up in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least that is over...wait...\u201d You look yourself over to discover that you still are Jeane or at least are possessing her. \u201cMan this feels so strange, I hope this isn't permanent.\u201d You say and suddenly you spit a piece of yourself out, which forms into your normal body. Suddenly the world goes black again, though you wake up shortly afterwards to see Jeane standing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, welcome back to the world of the living, dip shit.\u201d Jeane says in a sarcastic tone, though you still feel like you are in control of her, even though she seems to be acting normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Jeane how...how are you feeling?\u201d You ask hesitantly, thinking she might beat the ever living crap out of you as you subconsciously try to will her to be kinder to you and not want to harm you, also making her fall for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess.\u201d She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think we should do now?\" You ask Jeane. She thinks for a moment, and then speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's go back and see if we can recruit some more girls into our little harem! Don't you agree?\u201d She asks, to which you nod at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the Wii back on and start up No more Heroes again. After you load a game which is right before you (Travis) is about to face a female opponent, you and Jeane turn into liquid and enter the game.

The dark-skinned girl looks at it, and then up at you in question. \"It's a poisoned piece of candy.\" You say, answering her unspoken inquiry. \"I brought it along, just in case. Eat this, and you'll be down in seconds.\" She takes the 'candy,' and examines it one last time, before flipping it into her mouth, swallowing it with no visible hesitance. You see the lights go out in her eyes, she slumps like a marionette with its strings cut, and then you feel a second body coming under your control, this one far more feminine than your real body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise Shinobu's head, and look at your main body and Jeane, both of whom are smirking at Shinobu's body. You smile with your new, female mouth. \"Well.\" You have Shinobu say. \"I guess you killed me in a sense, but I've come back as a better person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight.\" Jeane affirms with a nod of her head. \"You're nothing but Anthony's puppet now.\" Indeed, you muse, Shinobu has become nothing but a literal extension of yourself, a thing for you to play with; she is little more than a puppet, and you are now her puppeteer. Speaking of which, you think with two minds as you raise the newly-dominated Shinobu to her feet and massage her breasts with your hands. You need to figure out who else you want to add to your collection. The possession of the 18 year-old has diminished a desire that you had no idea was present, but you have a feeling that it will come back unless the process is repeated. With this in mind, you scan your memories (as well as Shinobu's, as her possession has given you access to all of <i>her</i> memories) to figure out the best girl to add. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer hits you from two different directions at the same time: There's Dr. Naomi, Travis Touchdown's mechanic, as well as researcher and developer of beam katanas (including the Tsubaki series, Travis' personal weapons), and professional scientist and engineer. With her intellect on your side, combined with Shinobu's skill, you could easily power your way through the rest of the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you could go for Sylvia Christel, Travis's love intrest, as well as member of the UAA - with her knowledge, you can rig the matches so you have an advantage all the time. </span></div></div>",

After another minute of laughing, you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's fight!\" You say, and Jeane backs off to watch the fireworks fly. You and Travis roar battle cries as you charge at each other, creating a sword duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice\" Travis comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" You reply and both jet back becuase the sword duel ended in a draw. You were still fired up, and so was Travis as you again ran at each other, though this time, he jumps and sliced his beam katana into your arm, nearly severing it, but you manage to knock him away with a swing of our own, doing some damage to him as well, the difference was, you are the only one who healed. \"Time to end this, I haven't been using my full powers, but I guess it's time I stop holding back.\" You summon up a small ball of your liquid self, and instantly chuck it at the still shocked Shinobu, the ball goes inside her, and then takes hold, allowing you access to her sword skills, which you happily copy knowing that this will make it so that you can switch up your style so that if someone gets used to one style, you can switch to throw them off.You adjust you beam katana to work with Shinobu's style, and then release a loud battle cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush at Travis with incredible speed, suprising even Jeane in the stands. You manage to strike a heavy blow on Travis' left shoulder, as noted by the now present large gash on his shoulder. His shock at your change of style gives you a major advantage, and you slice into Travis' left arm. You snap to your senses as soon as the fight was over as you had delt a criplling blow on Travis having broken Travis' left arm with your strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As of now, you are ranked Eight, though I would recomend resting a bit before continuing on your quest.\" You say in a profesional voice. \"Oh, by the way, I'm gonna keep this beam katana.\" Travis' doesn't object and passes out. You have Shinobu carry Travis home, since you want to leave Travis there to recover, thinking that Sylvia (who you are conteplating whether to posses or not) thinks less of him. You bandage Travis up with a first aid kit and then decide to leave the game, making sure to save the game so that Travis would remember this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going ot do about my brother?\" Jeane asks you in her usual though this time slightly concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Back in No more heroes***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis wakes up with a groan, and also sees a note from you left on his bedstill. He opens it up to find two pictures left from you. He examines them for a second and then screams out loud \"Damn it! I never got the guy's name!\" Travis begins to have a nose bleed and rushes to the bathroom as the note and it's contents fall to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents of the note were two pictures one of Shinobu and another of Jeane, though the really big suprise as well as what made Travis nose bleed was the fact that both of the pictures were that of the two women top-less. As for the note it read \"To my new friend Travis Touchdown. Great fight as well as great sportsman ship. Hope you enjoy these nice pics ^_^\" the message was followed by two words \"Shinobu\" and \"Jeane\" with arrows pointing to what was suposed to be the pictures though they had fallen out. A message was left under the spots for the pictures \"By the way the name's Anthony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Back to you in your room***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have gone ahead and taken direct control of Jeane, leaving you with three bodies sharing one mind.

You answer the phone regretfully to find that it is your mother. \"Hello.\" You say, answering the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Anthony it's mom, I just wanted to call to let you know that we'll be out for longer than we first thought, so we may or may not be back tomorrow, if not we'll be gone for a while, then.\" With that your mother hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was that about Anthony?\" You/Jeane asks, you're acting like you aren't yourself in the girls' bodies, so, she has to pretend that she doesn't share a mind with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.\" You reply. \"Just a message from my mom saying they'll be back late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then we should go back to possessing more girls.\" You/Jeane say, to which you nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are we going to go after?\" You/Shinobu asks you shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margret Moonlight...\" You declare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's that?\" You/Jeane asked as if wondering who it is that you are going after?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's one of the high ranking assassins, at rank 4, and she's rather beautiful.\" You say, blushing a small amount. You put No more heroes 2 into the Wii console, then load up a save file just before the 4th ranked battle, and proceed to enter the TV with you/Jeane and you/Shinobu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see that you are outside the bathroom in a room just before the roof door, which is to your left, upon exiting the bathroom. You get up and walk into the next room to find that Travis isn\u2019t around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, guess he\u2019s outside still fighting. Oh well this\u2019ll make it a small bit easier.\u201d You say with a smile as you pull out the Blood Berry that you had gotten from Travis earlier, and after looking it over, you slip it back into your pocket, ready to whip it out if need be. As you open the roof door, it makes an eerie creaking sound as it reveals the rooftop. You walk out into the open and begin to walk around on the roof as a strange, and yet enticing melody plays in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm hm hmm\u2026Reaper, reaper hmm hm.\u201d You hum along to the beat as a small red laser pointer slowly, but surely, makes its way up your spine. You stop dead and speak. \u201cYou know that song of yours is actually quite beautiful.\u201d You comment as you turn around, the laser pointer\u2019s dot was now right in the center of your forehead. Far away from you atop a billboard was a woman, her bladed weapon glows in the moonlight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm it seems that you are not afraid of being shot, correct? Well than I will ask you one last question, why is it that you are in the UAA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not in the UAA per say, but really\u2026I\u2019m just in it for the chicks.\u201d You say jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm it seems you take death as if it was something you could easily wash off with soap, like the dirt on those shoes of yours. So be it then. If you defeat me, then you may do whatever you wish to me.\u201d The woman replies as she jumps down off the billboard. You run up to catch her and narrowly make it before she touches the ground. \u201cOh and such a gentle man as well\u2026\u201d She says impressed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure all the other men you meet don\u2019t treat you with such courtesy.\u201d you say setting her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, all the men I meet, I cut their heads off.\u201d Margret says as her blades wrap around your neck like a snake, with a small amount of room left for breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh aren\u2019t you such a diva.\u201d You say as you move her blades away with your bare hands. Margret back flips away and her expression shifts into one of a fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, let us begin\u201d you say as you withdraw the Blood Berry from your pocket. You activate the beam saber and then the fight begins\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReaper reaper that\u2019s what people call me\u2026\u201d You begin to sing for the heck of it as you twirl your beam katana in your hand. Margret then continues after you as the song becomes that of a strange duet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Cause they all die!\u201d She sings. \u201cWhen I sing this song, I end their lives\u2026\u201d Margret sings as you block her strike and back flip away. \u201cYou act as though payback makes you a noble man. Is that a fact?\u201d Margret sings, and fires off a round which you easily dodge and continue the melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re a *BLEEP* Philistine.\u201d You sing, censoring your vocabulary slightly, and then drop kick Margret as she begins to fall you catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRequiem aeternum, Bullets right through the sternum\u2026\u201d Margret sings in your arms as you spin around and then twirl her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLullaby to heck, babe\u2026\u201d You sing as you two slip your weapons in between each other and hold each other\u2019s blades respectively an inch from their opponent's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReaper's got your name\u2026\u201d Margret weakly sings as you quickly slice her across her chest with the beam saber, which sends her into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I win babe.\u201d You say as you catch Margret one final time as her blood begins to soak her gothic Lolita style clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do\u2026please\u2026remember my song well.\u201d Margret replies with her finally word but you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re going to die now Miss Moonlight.\u201d you say with a happy smile as you materialize a small piece of you in your hand and transform it into that of the shape of a piece of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought you were going to kill me.\u201d Margret questions as she begins to chuck up blood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I would never kill a woman, especially such a beautiful one. That is why I want you to swallow this.\u201d You say as you show her the small piece of yourself disguised as a piece of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201c Margret protests, but you slip the \u2018candy\u2019 into her mouth, and she swallows it. You lean in and gently kiss her on the lips as the piece of you begins to take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you escort you/Margret outside to find you/Jeane and you/Shinobu with about a thousand bodies behind them. Shinobu\u2019s blade is coated in blood, yet her clothes remain clean, though you/Jeane is the opposite, with her hands and clothing covered in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you seem to be having fun.\u201d You say as you looked at Jeane's bloodied attire. You/Margret smiles and chuckles a small bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's so funny, prissy girl?\u201d You/Jeane asks as she cracked her knuckles, clearly not tired from killing all those henchmen behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's the fact that you are so feisty and act as though the blood on your hands is nothing.\u201d You/Margret replies with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks, I guess, but are we done here? I really need a shower\u201d You/Jeane complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Jeane, Mission complete.\" You reply, and then transport all of your bodies back to your room. As soon as you arrive back, the first thing that happens is you/Jeane, in order to keep up the act, asks you where your shower is, and after you answer, she bolts for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess she really wanted a bath.\u201d You say with a sigh as you plop onto your bed. \u201cAll I want to do now is take a nap *yawn* that fight really took it out of me.\u201d You/Margret smiles and walks up to you, then begins to stroke her chest along your chest which actually feels very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to need more strength if I know what assassin we\u2019re going after next.\u201d You/Margret says as her sharing a mind with you of course allows her to know everything you do, and vice versa.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYes master, rest up, and then when you wake up, we can fight again.\u201d You/Shinobu says as she walks to the door to keep watch, so that when your siblings get home, you will not be caught in this situation. You/Margret gets in your bed and sleeps in it with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning you decide to shoot for one more girl and when you appear in the game you see you are now...</span></div></div>",

You instantly release control of all the girls, seeing as how would be really difficult to fight simultaneously with four different bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they seem quiet authentic of them\" Margret chuckled as she readied her blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess they wanted to dress for success. Too bad the destroy players haven't won a game in years\" Shinobu said shifting into a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell than I guess we should put them and their stupid outfits back into the grave than\" Jeane said cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh this should be fun\" you say as you activate your blood berry and then the four of you rush the group of quiet possibly thousands of enemies. You laughed and smiled as you sliced three guys in half with your beam katana. Shinobu congratulated you on your kill as did Margret but Jeane just told them both to shut up and told you not to be cocky. You laughed as you continued to attack as the girls seemed to be having fun as well. Shinobu was quick and nimble allowing her to easily slice thru tens of small enemies with ease. Margret was pulling back on defense with her gun-scythes though she was farther back then the rest of you she still was having fun as she blasted her advisories' head's off. Jeane, who was the farthest up, seems to simply be acting like this whole this was just a job and yawned after she had cracked two guy's skulls by smashing their heads together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this is so boring\" Jeane complained as she ax kicked another guy this time breaking the dude's spine with a loud snap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't like it than hurry up and kill the rest of them, so we can get to the assassin\" Marg-ret recommended as she slices threw two enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't order me around prissy girl\" Jeane yelled back as she threw two enemies at Margret who easily sliced them to pieces without getting a trace of blood on her clothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now ladies if you're done fighting...\" you said in a joking tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've eliminated all the enemies Master\" Shinobu explains as she sheathes her katana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\u2019 for the status update Shinobu. You're such a sweet girl\" you say with a smile and pat her on the head similar to what pet owner does to their dog for doing something good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft whatever, Teacher's pet\" Jeane says under breath though Shinobu heard it and quickly withdrew her katana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that skank? You say something\" Shinobu says threatening Jeane?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now that's enough of that ladies! No more fighting until we get downstairs\" you yell an-gered by the constant bickering. You start to run off and the girls chase after you but you\u2019re a lot faster than all of them thanks to your copy ability that you used to combine Margret's and Shinobu's speed. You are the first one to arrive at the 'boss' door so to speak and after taking a deep breath you go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the three girls had finally arrived just before the boss room, all of them out of breath as they had to fight their way here as you didn't kill any of the enemies for them figuring that it would be a punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dam it*pant* why the hell did he have to run off\" Jeane cursed as she tried to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because you started it\" Margret said catching her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go sister\" Jeane threatened but Shinobu stopped them as she put her blade and a kunai to the two girl\u2019s necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say another word and your blood\u2019s going to paint the walls red\" Shinobu threatened meaning every word. Margret sighed and Jeane regretfully withdrew thus ending the conflict for now when suddenly a loud agonizing scream was heard, a scream from you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony\" Margret and Jeane said in unison both worried for your safety!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master\" Shinobu cried as she opened the door only for suddenly someone coated in blood to be sent fly back and smash against the cement wall. The three women ran at the being and to their surprise it was you thou you\u2019d seen better days. Your head had been smashed in and your chest was smashed in along with blood gushing out of your head like a broken faucet. The three girls frowned saddened to find you had died, heck even Jeane showed sorrow though she didn't allow the other two to see it. Shinobu begins to cry wildly and begins to ball into Margret's shoulder. Margret sighs sad to see this event come to pass and strokes Shinobu, trying to comfort her.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m some cold blooded assassin with a mind so fucked up that no one can stand me. Hell Travis didn\u2019t even know about me until the end of the game. Dumbass\u201d Jeane sadly chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what about mast-er I mean Anthony\u201d Shinobu asks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh what about the shit head\u201d Jeane asks in her usual tone though tears were still falling from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell didn\u2019t he posses you first? That can\u2019t be just a coincidence\u201d Margret says trying to cheer Jeane up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope when he first appeared I nearly killed the shithead. Broke his nose and gave him a black eye. I don\u2019t even think he knew he could possess me until I was already his. Besides I\u2019m just a pawn anyway. It\u2019s not like I can go anywhere I want, do whatever I want to do. I\u2019ll have to follow him like the little toy I am. Hoping that he won\u2019t discard me when he gets a new one\u201d Jeane replies sinking her head into her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDam it why do you have to be such a pain in the ass\u201d Margret groans annoyed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Jeane shrieks enraged, bolting up right and grabbing Margret by her collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret smirks \u201cGot yah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?

That\u2019s why you always called Anthony dumbass as well as just about everybody you came into contact with. Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Jeane let\u2019s go of Margret and begins to walk off when Shinobu stops her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going\u201d Shinobu asks? Jeane doesn\u2019t turn around and instead continues to walk towards the boss door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill the bastards who killed him\u201d Jeane says before turning the knob and walking inside. Shinobu looks at Margret and in a unanimous decision by the both of them, they decide to follow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Jeane and a girl dressed like a pink version of Margret were talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that dumbass who walked in here and got himself killed was what, your boyfriend or some-thing\u201d the girl asks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Jeane doesn\u2019t reply instead she grips her fists, hard enough to make them start bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh cat got your tongue? Well whatever\u2026\u201d the girl stands up from the yellow stained couch she was sitting on. \u201c\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter who the fuck you are. I don\u2019t even care if you just wan-dered in here by accident. You\u2019re still gonna pay!\u201d The girl points the baseball bat she was car-rying at Jeane showing that it was stained with blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026you\u2019re not the one whose gonna get payback\u201d Jeane mutters not looking at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh tough talk for some bitch in a thong\u201d the girl taunts when suddenly Jeane rushes at her, forcing the girl to dodge out of the way. Jeane instead punches a large hole in the couch that the girl was previously sitting on. \u201cHa got you\u201d the girl shrieks insanely as she raised her bat high into the air intending to smash Jeane\u2019s skull in. Jeane turns around to face the girl but doesn\u2019t move anymore than that. The girl laughs crazed as she smashes the bat onto Jeane\u2019s head, severely damaging Jeane\u2019s skull but strangely this did not kill her. Jeane\u2019s head began to bleed out from the injury, blood streaming down her face, and drenching her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d the girl quickly bolts away then once she was enough feet away to still strike Jeane but not the other way around \u201c\u2026how the hell are you still standing? You skull should be paste!\u201d Jeane doesn\u2019t reply and instead she once more rushes the girl, except this time instead of dodg-ing the girl swingers her bat at Jeane only for her to dodge and deck her in the face! The girl tries to hit Jeane once more but Jeane grabs the bat and crushes it with one of her bloody hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d the girl screams right before Jeane grabs her by the neck. The girl struggles to get free but Jeane was far too strong. No this was not some benefit of being your pawn, this strength was all her own. After all what would all that train she paid for be if it didn\u2019t show results. It\u2019s the one \u2018good\u2019 thing that came out her horrible past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re a lot like me\u2026\u201d Jeane said in a stoic tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up and kill me already. Or do you plan to bore me to d-\u201cJeane punches the girl in the chest causing her to shut up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026you remind me of what I used to be like. Not letting anyone boss you around, beating people\u2019s faces in left and right. Yeah you\u2019re a lot like me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDam it just shut u-\u201conce more Jeane punches the girl, this time hard enough to break the girl\u2019s ribs, every single one of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever one thing is different, I have someone in my fucked up life who means something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah who\u201d the girl asks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bastard you murdered with that broken bat of yours! He\u2019d probably brain wash you by now but here\u2019s the thing\u2026\u201d Jeane whispers the last part as she gets closer to the girl <b>\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have that power!\u201d </b>For once in the girl\u2019s life, she felt like all those she had once killed, a feeling that she had never felt before, fear!  The girl began to scream but Jeane covered her mouth and begins to squeeze, slowly cutting off her remain oxygen! However, just before the girl was about to pass out Jeane removed her hands, causing the girl to collapse to the ground, desperately gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*cough* you*wheeze*bitch*gasp*\u201d the girl gasped cursing Jeane\u2019s very name. Jeane pulls her hand back but suddenly something grabs her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough\u201d shouts a voice. Jeane whirls around and sees none other than you! \u201cThat\u2019s enough Jeane! It\u2019s over. You\u2019ve won\u201d Jeane doesn\u2019t say a word and backs off. You ap-proach the girl who you knew as the second ranked assassin Bad Girl. She looks at you with fearful eyes as you place your palm over her open mouth, shooting out a rather large piece of yourself inside. Bad Girl passes out during this process having no strength left to fight with.</span></div></div>",

How did you survive being nearly bludgeoned to death\u201d Margret asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually I don\u2019t really know. I guess it\u2019s just some added bonus of my powers. Heh frankly I wish this thing came with an instruction manual\u201d you say with a playful laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot\u201d Jeane whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Jeane what did you say\u201d you ask only to see Jeane pull her arm back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDUMBASS\u201d Jeane shouts at the top of her lungs as she delivers a bone shattering punch to your face and sends you flying back.

The two quickly run towards you while Jeane, angrier to the oomph degree, slowly walks after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short few seconds later Margret and Shinobu finally make it to you, just as you come around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnthony, are you okay\u201d Margret asks concerned? You groan as you lean up, your back hurting the worst but other than that you were pretty much fine. You didn\u2019t even have a cut or mark on your entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alright but my back\u2019s killing me\u201d you groan, standing up. \u201cJeane must\u2019ve been taking it easy on me\u201d you laugh. It was then that Jeane arrived and you look at her and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you smiling about? I just put you threw about ten walls! Don\u2019t make me make a new addition to the pavement\u201d Jeane warned but you simply smiled. Jeane blushed slightly and turned away. \u201cAt least you\u2019re not dead\u2026\u201d Jeane says silently as she walks away saying the last part when she was out hearing range \u201c\u2026I\u2019m glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell regardless I think it\u2019s time to go but first\u201d you suddenly switch main bodies to Jeane, temporarily taking over her for a moment just as Bad Girl begins to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh what happened\u201d Bad girl groans holding her head in pain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry just a bit of a side effect from the possession. Now then when Anthony snaps his fingers you will switch to a good and nicer personality and then when he snaps his fingers again you will return to being a sadistic assassin\u201d you explain in a sydo-hypnotic voice though with Jeane\u2019s voice before snapping your/her fingers and saying the words \u201cGood Girl!\u201d Bad Girl blinks a few times and then stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Girl ready and willing\u201d she says with a salute and a cutesy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the family Good Girl. Now just to clarify repeat what I just told you\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlight Anthony, you told me that whenever you snap your fingers (even if you\u2019re in a different body) then I become a good girl and when you snap your fingers again I become the old evil twisted me call Bad Girl\u201d Good Girl explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good uh\u2026Good Girl\u201d you say clapping your/Jeane\u2019s hands. With this you return your main body to your original body and allow Jeane to take back her body. Jeane turns back around and growls clearly angered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time you do that without asking first I\u2019m kicking your ass\u201d Jeane warns meaning every word!

Also, I kind of borrowed some of my content from Seuzz, and some from ductorPhil)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" You groan as you flop into the chair like a dying fish; you're glad to be home after the last day of school for the school year. You browse through the sites that show anime for new fan subs, and you notice that there's a new Fairy Tail episode up. Mentally cheering, you click the video. It's a great episode, so great that you don't notice yourself becoming more and more tired as the episode continues, and by the time you realize you are tired, your head hits the desk and everything goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to find yourself in a completely different place from where you went unconscious. You feel a flash of fear, but that is quickly replaced by curiosity of finding out where exactly the heck you are. The only noise you hear is snoring, and you notice the only light in the building is the moonlight that shines through a window. You try to stand up and look around, only to find out you can't, although you can rise up, and realize that you are in some type of bar-- an extremely messy one, as there are more bottles and barrels strewn about the establishment than you thought possible-- specifically behind the counter, and it's full of sleeping people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This all looks very familiar.' You think as you look down at the table you have put your hands on to lean\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--and only then do you notice that you no longer have a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, where your arm should be, is a long, glowing blue tentacle. You stare at it in shock, too stunned to even scream. You look down, but only have a brief glimpse of the rest of your body similarly transformed before you collapse onto the ground. You raise yourself up again. You feel nothing like bones or muscles. Instead, you see bluish, goo-like pseudopods shoot out and pull back into your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you even have a body? You try to look at yourself, but as near as you can tell, you are only a puddle of goop. You try to roll along the ground, and find yourself forming into a serpentine coil. You slither around the now-large counter to take a better look at your surroundings, and you suddenly find a figure sleeping peacefully on the floor. The figure's chest slowly rises up and down, and you suddenly realize that the figure is female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is then that a feeling, an almost instinctual desire to get inside her body, sucker-punches your mind, and you are so taken by surprise that you are swept up by the feeling, and lunge towards her face. You can feel her violently twisting as you greedily start squeezing into her mouth and nose, but you don't care, and continue forcing yourself into her facial openings. You wake with a start, gagging. Getting your breathing under control, you look around; you're still in the bar, but something seems different. You sit up and lean on your arm, trying to figure out what's missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a weird dream...\" You whisper, putting your hand on your head. \"Wait...\" You say, as something has clicked in your mind. 'That's not my voice!' Your eyes travel to the arm with which you're holding your head; it's more feminine and paler than what you remember. 'That's not my hand! What the heck?!' You look at the rest of your body, only to find a pair of girl's arms, girl's legs, and- ARE THOSE FREAKING TITS!!? And why are you wearing a dress?! 'Abbaba... Ihavea... Whattheheck...?' This is, of course, too much for your brain to handle, and your eyes roll back into your head as you fall right back to unconsciousness, flopping back to the floor limply with one last thought going through your head: I wanna go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world comes alive around you, and her mind opens up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're watching another life from another perspective on what feels like fast forward x1000, but you process it perfectly: The girl you possessed was named Mirajane, and that right there freaked you out, because that's the name of a character in the anime Fairy Tail. That's not all, you become more and more freaked out as her life reveals itself to you, because it turns out that she IS the Mirajane from Fairy Tail: Her younger siblings are Lisanna (who she thinks is dead, but you know she isn't via the manga) and Elfman, she's the head waitress for Fairy Tail, and she's an S-class(\"S\" for \"Super awesome\") mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirajane: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100918203639/fairytail/images/3/3d/Miramaster.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much everything in her life, you live for her, and when it's all over you find yourself in front of a gigantic forest, and back in your own body, though it feels like you've never left. Between the trees flash moments of Mirajane's life, everything from an argument with young Erza, to Lisanna's death. You actually feel sorry for her loss, especially because you know she's really alive. \"I wish I could change that...\" You mutter. Suddenly, the image flashes white, and you find yourself right next to Mirajane, crying over Lisanna's gradually disappearing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" You shout, but you are merely an observer as Lisanna's unmoving body finally disappears, and Mirajane collapses into tears. Another flash of light and you're back in front of the forest. Suddenly, an idea hits you: \"If I can look at her memories... maybe I can change them!\" You say to yourself, though it sounds much better in your head. Regardless, you begin to walk into the forest, exploring the memories of the Fairy Tail poster girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you come across a large paper booklet, bound by what looks like gigantic paper clips. You look at it, and realize that it has every member of Fairy Tail, and every person she's ever met, and her thoughts on them. You wait a second, and then smirk and grab the pencil attached the bottom of the booklet by string, and erase her knowledge of Lisanna's death, instead writing down that she has left on a trip for two years, and will be coming back soon. Then you flip to the very back of the booklet and write your name down, and add a few sentences about you in the document. By the time you have finished, Mirajane a crush on you that is augmented by unwavering devotion and desire to please you by any means. And of course, she now thinks the best way to please you is by being possessed by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the pencil down, and fold the book back, and then you suddenly find yourself not at the bar, but in your room, on your bed. You sit up on the edge of your bed, and the two swinging lady lumps on your chest confirm to you that you are still inhabiting Mirajane's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did I get back to real life?' You wonder, but you've really stopped trying to figure this crap out. All you know is that you're in a hot girl's body, and you've got nothing to go on for anything regarding a cover story or disguise. Thinking back to what just happened, you try to call up her memories, and everything reveals itself to you; her memories, her mannerisms, her powers, all information within Mirajane's mind assimilates into yours. You could, if you wished, impersonate her perfectly. Her mind is nothing more than a pretense, and a persona that you can assume at will. You even know Japanese! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you have other issues to attend to at the moment, because you can feel something in your stomach that you just can't hold, and you run to the bathroom. Mirajane's high heels and dress not a problem since her muscle memory guides you. Once in the bathroom, you hurriedly lock the door and kneel down in front of the toilet, before closing your eyes and letting it fly.</span></div></div>",

Not only that, but there is also something wrong with your vision. Even though you can see the bathroom, it is doubled with another and very disorienting sight: walls, hard and white and curved, rising around you. You lean back over the toilet, in case more vomit is about to come out of you, and are shocked to find yourself looking into Mirajane's face, which seems to looming largely over you. You are also shocked to find that your vomit barely has any actual vomit in it, but in fact is made up of a blue, snake-like goo. You gasp, dully noting that Mirajane's voice sounds very cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are looking down at a piece of your own body inside the toilet bowl\u2014and, you realize, you are looking up from inside the toilet bowl at your possessed body. Your sense of disorientation is caused by being able to look at the world simultaneously out of Mirajane 's eyes, and out of this little bit of your body that's escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, you reach down and pluck the worm out of the mess; as you lift it up, you also see the world \"rise\" about you. Slowly, you carry it over to the sink and wash both it and your hands off; as the \"worm,\" you also feel the water rushing all about you. You concentrate, and find that you can operate the worm as well, and you send it slithering over your wrist and up your arm. It is fascinating to watch. You giggle, because it also tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in your bedroom, you concentrate and find you can expel a large number of these worms, of varying sizes. They squirm all over the desk as you concentrate on moving them, and you are even able to divide the larger ones and combine the smaller ones. If you let little worms out of yourself, and are able to control them when they are not connected to you, could you put one into another person and control two bodies at once? Hell, you even spit some of yourself out and realized the law of conservation of mass didn't apply to you, because you could alter the form of your worm so it resembled your original body, but only one worm could take your form at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to give it your best shot, but you don't remember how you got into the Fairy Tail world in the first place, so how will you get back? You think, and Mirajane's brain helps as well. With two brains, you come up with nothing, so you decide to try an absolutely stupid idea, and try to will yourself back into the Fairy Tail universe. Suddenly, everything goes dark, and then when you come to, you're back at Fairy Tail HQ. It's still dark and everyone's still sleep. A very uncharacteristic smirk appears on Mirajane's face, and you stomp on the urge to moan as, one by one, six worms wriggle their way out of her cunny and slither down her leg. They split in different directions, each headed for a different target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a really nice thing for you to do, Mirajane.\" You say through Erza body. By now, you've given up on trying to reverse whatever disease or affliction you've gotten, and have decided to have fun with it. It's 4:00 PM at your house, and this whole adventure started at 3:30, so you're alone in the house. Currently Mirajane, Erza Scarlet, Juvia Loxar, Wendy Marvell, Lucy Heartfilia, Cana Alberona and Levy McGarden are now all in your room, and under your control. Apparently once you possess someone, you get a crude grasp of their memories, but enough for you to fake being them well enough to pass as them in a first meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza Scarlet: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101012010957/fairytail/images/b/b7/Erza_Anime_S2.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia Loxar: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i826.photobucket.com/albums/zz190/jcbballer/Jubiacolour.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i826.photobucket.com/albums/zz190...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy Marvell: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101012010956/fairytail/images/c/c1/Wendy_Anime_S2.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy Heartfilia (with Gemini, who has taken her form): <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101108162935/fairytail/images/f/f2/Lucy_beaten_by_Lucy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana Alberona: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100803111159/fairytail/images/1/19/Cana_first_anime.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy McGarden: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.wikia.com/fairytail/images/1/17/Levy02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.wikia.com/fairytail/images...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" You have Lucy chime in happily, adding to Erza's grateful statement, and you note how weird it sounds for the girls' Japanese voices speaking perfect English. \"Thanks for sharing yourself with us!\" There's a collective smile and nod that your other hosts give, and you smile contently with Mirajane's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no trouble really.\" Mirajane --or rather, you-- say \"I just wanted to share this with all of my girlfriends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of sharing...\" You say with Lucy's mouth as you pull her celestial key ring from her belt. \"I think I know who we can get next~.\" You have her pull out the gold Key with the symbol for Virgo on it. \"Open the Gate of the Maiden! Virgo!\" There's a puff of smoke, and then a young woman with short pink hair in stereotypical maid attire appears, her arms drawn into a stereotypical maid position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th06.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2010/306/d/0/fairy_tail___virgo_by_raizen13-d320sze.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th06.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How may I serve you, Mistress?\" She asks, not really caring about her obliviousness to the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" You say as Lucy, walking up to her. \"You can join our little group, for a start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what you mean, Mistre-\" That's all she can say before you have Erza put her in a chokehold from behind.  She gasps, and begins to struggle. You quickly silence her by slapping the worm you have in Lucy's other hand over her mouth. She struggles for a bit more before she sags in Erza's grip. You release her, but Lucy catches her in a hug before she can fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Virgo.\" You say with Lucy's mouth, stroking the unconscious celestial spirit's hair; you see this from six other perspectives, and it looks adorable from each one of them. With a gasp, Virgo wakes up, and you look into Lucy's smiling face through Virgo's eyes. \"Welcome.\" You say as Lucy. \"To our group.\" You smile through Virgo and take a step back, before bowing like the maid you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, princess.\" You say through Virgo, going by Lucy's and her own memories of Virgo's behavior to imitate her. \"But if you'll excuse me, I must go to sleep now.\" You walk Virgo you to your bed, and fall asleep on the bed, setting out to absorb her mind. With that out of the way, you scan your hostesses' memories to see if there is anyone you missed. Then you remember: Aries! You're missing Aries, the celestial spirit. You pull out Lucy's keys again, but find that she doesn't have a spirit Key for Aries, and then you remember that she got it off Angel once they beat her. You use your computer to look up the episode where Angel first appears, but then you remember that she also has Gemini, the twin shape shifting spirits, so you keep going back in Lucy's memories to figure out who had it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ain't this just fantastic.\" Karen, now under your control, snarks as you all return to your house. \"I let my guard down for one second and <i>this</i> happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://forums.mangafox.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=37345&amp;d=1304892295\" target=\"_blank\">http://forums.mangafox.com/attachment.ph...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" You say through Cana. \"We need you to summon Aries for us.\" Karen crosses her arms. Erza, meanwhile, is blowing a copy of your body's mind (and dick) while you are making out with Juvia in the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I?\" You have her say It's kind of fun to act like a bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, you don't have any other choice.\" Wendy, who, along with Mirajane, you've used to moderate the conversation, argues, and you cross her arms in front of her body. \"This whole conversation is pointless, so just do as we say.\" You sneer with Karen's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever.\" You have Karen say, pulling out the gold key to summon Aries.\" Open, door of the white lamb! Aries!\" There's a puff of smoke, and a pretty girl with pink hair, a pair of twisted brown horns on her head and clothes in a soft and fluffy wool-like style appears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAries: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100531124529/fairytail/images/2/29/Aries_anime.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call me?\" She asks, bringing one shyly clenched hand up to her face and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" You Karen say scornfully, marching up to the spirit. \"Here.\" Is all she says, before you grab Aries's head, which she flinches at, shove a worm into her face, and push her head into it. She's so taken by surprise that she barely even struggles as you worm into her nasal cavity and dissolve. You rush Mirajane, Cana and Wendy to hold her up while you walk Karen away. \"There, you happy?\" She asks.</span></div></div>",

How about Angel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the one with Gemini, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Lucy stands up, and a worm pokes its way out of her mouth before crawling into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\"  You put a confused look on Lucy's face in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, this seems like your cup of tea,\" you have Levy reply, scratching the back of her head sheepishly. \"Gokouun o inorimasu, Lu-chan (Good luck, Lucy),\" You-Levy say, switching to fluent Japanese simply because can. You raise Lucy's lips into a smirk and nod before disappearing into the Fairy Tail universe once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summon them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summon. The spirits. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel sighs in a mix of exasperation and defeat. \"Augh! Fine.\" Lucy smiles victoriously, throwing a thumbs up to her fellow hostesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Success!\" She exclaims, but it's not really an accomplishment, since you knew what you were going to say and happen before you made it so, and you'd been planning this the whole time; Angel was to summon Gemini, make them assume one of your girls' forms, take them over and then transfer ownership from her to Lucy, leaving Angel as nothing but a fucktoy for  your enjoyment. She, unlike Karen, is completely okay with this, and feels that this is a fate better than the one she suffers at Lucy's hand. At least, that's the pretense you've assumed, because at least Angel had a sympathetic past, while Karen's just a straight up bitch. In fact, you'd probably just keep her because she killed Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk Levy and Lucy out of your room and into the kitchen, setting the former to reading the book you are required to read for school during summer vacation and the latter to cooking, as you have brought Mirajane into your room. You focus on using her transformation magic in order to trick Gemini into transforming into Lucy. You concentrate, and you watch through Angel's eyes as Mirajane begins to radiate gold and smoke swirls around her form before momentarily engulfing her and dissipating. You are satisfied to see that Mirajane's form is replaced by that of a disheveled, mildly injured Lucy. And to take your plan a step further, you walk your Angel body over to your Mirajane body, rear your gloved fist back, and belt it into your stomach. Hard. So hard that you double over, coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Mirajane, who has transformed into Lucy, shall be referred to as Mira-Lucy until she cancels the transformation)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fall to your knees from as Mira-Lucy, you concentrate, and suddenly both of you are no longer in your room, but in the Fairy Tail-verse, in the middle of river; a perfect location to put your plan into motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull Gemini's key out from Angel's pocket and twirl it before settling it between your thumb and index finger, pointing it to the space you just vacated. \"Gemini!\" There's a puff of smoke, and suddenly two blue, small, alien-like creatures with two strands of hair on their head, sashes across each of their chests and v-shaped mouths appear floating in mid-air in funny poses. \"Gemini, do it!\" you command, pointing to your Mirajane body, through whom you are still gasping and coughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Kay!\" comes the simultaneous child-like exclamation before the twin celestial spirits run into each other, there is a large puff of smoke, and Gemini is replaced by (guess who!) Lucy, who turns to face your other self. You look up tiredly with Mirajane's disguised eyes, and see a second Lucy, a hand on her hips and her expression very much conveying smugness, like she knows something you don't. You could take her that instant, but you instead decide to put on an act to make it more fun for yourself, so you gasp in surprise and widen your eyes in shock. \"Hey,\" the new Lucy says, still smirking as she saunters up to your Mirajane body. \"You don't look so good, lemme help you with that.\" She rears back, and you let out a short cry of pain as Gemini-Lucy plants her boot into your gut so solidly that you are knocked on your back. Back in your house, your hosts cringe in phantom pain. But you must keep up the act, so you put Angel's hands on her hips and chuckle in amusement as your other body hits the water with a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Literally bringing defeat upon herself... What a dope!\" You say, adding insult to injury as you watch one Lucy continue to strike the other before breaking out into laughter. \"Serves you right!\" you taunt as you crouch on your hands and knees with Mira-lucy; you might not be completely worn out as you could possibly be, but it's taking all your willpower to not just shove a worm into her face and end the pain right now. You try and struggle to your feet, but they give out from under you and you fall to your hands and knees again. You spit out the saliva that has accumulated in your mouth and look up. Through Angel's eyes, you watch as resolve flashes in Mira-Lucy's own while you bend over and dip an open palm into the water. \"What's that look for? I don't like it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You ask with Mira-Lucy's mouth. \"Why are you doing this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" You reply to your own question, strolling up next to Gemini-Lucy and crossing your arms under your chest. \"Besides,\" you smirk at yourself. \"We all know what's going to happen next. Go get 'er,\" you say, patting Gemini-Lucy on the head then putting her mouth with your hand. She says something, but her voice is muffled as you pop a worm into her mouth. As you take your hand away from her mouth, she coughs and tries to spit it out, but you're able to move it under her tongue and begin to dissolve. She stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" She questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out in a bit~!\" you reply in a sing song voice, and through Mira-Lucy, you smirk victoriously as you release the transformation magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" Gemini-Lucy exclaims in confusion and shock, and you watch over her shoulder through Angel as the injured Lucy's form is engulfed in smoke and replaced by that of Mirajane's true form. Then the light goes out in her eyes, she pitches forward, and you catch her by the waist as Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the good life, Gemini,\" your Angel body smiles, and you feel a new (yet very familiar) set of muscles warm under your control. You steady your new self, and a shadow passes over your face as you smirk through your new puppet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spirit information gathering complete,\" You make your new conquest say, keeping in character and acting as though the last ten seconds didn't happen. \"Oh, wow! You have quite a lot of keys. You've even had an audience with the Spirit King?\" You make her question, placing one hand on her hip. \"And your magical power isn't anything to laugh about, either; and to top it all off, you're part of <i>this</i> little guild? My, my, looks like I hit the jackpot with you, Lucy-chan. Or should I say, Mirajane-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" you reply through Angel, patting your new conquest on the head. \"You're nothing but a tool for Anthony to use, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't talk, Angel,\" you say in Mirajane's gentle voice as you stand up. \"All you're good for is as Anthony's sex doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I'll get more of him than you will,\" your Angel body retorts. \"Speaking of which, how is he in bed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's simply wonderful!\" Your Mirajane body says dreamily, clasping her hands in front of her chest. This, of course isn't competely true, as all of your selves are virgins, so all you have to go by is your own libido, your girls' memories of self-stimulation, and your memories of porn. Because you weren't all that experienced with this kind of stuff, it was hard to focus on controlling all of your bodies <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" you put a smug look on Angel's face. \"I guess it'll be more fun for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'll be able to feel it anyway, remember? After all, we share the same mind.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" you interrupt with Gemini-Lucy. \"Let's head back.\" With that, all three of you disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later in the real world, you've got all of your bodies either sitting or standing in the kitchen, eating the ramen you've prepared for yourselves and contemplating where to go from here. You've finished with Fairy Tail, and you are stuck on deciding which series to move on to. On one hand, you've taken the bodies of some powerful mages, and could focus on obtaining more strong and powerful women, but on the other hand, you could get some bodies with real sexual experience, and use them to give yourself a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder, and then all of your faces light up. You have decided.</span></div></div>",

It is Meanwhile, you've finished assimilating all of your hostess' minds, and have got them doing random activities around the house: Mirajane is cooking, Lucy is reading  on your bed, Wendy is watching cartoons, Juvia is taking a bath, Erza is googling fighter bodies on Mia's Windows Vista, you have Aries lying on the living room floor fingering herself, Angel and your duplicate body are in the bathroom making out, Virgo is cleaning the house and Cana is drinking a massive barrel of liquor that you took from Fairy Tail HQ in the kitchen. <br>\r\nEverything is going nicely and according to plan, and you've got plenty of potential 'recruits' in mind. Suddenly, until you hear the door unlocking with Aries' ears. All of you freeze, hearts pounding in unison. It's the longest three seconds you've ever experienced, and you watch with four pairs of eyes(Aries', Mira's, Cana's and Virgo's) as the door swings open.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door swings open slowly, and your twin sister Mia trudges in, relief clear in her eyes. She drops her backpack near the door, and it lands with a loud <b>thud!</b> You can't really blame her, either; you'd finished your last final exam a few hours ago, while she probably just finished hers twenty minutes ago. Your thoughts of pity are broken, however, when she walks into the living room and freezes in shock as she sees your Aries body. On the floor. Staring at her. With wide eyes. Did I mention you still had her hand in her vagina? No?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she sees you, and your Aries body seems to go into auto-pilot as you feel yourself crouching to your knees and lunging towards her, covering a few yards before she could so much as flinch. You tackle her to the ground and pin her arms down, looking straight into her shocked face. You whisper a small \"I'm sorry,\" and Mia squeals as you hock a wad of yourself onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight,\" Mia says, her gaze sweeping over all of your bodies, which you have standing at attention, from her vantage point of the living room couch. \"You were watching this 'Fairy Tail' anime, then you went to sleep, and you suddenly found yourself in a bar, am I right so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" You say with your duplicate body's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So, after that, you turned into some kind of gooey, silly-putty-type stuff, and crawled away from the counter of the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you saw someone sleeping, and then you figured out that she was a girl, and then... you... felt yourself get this really bad urge to go inside her. And then you ended up possessing her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how I got here, yeah,\" Mirajane chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" your twin replies. \"But then you-\" she pauses, making no attempt to hide her smirk as she snorts incredulously. \"You <i>fainted</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Shut up,</b>\"  You say. This time, all of your girls spoke unanimously, each one of their visages ones of annoyance but their reddened faces and indignant body language convey their embarrassment very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Mia exclaims, jumping a bit in her seat. All of your faces morph into smirks. \"Oh, very funny, Anthony,\" she says sarcastically, crossing her arms in a huff. \"Jesus Christ, it's still freaky; to think that my twin brother's really just a pile of goo that can take over people's bodies now. It just feels so... surreal, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" your doppelg'nger says apologetically, and your puppets' expressions sober into those of sympathy and guilt. \"I'm sorry, it must be a lot to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" she replies, smiling as she looks each one of you. \"Anyway: after you fainted, you found out you could access and change her memories, and after changing her memory so she was basically your bitch-\" she ignores the indignant noises you are making in protest while you've got Mirajane hanging her head to hide her red face and continues. \"-you found yourself back in your room, still in her body.\" Your Mirajane body nods, head still bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that,\" she adds. \"But he also woke up to find that my whole mind was open to him, and he could impersonate me perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the love of crap, Anthony,\" Mia groans, rubbing her forehead. \"Will you stop that? It's so wierd! You say you're in all of their bodies, but you act like they're themselves!\" You pretend to think about it, your bodies glancing each other to convey silent thoughts, then, as one, every single one of your bodies shake their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh!\" Mia sighs in frustration, and you try to suppress a smirk of satisfaction, but you can't help but let it show on Erza's, Juvia's and Angel's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, keep acting like you're all separate people, see if I care. Where was I with the story? Oh yeah: so then you felt nauseous and went to the bathroom to throw up, only to see that you only threw up part of yourself -your original body, I mean- and that you could also see through <i>that</i> part of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but you could also control it.\" She scrunches her face as she reaches out and grabs the goo that you have offered her and inspects it, letting it slither around her hands and arms. \"And then you tried to see if you could control more than one body at the same time by making your... 'worms' enter other people's bodies. Did I miss anything?\" You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, that's pretty much how I ended up like this.\" Your make your other hosts smile and nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, in any other situation, I'd think you'd gone bat-shit crazy, but I'll accept your story,\" your twin acquiesces, leaning back on the l but there's just one thing I wanna know: Why'd you possess me  when I saw you...\" she trails off and glances at your Aries body, who you've got matching Mia's blushing face with her own and looking down in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you have her apologize. \"I just panicked and I-I-I didn't know what to do!\" You've got her on the vergo of tears now, and you comfort her with Erza, Lucy and Virgo. Mia, for her part, looks on with a face conveying disbelief, shock and regret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonono, uhhhh, don't cry!\" she says desperately, jumping up to comfort your Aries body as well. \"Look, I, uhh, I guess I understand why you did it; I mean, I'd be pretty freaked out if someone walked in on <i>my</i> happy time.\" Aries sniffs, and looks up with hopeful, tear-filled eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you forgive me?\" Mia smiles reassuringly, holding the blue goo in two pinched fingers and slurping it down. She swallows, and you can feel the worm sliding down your esophagus, dissolving halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you even have to ask?\" Of course not, this whole time your sister has been under your control, and the whole conversation has been an attempt to suppress the guilt of possessing your sister's body-- since you were afraid she might let it slip if you left her unchanged, and she might find out accidentally if you alter her memory and leave her-- from explaining the situation to \"her,\" to her \"forgiving\" you; it has all been a puppet show with the intent of soothing yourself. \"I'm part of you now, so let's all get together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod with your duplicate body, and you all give a great big group hug. \"It's great to have you on my side, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels great to be on the team, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's ten minutes later, and you're doing various thing around the house again: Levy is reading, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Virgo's spiking all of the drinks with bits of you</span> cleaning, Cana's drinking some booze, Wendy's playing in the backyard with Aries and Juvia, Angel is pleasuring herself, Gemini is sleeping in Mia's room, and Erza, Lucy, Mirajane, your dupe, and Mia are all sitting in your room, tossing around ideas on who to add next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Simca from Air Gear?\" you have Erza, who you have sat on the bed, suggest. \"She's about twenty-five and she flirts with Ikki all the time, she's got to have plenty of experience with pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it,\" you chime in with Lucy, who you've got sitting at the computer. \"Doesn't Air Gear have a few people like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" you exclaim through your dupe, writing the name down on a piece of paper. \"Air Gear is one, what others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's Blair from Soul Eater,\" you supply through Mirajane, who is sitting on the floor and leaning against the wall. \"I only remember a bit, but I'm fairly certain that she has some experience with sexual affairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You jot it down. \"Anything else?\" There's a long pause as you think of anything you missed. Finally it comes to you; but it's not a new body, no, it's something else entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you have Mia speak up. \"If you can possess girls from anime, and you possessed me, which means you can also take over real life girls, couldn't you possess girls from other mediums? Like, say, video games?\" Your bodies glance at each other in surprise, as if they hadn't thought of it before. Truthfully, you had thought it through and approved of it the moment it entered your mind, but it's fun to stay in character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's worth a shot,\" you have your dupe body say. As Mia, you beam happily.</span></div></div>",

Not only that, but you've realized that the longer you go without taking a new host, the stronger and more intense the urge becomes, and it is only sated by the possession of a new one. Luckily, your recent domination of Gemini and Angel have suppressed your impulses. however, you are hopeful that if you could take over a score or two of girls, you could extinguish this for craving for at least a week. In order to achieve that, you would need a whole lot of anime to choose from, especially if you  wanted bodies that could more than hold their own in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you've also got Wendy and Virgo with two other laptops that you definitely <i>didn't </i> take from your sisters' rooms, and with three bodies you're searching for new recruits to your little \"association,\" from various anime, which you have divided into three sets of five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira's laptop--the first set--contains a single episode of the original <i>Tenchi Muyo!</i>, <i>Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid</i>, <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</i>, Ah!

The other series in the set don't particularly interest you but Fullmetal Alchemist is full of lovely ladies that you can take.  And while Brotherhood is the only series on the computer right now, having your \"guests\" download the first anime series while you're gathering girls from Brotherhood shouldn't be a problem at all; after all, there are a few girls exclusive to the first series that you wouldn't mind taking in addition to the ones from Brotherhood.  Get the FMA girls and then move on to another series in a different group, or perhaps one you haven't thought of yet, or cartoons or video games... the possibilities are endless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Virgo.\" you say, continuing when she looks up at you.  \"I'm going into Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for some new recruits so while I'm in there I want you to download the first FMA anime series, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Mira.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and then concentrating, you exit Mirajane's body but make sure to leave a piece inside of her to control her.  Concentrating again, you feel yourself blacking out.  Soon after, you come to in a large and bustling city that looks very similar to World War I era Europe.  You're a goo again and you quickly scurry along the ground, looking for someone, anyone, you recognize from the show.  You come across a building and slip under the door and continue moving.  You hear a female voice and look up, seeing a character that you vaguely recognize from the show.  They're alone and acting quickly you shoot up, launching yourself into their nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so you come to.  You can feel a weight on your chest and that tells you that you're definite a woman now, however you're also wearing a military uniform and your hair doesn't feel long at all.  You look around and notice that you're in a small apartment.  Searching, you eventually find a bathroom and enter it.  With the mirror, you're greeted by someone who looks very boyish, however you know very well that it's a woman despite the short, black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Second Lieutenant Maria Ross.  Well this is a boon, you think, as Ross' position as protector of Edward Elric gets you close to Winry Rockbell and potentially Izumi Curtis.  And as a military officer, you're now close to Sheska and Riza Hawkeye as well and perhaps Maes Hughes' lovely wife Gracia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your chest and are surprised to find that it's actually bigger than you thought.  You suppose that, given that she wears a military uniform most of the time it covers up the fact that Maria Ross is actually fairly well-endowed.  \"Well this isn't gonna do.\" you say to yourself grinning, \"Let's let these bad boys out and take a good look.\"  You begin raising your hands to remove the jacket but suddenly stop.  Are you really Maria Ross, you wonder?  After all, Maria's most famous moment in the series came when she wasn't even there: the homunculus known as Envy had assumed her identity, framing her for the murder of Maes Hughes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might mean nothing but now you're curious.  Are you really Maria or are you actually Envy having assumed her form for some nasty reason.  Can you even possess a shapeshifter like Envy?  Maybe, if they've turned into a girl.  After all, you did possess Gemini.  You decide that it's best to take a quick look through the memories of the person you now inhabit in order to get an answer.</span></div></div>",

Another flash and you're Winry, another and you're Riza Hawkeye.

You suddenly black out and awaken in a graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where am I?' You wonder as you try to stand, but find that you can't, but that you can still move around. Suddenly someone walks up by you, someone very familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Moka?!' You think to yourself in surprise. You shake a little, and she appears to feel your liquid self move around her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Moka wonders out loud, bending down to try to get a look at what to her appears as a puddle, but since felt you move, she knows that something is off. She leans in farther and she puts her hand into the puddle to see if she can feel if anything is different. You suddenly feel a very strong urge and shoot up Moka\u2019s arm and make your way into her mouth, she is too surprised to scream, and by the time she can get her bearings, you're all the way inside of her body. Moka mutters a small murmur before collapsing into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTskune... \" Moka says with her last breath before passing out. You black out, but quickly awaken to see that you are now controlling Moka. As you start to get up, you feel as though you are now in control of two girls, though you don\u2019t know why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder what I\u2019m forgetting\u2026' You think for a moment before suddenly you hear a loud bell ring. \u201cOh crap! Moka's... I mean, I'm late for school!\u201d You run off towards the school, and as you make it you find\u2026</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes and before you stands a small boy about the age of five or six. On his face was blood as if he had just ripped out a chunk of meat from a cow kind of like what a T-rex does to it's prey. The boy's eyes where completely pitch white and suddenly you were stricken with a cold fear. It was as if something was compelling you to run away yet you didn't know what it was, let's just say it was instinct for now and leave it at that. You back up and bump into someone, a brown haired teenager who was in a very familiar outfit but you couldn't put where, he was also carrying a shot gun by the look of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What's wrong Saeko? There just like the rest of them\" as he spoke he spoke as in what you believed to be Japanese. You didn't know why but you understood him perfectly as if it was your native language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what are those things\" you asked once more not realizing the sound of your own voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit messing around and kill them Saeko\" yelled the boy as he shot off a round at one of the monsters. Suddenly a realization hit \"Did you just call me Saeko\" you asked as you begin to realize your voice? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saeko watch out\" the teenager cried but to late as suddenly one of the monsters bit into your shoulder and ripped out a chunk of flesh much to your agony. You felt pain and then began to feel numb in that spot as if you were dying yet some how you regained feeling in that area as it began to regenerate. You watched as the wounded area regenerated showing you a brand new shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing\" you say in shock then grip your fist in rage as you allow the person who you unknowingly posses to take control figuring to allow this person to deal with what was happening. You saw as if by a third person view from the fountain behind you as the woman smashed the monsters face in. She then grabbed what looked like a kido stick you saw in various animes which was hanging by her side and she smiled sadistic as she began to crush the other monsters heads in. Soon most of the monsters were wiped out leaving the woman with minimal cuts or scraps the only thing that remained was a bite mark on her left leg that was quickly healing as if by magic or by some strange ability. You suddenly then saw the woman faint and rushed towards her with incredible speed and caught her. The teenager before you was in as much shock as you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...? Who the hell or what the hell are you\" the teenager asked reading his shotgun? Surprisingly you could understand him even though you weren't in control of the woman's body. You than spoke in the same language as the teen before you to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you are right now but please just let me go! Don't worry I'll protect her so long as I am alive!\" the teen didn't know what to say as you make your get away with almost as much speed as before though this time you felt different as you had feet. You soon realize as you turn the corner what just happened and begin to recall only a short while ago before you awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Flash back to a bit before awakening***<br>\r\nYou had just gotten home and sighed wishing that something exciting would happen since you were kind of sick of boring normal everyday life. You did what you usually do when you feel like this and went to your room, search the internet for something interesting and ended up watch a anime called High school of the dead for about a hour or so until you ended up falling asleep during episode nine which feature Saeko (the girl who you must have possessed in your sleep and the very one you are carrying) and the main hero of the series Takashi having been cut off from the rest of the group forcing them to have to find a way around to Takashi's friend Saya's house. You must have somehow entered the anime via the computer and possessed Saeko through some means. This brought you up to date.<br>\r\n***End Flash Back***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now that that's settled how the heck do I get out of here\" you asked yourself in your own native language. Saeko begins to awaken slightly and points you towards the left which you happily do and end up finding a safe place to hide out from the monsters. \"Seako are you alright\" you asked her in Japanese unaware that you had unlocked her ability to speak English? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..yes I'm alright\" Seako spoke in perfect English to your amazement. You guess that was something that your power allowed her to do you guessed or maybe it just unlocked it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good well how's about standing? Can you stand up\" you asked as she climbed off your back. She stood on her feet for a moment but then began to fall but luckily you caught her. \"Are you alright\" you asked worried that she might be injured? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'll be fine once I heal a bit more just carry me til then okay Anthony\" Saeko said regretfully hating to be a nuisances. You helped her back onto your back and then heard a loud roar. You turn to see...</span></div></div>",

You remembered that this guys were attracted to sound so you tried not to make any noise hoping to simply bypass them but suddenly one of the zombies bumped a car and the car alarm began to go off signaling the zombies to attack what ever was around them, the car, the stone concrete wall a little ways besides them, and of course...you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap\" you say under breath fearing for your life and then Saeko forces her way off of your back and stands shakily before you with her kido stick in hand ready to defend you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony I'll hold them off while you get to safety ok-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Saeko\" you shout back and push her behind you like that of a would be hero. You feel a strange urge begin to erupt inside of you and suddenly you transform into a odd water like substance and then begin to make your way towards the crowd of zombies. Suddenly you split up into multiple water blobs and they all make their way towards oddly enough a female zombie. They force their way into the female zombies threw any opening be it a mouth, a wound on their body or their vagina. Suddenly you feel as if you were almost completely numb but saw threw eye like your normal ones. Unknown to you the zombie girls who you now possessed 's eyes had rolled back into place showing eye color on their irises but nothing more. They still looked like soulless monstrosities from the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony are you alright\" Saeko asked concerned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*moan* I..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am...*moan*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*moan* ..alright\" you moan simultaneously throughout all of your current bodies minus Saeko who remained normal. You suddenly then felt a odd craving for something rather revolting and disgusting, \"Flesh...\" one body moaned but you forced it to think of the non-living variety I.E. turning it into a zombie eater. You made sure to sever the mind link from those bodies as you wished not to taste what they were experiencing preferring to remain as human as possible be it in a zombie's body or not. Soon your zombie slaves had manged to devour all of the remaining zombies minus a few who you simply missed. As soon as this was done you wanted out of this body and suddenly you exited the current body you were inhabitating though you left a piece inside this once that way it wouldn't try and eat you on your reformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony how are you feeling\" Saeko asked concerned like before though this time she managed to run up to you and ask you in person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright but what do I do with these things\" you asked looking at your four zombie slaves? Saeko looked at you with a small grin then spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have them relay a message to Takashi and the others...\" she then whispered the message into your ear then told your minions to play messenger. All of them followed your will like well mindless zombies and rushed off towards Saya's house. Soon you and Saeko were alone as you began to think of a way to get out of here not just the zombie infected place but the anime itself. Soon as if on instinct you suddenly knew how to exit the world and simply concentrated then in the blink of a eye you and Saeko disappeared from this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere your zombie minions had arrived at what they knew to be their master's friend's house. There were multiple zombies all around and too many for them to get threw and relay their message. The leader of the three zombies smiled the best she could and then looked over to find a broken police car. The two followed her lead and then loaded up on on built proof armor as well as now began to wear helmets as they knew their own weakness to head shots. The leader of the three who used to be know as a girl from a high school called Yumi, now had a loaded revolver with two packs of ammo on a ammo belt she picked off one of the dead cops' bodies. She and the other two who turned out to be twins named Nia and Nina proceeded towards the hoard of undead then opened fire makign sure to make enough noise for them to be noticed yet not enough to attract any more zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look at that\" called a guard from inside \"Some of the zombies have begun to kill their own and...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what Satoshi? Spit it out\" shouted his superior!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem to be using weapons from a that destroid police van from outside the gates\" the man replied to both his own shock as well as anyone else listening on the radio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" a young teenage high school student said in shock from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be possible they're too far gone to remember anything from their pasts\" a girl in a school uniform with long orange hair said in shock to a teen with brown hair who you remembered was Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it is Rei but...\" the teen readied his trusty shotgun and then headed out towards the front gate \"...I intend to find out!\" Takashi jumped from the railing and rushed towards the gate as he saw several people retreating for safety. \"Dam it there's too much chaos for my to get a good shot\" Takashi groans in anger as he aimed for a zombie who was trying to get in but before he could one of the three zombies with guns appeared and kill it. She then looked at Takashi and gave a small wave which Takashi found extremely strange and odd. She then smiled and pointed her finger towards him and began to tell him with her hand to come closer. Takashi regretfully got closer and to his surprise the zombie girl spoke though it was a mix of small moans and actual human language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Moan*...You're Takashi correct\" the zombie girl asked to Takashi's amazement?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah I am who are you\" Takashi asked still having his hand on his shotgun just encase something were to go bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is of no importance other than we are those that follow a master of greater power than one of any human of this world possess. He managed to create us out of mindless shells that you call zombies and allowed us to restart our existence. We are her to deliver a message from miss Saeko-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saeko!? What have you bastards done with her\" Takashi yelled angrily about the possible loss of his friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Moan* Calm down! Saeko gave this message to us personally so don't worry\" the zombie girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but two things are still wrong. 1. Why are you talking aren't you suppose to be dead and brainless? And 2. how are you even able to be move like a normal human\" Takashi asked rather curiously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well one...our master gave us somethign special that allows us to be more than simple flesh eaters...mmm flesh\" the zombie girl suddenly began to drool as she flashed back to the taste of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... you're drooling Zombie-sama\" Takashi said and the zombie girl quickly snapped out of her daze then wiped the drool off of her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that I'm still not completely recovered\" the zombie girl laughed the continued to speka in a more serious tone \"Saeko says that she is fine and well and will be with master Anthony until she figures away to thank him for saving her from well these other guys *giggles*\" the zombie girl then smiled and did a back flip onto a stone wall as if she was a gymnastics student when she was alive though with out the limitation of pain she could do a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bye Takashi and tell Rei that Yumi says hi\" then the zombie girls were gone, leaving Takashi at the gates rather stunned and a little bit mind boggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in your room...</span></div></div>",

You watch her sleeping peacefully on your bed and remember what hard ship she had faced during the course of what you saw as nine episodes but to her it must have been like a week or at least a good few days. Either way it was long and hard for her perverted jokes aside. You decided to grab a snack while Saeko rested and soon returned to your room with a few candy bars in hand. You suddnely then felt some odd feeling as if someone was tryign to tell you somethign when you remembered the three girls from before and decided to bring them into your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few moments before three zombie girls now stood before you though they looked a lot better than you remembered as their flesh had been compleatly restored though they still were covered in blood and had skin like zombies.

You also modified thier vocal cords so that they could speak english as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah much better\" cheered Yumi happ[y that she was no longer a walkign people eater. She walked up to Anthony and hugged him excited and happy that she was the salcve of such a nice and carign master. The other girls were not as cheer. The black haired one whose name you now knew as Millie simply was shy as she was afriad that you might turn her back or get rid of her (not that you'd ever be that cruel of course).

It was large enough esecially the tub, (your crazy dad thought it was cool to replace the tub with a hot tub figuring that it would be a bit more fun to bathe. You figured he was crazy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom the two girls strip right before you though you avert your eyes as not to be called a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already\" Yumi called and soon you turned around to see that both of them were naked, you got a small nose bleed dude to the steam coming fro mthe tub as when you got here Yumi turned it on hot water first. \"I figured you had some blood on you\" Yumi smiled and then climbed into the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \"...\"</span></div></div>",

Maka then lifts up the water bottle and begins to drink it. You can't even react before everything goes black. A few moments later, you wake up, scratching your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You wonder, still dizzy from the possession. You notice that you voice has changed. It is not the deep male voice you've developed from puberty, no it is the voice of a fifteen year old girl, and not just any girl, this voice sounds like the girl you just watched a few moments ago. You look down to see the body you are in is fairly petite. You touch your cheek, and feel the soft skin that is on what is now your face. You look down to see the outfit you are wearing; it is a typical schoolgirl outfit and a trench coat with a cloak-like end, a white blouse with a yellow sweater vest, a red plaid skirt, and black boots with white buckles. You notice you hair has become ash blonde and is in pigtails. \"Maka, you ok?\" Tsubaki asks, looking concerned that you kept scanning yourself.

Her eyes rested upon her best friend Maka, who seemed to be scanning herself with her hands. Tsubaki asked Maka if she was OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-present time-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Tsubaki.\" You respond, trying to stay in character to keep Tsubaki from suspecting anything as you start pulling things out of Maka's bag, and placing them neatly on her desk. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thank you.\" Tsubaki replies. \"By the way, what were you doing just a minute ago, did you lose something?\" She asks wondering why her friend was moving her hands around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at Tsubaki and answer 'Yeah, I was, but I'm fine now, have you finished your assignment yet?' You ask, scanning Maka's memories, and found out they had an assignment, and you know Tsubaki isn't finished. You know you can use this to get Tsubaki's body as well, but first you have to get her to come to Maka's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki stops sorting her pens and highlighters, and looks at her friend in disbelief. \"It's not due for another week!\" She sits down. \"Don't tell me you've already finished!\" You shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I can do another proof read. You nod to yourself, as if this is a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so jealous.\" Tsubaki says with a little sigh. \"I've done all the reading for it, but I haven't even started writing yet.\" She stares gloomily at her books. \"I just can't get my head around some of the ideas.\"<br>\r\nYou pat her back in sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not a big deal, why don't I help you?\" You grin encouragingly. 'This is perfect.' You think, knowing this is the opening you have been hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't have to.\" Tsubaki sulks. You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I don't have to, but I want to help you.\" You say to Tsubaki. Tsubaki looks up at her friend. Your green eyes suddenly become wide with mock excitement. \"I have the best idea! Why don't we have a study session tonight at my place!\" You exclaim. \"I'll make dinner, and you can sleep over, it'll be loads of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist your infectious enthusiasm, Tsubaki laughs and says \"Ok, and I'll bring something for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" You say. Tsubaki nods and laughs as you start going over the finer details of preparation for that night. The class's teacher, Dr. Stein, then rolls into the lecture theater on his office chair, only to crash as its wheels caught on the tiny ledge in the doorway. You whisper \"You'd think someone so smart would learn from his mistakes by now.\" You don't actually care about this, but you need to pass the time, so a conversation won't hurt. Tsubaki nods in agreement as she laughs quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class starts, and you busy yourself with taking notes, trying to imitate Maka, which isn't that hard since you can access her mind, allowing you to act like her. Tsubaki did the do the same thing, still excited about the sleepover. Class finished early because Dr. Stein had some important experiment he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lets go shopping for dinner, then go to my place!\" You say, cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should go back to my place and get my pajamas and a change of clothes.\" Tsubaki replies as she goes to her house. An hour later, she is in front of Maka's apartment door. You got ingredients for creamy chicken pasta, and a store bought strawberry cheesecake, and have put them in the fridge. Tsubaki knocks, and you open the door to let her into the small, but cozy, apartment that is now yours. You are thinking that you are a better actor, or now actress, than you thought before since you have imitated your host without arousing suspicion from anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should we study in the living room?\" Tsubaki asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" You say as you get two cans of juice out of the fridge, and go into the living room. You hand one to Tsubaki, having put some of yourself inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Tsubaki says with a smile. You smile back as she settles down at the coffee table. \"Alright, let's get started.\" An hour and a half later, Tsubaki is astonished at how good a teacher you are. You are very patient, and explain things so clearly that Tsubaki now has a firm grasp on everything she needs to write her assignment. This is tiresome, but Tsubaki continues on. \"You are good at this.\" Tsubaki says. You laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I just study hard.\" Knowing that Tsubaki didn't know how right she is, since you are still doing a good job of pretending to be Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you really are good at this,' Tsubaki says, firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You say with a smile. You decide to take a drink, wondering when Tsubaki will drink the part of you in the juice. \"Should we start dinner?\" You ask, getting up from the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm starting to get a bit hungry.\" Tsubaki says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm going to start cooking.\" You say. You soon have lunch made, and you bring it out to the table, which Tsubaki had set while you were cooking. \"Alright, let's eat!\" After dinner, the two of you decide to watch TV on the couch and eat strawberry cheesecake. \"That was a good meal.\" You say as you return from the kitchen with another slice of cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Tsubaki giggles she licks the end of her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should do this more often.\" You say.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Tsubaki nods, eyes on the TV. She finally begins drinking her juice, and just like that, you are finally in control of Tsubaki.</span></div></div>",

You see the pale, luminescent orb that is Tsubaki\u2019s soul, complete with long tail. Everything seems to be normal, except... you squint Maka\u2019s eyes -as Tsubaki, you almost flinch under your own intense gaze- It almost seems like there\u2019s something surrounding the weapon\u2019s soul: an almost imperceptible layer just above her soul, almost like a witch\u2019s Soul Protect, except there\u2019s nothing to disguise. Both you and Maka\u2019s mind, provided with information of your abilities, deduce that this is the soul of your real body. Lucky for you, you can barely see it, and you\u2019re almost certain that no one -even Professor Stein- would notice it unless they were looking for it. As Maka, you blink, disengaging your Soul Perception, and grin at your also-possessed friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look normal, Tsubaki.\u201d As if she doesn\u2019t already know. Tsubaki just smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You smile and wave goodbye, then proceed to your room, which you find in a wreck for some reason. You are in shock as everything is all over the place and frankly it makes you kind of pissed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would do this to my stuff!\" You think as you get a camra and take a picture, then begin to clean up. As you do, you find a note taped to your television, it is from your witch of a sister Sarah. The note read <i>\"Hope you enjoy cleaning up your room &gt;<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*Bigsmile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Bigsmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> This'll teach you not to make fun of me and my friends!\"</i> You crumple up the note and then punched your wall because this time your sister had gone too far and for what just saying that her friends were mindless trend followers. This is bull shit! You throw the note on your bed to give to absolute proof of what happened, thankful that Sarah isn't much starter than her friends, making it so you could always easily prove that she did the stuff that she does, so she always pays for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half hour of cleaning up, you have managed to pick up your room, and even start to watch an anime called Soul Eater, which you had heard from a friend to check out. You shrug as you begin to watch the first episode, and then begin to fall asleep for some odd reason. I guess cleaning up your room really took it out of you. You yawn and rest your head on a pillow, then pass out, forgetting to turn the television off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know is that you are suddenly are inside a strange house, and not only that, but you are, in fact, what seems to be a bubble bath. You feel relaxed as if you are one with the bubbling water, and mentally sigh, not realizing what has happened to you. You simply feel calm and relaxed as if you are surrounded by something warm and inviting. You then take note of your surroundings, only to see that you have a full 360 degree angle view of the whole area around you like some strange blob creature. You are about to freak out and thrash around, but your instincts tell you to keep your cool and then suddenly you feel yourself move, but not with your control. You then notice someone's arm reach out from under the water, as if not realizing you are there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah this bath feels soooooooooooo good!\" A charming female voice yawns as another arm rises out of the water. You notice that the girl\u2019s fingernails are painted purple. which you find familiar, though you don't know why. Finally, you feel as if you are being sucked up like that of sucking water up from a lake with your mouth. You don't know what to do but freak out, but what can you do but simply let it happen. You feel a part of your 'body' being sucked in by whatever was sucking you in, and then it casually spits you out so that you are shot into the air like a geyser. then fall back into the bath like rain. After that, a head finally pokes its top half out of the water, revealing a girl's enchanting yellow eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh I guess I'll get out now.\" The girl says as she begins to rise up from the bath, revealing her rather large breasts. You mentally blush, and then, when the girl gets a foot out of the bath, you suddenly feel a strange urge, and before you know it, you have shot out of the water and straight into the woman's soaking wet vagina. \"What the heck? Did something just go into me.\" The girl wonders, before she suddenly begins to lose consciousness, and gently falls back into the bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh what happened?\" You groan as if you haven't slept in a week as you rise up from the bath, though this time you have a body. \"And why does my voice sound so differ-\" before you finish what you are saying, you notice your new breasts, and also your purple hair that is soaked to the brim with bath water. \"Oh my! I've got boobs and long hair!\" You gasp in shock, then after a minute of putting together the whole fact that you have somehow become a girl. you get out of the bath tub and towel up as a cool breeze is beginning to blow. You then close the window, and then slide down to the floor and sit besides the now shut window. \"SO... what do you do now Anthony?\" You ask yourself, still getting used to your new voice. You begin to think up what to do, but when you do, a sudden bolt of lightning goes thru your mind. You realize that you have gained the power of possession, and that this girl you are possessing is Blair from the Soul Eater series that you had been watching before you had that odd nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and shrug. \"I guess I can live with being a girl for now, at least I'm a hot one.\" You say with a bit of a perverted thought going through your head. \"Although I'll have to figure out how to turn back to normal eventually.\" You chuckle, and then smile lustfully before removing the towel, and casually move your fingers towards your now dried off pussy. You simply touch the lip of your vagina, and suddenly a rush of pleasure goes throughout your body. This girl you are possessing must be really sensitive near your/her vagina. You then notice that your nipples are now rock hard, and you smile wider with even more lust as more perverted thoughts creep into your mind. \"Heh I would love to do this girl with my normal body, but oh well, I guess masturbating is fine.\" You casually shrug then begin to finger your pussy rapidly before suddenly orgasming. \"That was*gasp* fast!\" you gasp, out of breath, before moving onto your boobs. You put one up to your face and begin to suck on its nipple while pinching the other. You are entranced by pleasure and can't believe the amount of it that you\u2019re experiencing. You can't believe it as you orgasm for a second time but as you do you end up passing out due to the overflow of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awaken...</span></div></div>",

You yawn once more as you stand up and put on Blair's clothes, which are right outside the door. You smile as you are now wearing clothes that you realize are relatively sexy. You walk outside, and smile at the sight of the city as it gives off a strange, yet inviting luster to it. You smile as you begin to walk towards it, when suddenly you notice something strange out of the corner of your eye, a girl with blond hair, in a black coat, caring around a black and red scythe, which it itself is odd. It even has an eye on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! There she is!\" The blond haired girl, who you realize is Moka charges straight for you. You begin to panic, but take a deep breath and begin to think of if there is some way you could retaliate or defend yourself, when suddenly, something strange occurs. It is like a strange sound, though it is as if it comes from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smashing Pumpkin...\" Then, as you say the phrase, all around you a strange shape begins to form, it soon grows and becomes something sort of like a would be force field, but then suddenly, as the girl sliced at the wall, it detonated, causing a massive explosion sending you flying backwards as well as the girl. You smash through a few trees, before you finally stop, and groan in pain as you get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smarts.\" You groan and look yourself over, surprisingly enough, you are fine, minus being a bit dirty. You turn around to examine yourself, and suddenly you hear and feel something touch the tree behind you. It was a large branch of a tree and it was imbedded into your back, specifically right in the center of your spine. You close your eyes and take a deep breath, pretending that it isn't there, but yet, when you open your eyes, it's still there, plain as day. You sigh, and place one hand on the branch, and then pull on it slightly, it hurts like hell, and that was just a small tug.<br>\r\nYou shut your mouth, and bit your lip as you this time try to pull out the branch from your spine as waves of surging pain shoot throughout your body screaming for you to stop. As you do this, your body oddly starts to heal. Finally, you manage to remove the tree branch from your back as you gasp for breath, and then scream out in pain having bit so far into you lip it became sliced open.<br>\r\nSoon after your loud yell, you gasp for breath, and then realize that you are still breathing, even though the branch surely would\u2019ve breached your lung from the angle it entered your back. This intrigues you, yet you shake it off, and then proceed back towards \u2018your\u2019 house, only to find Maka out cold, and her scythe on the ground, with its eye closed, as if asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and pick up Maka. You put her over your shoulder, and then look over and grab her scythe, figuring that you\u2019d be nice, and in return, they wouldn\u2019t try and kill you again. You walk over to the door of your house to find that your house was actually that of a large pumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I guess I really do live in a fairy tale world.\u201d You joke, and then walked inside. You carefully place Maka on the couch, cover her up in a blanket, and gently put a pillow under her head. She seems to snuggle right up, and then drift off. You smile, and then walk back to your room, scythe in hand. You decide to place the weapon in your room, and then after setting it in the corner, you decide to take a nap as that fight was rather tiring. You yawn and soon fall asleep on you lush bed, not bothering to cover up or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon a few hours later, at sun rise, you awaken once more to find that the scythe that was originally left in the corner is now gone. In its place is that of a young teenager with white hair wearing a yellow and black jacket and red pants. You walk over to him to see if he was alright to find that he is out cold, and you decide to lift him up, and carry him outside, only for him to begin to stir upon you helping him stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Maka? What happened.\u201d The teen asked, thinking you were most likely Maka, though you don\u2019t know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your friend is down stairs.\u201d You say happily and the boy nods still half out of it. You escort him down stairs to the living room, where you find the blond girl just waking up. She begins to stretch and groan, clearly hurt. \u201cOh my, I hope you are alright.\u201d You say concerned as you and the boy walk over to her. You then get an idea, and reach into your pocket to find a strange little blue piece of candy. You don\u2019t know why but you feel you should give this to Maka and somehow it would make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, take this, it should fix you up as good as new.\u201d Maka looks at you and rubs her eyes most likely half asleep, just like the boy beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026oh, thank you.\u201d The girl says as you hand the piece of candy to her. She quickly downs it and then ask you for a glass of water. You turn around to find a kitchen like area, and soon grab a glass, before turning on the sink. You hear the two walk up behind you. You turn around and smile after filling the glass with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go.\u201d You say as you hand the glass to the girl and she thanks you before downing the water. The girl wipes her mouth then tells the boy that they have to be leaving, and soon they leave as you wave to them goodbye. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger and come back any time you want.\u201d You say, waving, to which the two wave back, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess I should maybe try and find a way out of this place. Hmm what should I do?\u201d You asked yourself as you lean against the wall of your house? Suddenly, you begin to feel sleepy once more (Boy is this getting old &gt;_&lt;) and soon pass out only to reawaken\u2026</span></div></div>",

She asks you to come with her to the arcade, and a little bit later, you are walking through the park on the way to the arcade with Jill, talking to her while doing so. She never really had the perfect body, but you still like her more than you care to tell her, and she does have the best body in your classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are speaking to her, and think of her breasts. A usual thought, but you are wondering more about how she keeps them in place without moving due to their size, which is unusual. You suddenly gets a strange urge, and want her body to be yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you listening to me, Anthony?\" She asks, seeing as you appear to have zoned out. You don't have time to answer as you feel yourself shrink, form into a fluid, and go inside her. You black out, but when you come to, your body feels wierd. You feel off balance, with a weight on your chest, a breeze between your legs, something around your neck, and an emptiness where your penis should be. You look down to see breasts covered by a blue shirt, a dark blue skirt that can easily be mistaken for black with how dark it is, a blue purse, and blue sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" You begin, before your hands go to your mouth, as that wasn't your voice, in fact, it sounds like Jill's. You then notice that your arms are more slender. By this time, you have realized what has happened, but you just can't believe it, as it shouldn't be possible. You turn around and try to run back to Jill's house to find a mirror. You trip, however, because of being off balance, and skin your knee. You feel pain for a moment, before your knee suddenly heals. You are in shock by that. You get up, and slowly walk to Jill's house. You have a hard time adjusting, but you eventually get the hang of it, and eventually, you can walk without problem in this female body, but you still can't run. You arrive at Jill's house, search for her key in her purse where she put it, then pull it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then unlock the door and go inside. You go to a mirror, and look in, finding what you've been suspecting, you are now in Jill's body! You try to come out of her body, but some of you remains in her. However, that's how you wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been wondering something.... You make her breasts larger by pushing your liquid form into them. You begin to feel horny, and you begin to have Jill's body masturbate. You can feel the orgasms, even while your main part is your own body, due to you having the bodies still connected. You have been a virgin for 16 years, and have always wondered what sex is like. You decide that now's your chance. You look around her room and find a condom, and are about to insert it into her, before learning that your abilities can prevent her from getting pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly and forcefully shove your penis into Jill's vagina, wincing as you feel a pain in her vagina as you take her virginity. Once her body's pain has subsided, and her vagina is used to the feeling of your penis in her, you begin thrusting in and out of her. You realize you're feeling double the pleasure, and have fun with this. Your sexual tension lasts 4 hours without interruption, ending with you making Jill's breasts' nipples pop out of her shirt, and with your body sucking on one, while you have her body doing the same to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

You rest Jill's head against your chest, and have her sigh in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you haven't learned about your powers is that if you remain outside of a female body for two long, you'll get the urge to enter a girl, like what caused you to possess Jill in the first place. As your bodies drift off, the urge comes back. Seeing as you want to sleep like this with Jill so much, and part of you is inside her anyway, your body doesn't liquify and flow into her, but some of your liquid self separates, splits apart, and all of the pieces go after more girls subconsciously. While this will slow down the urge, it won't get rid of it due to part of you being outside a female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens from here?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Let's take a look at some things, we've got a teenage boy who is not only in his own body, but in the body of a teenage girl he likes, who is attracted to him as well, and he can access her memories and personality, then there's the fact that he shares senses between the two bodies, both of which were feeling extremely horny before having sex, with the boy feeling the sensations and pleasure from both bodies at the same time with a quick recovery, and with the boy close to running on base instinct due to an urge from a power he has yet to fully understand. What do you get at that point? The pleasure from both bodies cycling through each other on a loop, making it hard for him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is shown quite well, as despite going at it for four hours, you are unable to keep either set of hands off of the other body for any real length of time after stopping, with both bodies just trying to get as much pleasure in their hazy perception as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw Jill's body on top of her bed on her back, by this time having both bodies completely stripped naked, and plow your penis right into her vagina, getting a moan of pleasure, and begin kneading her breasts and massaging her tits to erection as you run her hands all over your torso, and nibbling down on your neck, as both bodies are thrusting, again and again. You eventually feel a build-up in your penis, and you wrap Jill's legs around your waist, locking you in as you blast your load inside of her, causing dual screams of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill aroused to the point of madness, you don't stop for a moment as you have Jill's body stand up, and then press herself against a wall, squishing her breasts a little, and then press her hands against the wall, before ramming your penis straight into her butt. This causes a new wave of pain, but you instantly pull her back a little so that you can begin kneading her breasts again and nibbling on the back of her neck, causing you to let out a moan through her. You wait until her body adjusts to the intrusion before you have her bend over, hands braced against the wall, and start ramming your penis into her repeatedly, causing her body to begin crying out in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon unloading again and pulling out, you have Jill's body stand up, spin around, and push your body onto the bed, before getting on, straddling your own body with hers, before lifting up, and slamming down, crotch first, on your penis, and begin bouncing up and down, with her breasts bouncing too, occasionally hitting you in Jill's face. Upon the next unloading, you remove your vagina from your penis, and readjust your bodies, with your penis in Jill's face, and your vagina in your original face, you go to town, taking all of your penis into Jill's mouth, giving yourself a blowjob, as you begin eating your female body out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you're so lost in pleasure, that you can only think of increasing it, so you come to a simple decision.  \"Must... have... more... girls...\" You moan through both bodies, although with your mouths full, you aren't able to do more than stimulate your penis and vagina, causing you to increase your paces on both. You separate part of yourself without thinking about it, and break it into three parts, which head to places you know girls are at, one going towards the local pool, as Anna and Rose are swimming there at the moment, although your stepmother will arriving to pick them up shortly, after having picked up Megan, with Rose staying the night, one going towards your house, and the remaining one goes towards Katherine's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat part do you focus on? Note, Andy is staying the night at a friend's house, and your dad has gone out for his military training, leaving no other male at the house. Also, by the time you come to your senses, all of the girls staying at your house will have been possessed.</span></div></div>",

You lean up and groan as you wipe the blood from your fore head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw that really hurt\u201d you groan before the mechanical monstrosity takes another shot at you, only this time before it can, you manage to get to your feet and run away. \u2018Got to run, got to run, got to run\u2019 over and over again your mind screamed at you to run away, escape, get the hell out of there, ext\u2026 but every where you turned more of those same machines appeared to block your path. Soon you are surrounded and there is no longer a way for you to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to die! Leave me alone\u201d you scream, shielding yourself with your arms as the machines charge at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happens and the sudden sound of metal clashing against metal pierces your ears, causing you to flash your eyes open. To your surprise you were surrounded, not by machines, but humans\u2026 well human like beings called Homs, the only real difference between humans and homs is that homs require Ether which is an abundant resource in this world. There were three of them, all of them you recognized but right now you couldn\u2019t really place where you remembered them from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the female hom asked who was garbed in a strange outfit that looked unsuited for even a small fight, let alone the all out war that was going on at this very moment. You nod and lower your guard, noticing a faint urge that begins to tug at the back of your brain, however you ignore it as another hom speaks, this one, garbed in red and had blond hair and carried a strange sword that looked like it was made from scrap metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up and get to safety\u201d the blond hom explains and you nod, covering your head as you runaway towards what was known as the Residential District, which would soon be the key location of a very critical and horrible event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dart past the machine entities known as Mechon and dart for a house, narrowly avoiding a blast from a huge mechon that flew by that resembled something like a black jet if it was on steroids and left a slim trace of blue fire as it flew through the air, as you roll inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa that can\u2019t be\u2026Metal Face?\u201d you gasp in astonishment as your memory finally has a chance to returns to you which is when you realize \u201cI\u2019m in Colony 9! Which means this is the Residential District!\u201d You slightly open the door and that\u2019s all the reminder you needed. Yep this was indeed Colony 9 from that Xenoblade game you picked up a few days ago. How and why you were here came to mind but that was quickly overshadowed by this strange urge that you had noticed before but no it clearly was noticeable. It was like something was pulling at your hair but without the pain, just the sensation made you feel a bit freaked out. However the second Metal Face came whizzing by you immediately slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew that was close\u201d you sigh before suddenly hearing a loud crash outside the door, you look outside just in time to see Metal Face pick up a strange robot vehicle, this vehicle looked very different from the green and black mechon, for one it was all one color, a pale grey and for two, someone was in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u201d you hear a familiar scream pierce your ears as Metal Face throws the mech in your directions causing you to barrel out of the house and into a nearby alleyway. Metal face looks back and begins walking over towards the mech which is when you realize what was about to happen. You may have only been playing this game for a good five hours and only about an hour of those five hours were story related but you knew what was going to happen.<br>\r\n\u2018Fiora\u2019s gonna die and I can\u2019t do anything about it! Ah! And this annoying urge isn\u2019t helping!\u2019 you watch as Metal Face draws closer and closer towards the unconscious Fiora in the damaged mech. \u2018Only a 5 yards away! Only 5 yards away before Metal Face kills Fiora!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah! What the heck is wrong with me? It\u2019s like this urge is trying to take me over. Gah\u201d you grip your head but the urge doesn\u2019t go away. You look back up as Metal Face as Metal Face closes the gap between him and Fiora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSCREW IT\u201d you scream bolting forward, unaware as your body begins to turn into liquid. You didn\u2019t care rather you wouldn\u2019t because all that mattered right now was saving Fiora!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot forward just as you arrive at the cockpit and dive into Fiora\u2019s mouth, fully liquefied, as Metal Face weaves back his arms back ready to land the killing blow. You quickly flash your new eyes open, finding you are now Fiora for some strange reason but just as you look up Metal Face stabs you with his massive claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an ear splitting scream as the pain shoots through your body, like a thousand hypodermic needles piercing every one of your nerves at once. You look down for a moment and see as a river of blood pours out of you and onto Metal face\u2019s claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can almost hear the metal monstrosity laugh as it pulls its claw free and casts you aside like a piece of garbage, which is when you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt cold, colder than you\u2019ve ever felt before, even colder than that time when you were locked outside your house in the middle of a blizzard. You felt like you were dying and couldn\u2019t help but scream which is when you flashed your eyes open to see that you were surrounded by darkness. Panic struck you like a ton of bricks and you began to thrash around only to find you were confined! Stuck in the dark and confined to only a small amount of room you begin to sweat and gasp for breath. Claustrophobia was setting in and you knew it. You scream out for help but no one arrives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Is this really how I\u2019m gonna die? Stuck in this darkness, confined to die like a corpse?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die! I don\u2019t want to die here\u201d you scream at the top of your lungs thrashing around, punching forward in a fruitless attempt to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d you scream punching forward, breaking your hand against the solid wall of darkness before you! \u201cCome on! Let me out\u201d you scream once again punching your fist. You hear the sound of a muffled cracking but it is canceled out by your screams as you continue to thrash around until suddenly you feel something, something wet, had fallen on your face. You touch it and then more of the strange wet matter began to fall onto your face. You quickly punch forward with your good hand and hear a loud creaking before suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFREEDOM\u201d you scream breaking free of your prison, gasping for breath as mud covers your wounded body before then being washed away by the heavy rain. You stay there for a moments, allowing your senses to return to you as the mud covers your lower body. You stand up and let the rain wash the mud from your clothing until the only mud left on you was the mud that had gotten really deep your clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to change before I get sick\u201d you say to no one in particular as you climb out of the now muddy coffin and onto the somewhat solid ground. You look around but the rain makes it hard to see but you notice a strange light several feet away, a lantern perhaps? You decide to walk towards it only to find that your body felt numb and you were in quite a bit of pain. You collapse a feet steps later, smashing head first into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low groan escapes you as you crawl to your feet, your body aching so much that it makes every step feel like you were an old (wo)man. However somehow you managed to make it and found that the light was only that of a lamp post. You let out a clear groan of pain as you slump back to the ground, your back against the metal pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I do now\u201d you ask yourself silently as the rain continues to pelt you with its bitter cold water and wind. Just then you hear the sound of footsteps and quickly see a shadowy figure pass you by. You were about to continue sulking when you notice that of a large black cloth on the ground, a blanket perhaps? Regardless you decided to wrap yourself with the blanket and find some shelter. You soon found refuge under a nearby open air shop whose roof helped keep the water off you and the blanket, although a bit soaked, helped keep the wind off you.<br>\r\nYou felt tired and decided to rest, today had been very strange and weird day but at least now you were safe and could catch some Z\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lye your head against a wooden shelf and pass out...<br>\r\n(The following are a list of in game characters that appeared in this chapter)<br>\r\nFiora (the girl Anthony is currently possessing) pic (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://download.minitokyo.net/Xenoblade.Chronicles.544453.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://download.minitokyo.net/Xenoblade....</a>)<br>\r\nShulk (the guy who was with Fiora when they saved Anthony)pic (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sickr.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/shulk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://sickr.files.wordpress.com/2011/12...</a>)</span></div></div>",

You decide it would be best to clear out and leave before anyone could notice that you were inside the shop. They\u2019d probably mistake you for a thief and you really didn\u2019t want any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever upon standing up you found that your hand was no longer broken and that you no longer ached when you moved which was nice to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018At least I can move now\u2019 you say mentally as you walked away from the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for quiet a distance before you stopped again, your stomach was growling, you were hungry. You rub your stomach as if trying to sooth it as you look around for sustenance, quickly spying a tree which held many a fruit. Plenty of fruit to sooth your grumbling stomach! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow all I have to do is get them down\u201d you explain, walking up to the foot of the tree.  You reach up to try and grab the fruit but find your reach is just a bit too short, this new body of yours was a few inches short than your normal body. \u201cDrat! If only I was a few inches taller\u201d you groan standing on your tiptoes, trying to reach an apple on one of the trees lowest branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel your mouth get really watery and immediately keel over, vomiting up a strange clear liquid that a normal person would mistake for water. You feel yourself black out again but soon you awaken once more. You look around and soon realize you were back in your own body which makes you jump for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re happy\u201d says a familiar voice. You stop jumping around and turn to see that of your former body, Fiora, who was still wrapped in that dirty black blanket from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiora uh\u2026are you okay\u201d you ask a bit worried for some reason. Maybe you were worried that you had somehow hurt her when you took control of her, or maybe you were worried she\u2019d be mad at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alright, thank you. Uh where\u2019s Shulk and Reyn\u201d Fiora asks curiously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what happened? That huge Mechon grabbed you while you were inside the tank suit thing and then threw you\u201d you explain before suddenly both of your stomach\u2019s growl interrupting your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh I guess we\u2019re both really hungry, why don\u2019t you pick some of those apples. You can tell me what happened while we eat\u201d Fiora says with a kind hearted chuckle. You nod and quickly reach into the tree and pull down a few apples. Fiora takes off the blanket and places it on the ground. It almost looked like a picnic only minus the basket and drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to fill Fiora in on what had happened up to this point, even the part about you taking control of her. You just felt like you had to confess, Fiora was kind and you didn\u2019t feel it\u2019d be right to lie to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened, I blacked out just before that faced Mechon stabbed me which is when you took over and somehow through your possessing me, it saved us both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that pretty much sums it up\u201d you reply matter of factually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I don\u2019t suppose you know where Shulk and Reyn went\u201d Fiora asked a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell even if I didn\u2019t, and I do! I\u2019m sure they\u2019re somewhere close by\u201d you say trying to cheer her up. \u201cCome on they\u2019re at Terpha Cave but before we go\u2026\u201d You stopped midsentence and looked back at Fiora who quickly realizes why you\u2019re staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, I\u2019m filthy\u201d Fiora says with a clear tone of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah before we meet up with Shulk and Reyn maybe we should stop by your house and pick up some new clothes.\u201d You explain and Fiora nods. With this you two quickly wrap up the makeshift picnic and head back into town, however before you could even make it you realize one vital thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Fiora\u2026\u201d you begin stopping in place just outside one of colony 9\u2019s many entrances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes what is  it?\u201d Fiora asks, stopping as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re dead, right\u201d you ask beginning to sweat out of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy what you told me, yes! Why do you\u2026oh\u201d the sudden realization saves you just in the nick of time as two colonists walk out onto the bridge that you were standing on. You and Fiora quickly jump into the small river under the bridge creating a small splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that\u201d one of the colonists asks as the two quickly walk up to the side of the bridge. They quickly lean over the side of the bridge just in time to see you stand up (Fiora was hidden behind you in a way that none of the colonist could see her).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey are you okay\u201d the other colonist asks looking down at you. You look up at the two colonists; both of them were girls though why you really noticed was a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay! I just\u2026uh\u2026lost my hat\u201d you lie. The two colonists look each other in the eye and the shrug. The lie worked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright just be careful, there\u2019s Brogs down there\u201d one of the colonists warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks I\u2019ll be careful!\u201d you say keeping up the act and then waving the two colonists goodbye. A few minutes past until you were absolutely sure that the coast was clear, that and you had to wait for your clothes to dry off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was just awful. I wish I wasn\u2019t dead, that way we could at the very least walk down the street. Curse that faced Mechon\u201d Fiora growls, smashing her fist into the water angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere let\u2019s get moving. Besides if all else fails we can just go out during night.\u201d You explain and help Fiora stand up. At least the water had helped wash some of the mud off of her, though she still looked really dirty. Oh how you wished you could just return home and let her use your shower but then again is there any way you can get out of here? Regardless you were here now and your main goal right now was to reunite Fiora with Shulk! You can worry about other things like showers later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway we\u2019re only a block away from my house so at least I can change my clothes\u201d Fiora sighed thankfully before you two ascended the hill of the river bank and got back onto the bridge. In only a few minutes you had reached Fiora\u2019s place only to find that someone was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap Dunban\u2019s inside and I can\u2019t just run in there and grab your clothes\u201d you say annoyed as you and Fiora hide in a nearby alleyway that was exactly five feet from Fiora\u2019s house. You had seen Dunban as he walked inside and out of the house, granted he was only gone for like a minute so there wasn\u2019t any way for you to get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Fiora asks you as if you had all the answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d you begin trying to think up some plan of infiltration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anything?\u201d Fiora asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it\u201d you say finally coming up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Fiora asks a bit impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

However even though it was now nightfall there were still plenty of people out and about so you had to wait another hour before everyone was finally gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now midnight by your watch; well it would be if you actually were wearing a watch! Regardless the time to act was now and you weren\u2019t about to let that moment pass! You and Fiora quickly bolted for the house and quickly infiltrated it like the thieves you somewhat were. (A/N Fiora kind of does play the role of the thief in this game. Well to an extend she does)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in the downstairs/kitchen area which you are quick to realize, partially due to the fact that your power allowed you access to Fiora\u2019s memories even though you really didn\u2019t know whose memories they were. You just knew where you were and where you needed to go. Regardless you and Fiora carefully move upstairs to the bedroom area, and to a somewhat surprise to you Fiora and Dunban share a bedroom together, not the same bed mind you but the fact still made you uneasy, maybe it was the fact that any wrong step could wake up Dunban and there\u2019d be one hell of a ruckus following that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of causing any sudden noises you carefully and stealthily move across the bedroom while Fiora instructs you via small whispers from the top of the stairwell. Your power helped to shield your footsteps by turning your lower region into water allowing you to move without making a sound. Soon you had made it to the dresser that contained Fiora\u2019s clothes, however you had to been even more careful now due to the fact that the dresser was between the two beds, one of which Dunban was sleeping on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully pull open the dresser but no matter how stealthy and careful you were, the dresser still let out a loud not to mention prominent creak. Dunban in response quickly rocketed upward, grabbing a sword that was surprisingly close to his bed and bisecting you in half!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonster, what are you doing here\u201d Dunban yelled quickly moving to turn on the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Don\u2019t\u201d Fiora shouts out just as your top half, which is still alive mind you, falls onto Fiora\u2019s bed. (Your bottom half was completely liquid so it just turned into a puddle on the bedroom floor.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiora?! \u201cDunban called out a bit surprised \u201cIs that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it\u2019s me but\u2026uh\u2026well\u201d Fiora didn\u2019t know what to say. She couldn\u2019t just tell Dunban that she was alive, that\u2019d raise too many questions not to mention cause a lot of panic. A girl coming back from the dead, yeah it\u2019d be like a zombie movie! Well that\u2019s what you thought at least as your body tried to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Fiora? Come on you can tell me\u201d Dunban asked almost sounding like he was begging for her to speak again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026this is a dream! Yeah a dream\u201d Fiora explains trying to think up a plan on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dream? But-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Dunban\u201d you say finally managing to completely reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you\u201d Dunban asked now on his guard \u201cwhat have you done with my sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy Dunban we just came here to\u2026umm\u2026\u201d Fiora didn\u2019t know what to say but you quickly jumped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook we\u2019re here to tell you that you need to go after Reyn and Shulk! They need your help!\u201d You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know Shulk and Reyn? Wait you mean they left Colony 9?\u201d Dunban asked curiously as well as quite a bit confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time for that! You have to find them. Find Dickson; get him to take you to Colony 6! Shulk and Reyn along with a girl named Sharla, will arrive there in a matter of week or so and just after they fight a huge Mechon named Xord they will be ambushed by the very same mechon that killed Fiora! Along with him there will be five to seven other bigger and bulkier mechon. If you don\u2019t make it their in time then they\u2019ll all die\u201d you explain getting a bit carried away, in fact you get right in Dunban\u2019s face and shout exposition that even he shouldn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s enough, our job is done\u201d Fiora says chiming in right before you reveal that Fiora was indeed alive though how you knew this was a mystery to even yourself. Maybe you took a peak at the Xenoblade Chronicles wiki one time when you were bored. Regardless you and Fiora take your leave and Dunban goes back to sleep. You pray that he believes you as you leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell crap!\u201d you groan as you and Fiora walk out onto the streets of Colony 9. You were distraught over failing to get Fiora clothes and also revealing a crap ton of exposition that Dunban was supposed to find out on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s okay, at least he didn\u2019t accidently attack us\u201d Fiora says with a grateful sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually he did, he cut me in half, though I doubt you could\u2019ve seen that since it was really dark up there\u201d you explain running your finger along the span of your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026well at least your okay now\u201d Fiora says a bit awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway I guess since we didn\u2019t get any clothes hmm\u2026maybe if somehow\u2026hmm\u201d you begin to mumble and go off on a tangent, so much so you almost end up running into a building but luckily Fiora grabs you by the arm and you stop walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook if it\u2019s really that bad of a problem then we can just um\u2026\u201d Fiora looks around before spying a nearby black cloak that was hanging out to dry \u201cWe can use this!\u201d Fiora quickly puts the cloak on and in a somewhat moment of sudden fanboyism, you let out a squeal and hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t help it you look like Xion from Kingdom hearts\u201d you squeal while picking Fiora up in the air and hugging her like an adorable plushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh could you let me down now\u201d Fiora asks, blushing underneath the hood of the cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry\u201d you apologize and quickly set Fiora back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026who\u2019s Xion\u201d Fiora ask still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUh well you see there\u2019s this game called Kingdom hearts and uh\u2026I-it\u2019s not important! Never mind! Besides don\u2019t we have somewhere we need to go\u201d you quickly snap back trying to change the topic, luckily it works! Fiora quickly realize what you meant and almost smacks herself in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to catch up to Shulk and Reyn. Oh no they\u2019re probably already in trouble by now. We have to go rescue them\u201d Fiora exclaims beginning to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey calm down! Besides I\u2019m sure they can handle it. Shulk does have the Monado after all\u201d you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go again. How do you know these things?\u201d Fiora asks confused and a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026hmm I think it\u2019d be best if I just show you\u201d you say with a sigh. You slowly reach your had forward and touch Fiora on the forehead with your index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you-\u201csuddenly several flash through Fiora\u2019s mind cutting off her train of thought, images of various things, mechon, Shulk, Reyn, herself and even, you! You showed her how you arrived here, how she and Shulk saved your life from mechon, and more. You showed her images of Colony 6, bombed and blown to bits along with another faced Mechon, Xord, a giant bulky mechon who wielded a giant hammer and was responsible for countless deaths of homs. And then\u2026that was it! You had stopped play after you had beaten Xord and was ambushed by Metal Face (that\u2019s why you knew about the ambush and Dunban\u2019s introduction into the party).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this you let Fiora go, allowing her a bit of relief before she asked \u201cwhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know how I got here; let alone why I have these powers. All I know is there\u2019s this strange urge inside me that, up until now, I\u2019ve been suppressing by sheer will power. This urge is the only real downside to these powers\u2026well that and not having an instruction booklet but what does now a day\u2019s anyway?\u201d you say the last part with a weak chuckle trying your best not to freak Fiora out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026umm\u2026wow\u201d Fiora was at a loss for words and why wouldn\u2019t she be, you just dropped a bombshell if not an frickin nuke! So many questions entered her mind only to be answered the next. She seemed to be on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can take them away, the memories if you want\u201d you explain and Fiora saddly nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, take them away, I don\u2019t want to know all these things\u201d Fiora pleads now clearly crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Anthony\u2019s gonna take all the bad things away\u201d you say in a comforting and sympathetic manner, taking Fiora in the arms and letting her cry on your shoulder. \u201cJust remember that you ask for this. That\u2019s all I ask\u201d You ask and Fiora nods, trying to wipe her tears with the sleeve of her cloak. You gently touch the back of Fiora\u2019s head and with in a small matter of seconds, the memories are gone, locked away inside Fiora\u2019s mind, and only allowed to be accessed on your command.</span></div></div>",

So you just continued to hold her like this, in the middle of the street, as night turned into day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiora\u2026\u201d you begin your voice soft and quiet as you look back towards the girl on your shoulder. \u201cFiora\u2026\u201d again you speak, this time a bit loud but still sounding quiet enough for no one other than Fiora to hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Fiora doesn\u2019t reply, instead the sound of soft snoring. She had fallen asleep; perhaps the strain of locking her memories was a bit much on her? Or maybe she was just tired. Either way you gently move her so that you could carry her on your back, via piggy back style, and begin your trek towards Terpha cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a surprisingly short time to make it to the cave, though instead of entering you decided to wait until Fiora had awakened before you proceeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour passed and yet Fiora continued to sleep. You decided against waking her and instead went for a small walk down the path that you had walked in order to reach the cave. You waved hello to the two guards that usually guarded the cave as they passed by. You were about to say something to them but figured against it, \u2018Enjoy your walk Anthony before things get hectic \u2018 you thought to yourself as you continued down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a few Bunnit (Xenoblade Chronicle\u2019s versions of bunnies though with opposable hands on their tails) as they skitter across the tall grass. However something about those Bunnits bothered you, there was a lot of them and by a lot you meant thirty if not forty and they were surrounding something. You try to get closer but the second you do something erupts from the grass to your surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-ah mechon?!\u201d you gasp in shock as a Mechon M63 roars to life before you. (Picture of the mechon: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.wikia.com/xenoblade/images/6/60/Mechon_M63.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.wikia.com/xenoblade/images...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly dodge roll out of the way as the Mechon slams down its claw like appendage towards you in an attempt to grab you. You quickly jump back as the mechon tries once again to grab you, however before it manages to get within reaching distance it hit\u2019s a snag! You carefully stand up, having fallen on your butt when you jumped away, and approach the mechon as it fruitlessly tries to grab you. You inch ever closer to the stuck mechon and begin to take note. The armor was cracked in several places; the legs were malfunctioning, that much you could tell just by looking, especially since the legs let off a small amount of sparks every time it tried to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm maybe I can use this thing\u2026\u201d you mumble to yourself as you examine the mechon. It was then an idea popped into your head, an ingenious idea, an ingenious devilish idea \u201cPayback time!\u201d you shout, smirking like a wiseass and for a second you swear you see the mechon wince in fear before you drive into the machine monstrosity via the several cracks in its armor! In only seconds you were completely inside the mechon, on your way to figuring out how to make this mechanical dog, so to speak, your bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm so that\u2019s how that works, this moves the arm, and these move the legs\u2019 you mumble to yourself as you ooze through the mechon\u2019s interior, which admittedly was a bit roomy which you didn\u2019t mind, after all you had more room to maneuver and less crap to move around. Soon the Mechonis foot soldier was yours to command!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright that ought to do it\u201d you say clapping your hands in satisfaction as you rematerialize outside the mechon. \u201cNow on my order\u2026mark! And Claw Strike!\u201d you order and the mechon once again roars to life, this time shooting it\u2019s claw appendage forward and smashing it into a nearby boulder! To your surprise the rock crumbles to pieces! \u201cWhoa! Nice job\u201d you say with a small but proud laugh! The mechon puppet quickly turns back towards you, waiting for your next order which you happily give it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright listen up!\u201d you\u2019re voice loud and prominent as the mechon soldier listens patiently \u201cFrom now on you will serve as my soldier! My body guard! You will protect me and my companion until your gears fall apart and your metal rusts until dust! This I command\u201d As if in response as well as a sign of loyalty and respect, the mechon give you a mock salute! \u201cNow come! Let\u2019s begin our new life as master and soldier!\u201d with this you and your new mechon puppet take your leave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about an hour later before you made your way back to the mouth of the cave, partially due to your soldier\u2019s faulty mechanics, which you swore you\u2019d fix once you had the chance, and also the fact that if anyone were to see you well\u2026let\u2019s just say the scene from any Godzilla movie where the monsters show up would sum it up pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless you had managed to make your way back to Fiora who, by now, had already gotten lunch started. You give her a wave as you and your mechon puppet approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH! Anthony look out\u201d Fiora screams running up to you and pushing you to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d you groan as you hit your head on a rock on the ground \u201cFiora what the heck was that for?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand back I\u2019ll take care of this mechon\u201d Fiora says pulling out two razor sharp knives that she must have either found or stole while you were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Whoa! WHOA! Fiora calm down\u201d you exclaim quickly and carefully disarming Fiora so that you weren\u2019t accidently cut by her knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but-\u201c Fiora tried to say but you quickly cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I reprogrammed this mechon to follow my orders so there\u2019s no need for that\u201d you explain. \u201cHere you can have these back now\u201d you explain as you hand Fiora back her knives. Fiora was about to say something but shrugged and quickly walked back to a crock-pot that was lying over an open fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway lunch is ready, I made some soup. I hope you like herbs and spices!\u201d Fiora explains as she removes the tops to the crock-pot letting out a large plum of steam from the pot.  You shrug as you and your mechanical servant walk over to the crock-pot and sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can try\u201d you reply as Fiora hands you a bowls of warm green colored soup with some floating meet chunks that you thought were from a crab for some reason.<br>\r\nA little while later\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blake looked at her in confusion bofore she heard a giggle from behind her. Her eyes widened when she saw a the blade of scythe at her neck, she turned her neck slowly to see Ruby in the same attire as Yang with the same infuriating grin on her face. Yang used this distraction to trip Blake and pin her to the ground, Blake watched in horror as she saw Ruby cough up the same blue goo she thought she had killed earlier. The goo slithered across the bathroom floor and crawled up Blake's leg. Blake shivered then gasped in shock when You ( the goo) shot straight into her vagina. She writhed, panted, and moaned on the ground as you wedged up her vagina. \"Ooohh! Oh GOD stop! Oh this feels so GOOOD!\" Blake yelled out with a moan as she started losing her consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang and Ruby watched with the same grin as Blake spasmed on the ground trying to get you out of her, but to no avail, she eventually passed out. A face splitting grin slowly spread across her face and she rose up and left the bathroom. You rubbed Yang's and Blake's boobs with their respective hands, and moaned at the same time. You decided to give them control over their bodies back in order to do the initiation exam, but not before altering their memories so that they (especially Blake) thought they had a normal morning.

Since you do not want to be waking in pee clothes you decided your going to need a change of clothes and a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Weiss, damn it's sounds so weird to hear someone's else voice coming out instead of mine. Anyway since I wet myself in going to need a change of clothes and a shower. Since I know nothing about taking a shower as a girl I am going to need your help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss's face morphs in a face of delight as if you asking her to help you were going to erase all her sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glady, I will make sure Master will have a shower befitting of a Schnee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she walks over to the bathroom to prepare your shower. Once you see the bathroom's lights turn on you started to look for a change of nightwear to wear to replace your pee soaked ones. Grabbing a new nightgown and shorts you walk towards the bathroom were Weiss would have your shower ready. Once you enter the bathroom instead of a prepared shower their was a prepared bath instead. Looking at Weiss you waiting for a response on why their is a prepared bath instead of a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because with a bath I will be able to clean you more effectively till you learn on how to shower in a girl's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your question answered you then remove your clothes leaving you naked in front of Weiss. Seeing your naked body Weiss's face turned red and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking away Weiss? I am pretty sure you are straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because Master's current body is nude. And because Master is inside Blake's body it's as Master is blessing me with your naked glory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I got tried of writing to I will end this here. I'll pick this up later.)</span></div></div>",

As you relax in the hot water, you look down through Blake's yellow eyes and take note on how big Blake's breasts are, 'they look like a D cup' you think to yourself as Blake's face becomes red. Then a pair of cold hands start to scrub at your back, you had forgotten that Weiss was in here with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrubs everywhere, until she reaches Blake's breasts, Weiss grabs both of your/Blake's tits and starts to grope them with her soft and soapy hands, you start to gasp loudly, never thinking that this would ever feel so good, and the fact that Blake's voice is coming out of your mouth is only turning you on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Master, do you like how I am pleasing you, would you like to have more, perhaps?\" Wiess says in a sly tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could do nothing other than nod, this teasing was driving me insane! Then Weiss smirked as she then pinched my/Blake's erect nipples and pinches them with her expensively manicured finger nails. I started to moan at a fast pace, is this what girls feel all the time! Oh God this feels so good. I then grabbed the back of Weiss's head and forced it to Blake's tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss, suck, now. \" I ordered in Blake's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master\" Weiss replied in happy tone , it was strange, but I was too horny to care. She then started to suck on my tit while she groped the other one. I moaned loudly, glad that everyone else in the room was possessed and the walls were sound proof. I then Moaned even louder, to the point of screaming when I felt something penetrate my/Blake's body's lower regions. I looked down and saw that three of Weiss's fingers were in Blake's vagina, Weiss then started pumping her fingers, I started Moaning/screaming in pure ecstasy and pleasure, Blake's body felt amazing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss!\" I yelled at her in between my moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master?\"She questioned in a smug tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" OH GOD! FASTER WIESS FASTER! OH IT FEELS SO GOOD! \" I screamed in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was way better than jacking off with a dick! Women got all the perks, I would be jealous, but I was too much on a pleasure high right now to even care. I Moaned Loudly in Blake's voice as I reached a climax in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I make you feel good Master?\" Weiss asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes you did but..\" I trialed off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\" Weiss questions confusingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It my turn now\" I declared in Blake's voice as I grabbed her using Blake's hands and, using the goo inside of Blake's body, formed a dick made of goo and impaled Weiss with it, Weiss screamed in pain as I broke her maiden barrier in one go. Ignoring her tears of pain I smirked with Blake's gorgeous face as I started to slam into her over and over again. Weiss's screams of pain soon became ones of pleasure and ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES MASTER! PLEASE GO FASTER, HARDER, DEEPER! OH GOD, THIS IS AMAZING\" Wiess started to scream in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you belong to?\" I asked with a unusual sneer on Blake's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I BELONG TO YOU MASTER! I AM YOUR COCK SLEEVE! FOR YOU TO USE ANYTIME YOU WANT! NO MATTER WHAT BODY YOUR IN! JUST PLEASE! FUCK ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN!\" Wiess screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone were to see this, they would have gapped in SHOCK as the heiress of the famous Schnee Dust Company acting like a lowly slut, especially the people who personally know her. But for you, it makes it all the more better, I then start to fuck Wiess even harder in Blake's body. Until Wiess screams as loud as humanely possible in pure ecstasy as she climaxes. Her cum squirting out of her abused pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, you think to yourself, Blake's has a lot of stamina, as you continue to grope her breasts, I definitely have to do this again later. Unfortunately, since the initiation test was the day previous, Blake's body was still exhausted so she passed out in the cum filled bathtub, with a naked also passed out Wiess in the bathtub next to your equally naked possessed Blake Belladonna.</span></div></div>",

Only she and her mistress had the right to know anything about their plans. Not even her two \"subordinates\", Emerald and Mercury had any idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout her zoning out. Something slithers slowly out of the shadows towards Cinder. It slowly sticks to the bottom of Cinder's glass sandal, bit since no weight was being put on the Sandal due to Cinder sitting down, Cinder did not take notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue Goo then slowly slithers its way up Cinder's toned, sexy, bare leg and disappears inside of Cinder's red dress. It travels up Cinder's toned stomach and goes inside Cinder's huge cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Cinder snaps out of her thoughts and notices something wrong. She looks down and that is when blob strikes. It bursts out of her cleavage and envelopes her head. Cinder is trying desperately to tear it off even going as far as to use her semblance to try to burn it off but to no avail is it working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob then sends two long tendrils of goo and they go inside Cinder's dress and wrap around Cinder's tits and start to squeeze and kneed them. Cinder lets out a loud, whorey moan and looses her Concentration allowing the blob to slide past her lips and start going inside of her. But Cinder isn't finished yet, she grabs the portion in her mouth and starts trying to pull it out. The blob seemingly realizing it was losing, makes another tendril and slides it down to Cinder's shaven vagina. It quickly sticks it in and starts to pump it in and out at unbelievable speeds. Cinder's pupils dilate and she falls backwards against the wall helpless as the blob continues to fondle and grope her tits and and pump into her while she keeps the blob from entering her mouth. All she can do is moan, and that she did, she moaned and moaned, and to anyone who knew her, they would just stare in shock at how the Cinder Fall was moaning and screaming like a common street whore. Then Cinder let out one last orgasmic moan as she reached her climax but unfortunately her grip on the blob loosened and the Blob seized its chance. It entered through every hole in Cinder's sexy body, her mouth, her nose, her ears, her tits, her ass, and even through the small spaces between her expensively manicured finger nails. By this point in time Cinder was convulsing on the ground as she lost control from her feet up. But Cinder did not go unconscious. Her body stood up on her sandals on its own and walked over to the mirror. Her hands rose up and started to squeeze her E-cup tits and her mouth was twisted in a vile smirk. But Cinder could see it all, her one visible eye showed pure, unadulterated fear as the Cinder could feel her consciousness fading. Seconds later Cinder Fall was no more.</span></div></div>",

Except that heiresses don't normally have divine powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's a thing you'll be able to do. I'll have Neptune \u2013 that's your sister, and the person you will eventually succeed \u2013 teach you the basics. For now, you'll just wait around the room until I can get her to come over here.\" With that, Histoire began to float away, presumably to take care of the CPU Candidates for the other Landmasses, of which you are unsure the number of.</span></div></div>",

Anthony could see a girl who looked a bit like his new body: Purple hair, a white-and-purple color scheme for her clothes, she even had D-pad accessories in her hair. The main difference between her and Anthony was that the girl had two D-pads instead of one, she wore a hoodie instead of a skirt, and she had short hair instead of long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on what Histoire told her, Anthony presumed that this new girl was Neptune, her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second... Thank you for waiting, Neptune.\" Histoire's voice came over to where Anthony was hidden, before dragging her out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi?\" She wasn't really sure what to say, after being put on the spot like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?! Histy! Who's that hot girl you have with you?! A new character?!\" Neptune was taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Histoire nodded, \"her name is Nepgear and she is your younger sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony makes an effort to save face. \"Hi. As Histoire said, my name's A\u2013 Nepgear. Uh, apparently we're related? I know, it was actually news to me as well. But I hope we can get close to each other!\" There, that sounded like something a normal if slightly precocious younger sister would say after meeting the older sister she never knew for the first time, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune nodded with a smile for a few seconds, before turning to her friends \u2013 a girl with long brown hair and a blue coat, and a girl with long pink hair and large breasts whose very existence screamed the word \"soft\" \u2013 and proceeding to freak out. \"Compa! Iffy! Wh-What should I d-do?! I-I have a younger s-sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear. Was that Anthony's fault?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a hold of yourself, Neptune. She was born from the power of the Shares.\" Histoire's reasonable voice cut through the trio's collective freakout, leaving the three of them as just simply confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune spoke again, question marks literally visible floating around her head. \"...Huh? You're not getting to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony could practically feel Histoire's sigh emanating off of her, but she held it in pretty well, keeping her tone the same as she explained, \"With the previous battle, your Shares inflated and a new goddess was born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown haired girl (Anthony wasn't sure if her name was Iffy or Compa) looked skeptical. \"Uh, I'm still not sure, but what I do know is that Shares are versatile...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap, they're all looking back to me!</i> \"I, uh... I don't know exactly what we're doing, because Histoire didn't really explain that much about duties or whatever, but I think I can pick up stuff quick enough to help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune then proceeded to look simultaneously bashful and smug, which was a very strange mix of emotions. \"Heh, oh, shucks. Now I'm a big sister. I'm a bit embarassed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft girl then spoke up. \"But... Nepgear looks more like Nep-Nep's older sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown hair played off of Soft girl. \"You're right. She looks, acts, and talks more mature than Nep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune was unfazed by these remarks, however. \"Oh, stop that! I'm gonna be a big sister, starting... NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo conclude this little exchange, Histoire said, \"Well everyone, please take care of Nepgear. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group of 4, Anthony, Neptune, and \"Iffy and Compa\" (which may be real names or just nicknames, she wasn't sure yet) left the digital room to go out into Gamindustri. This left Anthony with two options: A, go around the world and find other girls to possess, or B, go on whatever adventure needed Neptune and co. to sally forth and do... whatever.</span></div></div>",

After some experimentation, Anthony figured out how to move this slime separate from her girl body, and she moved it sneakily into the store to find that girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlime Anthony found the blonde girl staring at a wall of dating games meant for girls, and was reaching to grab one when Anthony tore across the carpet and went up her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl made a yelping noise and starting thrashing around a bit, but Anthony was quick enough this time to take control before anything bad happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright, Lady Vert?\" The store attendant asked her, just now arriving around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I merely tripped a bit, but caught myself before falling to the ground. Thank you for your concern, though.\"  Anthony spoke without thinking, somehow able to imitate a girl she knew nothing about on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant nodded, before returning back to her spot at the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, so that means that I can automatically act like whoever I possess?</i> Anthony smirked. That would make pretending to be others infinitely easier. Now, she just had to figure out what it was that this \"Lady Vert\" wanted from this store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, memories of Vert looking at trailers for a new dating sim game filled her mind, leading her to learn that it wasn't just personalities she could pretend to have; it was also someone's thoughts and experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that information, Anthony bought the game Vert had in mind, before walking out of the store to... wherever Vert lived. But before she did, she went into that alleyway and talked with her other self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Vert spoke, putting a hand over her mouth jokingly. \"That's where my honored guest went. I'm terribly sorry about the delay. Why don't you follow me to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds lovely, thank you.\" Anthony curtsies as her other form (which you're going to call \"Blue\" from now on, because that's what her outfit was colored), before the two of them head off to Vert's house, bypassing their guards with a wave of Vert's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside Vert's room (which looked like a shrine to anime pretty boys), Anthony debated on what to do. She could play around with the bodies of Vert and Blue a bit more, or she could see if she could play around with the minds of both of them as well.</span></div></div>",

She tried to grab you, but failed as you were made of liquid. With most of your form inside her body, you immediately took control of Vivi's hands and covered mouth from screaming after your liquid remains entered her body. After a moment of fighting for control, you finally took over Vivi's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, do I have to keep doing this just to take over a girl's body?\" you quietly said to yourself, not wanting to wake Carue.

Recently, a series called Keijo has captured your interest. For being an anime about a sport where girls stand on a floating platform and have to knock each other in the water using only their breasts and butt, the show actually has more redeeming qualities than just fanservice. Of course, given the subject matter, there's still plenty of that to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just finished the final episode when a sharp pain hit your stomach. You fell over on the ground, rolling in agony as your body started to melt. The last thing you remember before blacking out was your half-liquid self being pulled into your laptop screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, the first thing you noticed was that you've transformed into a liquid. You tried to move yourself around, and discovered that while different, you could move your liquid body relatively easily. The second thing you noticed was your surroundings. Instead of your bedroom, you seemed to be in a bathroom. Judging by the lack of urinals, it was a girl's bathroom. This was confirmed by the third thing you noticed, which was a girl washing her hands. With her back to you, all you could make out was that she was wearing a blue school uniform with black flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept watching her, you suddenly felt an incredible urge to enter her body. The urge was much too strong for you to resist, and your liquid body quickly went up her legs and into her vagina. This sudden attack caught the girl completely off guard. She moaned as her body started convulsing and her eyes rolled up into her head. As the last of you finished entering her, she collapsed on the floor unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the girl?</span></div></div>",

Pulling yourself off the ground, you caught sight of your reflection in the bathroom mirror and paused. Staring back at you was the same girl you just saw with a shocked expression on her face. You recognized the girl as Nozomi Kaminashi, the main character of the anime you just finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/5688-602756566.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/u...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stared at her in the mirror, you felt information about your new powers flow into your mind. As you looked at what you now knew to be your reflection, you saw Nozomi's face form into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can take control of all these lovely ladies?\" you spoke out loud, hearing your new voice for the first time. \"That sounds like a wonderful idea. I could have so much fun here. However, I need to be careful and blend in for now.\" You kept speaking your thoughts out loud as you loved the hearing them come out in Nozomi's voice. \"Oh, speaking of blending in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you said that, you closed your eyes and focused. You felt yourself gain access to Nozomi's mind. From her memories, you learned that she was still in Room 309 with her roommates. You opened your eyes and smiled brightly at your reflection, having brought out Nozomi's upbeat and cheery personality to act through. \"Perfect! It's only the start of the year, so I'll have plenty of time to have fun with my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving confirmed everything necessary, you took the time to actually examine your body in the mirror. You had dark, navy blue eyes that you felt any male could get lost in. You tried batting them, and were very happy with the results. Next you looked at your hands. Smooth, yet firm. You brought one of them up to run it through your long, blue hair that was currently in a ponytail. You then brought your hands down to examine the rest of your body, leaving 3 very notable places for last. Everything from your arms to your torso to your abs to your legs felt smooth, yet you could feel the strong muscles underneath. You then brought your hands to your ass. Grabbing it sent a slight jolt of pleasure through your body as you grinned at yourself in the mirror. You couldn't wait to learn and use Nozomi's strongest move, the Vacuum Butt Cannon. The technique normally has a strong risk of injury, but you wouldn't have to worry about that anymore with your new powers. You then brought your hands up to grab your breasts. Another, stronger jolt of pleasure coursed through your body, and you let a soft moan escape your lips. As you continued playing with your tits, you felt your crotch began to heat up. You let one of your hands slide down and rub your pussy through your skirt. The pleasure was enough to make you close your eyes. Opening them again, you looked back at your reflection. Staring back at you was Nozomi with an expression of pure bliss and arousal, one hand playing with her breast and the other rubbing her vagina. Her memories told you that classes had just finished for the day, which brought another grin to your face. You had the rest of the day to go and find more girls to take over. However, you weren't sure if you wanted to to that just yet. You were still incredibly horny from your previous actions and kinda wanted to finish what you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

It have all what you like about games, good graphics, not ordinary game mechanics, interesting story, but most importantly it has a ton of beautiful female characters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What this? New update? Strange, I don't recall any updates maintenance in the news. Well whatever. It's almost done.\" The moment the download is finished something strange happens. Your screen starts glowing, and you feel your body being sucked into the game. \"WHAT THE HELLLLLL!!!!?\" You screamed as your body starts to melt, transforming into a blue liquid. You feel a strike, then you lose your conscious. As you regain your senses, you notice few differences. first and most importantly is that you are a slime/liquid substance without form that looks like drop of water, second is your location, you are no longer in your room, instead you are in some kind of hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, I recognize this walls design!' You think to yourself as you start move to the window. Behind the glass you saw a snow blizzard. 'Yup, that's what I thought, Chaldea.' In game lore Chaldea is a top secret base located somewhere in the Antarctic, the purpose of this base is to make sure human history won't suffer any changes, and if some kind of change happens, then they should return it back to normal with the help of \"Servants\" - most famous heroes of history and legends, such as Heracles or Nikola Tesla (don't ask me how someone like him became a servant), and \"Masters\" - humans that make a pack of some sort with Servant, and help them maintain their form in this world. 'If this is the same world as in game, then that means that they have only one Master and about 200 different Servants.' You thought to yourself. But before you start to move, you see two figures walking down the hall. They are the female version of main character, Ritsuka Fujimaru, and the slender girl, Mash Kyrielight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this to yourself Senpai, if you don't get a proper rest, you will collapse one day!\" Mash says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Mash, I think you're right, I haven't felt very good lately, so I guess I'm gonna go get some rest, see you tomorrow!\" Ritsuka replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start think to yourself 'Ok, so, they're done rayshifting, which means no unexpected visits will be done, and all Servants will be in their rooms, the only problem is finding the location of Servants, since there are over 200 Servants, and searching every room will take too much time, I guess I just need stick with Ritsuka, as she's most likely to have map with everyone's location.' So you wait until they walk, near your location and you make a jump. Success! You stick to Ritsuka's boots, and for the rest of the trip, you try your best not to fall off. Finally they seem to arrive. You decide to wait until Ritsuka falls asleep, and then look for a map. Didn't take Ritsuka long, since she seems to be really exhausted from her work, and in five minutes, you hear a snoring. Making your way from her boots you look around. You forgot that in master room there's always one servant staying around. In this situation it was Mash. She is sitting in the corner of the room, reading some books and doesn't notice you. You slowly approach the table, trying not give up your presence. There is a huge map on the wall, right above the table, and just like you thought, it has location of every Servant in this mansion. After memorizing every location you decide to...</span></div></div>",

No, really, they even have Stable, makes sense though, some of riders have horses with them.' As you look through the map you you finally decided where you want to go. 'A swimming pool huh,guess we have our next stop. Pretty far from here, unfortunately.' You look on at a reading Mash, and decide that it's too risky, you aren't even sure if you actually can possess someone. So you jump from the table and plop on floor. Despite being a liquid, you realize that you're actually pretty fast, not to mention that you don't feel any tiredness. Being a slime like creature has its own benefits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a pretty short amount of time, you've made it to the pool. 'It's strange that I didn't encounter anyone on my way here. I wonder what time it is now, maybe its late night already, so most of them already fast asleep?' You think as you squeeze yourself through the slit under the door. You start to look around with amazement. It is a very big room, where there's only one pool that is about 3 kilometres in length, so, yeah, I guess you can imagine the size of a room. As you look around, you don't notice the swimming figure at first, only noticing her when she starts getting out of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/79845676gy1fsy3rjx527j20kn0xc41l.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/79845676gy1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name is Musashi Miyamoto, famous as one of the strongest, dueling with 61 wins, founder of double-bladed techniques, her work \"The Book of Five Rings\" still used by most of the martial artist, the only thing that was wrong about her is that in your world Miyamoto Musashi was a man, but you personally like this variation better. How can you not? She is gorgeous! Tall, slender body, nice, fit ass, a perfect pair of D cup breasts, a cute face and beautiful pink hair. In your eyes, she is a perfection! She starts moving to a lounge chair, not noticing you (I mean you are a puddle of water,nothing strange about them in the pool), and starts to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your chance, the girl of your dreams is lying on a chair not, knowing about you, and there is no one else around. You quickly move to chair and start going up. Another benefit of being liquid, you are 100% noiseless, so even famous Miyamoto Musashi can't hear you. You easily make your way to her pussy. Since her swimsuit is wet from recent swimming, you go through it to inside her. As you make your way forward, she makes a quick surprised gasp. But before she can do anything, you finish your way to her womb. When this happens your vision blanks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally manage to open your eyes... 'Wait a minute! Eyes?!' You lean forward, with a sensational of heavy weight on your shoulders. When you look down you saw two large mountains of flesh cowered by a swimsuit. \"Oh my God! I can't believe it worked! I'm actually in Musashi's body!\" You exclaim in excitement, giving your new found breasts a good grope. \"Oh!\" You moan with pleasure. \"These things are so sensitive.\" Fighting the urge to examine your body right here and now, you restrain yourself. \"It would be really unpleasant if someone decided to visit pool while I'm examining her body, besides, they could have cameras. It would be much more secure if I examine her in her room.\" You make yourself get up, and, while accustoming to the change your of gravity center, you slowly make your way to dressing room. You find her bag, and start to dressed yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sun1-7.userapi.com/c834400/v834400848/1715ae/vN1e1Y7NWjs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://sun1-7.userapi.com/c834400/v8344...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow moving with much more confidence, you hastily move to her room, once you reach the door you realize that it has a security lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah c'mon, does every door have lock on it? How am I supposed to get inside now?\" You mumble angrily, not noticing that your hand automatically begins typing the right numbers. The door opens. \"Wow, didn't know I can do that, probably muscle memory.\" Throwing the bag on the bed, you decide to take a quick shower after pool. You toss away your red pullover and jeans, leaving your body only in underwear. You quickly dispose of your underwear, leaving your body fully naked. You turn the shower on. As you feel hot water running down your body and fall to your sensitive tits, you can't help but feel thrill from the pleasure. You place one of your hands to your pussy you accidentally touch your clitoris , a sudden jolt of pleasure makes you gasp. You start massaging your pussy, and when your finger enter inside of your pussy, you can't hold back the scream anymore. You start massaging one of your fully erect nipples with one hand, and fingering your pussy with other, not holding in your passionate sighs, until you finally orgasm, this feeling is so different from male orgasm, that your body goes numb from pleasure.

There is a moment of brief disorientation and a flashing of bright, confused lights, and then the world slowly resolves itself into a dark room with a closed door. Some boxes are sitting next to a table, and Samus is sitting polishing her gun under the one dim and unshaded light bulb hanging from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adjust to moving around as an liquid entity quickly, flowing over to her as she sets down her pistol and goes to look in one of the boxes. Samus's tight blue spandex stretches taut as she bends over to rifle through the contents of the box. You seize your moment with a new found instinctual zeal, go up and slide under the blue material from the neck area and slither the whole length of you inside her. Samus bucks wildly with a loud grunt, falling to her knees and arching her back, staring at the ceiling eyes agape as she twists uncontrollably and the rest of your length disappears up into her tight buttocks. Her body falls limp on the floor, and the room is motionless. Suddenly her eyes snap open and she rolls onto her back, chuckling softly. You sit up and run your hands over your supple legs and bosoms nearly bursting through the thin spandex, tossing the long gold locks tied up in your ponytail.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your name is Anthony, and you gain the power to turn into liquid and enter TV and handheld video game screens, then enter the body of girls in it. Once you do that, you have possessed them. You can access their memories, use any abilities they have, live their lives, and imitate them perfectly. While you are liquid, you can split yourself into multiple parts so that you can possess multiple girls, and also be yourself at the same time. There will be one part that will be in complete control of all other parts, that is the main part, and you can switch which part is the main part. When you are in the series, no time will pass (unless part of you is in the real world).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can alter the girls' memories and then leave their bodies at any time, you can also make it so that they are your loyal slaves or that they have no minds or free will at all and will only do what you tell them to, and you can also alter the size of certain parts of their body, for example, their breasts. You can return to the real world while in their body, and when you enter their body from the real world, you can enter their series while it is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also can make others liquid while they are holding on to you, and only you can turn them them back to normal. You both can enter the same body, however, and both have control that you share, but you are the dominant one if you do. You can also enter the body of a real girl and do the same things to her as the girls from the Cartoons, Anime, and Video Games. Also, you can have girls turn into liquid under the same conditions as the boys. When you possess a girl, you can then use their body to possess another girl, if that happens, you can leave the girl whose body your using to possess the other inside the other girl's body, and if you want, you can remove the girl's body, which will be yours to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and only you can cause a merger (either by you merging, or by you having others merge), but no boy other than you can be used in a merger. When two or more characters merge, you can choose the personality traits they get from which person (along with the appearance, but unlike the personality part, there must be aspects of the appearance from everyone merged), but if you are one of the people merged, then you have complete control, with no change in personality, with the ability access to their memories if you want to. The default form of the body you get when you merge will be female, but you can change it to male at any point (but no in between).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get the powers, you will get the urge to possess a girl (although you may not realize that the urge is to possess someone at that point, but that it is to enter her body), an urge that will be so strong that you can't fight it. If you go too long without possessing a girl, then you will start to get the urge again, and it will slowly get to the point where you can't fight it, and will possess the first girl you can. If you're already possessing a girl, you obviously won't get the urge, and the longer you're in her body, the longer you can go without the urge once you leave. If you split yourself into multiple parts and have some of the parts possess girls, then the urge is reduced, and you can go longer without it, but eventually it will get to the point any part not possessing a girl will get the urge to the point where they can't fight the urge (obviously, the more females possessed, the more the urge is reduced).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you occupy a space in liquid form where a non-physical girl is while she is intangible, you can still get inside of her if you can manipulate your and her forms to the point where she'd completely cover you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind can't be read, your soul, mind, and memories can't be affected by outside sources, and while you are in the body of a female, her mind is unconscious while you're in control, and you can alter her thoughts, making it so you can fool anyone into thinking that you're that girl if they do a mind reading. Information involving you possessing them can't be discovered by mind reading at all, even if you would mentally scream it at someone while they are doing a mind reading. Your mind can't be affected by any outside forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA person who is possessing a girl can assimilate the girl's mind and make it theirs permanently, unable to have the part of themself inside at the time leave the body. In this situation, you can't be completely inside the body. If the possessor is stuck inside a host's body permanently, the girl's mind is unable to be put on autopilot, as it is no longer separate from the person possessing them, but you are still imune to any outside forces. In trade off for this, the one possessing no longer needs to search for memories, as they'll come on their own, although the person can still search for the memories, the downside is that the person possessing will, for a while, have some of the host's habits, and if they are absent minded about something, then they may subconsciously act like the host would to a degree in a situation, except her mind and personality being influenced by the one possessing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything that specifically controls liquids will not affect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo gay/lesbian stuff or incest, except in cases where it is canon in a series, and in this case, don't focus on it, also, these things don't apply to you as far as possessing girls goes, as your powers can alter things that would cause problems, such as diseases, and things caused by incest, and in the case of boys in girls' bodies, they still have male minds, which would be attracted to girls, while the girls' bodies are attracted to guys. Romance between a boy in a girl's body and a boy in their own body is ok, but if that is used, then the boy must stay in the girl's body permanently, and if you are the one who does it, then you must have a part of yourself outside of the body in order to avoid being stuck in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse proper spelling and grammar (I'm ok with small mistakes since everyone makes them once in a while).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo weight gain or vore (outside of entering the bodies of girls in liquid form), except in cases where it is canon in a series, and in this case, don't focus on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I find out that someone who adds has stolen someone else's chapter, and then posted it as their own, then I'll delete it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStick to the story that's going on, don't switch it all the sudden without any explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly you can gain this power, everyone else needs your help to do anything with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy in a girl's body must be referred to as a girl. The other characters don't have to, but the person writing it must do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters who can transform between girl forms and boy forms will be only have their girl form the whole time that you (or anyone you help possess that character) are in their body, and you can also lock them in the female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is ever a debate on the gender of a character, then ask me, and I'll decide. Characters that are counted as female:<br>\r\nHaku (There is no way that Haku is a boy in my opinion, and I can think of several reasons for Haku to hide her identity).<br>\r\nVivian (In the English version of Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door it is true without a doubt, and by what I understand, the info in the journal about the characters in the Japanese version comes from Mario's point of view, and since Beldam calls Vivian a man during an insult, Mario could quite possibly only believe it to be true).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to have a female version of a male character, then you must have something happen to change their gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny character who in their series is called a god will be considered a powerful spirit instead in this story, even if the charaters from their series won't call them as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease put up links to pictures of the fictional girls during the option chapter they are mentioned in, or the chapter they appear in. Also, if you can, put up links to images of any original characters from that series, or any fused characters. (I'll do my best to edit the chapters already up to include images). Don't hesitate to use pictures of what the girls are doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo ending the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo turning Anthony evil or changing his personality. Since the video games, anime, and cartoons are in a fictional world, Anthony has less restrictions in there with that rule, he can play the role of a villain/villainess, but only in the fictional world, not in the actual one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, you can do what you want. I may add more rules later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony: 16 years old. A lone-wolf, but not a mean person and is very stubborn. Will always be there for his friends if he can; become his enemy and you will have a hard time. He is not a lone-wolf towards his friends. Tall, with dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Wears dark blue jeans or shorts, black shoes, with the shirts he wears being either completely dark blue, completely yellow, completely red, very dark blue with the word Nintendo written on the front, or black with a picture of Sonic on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther Characters (Note, there are changes, due to the fact that one woman having as many kids as Diana did in the original is unrealistic):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura: Anthony's older sister by a few months. 16 years old. She wears brown boots, jeans, and a black shirt. She has blond hair. She is a very selfish person who thinks she is better than everyone else. She still cares for her siblings, and unknown to them, has threatened Sarah to not let Zoey know the truth after kicking her butt, since Zoey cares for her step siblings and step father, and Laura doesn't want to risk Zoey distancing herself from them. Kimberly kept custody of her after the divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Anthony's older brother. 20 years old. Gets along with Anthony and and the rest of their siblings, except Laura, although both care for each other. Zoey thinks Zack is just a friend of Anthony's. Kimberly kept custody of him after the divorce. Has a crush on Mary, but due to being step siblings, feels awkward about it, so he doesn't tell her. He doesn't know she feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly: Anthony's 42 year old mother. She wears black high heels, a grey skirt, and a grey shirt. She has long brown hair. A very kind person, she cares about other people and tries to help them if they need it. Sad that her family was split apart, but she and Henry just couldn't make it last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: Anthony's older step sister. 17 years old. She's shallow, liking only what's popular, and is a real witch (Not literally, just personality wise, and I won't write the word originally used to describe her that was used by the person who created her) towards Anthony and friends. Always dyes her hair to whatever hair color is popular. Fears Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna: Anthony's younger step sister. 15 years old. Just started the swim team 3 months ago. She has a long, straight golden hair, average eyes, pointy nose, and her mouth is not big, but not small, and she always smile in front of people, and giggles as she talks, which makes her look cute on the face. She is thin, and moderately short, around 160+cm in height, she has the breast of C-cup sized, it's not that big. She is also good in sports, and intelligent in her work, and she is popular among her age group, but not exactly as popular as school models. She looks up to and respects Anthony. She loves anime and video games. She wears a wide variety of clothes, but wears a green one-piece bathing suit while swimming. She has a crush on Anthony, but feels awkward about it, due to Zoey not knowing, and them being step siblings, so she hides it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy: Anthony's younger brother. 13 years old. Loves video games. Has a crush on Bethany, although she doesn't know (more info will be added when someone expands upon it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey: Anthony's younger step sister. 10 years old. She is majorly in love with Anthony, but due to thinking that they are actually related, she feels awkward about her feelings and hides them, acting like she just has a brother complex, however, if she found out the truth, she would make no effort to hide her feelings. She likes her friends, and unlike Sarah, she doesn't like populars or following them. She has a shortish, light brown hair in pigtails, amber-colored eyes and a smile that fits greatly on her face. She has normal breasts, not too big because she's so young. She wears mostly skirts and shirts, but she has some jeans, and sometimes she wears dresses, she loves all colors equally, and thus, she has many different colors of clothing. She likes candy (mainly chocolate), playing videogame, and she loves love stories. Anthony likes her too and they've always gotten along. She has the personality of a cute 10 year innocent girl, she wouldn't do anything bad even if forced to. She knows her brother is a nice person and inspires in him. She loves being praised and is a hard worker. Would do everything for her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia: Anthony's twin sister who gets along with him very well. Her favorite fictional character is Mia from the Fire Emblem series, because they share the same name, and similar personalities. She naturally has black hair, but always dyes it purple in order to be like her favorite character. She is almost always wearing a skirt or dress. She likes sports (one of the few kinds of things that she doesn't wear a skirt for), but can't stand cheerleaders. She is easily excitable, more so when she has some kind of sugar (which is why she usually isn't allowed by her family to have any when at home or out at a family event).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she has some kind of sugar, then she gets so hyper that she sometimes starts pulling pranks, although they're never harmful. She is an odd mix of being a tomboy and girly-girl, but gets annoyed with girls who are complete girly-girls. Shares Anthony's love of the sword, anime, and video games, but because of how hyper she is, she hardly ever reads books, because she think they're too boring for the most part.. She's a little faster than Anthony, but a little weaker. She is also a couple minutes younger than him. She's always wanted to have a full on twin telepathy, and secretly wishes that Anthony and herself would share one mind, no matter if it would be one of them in charge, or a merger of their minds (that being said, Anthony's powers prevent him from being controlled or subverted)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary: Anthony's older step sister who is in college. 21 years old. Waist length, dark brown hair kept in a ponytail, same eyes as Anthony, shorter than Anthony but athletic. Humble and willing to help out. She enjoys playing video games with Anthony a bit. Likes spending time with friends and Anthony when possible. Adapt at video games somewhat (not as much as Anthony or the others), pretty fast as she almost beat a track record. Nimble as well (as in she could be an excellent thief if she desired) She likes sticking up for people when they feel oppressed, she has a strong sense of justice, and she is a tomboy. Prefers to wear a lavender sweater over a white tank top, along regular jeans and white shoes. She has a crush on Zack, but since they are step siblings, feels awkward about it, and doesn't tell him. She doesn't know that he feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana: Anthony's step mother. She is a widow, with her late husband being Henry's cousin. She married Henry a little over a year after her late husband's death, during that time, Zoey was born. Since Henry has the same last name as her married name, Zoey hasn't been able to find anything weird about it that could cause her to figure out. (This is all for her for now, I'll update it if/when she is used again)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry: Anthony's father. 42 years old. Is in the military, but his section hasn't been called in to outside conflict at the time. He is about to begin some military training required, and won't be back for two weeks. He'll either leave while Anthony is at school, or the next day, depending on who is writing. Originally married to Kimberly, but they couldn't make it last. All of his kids blame him for splitting up the family. (more info will be added when someone expands upon it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie: Anthony's step aunt. 35 years old. A near mirror image of Megan (mentioned later). Tall and slender, she goes on business trips for a technology company she and her late husband co-owned. She always dresses professionally, and is completely dedicated to her work and children. She is fearful of taking the children with her, traveling due to the nature of her husband's death, but she calls them two times each day, fifteen minutes each. To relax, she practices Tai Chi (a non violent form of martial arts). She drives a cherry red corvette. She will be on her business trip for three months, working on a contract deal with a European company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle: Natalie's husband. Deceased. He was tall and muscular with jet black hair and deep blue eyes. He traveled across the globe, taking care of business abroad while his wife worked at home, raising their three daughters. He was shot in the heart by a robber he had cornered inside his apartment while on a business trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta: Natalie's oldest daughter. 16 years old. Tall and slender, like her mom, jet black hair and piercing green eyes. She is cold to anyone she does not know, will warm up though... given time. Jacinta is the top cheerleader in her school but prefers to play football as she is strong for her age. She hates video games of any kind as she is into real adventures such as mountain climbing or cave exploring... would climb a building, if it were not frowned upon, lives for the next challenge. She prefers to wear blue jeans and snug fitting shirts, of earth tone colors, and boots. She is on the cheer team to be closer to the game she would prefer to play. Jacinta had a fair relationship with Megan, but the two have not talked since receiving news of their father's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah: Natalie's daughter, and the middle child of the sisters. 14 years old. Short for her age, with shoulder length brown hair and gentle green eyes. She is a tomboy, kind to all, but she can fight well, if provoked enough. Hannah is a member of the junior ROTC, low rank but eager to learn. She is into martial arts of any kind, has a black belt in Kung fu and Karate. She is a big fan of the Kamen Rider series. Hannah loves video games and is often teased by Jacinta for playing them, causing the occasional fights. Hannah loves to wear skirts and dresses. She is more popular with the boys than her older sister, which often drives her crazy. She got along very well with Megan but has been quiet since their father's death... seeing a pattern here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: Natalie's youngest daughter. 13 years old. Andy's height, with waist length brown hair, and curiously deep blue eyes and doll like features. She is very intelligent for her age and very quiet, but she will speak if surprised or impressed, which is not very often. Megan prefers to dress professionally, usually wearing a modest length skirt and dark colored blouse. She frowns upon video games, but will play if challenged. She loves to read and watch TV. Megan is a dreamer with a wish to actually visit the Pokemon world she loves to watch. She is deeply hurt, losing her father, worse, having her family spit up while mom does the traveling. Megan secretly fears that the same fate awaits her mother and is constantly worried. She has a hidden crush on Anthony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy: 16 years old. She has long blonde hair, is kind of pretty, and wears a lot of make-up. She recently moved next door to Anthony. She wears black fingerless gloves, and black jeans. She wears combat boots which always cover her pant leg bottoms, and have striped black and red laces. She normally has 3 different belts on at the same time, she wears a dark blue shirt all the time, but nobody will see it because she has a long black jacket, that everyone thinks is a dress at first sight. She wears a necklace, the chain is metal tubing, while the amulet is that of a creature with red eyes. The eyes are rubbies. She has blue eyes and wears black lip stick. She is a gothic person by apperance, but is she really gothic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael: 16 years old. He has short brown hair that is very messy, but not stubble. Kind of an average body, not muscly, but not feeble. Doesn't really go out with girls, is a bit of a loner (This is mainly because of his rather obscene addiction to video games, especially Pokemon).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna: 16 years old. She has long white hair, dark skin and bright green eyes. She wears a red, white, and blue jacket with a Puerto Rican flag on the backside. She also wears a pair of pitch black jeans and red and white chucks. Laid back, yet somehow, easily excitable. She loves video games, knows Spanish, but not as good for some rules as most people from Puerto Rico when she was younger, and was teased for it when she went to school there. Her mother is dead, and a spiteful girl named Marivi who lives in Puerto Rico made fun of her for it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany: 13 years old. She has long, straight, blond hair that comes halfway down her back, and blue eyes. She wears dresses and skirts most of the time, usually yellow, and she wears yellow knee-length boots with them, but wears dark blue biker shorts, a yellow shirt, and black shoes when doing physical activities and a yellow one-piece bathing suit when swiming. She is very shy, and has a crush on Andy (Just like she doesn't know Andy likes her, he doesn't know she likes him). Likes anime, video games, and cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria: Bethany's older sister, and Sarah's best friend. 17 years old. Like Sarah, she is a shallow witch, only caring about what's popular. She is also on the cheerleading squad. She is dumb, to the point where others wonder how she has enough brains to keep passing her classes (Anthony, his siblings, except Sarah, and his friends suspect that it has to do with her boyfriend, who is mentioned right below). She has long, blond hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike: 17 years old. Maria's boyfriend, and the Quarterback on the school's football team, he isn't much brighter than Maria, so Anthony, his siblings (except Sarah), and his friends suspect that the teachers are changing his grades since he is so good at football. Has short brown hair, brown eyes, and very big muscules. He gets annoyed at the fact that Anthony, his siblings (except Sarah, who he has no problem with since she's Maria's best friend), and his friends aren't afraid of him and won't let him push them around. He doesn't try to mess with Anthony, or anyone Anthony gets along with anymore since Katherine (mentioned a little farther down) sent her bodyguards after him when he attacked Anthony in front of her once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarivi: 16 years old. An old classmate of Brianna's who loved torturing her before Brianna moved (more info will be added when someone expands upon it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose: 15 years old. Anna's best friend, who has a major crush on Anthony, who doesn't know it. As her name implies, she loves flowers. She usually wears a pink dress with flower designs on it and sneakers. She has long, straight, brown hair and brown eyes. She is very kind to people who aren't rude to her and her friends. She likes anime and video games. Like Anna, she is on the swim team and kickball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine: 16 years old. A rich girl, but she isn't a snob. Her father is dead, but it didn't matter too much to her because he didn't care much for her and was always away on business, and her mother, although still alive, is very much the same. Because of how she grew up, she believes everything can be bought by money (although, as I said, she's not a snob).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony once saved her life by getting her out of the way of a car that came out of nowhere and was going to hit her as she was crossing the road, and ever since, she has been in love with him. She doesn't understand why he didn't agree to become her boyfriend after she offered to pay him a large amount of money to do so, because of how she believes anything can be bought. Anthony, his family (except for Sarah, who encouraged him to accept so that she could try to take the money from him), and his friends got annoyed when she tried to buy his love, although they were thankful when she sent her bodyguards after Mike to protect Anthony (except, of course, for Sarah). Henry, Norman, and John are the only males she has working for her. She lets her friends, her uncle Henry, and Anthony call her Kat, but no one else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually wears a sparkling silver dress with gems imbedded in it, expensive bracelets, a diamond necklace, and silver high-heeled shoes, although, despite the way she dresses, she is a bit of a tomboy, and likes many sports (she dresses the way she does, because her mother wants her to keep up the family's good image in front of the media). She lives in a mansion, and rides in a limo whenever she isn't going on foot. She loves video games, and has every console system, along with most of the games for them. She has long, straight, black hair and blue eyes. She knows martial arts, and is good at it, so she can easily handle most threats on her own, and her bodyguards can handle most of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra: 23 years old. One of Katherine's bodyguards. Short black hair and blue eyes. Always wears a black suit, black boots, and sunglasses when on duty. She never shows emotion while on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn: 26 years old. One of Katherine's bodyguards. Short brown hair and brown eyes. Always wears a black suit, black boots, and sunglasses when on duty. He never shows emotion while on duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine: 24 years old. One of Katherine's bodyguards, who is on duty whenever either Sandra or John are not on duty to make it so Katherine has two bodyguards at a time. Short blond hair with blue eyes. Always wears a black suit, black boots, and sunglasses when on duty. She never shows emotion while on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry: 38 years old Katherine's uncle on her father's side. Unlike his late brother and his sister in law, he cares for Katherine, and wants the best for her. He is rich (although not as rich as his sister in law and Katherine), but he is very humble, always donating money to worthy causes. He works as Katherine's Chauffeur by his own will so he can have a reason to watch over her. He met Anthony about a week before Katherine met him. Anthony and Henry get along well, and Henry hopes that Anthony will fall in love with and marry Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman: 46 years old. Katherine's butler. He is more like a father to her than her real father was, and always helps her out. He knows martial arts. He wants nothing but happiness for Katherine, and after finding out about her feelings for Anthony, found out more about him, and approves of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill: 16 years old. Has brunet colored hair and bright blue eyes. A bit of a brave heart she won't let anything deter her from her dream job. She wears mostly the color blue and her favorite outfit is a bright blue tank top with a dark blue skirt that is so dark that people think that it is black blue sneakers. She loves to dance and likes to have fun. Her favotire game is DDR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dream is to become a dancer like ballet, or something like that. She recently met Anthony a month ago, and has developed feeling for him, though he doesn't know that, and in turn he has a bit of a crush on her. She's an only child, so she gets lonely, but Anthony helps solve that by putting his number into her cell, and telling her to call him if she ever feels lonely. She has another hobby, which she keeps to herself, as she's a little embarressed because of it. She's a massive anime fanatic. She lives by herself as her parents had died a year before she met Anthony, leading her to have deperession, but that cleared up mostly after meeting Anthony. She always wears a broken heart necklase that her mother got her for fifthteenth birthday, which is May 30th. She is currently sixteen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lives in a dirty apartment, which she's doesn't clean due to her depression issue. Her parents lived with her in that appartment until they died. She prefers to go out instead of stay in and cry, but she sleeps alone, and sometimes cries herself to sleep due to being lonely (that is, until she met Anthony, of course). Anthony offen takes her with him when ever he goes out to play at the local arcade. He even bought DDR in order to play with her at his house.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCarol: 24 years old. Has black hair that goes down to her shoulder blades, and blue eyes. She is a police officer. Her uniform consists of a dark blue shirt, a black skirt, black boots with a slight heel, and a pair of black leggings. Tends to be a little short with people, especially because of her large breasts, which cause guys to stare at them quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an airship that can only be seen or touched by Anthony or someone with a piece of him inside of them. The airship automatically transports to what ever world that Anthony's main body is in. It is controlled by the program Diva (Digital Interactive Virtual Assistant), which obeys Anthony's will. Diva and all technology on the ship are immune to any outside influences. Diva can reprogram the brains of others by having electrical charges reprogram their brains, but in they are immune to electricity, then their brains can't be reprogrammed. The stronger the will, the more resistance the person who Diva is trying to reprogram has. Diva can possess one girl at a time, and use her as a host, so that she can interact with the outside world. The ship has a digital viewer function that can make a digitized version of a series that doesn't use screens that Anthony and Anthony alone is the only one other than Diva's digital for that can enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you create a character, then you must give the details about them, such as their appearance and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you have just finished school for the year.</td>",
