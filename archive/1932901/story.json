But since your new in the zoo world you do need publicity to stay in business but how will you do that? You don't even have animals in your zoo yet and the zoo will open with in two days, but as you look in the news paper you notice an article on the front page which said 'celebrities gain more popularity each day' even tho you had no idea why an article like this was considered news you realized what you should do. You came with the idea to transform celebrities into animals for in your zoo, that should help you with getting some publicity. And since you were raised by gypsies and they taught you the art of magic it wouldn't be such a big deal. But how would you do that as most fans would be upset about their favorite celebrity being transformed into an animal. Maybe you know a spell that could help you with that, maybe you could erase their memory about the celebrity but then most people wouldn't notice your zoo since in their eyes the celebrity is just another animal. But maybe you could manage to make them think that their favorite has always been a animal, and if the fans are being a pain you could also make them join their celebrity you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay but now let's get to business which celebrity would make a lovely first addition to the zoo...</span></div></div>",

Something you wouldn't be able see on a regular basis, something large an impressive, something.... Ah, you had the perfect idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a call to Hayley's agent, making up some story about a charity fundraiser. Hayley agreed to fly over the next day, and when you saw her you couldn't believe your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley Williams had a small and petite build. She wasn't much taller than 5ft and though she carried herself with confidence, she was too short to give of much of a presence. In other words, she was the ideal candidate to be turned into a big, heavy hippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she seemed a little weirded out by her surroundings, Hayley came to greet you with an optimistic smile on her face. She had no idea what was about to happen to her, but in a way, she was going to be helping out a needy cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" She said, extending her hand out to you. \"I'm Hayley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accepted her hand, taking this moment to transfer some magical energy into her. There was a spark of purple energy, causing Hayley to recoil as she began to feel the changes quickly take effect. Her belly was the most noticeable, bounding out and flopping over the waist of her jeans. She was obviously startled, having grown a big fat gut in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not right....\" Hayley said, dryly. She used her hands to lift up her oversized belly, feeling the very real weight and looking at you accusingly. \"Did you do this? What's happening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your help.\" You explained, calmly and sincerely. \"My zoo will never achieve success without animals to populate it. I needed a reason for people to come here, something special that you can't get anywhere else. A few exotic animals may be a start, but what if my attractions were celebrities? Who wouldn't want to see Hayley the Hippo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm.... turning into a hippo?\" Hayley wondered, staring down at her fat belly as her skin started to turn a darker shade.</span></div></div>",

Maybe even your voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing!\" Hayley whelped. \"I don't know how to thank you enough. I bet I'm going to be huge, right? So big and fat that I can barely move around. I won't have any responsibilities anymore, no problems. All I have to do is be a hippo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all.\" You answered, not expecting such an enthusiastic reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley's approval was actually speeding up the process of her transformation. She was positively glowing as the sides of her shirt split open to allow her belly fat to ooze out in dozens of rolls that pulled taut into a smooth, round gut. Her shirt was reduced to tatters, but that was only the first casualty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt was the next to grow, blimping up into a meaty set of hindquarters. Hayley's jeans gave up easily, though her panties were putting up a good fight wrapped around her chunky rear. The skin on her ass morphed to a deep grey, with subtle hints of purple and pink. Hayley had a hippo's ass, and it was only a matter of time before she was a woman no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a such a heavy gut and a fat ass....\" Hayley moaned, patting her thick hide. \"I love being so big! Make sure that people come to see me, won't you? I want everyone to know that Hayley Williams is a massive hippo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her your word, watching as Hayley's breasts retreated and her bare underside curved outward. She fell to her knees, marveling as her hands and feet hardened into something far more hoof-like. Her entire body was growing chunky, changing all of her proportions until she was supersized. Lastly, her jaw widened to make her entire head larger and longer. Her nose retracted and her ears rounded into small flops on the side of her head. Hayley was just a huge hippo now, with nothing left to recognize her except for the patch of orange hair on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley?\" You asked. \"How are you feeling?\"</span></div></div>",

She smiles as you greet her, clearly liking the aesthetic of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Hayley.\" She introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was just as gorgeous in person as she looked in photos. Her bright orange hair hung down to her shoulders, perfectly framing her beautiful smile. She was wearing simple clothes, with the outline of her small breasts visible on her black t-shirt. Hayley was better known for her ass, but you weren't quite able to get a look at it. The singer was certainly on the skinny side, and you had to suppress a smirk at the idea of her turning into a big fat sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered you her hand, allowing you the perfect opportunity to imbue your magic within her. Purple energy glowed from between your palms as you shook her hand, taking hold of Hayley as she relinquished her grasp in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me!?\" Hayley gasped, looking at you accusingly. \"What did you do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Hayley.\" You apologized sincerely. \"You must have noticed how sparse the attractions in my zoo are. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I'm sure you'll make for a fine pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm turning into a pig!?\" Hayley yelped, taking a big gulp as the reality of her situation set in.</span></div></div>",

Her ass followed suit, bulging up until they overflowed her pants. The seam of her jeans split open as a springy tail poked through it, causing the retreating girl to squeal in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This can't be happening!\" Hayley said, rejecting the reality of her situation. \"I can't be a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley's snout grew in next, transforming her face into a much chubbier version of itself.

Pig girl though she may be for the moment, the news that she could be something else was alleviating her worries.

Her arms melded with her torso, and her breasts flattened until everything bellow her collar was one long cylinder. She showed panic on her face, but then all of her features, including her hair, vanished, leaving only a round nub as her head. She wriggled around helplessly as she began to shrink, her clothes collapsing on top of her.

She smiles as you clasp her palm, activating the glyph and sending a wave of magic coursing through her. You retract your hand to find it sticky. Hayley's arms are turning green, and she's positively lit up as she watches her skin moisten with slime. Her stomach and breasts swell, soaking her clothes with a sickly excretion before her growing assets tore the clothes to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels incredible!\" She moaned as her pants popped at the waist. \"I've always wanted to do that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley's butt poured out through the top of her pants, green as her belly and just as large. Her arms were pulled inward to merge with her torso, and not much lower her legs were fusing together, too. Her front started to take on a paler tone of green, while her sides and back grew darker. Hayley's boobs were excreting more slime that dripped down her naked body, covering her underside in a coating that would keep her mobile. She was just a giant slug with a human head for now, but that wouldn't last much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo long antennae-like protrusions sprouted from her forehead, jutting through her hair just as the red shades retreated into her skin. Her ears were next, and then Hayley's entire face lost it's features as she morphed into a creature not so reliant on sight or smell. It was only now that she started to shrink, becoming smaller until she was nothing but a grub left to crawl over her own jeans. The transformation had been a success, not only in body, but also of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accidentally sat on a slug once.\" She said, communicating through your magic. \"It burst immediately, covering my ass in it's slime. I never thought that I'd be in it's shoes, but this is more than I can take in right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed a piece of paper and held it nearby so Hayley could crawled onto it. Her progress was painfully slow, but then, she was a slug. She left a trail on her jeans as she slithered her way onto the paper, thanking you for your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite welcome.\" You answer. \"How does it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..... You know when you have a really lazy day? Just sat on the couch, belly stuffed with food and just generally feeling like trash?\" Hayley replied. \"It's like that times 1000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound so bad.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not.\" Answered Hayley the Slug. \"Just find me a lettuce leaf or something and I'll gorge myself all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set down Hayley and busied yourself with emptying out an old fish tank. Then you went to the fridge and grabbed a few shreds of lettuce, placing them in the tank before dropping Hayley onto them. She transferred onto the leaf without issue, crawling further up the stem and settling in to nibble away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is strangely comfortable.\" Hayley said, oozing her slime everywhere. \"I think I might take a nap.\"</span></div></div>",

Her sides and belly were swelling as she spoke, pouring out from under her shirt before a surge in size from her gut tore the black fabric away entirely. Hayley's belly flopped out, a huge squishy mass of flesh that was getting pulled taut by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boobs were the next to grow, bursting out of her bra and spilling out to give you any eyeful. This was the first time that Hayley could say she had big boobs, and she was eager to fondle them. As she squeezed her nips, another set of breasts formed along the curvature of her swollen gut, and then a further pair below that. Hayley's nipples were incredibly prominent, and she had to resist the temptation to start suckling on them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a satisfying tear as the redhead's pant were split apart by the rapid expansion of her ass. You got a good look at it now, and Hayley actually seemed eager that you got to see it. She stuck her butt out as her pale moons rounded out into plump spheres of a rubbery, bright pink texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley squealed, yes <i>squealed</i>, as a curly corkscrew of a tail sprouted from just above her now massive behind. She wiggled her rump playfully, clearly loving her enlarged form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Paramore performer was very fat now, with her clothes reduced to nothing more than tatters. She instinctively got down on all fours as her toes and fingers fused to form hardened trotters. She was very much looking the part now, and you couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as Hayley stared at you with a wide smile as her nose grew and flattened into a large snout. Her ears were the last to go, lengthening into big and floppy pig ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was mostly a pig at this point, and you had never guessed that she would be so happy. If you wanted crowds to gather to see Hayley Williams the pig girl, then you already had the perfect specimen.

You let the transformation continue, watching with a smile as Hayley's body swelled further. Every inch of her was rounding out, particularly the drooping curve that made up her underside. Her breasts grew with it; adorning her low hanging stomach with several rows of pert teats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the girl's clothes fell to her trotters as she stepped out of them, using her new quadrupedal form for the first time. She was almost finished now, with just her head to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair retracted, pulling back into her skull and leaving a wrinkly surface of pink skin behind. It was odd to behold until her bone structure changed shape, losing height and gaining length as her snout became even more prominent. She snorted happily while her cheeks sank in and the last of her human features became as porcine as the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oink, oink!</i>\" Hayley sounded, plodding towards you and wiggling her plump figure. \"What do you think? Am I pig enough for your zoo?\"</span></div></div>",
