That is; Jenny was getting ready, while Oliver was watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny had just finished getting into her pajamas, when a voice called up to her from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, you did remember to brush your teeth, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice belonged to Winston, the Foxworth family's bumbling but loyal butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I remembered!\" Jenny yelled back. \"Goodnight, Winston!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hint, Winston simpy yelled back: \"Goodnight, young lady!\" and that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Jenny walked over to Oliver and lifted him up so she could look him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winston is such a worrywart, isn't he?\" giggled Jenny to Oliver. Oliver meowed in agreement. Still giggling, Jenny walked over to her bed and sat on it, still holding Oliver in her hands. \"Just because my parents are away on important buissness again, he becomes overprotective, even though he doesn't have to. This isn't like the last time; I've got you to watch over me now, Oliver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver purred happily in response. Jenny got up and walked over and placed Oliver in his basket and wished him a good night. She then went back to her bed and tugged herself in under the blanket. Looking over at Oliver in his basket, she giggled again at the sight of Oliver making himself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's so nice to have Oliver around,' thought Jenny. 'And he must have it nice, too. He gets to stay home and play all day, while I have to go to school. And though I do like being at school, I wouldn't mind being able to stay at home, like him, if only for a few days.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the room, Oliver was looking at Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jenny is always so nice to me,' he thought. 'I'm sure it must be the reason why she has so many friends. Her parents, Winston, the other children at that 'school' place; they're all so nice to her and she to them. Sure, I have friends too, but not nearly as many as Jenny seems to have.' Oliver yawned. 'I wouldn't mind having as many friends as she has. It must be so nice.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenny and Oliver kept looking at each other, the last thought that went through their heads, before Jenny turned off the lights, was exactly the same:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know; I really wouldn't mind being you for a few days!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat very night, a shooting star could be seen in the sky. As it passed over the Foxworth house, something strange happened to Jenny and Oliver. A tiny ball of light came out of both of their sleeping forms. Then, the light that had come from Oliver went into Jenny's body and the light that had come from Jenny went into Oliver's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jenny and Oliver would be in for a big surprise the next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wakes up first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oliver yawned. He had had a very odd dream that night; instead of Jenny being his owner, he had been Jenny's owner! And Jenny had been acting like him and he like her; Jenny had been meowing and walked on all fours and had been standing on two legs and wore a tiny version of those things that Jenny called 'clothes'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to himself about the absurdity of the dream, Oliver blinked the sleep out of his eyes, lifted his head and opened his eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed, was that for some odd reason, his body didn't feel quite right. The second thing was that the room seemed smaller to him. The third thing was that he had somehow ended up in Jenny's bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver was confused by this; he was sure that he went to sleep in his basket last night, so how did he end up in Jenny's bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a look around the room; there was the window were the sunlight could be seen outside the curtains, that funny indoor plant in the corner, Jenny's funny wooden thing with the small slide-out places where Jenny kept some of her 'clothes', himself asleep in his basket, the door into the bedroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute... himself asleep in his basket?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver had to blink a few times to make sure he wasn't still asleep. Sure enough; there he was, soundly asleep in his basket!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver just stared; this made no sense to him... How could he be looking at himself like this? He knew he was awake, so he definitely wasn't dreaming. So then, how come he was looking at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's eyes grew wide as he remembered two things; the dream he had earlier, and what he had thought about before he fell asleep last night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver had to swallow a lump in his throat. It couldn't be... Such a thing would be impossible! But what other reason could there be for this? Taking a deep breath, Oliver prepared himself for the worst, closed his eyes, moved his head downwards and opened his eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of being prepared for the possiblility, Oliver was still shocked beyond measure at what he saw; instead of seeing his tag and orange-furred paws, he saw a pair of human arms and upper body, covered in something soft and pink, that looked like those kinds of 'clothes' that Jenny wore at night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver was practically paralyzed with shock. This couldn't be real, right?!!! But he had to be sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of Jenny's bed was that wooden thing were Jenny kept those 'clothes' things... what had Jenny called it, a 'cup-board' or something like that? Anyway, on top of that was something Jenny had called... was it 'tell-a-vision?... It was some kind of funny black box with glass on the front of it. When Jenny did something with a smaller black thing, the glass on the box would suddenly show all kinds of funny things and noise would come out of it too. All other times, Oliver was able to see his own reflection in the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his head to the left, Oliver looked at that glass again. But it wasn't the reflection he was used to; instead of seeing his usual orange-furred reflection with the blue collar on his neck, he saw the reflection of a red-haired human girl, with a frightened expression on her face! What's more, that face was very familiar; it was his owner, Jenny's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few horrified seconds, before Oliver's kitten-brain registered what was going on and when it did, the realization hit Oliver like a ton of bricks: HE WAS A HUMAN!!! HE WAS HIS OWNER!!! HE HAD SOMEHOW ENDED UP IN JENNY'S BODY!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this revelation, Oliver fell out of the bed with fright. The pain he felt when he hit the floor, illiminated any remaining possiblility that he was just experiencing an extremely realistic dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver got further confirmation of his current situation when he moaned from the pain; it was Jenny's voice that came out of his mouth, not his own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's first reaction was to freak out; laying on his back and flailing his - or rather Jenny's - limbs around in the air. After a little while he had calmed down enough to stop his flailing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmed down, but still frightened, Oliver first flipped himself over, so he was laying down on his -Jenny's- stomach. Then he looked himself over, again, just to be sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep; he was definitely in Jenny's body! Instead of having paws he now had hands and feet, the only hairs on his body was on the top of his new head, and just like with his new arms, his new legs were also covered by another of those 'clothes' things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's mind was in overdrive: 'This is wrong; really wrong!!! I know I thought that I wouldn't mind being Jenny for a few days, but it's just one of those things you say!!! I didn't think I would ACTUALLY become her!!! I'm supposed to be the pet, not the owner!!! I'm a kitten, not a human!!! I don't even know how to BE a human!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a lot of trial-and-error, Oliver managed to sit up. He began inspecting his new body even further, starting with the hands. The hands and arms felt so weird to poor Oliver; they were much more dexterious than his fore-legs were and it was an even weirder feeling when he opened and closed the fingers on his new hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Jenny's entire body felt weird to him. It was not only much bigger than what he was used to, but her limbs also moved differently than his own. A good example of this, was when he got an itch behind one of his new ears. Oliver attempted to scratch it like he usually would; with one of his hind-legs. But of course, since Oliver currently occupied Jenny's body, it didn't go as well as he had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he found out, Jenny's leg couldn't bend enough for him to use it to scratch his ear. Oliver instead resorted to shaking his -Jenny's- head hard from side to side to make the itch go away, causing his -Jenny's- hair to flap around his new head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver was still disdraught, even though he had gotten rid of the itch. Not surprising, given the fact that he was a kitten in the body of a human; his own owner, no less. It didn't help that he could feel Jenny's 'clothes' brushing against his new hairless skin, every time he moved. It was a very uncomfortable feeling for him, since he was only used to wearing his collar around his neck, not these 'clothes' -thingies that Jenny always wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver didn't know what to do. He just sat there for a moment, wondering again how he had ended up in Jenny's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Since he was in Jenny's body, did that mean that Jenny was... Oliver looked over at his basket, were he could still see his own body sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I'm in Jenny, is she now in me?' thought Oliver. There was only one way to find out: He had to get over there and wake 'himself' up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, again, it wasn't quite that easy. Since Oliver was still a kitten in mind, he attempted to walk as he normally would. But, since he was in Jenny's body, it ended up being more awkward than helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, when he got Jenny's body up to stand on all fours, with his new body's hands and feet planted flat on the floor, he found that his new backside was now elevated higher than his head was. For another, it meant that Oliver had difficulty balancing because of it. Jenny's body simply wasn't built for walking like Oliver's normal body. Unfortunately for Oliver, he was forced to walk like this, because he didn't know how to walk on only two legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, Oliver walked over to 'himself' in the basket. When he got there, he got down on his -Jenny's- knees and then used his new nose to nuzzle his sleeping body to wake it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver watched as his normal body turned it's head towards him, yawned and opened it's eyes. Those eyes grew wide, when it noticed Oliver's new body. His normal body looked down on itself, then at Oliver, then back to itself again a few times. Then came the hysteria; Oliver's former body let out a meow-like shriek and started to roll around in a panic, letting out lots of frightened cat-sounds in his voice while doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now clear to Oliver that Jenny indeed occupied what used to be his body. And from the look, and sound, of it, Jenny was appearently just as frightened about this situation as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting Jenny to hurt herself, or his body, Oliver attempted to purr and meow, as he had done before to calm her down. Unfortunately, Jenny's vocal cords weren't designed to make such noises, so Oliver ended up making noises that sounded like: \"Hnnnnnnn!\" and \"Rrrraaahhhhwww!\" in Jenny's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, even though the sounds didn't come out as Oliver expected, it still had the desired effect; Jenny stopped flailing around in Oliver's body and turned her new kitten-head towards Oliver, looking straight into her former body's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, the body-swapped human and kitten looked into their former bodies eyes, doing nothing else but stare at each other. Jenny was the first one to break the ice, as she tried to talk to Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver, what's going on?!? How did we end up like this?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jenny, since Oliver was currently in her body, he also had her ears, meaning that all Oliver heard was nothing more than a a long series of meows. However, Jenny quickly realized that Oliver wouldn't be able to understand her now, so she tried another way to make herself understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Oliver was upset over the fact, that he could no longer understand what his own body was saying, he was impressed that Jenny instead his body's facial expressions and head movement to make clear to Oliver what she wanted them to do first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what exactly was that?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Through various gestures, facial expressions and meows, Jenny managed to 'say' to Oliver what she thought they should do first; namely learning how to walk properly in each others bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver thought that was a really good idea. When he had walked like a kitten would in Jenny's body, it had felt so unnatural. But, since neither of them knew how they had swapped bodies, or for how long they would stay this way, it seemed like a wise course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to simply go for it, Oliver attempted to stand up on Jenny's two legs. But, that was a lot easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was currently in the body of an eight-year-old human girl, Oliver was still a kitten in mind. As such, even though he was very smart for a kitten, he still had no idea how to stand upright, or even balance, in a human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when Oliver tried to stand up on Jenny's two legs, he instantly lost his balance and fell over, landing hard on his -Jenny's- butt. Groaning in pain, Oliver tried again, but got the same result. After three more tries, falling over each time, Oliver looked with sad eyes at Jenny, in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the problems that Oliver were having, Jenny used one of Oliver's paws to 'point' at one of the bedposts; namely the one right next to Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver understood right away. Since he was right next to the bedpost, he could hold on to it, in order to stand up. Or at least try to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for the bedpost, Oliver attempted to grab a hold of it, using Jenny's hands. It wasn't easy for him; he wasn't used to having hands and fingers, after all. After a few tries, Oliver managed to use Jenny's hands to get a firm grip on the bedpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his new arms, Oliver slowly lifted his new body up. When he got up far enough, Oliver manouvered Jenny's legs from being on their knees, to having both of her feet flat on the floor, and then continued lifting his -Jenny's- body up. As he slowly lifted himself higher, Oliver realized just how difficult it was for him to be in Jenny's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving walked on four legs his whole life, it was very hard for Oliver to even balance on just two, even though he held on to the bedpost. As he continued to lift himself higher, Oliver could feel his -Jenny's- legs wobbling beneath him like Jell-o in an earthquake. It was hard for them not to, considering that they and the human body they belonged to, was now being inhabited and controlled by a kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Oliver finally got Jenny's body up on her two legs, the first thing he felt was dizzyness. He wasn't used to having his line of sight so high above the floor, after all. Tightening his grip on the bedpost to avoid falling over, Oliver waited until the dizzyness had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it passed, Oliver found that he still had to tightly grip the bedpost. If not, he would have fallen over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a kitten inside a human's body, was weird enough for Oliver. But standing up on only two legs was even weirder, since he had walked on four legs his whole life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was still a kitten in mind, the feeling of standing on only two legs felt thoroughly wrong to Oliver. His new human legs were shaking like crazy, due to him not being used to them. His cat-brain was also playing tricks on him, telling his body to get down on all fours again, but Oliver knew he couldn't do that while in Jenny's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of tries, Oliver finally managed to make Jenny's legs stop shaking; at least enough for him to try and stand on them, without holding on to the bedpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Oliver let go of the bedpost. Since he he still didn't know how to balance on Jenny's legs, he immediately began to fall backwards and he had to quckly grasp onto the bedpost again to prevent it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver wasn't deterred; he just tried again. Still, it took many attempts before he finally succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten the basic measure of Jenny's body's balance, Oliver tried to stand, for the seventeenth time. This time, he managed to stand on Jenny's legs for three seconds, before he started to tip over. Spreading out Jenny's arms on either side of her torso, Oliver tried to regain his balance. Jenny's body's torso swayed forwards and backwards, with Oliver swinging her arms around, eventually succeeding in regaining his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up on just two legs felt very weird to Oliver, even though he was pleased that he was finally standing up without holding on to something. However, he still wasn't completely steady on Jenny's legs. He could still feel them wobbling slightly under him, but not enough to make him loose his balance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was standing upright, Oliver took the time to see how Jenny was doing in his body. As it turned out, she was having almost as much trouble being in his body, as he had being in hers. Judging by the way his former body stumbled about, Jenny also had difficulties balancing on her new legs. However, unlike Oliver, Jenny was appearrently trying to balance in Oliver's body and trying to walk on his four legs at the same time, resulting in the stumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy that he wasn't the only one having problems with a new body, Oliver geared himself up for a tougher challenge than just standing on two legs; namely, walking on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was standing up on Jenny's body's legs, Oliver wasn't quite certain that he would be able to keep his balance on them, if he were to attempt to walk on them. But, there was only one way to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a lump in his -Jenny's- throat, Oliver lifted up one of Jenny's legs. As soon as he did, he had to grab hold of the bedpost again to stop himself from falling. While he had figured out how to balance on Jenny's body's two legs, he wasn't yet comfortable enough with them, to keep that balance while 'walking'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this little mishap, Oliver decided to hold on to the bedpost again to get used to this too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten used to balancing on two legs, it didn't take as long as it could have done for Oliver to get used to this. Still, this was an even weirder feeling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver was used to moving all four limbs when walking, so for him to move just two to do it, felt highly unnatural for him. It didn't help that Jenny's legs moved differently than his own hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver started by simply lifting one of Jenny's legs at a time, lowering it and then lifting the other leg. Though it felt weird, Oliver did this a few times to get used to it. When he felt that he was ready, Oliver once more prepared to try to walk in Jenny's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he lifted Jenny's leg this time, Oliver did manage to keep his balance, but he had to swing Jenny's arms around again to avoid falling again. Knowing that he couldn't stand up forever with one leg in the air, Oliver quickly placed it down in front of him, perhaps a little hard. Nevertheless, he had done it; he'd actually taken a step in Jenny's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncouraged, Oliver took a few more steps. Of course, since he wasn't yet good at it, the 'steps' ended up being more like stomps and very wobbley, and he still had to swing Jenny's arms around, as well as swaying her torso back and forth too, to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jenny had had her own share of problems with Oliver's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to do as Oliver had done, Jenny abandoned her previous method and focused on standing up first. Standing up on four legs wasn't as easy as she had thought. It felt weird for her to stand on four legs, since she was used to just two. Oliver's fore-limbs were the hardest to get used to; what would have been arms on a human body, were fore-legs on Oliver's. This change was one of the reasons she was having trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver's body's size was another. Since Jenny was currently in the body of her kitten, everything in her room was much bigger to her than it usually was. Being so small was very disorienting for her, further complicating her attempts to stand on Oliver's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jenny managed to stand up on Oliver's four legs, but, like Oliver in her body, she was not completely steady on her new paws yet, causing Oliver's legs to wobble a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the wobbling legs, Jenny tried to walk on Oliver's four legs. When she tried, she immediately fell down on Oliver's stomach. Getting back on Oliver's paws again, Jenny realized why she had fallen down. She had tried to move as she would have in her human body, out of habit. Ergo, she had only moved Oliver's hind legs, while she had kept his front legs stationary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying once more, Jenny slowly moved Oliver's front right leg in front of her. Then, she moved his left hind leg, then his front left leg, right hind leg, ect. It was a difficult rythm to get into, but she managed it. Of course, the walking was still very slow and wobbley, since she wasn't used to walking this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat further complicated things, was the fact that Oliver's kitten-body also had claws. Jenny didn't yet know how to control when they should be out or not. As a result, those claws kept getting snagged in the carpet, adding a further level of difficulty to an already though task, but she eventually got it under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Oliver, Jenny saw that he had learned somewhat how to 'walk' in her body. That was enough for her to think, that he was ready for the next step. Meowing to get his attention, Jenny again used gestures to let Oliver know what was next.</span></div></div>",

As soon they're done eating her we'll restore her back to normal. It's just a HARMLESS prank.\" Georgette insisted. \"Okay then.\" The Tan Chihuahua said while looking at Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes in the park. Georgette asks Rita to help her in the Kitchen at her house. While everyone else was still playing at the park, Georgette &amp; Tito set up the trap for Rita in the kitchen. \"Now tell her time come in here, Alonzo.\" The Sky-blue poodle said while preheating the oven. \"Hey Rita, come in here we're ready!\" Tito while called snickering a bit. \"Okay I'm here--!!\" Called Rita as steps on a spring  left there by Georgette &amp; Rita falls right into a large bowl filled with. \"HEY WHAT THE BIG IDEA--!!!\" Rita was cut off as the Georgette shoves a hose into her snout &amp; inflates Rita's belly to 3 ft. wide with milk &amp; Georgette yanks out the hose &amp; then has large electric whisker comes into the bowl &amp; begins spinning, slowly turning the Brown Saluki into cake batter. \"HEY!! HELP!!!!\" Cried Rita. About 2 minutes later, Rita is now Cake Batter. Georgette &amp; Tito pour Rita into a large cake pan &amp; then put her into the now fully heated oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time time later, Rita was now a fully cooked cake. Georgette decorates the Rita cake while Tito goes to get his friends. \"OK, seriously what's the big idea?!\" Growled Rita as Georgette puts the finishing touches on her. \"Relax, it's just a prank. We'll restore you when we're done.\" Georgette said as she puts the Cake in the living room... Rita is a little bit worried at this point but then decides to go along with it. After Dodger &amp; co. arrive at Georgette's house they go into the living room &amp; they see the cake not knowing it's Rita &amp; they were amazed by it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&amp; then...</span></div></div>",

She pointed her nose in the air and sniffed, she followed Oliver\u2019s scent into Jenny\u2019s room. Oliver was lying asleep in his basket; Jenny was nowhere to be found.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vulpine walked over to Oliver\u2019s basket and licked her lips as she looked in, her predatory instincts were kicking in and Oliver looked delicious. She couldn\u2019t possibly eat another creature\u2026but she was top of the food chain, it was only nature\u2019s way after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver sensed that he was being watched and woke up; he jumped when he realized he was looking directly at a Fox. \u201cw-who are you?\u201d he asked \u201cp-please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d He added as his voice trembled. Georgette simply smiled, exposing all her sharp teeth, she was enjoying teasing the cat. \u201cI was just in the neighborhood and thought I might come in for a quick snack\u201d she laughed as she started circling around Oliver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver jumped made a run for the door; Georgette ran and pounced on him before he could make it. The cat shivered in her paws \u201cplease don\u2019t eat me!\u201d he shouted. Georgette ignored his pleas and tucked into her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly slid his furry head into her jaws, taking care not to bite down. The cat\u2019s taste was interesting, like a mix of chicken and beef. Georgette mulled on the taste while Oliver kicked and begged to be let out, which didn\u2019t deter the vixen as she continued swallowing him. She gently chewed on his stomach; there was no need to rush since Jenny didn\u2019t seem to be near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all that was left of Oliver were two furry paws poking out of the vixen\u2019s muzzle. She licked them over and swallowed one last time. The bulge in her throat traveled down into her stomach where it stayed. She belched and lay down in Oliver\u2019s basket to rest while her stomach gurgled, digesting the kitty inside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
