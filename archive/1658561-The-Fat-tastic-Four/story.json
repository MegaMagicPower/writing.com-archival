Galactus had hunger pains yet again, Namor had attempted to kidnap Sue once more, and the Mole Man had tried to steal the Grand Canyon. Luckily through the efforts of Reed, Johnny, Ben, and Sue they had prevailed. But the ordeal had left them all exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was examining her body because lately she had found herself to be unattractive. Of course she still looked as fit and trim as a supermodel but to her own eyes something was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were halted when the bellowing voice of Ben Grimm rang out, calling all of them to dinner. Now normally the thought of Ben Grimm making anything would be cause for alarm but Thing had been working on his cooking skills to impress his new girlfriend Blair, who was dining with the family tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what met Sue's eyes as she made her way down to the table wasn't a meal. It was a feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were roast turkies, hams, pies of all descriptions, french fries, bratwurst, hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, salmon, in short every food that every member of the family could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed, Johnny, Franklin, and Valeria were already there along with Blair and Ben and when they saw Susan they ushered her to sit down. Doing so, Ben soon handed her a plate loaded with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit nervous and after saying a quick thanks for the food, she dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was incredible, fantastic even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Susan had polished off the first plate and went for seconds. That plate was finished faster than Reed could solve the function of pi and soon a third and fourth plate joined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result was Susan's stuffed stomach, though looking around at the table, she wasn't the only one who had stuffed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner and still stuffed, Susan returned to the mirror, cradling her distended gut. Gut it was for the round orb filled to the brim with food could not honestly be called a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan liked what she saw and for a moment she thought she might be crazy. Fat looked good on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the crazy moniker soon vanished as she struck a few poses, replaced with a determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked her big belly. If she liked her stuffed stomach so much, how much would she admire her butt when it was larger? Or her thighs? Or her face surrounded by fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would think that Susan was under the enchantment of some villain for her to be thinking these odd thoughts but such wasn't the case here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Storm was going to get fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how should she do it?</span></div></div>",

But Franklin was twelve now and beyond that phase of childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how your father and I told you not to use your powers anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's hard not to sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Well I was wondering if....maybe...you would be willing to use them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranklin now fully looked at his mother, a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to! What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was blushing now and looked around, hoping no one else was around to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to make me fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranklin blinked a few times. His neurons fired but he still couldn't process what he just heard. \"You...fat...want to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded, smiling a bit as she confessed to another person her desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I want to have a gut! I want to not be able to see my own feet no matter how hard I try. I want my butt to fill up three chairs! I want my thighs to touch no matter how far apart I spread them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last image caused Franklin to wince and his adolescent disgust brought him back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded again. \"Think of it as a trial run. Make me fat for six months and if I don't like it I'll let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want dad and the rest of the world to know that you became fat or do you want them to think that you've always been huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always been huge,\" Susan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranklin nodded and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, when I open my eyes again you'll have the body you just described. But it's going to be tricky to pull off. Also I don't know how this will affect the rest of the world. But after six months I'll ask you and if you're happy with it then that's the way reality will stay, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded and couldn't wait for her son to open his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranklin did so and gasped a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Storm had the body she had asked for. Her butt, by far the largest part of her now, stuck out like two beach balls. Her stomach was separated into two huge rolls. Her face had four chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't know what to do next... </span></div></div>",

In this reality Jennifer Walters had become the She-Bulk, her transformation causing permanent, irreversible weight gain.

I'm the She-Bulk and the baddies fear my big butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sharing a laugh with Jennifer, Susan made plans to meet for lunch with Jennifer, Electra, Black Cat, Scarlet Witch, and Tigra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up, Susan went to look for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found him, as usual, in his lab. But he had changed. Whereas Reed Richards was normally skinny, the Reed before Susan was huge! His butt was nearly as big as hers, he had four chins that jiggled as he smiled at his wife, and a big gut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reed...how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better honey! But it was kind of hard to get down to the lab today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed stretched then, the elastic body of his doing little to prevent the fat man from sweating heavily as he did so.</span></div></div>",

Luckily though, Susan wasn't late and spied her five fellow females already seated around a large table, easily fitting their huge bodies around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what bodies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk's gain had surprised her but the rest were equally stunning. Electra's butt was larger than Ben's for crying out loud to say nothing of her stomach. The ninja smiled at Susan as they both ate a large chocolate cake. Felicia Hardy had the largest breasts out of all of them and a big gut that jiggled when she laughed, easily earning her the new name of the Black Fat, Tigra having the name of Fat Cat. Tigra's weight was distributed all over much like Susan's, and the cat-woman purred as she ate five salmon. Wanda Maximoff, or the Scarlet Witch, was plowing through eight pieces of fried chicken and getting grease all over her uniform, not that she cared. Wanda's weight was focused on her belly, the round orb just beating Johnny's big gut though Wanda's butt, thighs, fat face, and chins were huge as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan observed all of her fat friends as they all ate and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going great so far!</span></div></div>",

After about an hour, the Immobile Woman{as she had now elected to call herself} finally stopped to moan in pleasure at her divine meal, only to have it turn into a rather audible burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue blushed with embarrassment and covered her mouth. \"I'm so sorry, Jen!\" She-bulk raised an eyebrow at her friend. \"You should be, girl...because that was weak!\" Jennifer proceeded to suck in a breath and unleash a mighty belch of her own. The force of it blew Sue's hair back and cleared the table of it's dishes. \"Top that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue looked dejectedly at what remained of her half-eaten cake on the floor. Then, she thought better of it and flashed She-Bulk an impish smirk. \"Okay Jen, if that's how you want to play!\" She would've never fancied her chances in a belching contest before, let alone one with She-hulk, but thing were much different now. She was the Immobile Woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Fat-tastic\" Four's blonde matriarch picked up what was left of her drink and chugged it as fast as she was able.

Using a system of fore fields to quietly bring herself a spoon, Sue sat down against the fridge, opened the carton, and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue was still fairly full from dinner, as was evident by her still bulging gut. Sue, however, was determined to eat the entire contents of the carton. With a quick grace, she dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about a quarter finished with the carton when she began to feel full. This only fueled Sue's determination to finish the carton. Steeling her resolve, Sue doubled her speed, shoveling spoonful after delicious spoonful into her mouth and down to her gullet. By the time she was half-finished, Sue's belly was burgeoning out from behind her pajama bottoms. She rubbed the bottom curve of it soothingly, then resumed her feast. As soon as she finished, Sue lay down in victory, rubbing her immense food baby. Her pajama top could not contain the entirety of the gargantuan gut Sue was now sporting, coming to an end a little above her belly button. After a few minutes of rubbing her belly, Sue stood up, threw away the empty carton, and carried herself back to bed.</span></div></div>",

Before, they could make it up her legs and up to her waist with incredible ease, but it took Susan a great struggle to get them up her legs today, and they stopped just a little below her hips. Susan examined herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jeans constricted her legs tightly. If she stood stock-still, the silhouette would resemble that of an ice-cream cone. Her arms had lost most of their muscle definition, appearing to be a lot softer and slightly thicker. Her bosom had experienced minimal change, but they were in proportion with the rest of her. Susan turned for a back-side view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer derriere was a lot rounder than she remembered, straining against her jeans. Nothing would be able to fit in the rear pockets, since the material was spread to maximum capacity. Her back formed little folds of fat against the white T-shirt she was wearing, her love handles quite prominent. With another twirl, Susan expected her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit smaller than yesterday, almost as if it had transferred some of its mass to other parts of Susan's body. However, the globular gut was still quite large, refusing to be covered by her shirt anywhere past her belly button. It formed a small muffin top above Susan's jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a delighted smile, Susan changed into a pair of sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm finally getting fat!</i></span></div></div>",

Her belly had to be partially covered by her sweatpants\u2014her shirt not being large enough to do so on its own\u2014and even then, her love handles would ooze out from behind her shirt. Walking through the mall, she attracted her fair share of looks, managing to disappear before someone could take a photo. It wasn't that she hated her body\u2014she just didn't want the attention that would come from her recent changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan grabbed a pair of size 16 black jeans, placed them in a concealing force field, and rushed to a changing room, resuming visibility as soon as she shut the door, not wanting to exhaust herself from extended use of her powers. Taking off her sweatpants, Susan tried on the jeans. They were a bit snug around her waist, a small muffin top present above her hips, but they could button up and were not nearly as constricting around her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll take these for now,</i> Susan thought, <i>and grab a larger pair for later.</i> Changing back into her sweatpants, Susan made her way to a checkout counter, grabbing a larger pair of jeans along the way. Paying for her clothes, Susan returned to the changing room  to put on the Spider-Man T-shirt and the size 16 jeans. The shirt hid her muffin top and covered her belly, thankfully. Susan could almost hear Peter passive-aggressively joking about her added weight. Smiling, Susan put on a large sun hat and shades and left the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking back to the Baxter Building, she came across a food truck selling shaved ice. Susan's stomach growled, and she remembered that she hadn't had breakfast yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan patted her belly. \"Don't worry\u2014I'll get you nice and full soon enough,\" she cooed. Susan made her way to the truck. Examining the menu, Susan made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a chocolate shaved ice,\" she told the owner. And in less than a minute, she was chomping away on chocolate-flavored ice chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, she was still fairly hungry. She was about to return home to make breakfast herself when she came across a very interesting restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Superheroes' Repast,\" she read aloud. \"Dress like a superhero, and get 50% off of your food. Actual superheroes eat for free.\" Susan looked up at the restaurant, mulling over whether or not she should go in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The deciding factor for Susan was something that had been influencing her decisions for the past week: her stomach. Having grown accustomed to large and frequent meals, being full of food had become the norm for it. While the shaved ice did satiate that hunger a little bit, it was not nearly enough. Susan's stomach wanted more, and it wanted it <b>now.</b> As such, it rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked down at her belly. Smiling, she gave the bulging layer of fat underneath her shirt a rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that answers that,\" she chuckled. And with that, she entered the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greeted almost immediately by a waiter dressed as Spider-Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way, Mrs. Richards,\" he greeted, gesturing to a nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the direction of his gesture, Susan walked to the table, the waiter leading the way. Arriving at the table, the waiter pulled a chair out for Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said graciously before sitting down. The waiter bowed his head in acknowledgement and pulled out a notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can we get for our fine superheroine this morning?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Susan would inquire about the options available to her, seeing as there was no menu. However, something compelled her to say the first thing to pop into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have ten Belgian waffles, some hashbrowns, an omelette, a bowl of chocolate cereal, a dozen donuts, a slice of chocolate cake, a slice of chocolate pie, and a chocolate milkshake.\" Even though she had every intention to gain weight, the sheer amount of food she had asked for still stunned Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter scribbled this down in his notepad. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A box of chocolates.\" The words slipped out of Susan's mouth before she could even question the fact that the waiter could still ask Susan if she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be here shortly,\" the waiter informed Susan, shortly before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back from the table, Susan was surprised to find a box of chocolates sitting on the table. Before she could question the how, though, her hands grabbed and opened the box. It was a two-pound, circular box containing many different chocolates\u2014milk, dark, creme-filled, caramel-filled, white, wafer, sea-salted, and more. Susan picked a disk of creme-filled milk chocolate and placed it in her mouth, chewing slowly. Her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" she moaned. The taste was probably the most delicious she had ever had the pleasure of experiencing, being sweet and fluffy but with an edge of cacao not usually found in milk chocolate. Upon swallowing, she had another. And another, and another, and another\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're all so good!</i> she thought, giddy with their delectability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had emptied the box, Susan was fairly full. Within seconds of finishing the chocolates, the Spider-Man waiter returned, towing a cart loaded with the rest of Susan's order. Meticulously, he set the gloches around the table, removing the lids and putting them back in the cart. Unfolding a napkin, he wrapped it around Susan's neck like a bib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, enjoy your meal,\" he said, clasping his hands together. Taking the cart with him, he left Susan to have her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing down at her belly, Susan unbuttoned her jeans for what she knew would surely come. Rubbing her hands together in anticipation, Susan licked her lips and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with the cereal. Rotating the turntable on which all of the food was placed, Susan picked up the bowl and began slowly. Within the first two spoonfuls, though, her pace accelerated dramatically, with little breaks in between to suck any possible vestiges of flavor off of the spoon. Finding no more of the chocolate flakes in the bowl, Susan slurped the milk down into her growing gullet. Even the milk tasted a thousand times better than any other milk Susan had drank before!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to the omelette and hashbrowns. Susan took to tearing off a piece of omelette and wrapping it around some hashbrowns to increase her eating efficiency. While not usually a fan of a salty breakfast, Susan could have eaten those omelettes and hashbrowns all day, and would have, too, if not for the other undevoured parts of her breakfast (in addition to her duties and responsibilities as a scientist, a superheroine, and a mother).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waffles were Susan's biggest challenge (literally). Divided into two stacks of five, they were five inches in diameter and five inches in height, being drenched in butter and syrup and topped with whipped cream. Grabbing a knife and fork, Susan cut and ate them piece-by-divine-piece, sips from her shake interspersing. It took her 10 minutes to get through the waffles, and by the time she was finished with them, she was feeling rather full. Her belly was quite bloated, her previously baggy T-shirt now barely covering the entirety of the pudgy orb. Despite this, though, she still felt hungry. It was strange\u2014she knew that she was full, and yet she continued to desire food as if she had yet to begin breakfast. Stroking her gut and shrugging, Susan moved on to the donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere six kinds of donuts, two for each kind: chocolate long-johns, maple bars, classic, frosted, creme-filled, and chocolate-glazed with sprinkles. Susan started with the creme-filled, seeing as they usually were her least-favorite. That notion was almost instantaneously erased after the first bite. Susan actually leapt up to her feet in excitement, the flavor was so good. She stood there, leaning over the table, belly drooping, excitedly eating the donut, before grabbing the next one. This time, she dunked it in her shake before devouring it, but that did little more than whet her voracity. Down, down the donuts went into the Invisible Woman's stomach, kissing her taste buds with sensations that she would later describe as heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Susan groaned, collapsing back into her seat and massaging her engorged belly. There was no denying it, now\u2014Susan Richards, AKA the Invisible Woman, was stuffed to the brim. Despite this fact, Susan found her appetite still unsatisfied. And while her stomach put up a good fight, in the end, appetite won, and Susan found herself reaching for the cake and the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed one in each hand\u2014pie in her left, cake in her right. Quick as lightning, the waiter dashed to Susan's table, placing a straw in her shake long enough to reach Susan, slumped in her chair with her belly bulging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said before taking a large draft from her shake. The waiter bowed, then left Susan to her feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe alternated between delicacies: left, right, middle; left, right, middle; pie, cake, shake; pie, cake, shake\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an attack on three fronts in the Battle of the Bulge, and it was clear on which side Susan had thrown her lot\u2014the fat side, filled with a future of stuffing and puffing. The pie's dry, biting nature balanced with the cake's moist, chewy one. Combined with the shake, they made a trinity of ambrosia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If there is a better way to finish a breakfast as marvelous as this, I don't know it,</i> Susan raved, sliding the last of the pie and the cake into her mouth. Standing up gingerly, cheeks stuffed with cake and pie, Susan grabbed the cup containing her shake, stuck its bottom in the air, and took one final gulp. With a mighty belch, Susan finished her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" she apologized, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to pay her any heed, though\u2014they all seemed to be busy eating there food. The odd thing was, though, that only the women seemed to be gorging themselves. The men were either eating at a normal pace or gawking at the voracity that their female companions were displaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, for her part, paid no heed to the rest of the restaurant. The sheer amount of food had finally caught up to her, and all she could do was lie slumped in her seat, rubbing her belly soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh\u2026\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there for a few minutes before the Spider-Man waiter returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else today, Mrs. Richards?\" he asked earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine, really,\" she said, pausing to stifle a burp. \"It was a wonderful breakfast, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was our pleasure. Anything we can do to make our superheroines and superheroes happy is reward enough for us,\" he said beamingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very kind of you,\" Susan replied graciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need assistance returning home?\" the waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" Susan answered. \"I just need a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, thank you for coming to the Superheroes' Repast. Come again soon, and good luck!\" And with that, the waiter left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan lay there for another five minutes, stroking her belly. It had burgeoned out considerably, having to contain pounds of food waiting to be fully digested. Her T-shirt could no longer contain it, stopping just above her navel. Had Susan not unfastened them earlier, the buttons on her jeans would have surely popped. There was no way they were going to button around her globular gut anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. Making a force-field, she slowly made her way back to the Baxter Building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm going to be a fat woman, indeed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: This story and the first option ties in with my work in another story, <i>Marvel Comics Female Weight Gain</i>, specifically the chapter \"A Thickening Plot.\" For full context, you should read the chapters \"Lunch With A Friend,\" \"Bending The Rules A Bit,\" and \"A Thickening Plot,\" in addition to <i>The Fat-tastic Four</i>'s chapter, \"Susan was out dineing with a few of her fellow\u2026,\" but it's not necessary.

Because of the nature of existence for the room, they were able to watch Susan as if they were right behind her without intruding on the other customers.

The white fabric of her Unstable Molecule uniform seemed fit to burst after the brunch she just finished. Texan toast, an omelette, a box of donuts, and a whole chocolate cake only added to the already very large breakfast that she had devoured earlier today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks ago, such a feat would have been unfeasible for Susan to accomplish. Now, however, after frequent stuffing sessions and numerous similar visits to the Superheroine's Repast, Susan was quite able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan to gain weight had been proceeding quite successfully. While she still sported a very large potbelly, the rest of her body had begun to catch up in fattening up along with it. Just two days ago, Susan had to restock her entire civilian wardrobe with new clothes, having outgrown the rest of her clothes a while ago. In total, Susan had put on 25 pounds in two weeks. After today, that number was sure to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up unsteadily, Susan began to make her way home. The Spider-Man waiter helped her up and ushered her to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Susan said graciously. The Spider-Man waiter merely nodded in acknowledgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a wonderful day,\" he said, before returning to her table and cleaning it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan made her way out the door and ran directly into another person. The two collapsed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" the other woman said, slowly picking herself up. \"I'm so sorry\u2014I didn't see you.\" The other woman got up and offered Susan a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's alright. I should've been watching my step,\" Susan answered apologetically, gratefully taking the other woman's hand and standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third woman in a Medusa costume stood beside the two women, and for a moment, all three stared at one another. Susan noted that the woman who had helped her up looked remarkably similar to her. The resemblance was almost uncanny. She was dressed in an old navy-and-white Fantastic Four uniform (the full bodysuit version, and not the regretfully revealing one), and looked almost like Susan herself had a few years ago when that was the standard uniform for the team. She was a bit softer, yes, not quite as slim and trim; but aside from that, she looked almost exactly like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both have wonderful costumes,\" Susan said, breaking the silence. The woman dressed as Medusa raised her hand as if to say something, but Susan's doppelg\u00e4nger shook her head at her, cutting her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. So do you. I love the design,\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded and smiled. \"Excuse me,\" she said, and made her way back home.</span></div></div>",

I know I've been putting on weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a week or so since her encounter with the Susan and Medusa cosplayers, and in that time, Susan had managed to add fifteen pounds to her frame. She was becoming quite plump. Her legs were close to rubbing together when she walked; her arms were quite soft and flabby; her breasts had grown fuller; her hips, already a bit wide, were thicker; her derriere was quite larger; and, biggest of all, was her big, bulging, globular potbelly, which was now well on its way to outgrowing that title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed breathed a sigh of relief. \"Oh, thank goodness. That gets that out of the way. Any particular reason for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying out something new. And I must say, I'm liking it so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed shrugged. \"I trust you.

Let me know if anything happens, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. She gave Reed a quick peck on the cheek. \"See you in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was about to enter the Superheroine's Repast when  a gloved hand reached around her and opened the door. \"Allow me,\" the owner of the hand said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the door for her was none other than the Uncanny Avenger known as the Scarlet Witch, better known to Susan by her given name of Wanda Maximoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Wanda,\" Susan said gratefully before entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda gasped. \"Wait, Susan? Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"In the flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda stammered. \"You look--you look--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatter? I'm trying something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda entered the restaurant. \"... I see. Well, it is your choice. And it looks good on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Susan replied gratefully. \"Would you care to have lunch with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Wanda's stomach growled. \"I was just about to ask you the same thing,\" she said. \"This is a delightful little eatery. I've been coming here for a few days, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded in agreement. The two superheroines proceeded to a table. Susan noticed that there was something different about the Scarlet Witch. She seemed... fuller, for lack of a better term. The fabric of her coat dress seemed a bit more strained around the midriff, and Susan could have sworn that she saw Wanda's belly jiggle ever so slightly behind the fabric of her costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess I'm not the only one who's packed on some pounds...</i> Susan mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda and Susan sat down at the table. Immediately, they were greeted by the Spider-Man waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Wonderful to see you two again. The usual, Mrs. Invisible Woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! And for you, Ms. Scarlet Witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda turned to Susan. \"Would you mind if I shared with you? Just to get a taste for the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Susan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll have a chocolate cake, please,\" Wanda told the Spider-Man waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Your food will be here shortly.\" And with that, the Spider-Man waiter hurried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to warn you, Wanda\u2014I eat a lot,\" Susan said, patting her belly. \"You might not be able to  handle it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm just hoping I can control myself. Every time I've been here, I've eaten far more than I normally do. It's\u2026 starting to show, I think,\" Wanda sad sheepishly, eyeing her own softening stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"Oh, don't worry about it. You wear it well. Besides, you're a superhero. You can burn it off quickly enough if you don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 I suppose your right,\" Wanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, hey, I come here often enough. If you want, you can meet me at the Baxter Building and we can have lunch together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda was a bit taken aback. Not many people extended a hand in friendship to her. But upon seeing the sincerity in Susan's face, Wanda smiled. \"That sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spider-Man waiter arrived with the food. \"Two orders of fried chicken, ten double hamburgers, and fries for the Invisible Woman,\" he said, placing the meal on the table, \"and a chocolate cake for the Scarlet Witch.\" He stood still and clasped his hands together. \"Enjoy, ladies!\" And with that, he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 bon appetit,\" said Susan. Wanda dipped her head in grace, and the two dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chicken was the first to go. Susan let Wanda take what she wanted, then took the rest for herself. Susan, while plumper than she had been, was not quite plump enough. At least, not yet. Susan quickly gobbled down one whole order of fried chicken. Wanda, for her part, managed to eat three-fourths of one, eating a few fries in between. Susan noted that Wanda didn't even look at the burgers. Unbeknownst to Susan, Wanda didn't eat beef, mostly because she had been delivered into this world by a cow-person from the High Evolutionary's home at Mount Wundagore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burgers were thick, juicy, and filling. Luckily, Susan had a lot more room to fill. The first three burgers were followed by the next three. By this point, Susan was starting to feel full. A few days ago, she had felt stuffed at this point. But now, due in part to sharing with Wanda, (but mostly to her larger stomach capacity,) Susan didn't feel quite as full. She still had plenty of room for the remaining nine burgers (although her belly started expanding at round the eleventh burger). Finishing off the last of the chicken, Susan pushed back her seat, content with her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda, meanwhile, was in the middle of a frenzy. While the food at the Repast had been quite exquisite, the cake was almost intoxicating. Truth be told, the soft layer of pudge accumulating on her figure mostly came from eating similar cakes at the Repast. Wanda ate with abandon, shovelling spoonful after ambrosial spoonful of chocolate cake into her mouth and down into her ever-growing gullet. Finishing up a few minutes after Susan, Wanda kicked back in her chair, cradling her orb-like food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You  look like you had fun,\" Susan commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda moaned. \"I lost control again, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little bit. But can you really say it wasn't worth it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda stifled a burp. \"... No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"That's what I thought.\"</span></div></div>",

True, Wanda wasn't a frequent visitor of the Baxter Building up until recently, but being 20 minutes late? That was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's stomach rumbled hungrily. She patted her belly and made up her mind. <i>I'll leave a note for her,</i> she thought, quickly grabbing a pad and paper and scribbling a short message on it. She taped it to her front door and headed out to the Superheroine's Repast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan entered the restaurant and walked to the counter. She was about to ask the Spider-Man waiter for a seat when she heard a familiar voice calling her name. Susan turned around to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Wanda! I was wondering where you had gotten off to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda sat at a food-laden table with two other women dressed as superheroines. One of them, a pudgy blonde woman dressed like the Invisible Woman, took one look at Susan and momentarily became distressed, whispering something incoherently. Her friend, a tall redheaded woman with a small layer of fat dressed up as Medusa, looked at her friend questioningly. Both women looked familiar, but Susan couldn't quite place where she had met them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman looked up at Susan. \"Well... Since you two know each other... Would you care to join us?\"  she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan tilted her head, and finally recognized Wanda's companions. \"Aren't you the woman I ran into the other week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I am. Would you like some fries?\" the blonde woman asked, offering Susan a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan glanced at the food and remembered how hungry she was. \"I would love to,\" she said. Susan walked towards the table and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman smiled. She passed the fries over to Susan, who gladly took them and immediately started nibbling on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know,\" Susan began, \"we might have to order more food. This might not be enough for all of us.\" She patted her belly for emphasis. \"It takes a lot for me to be satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry,\" said Wanda, \"you can share with me. I probably won't eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Susan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without further ado, the women dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" moaned the redheaded woman in the Medusa costume. \"I... I believe that's quite enough for me today,\" she said, slowly making an effort to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too,\" said her companion as she followed suit. \"It was lovely meeting all of you.\" Pushing in their chairs, the two women left, returning unsteadily to what was presumably their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Wanda remained seated, massaging their swollen stomachs. Both of them had devoured not one, but TWO courses of a meal that could very well have fed nine people. Wanda had displayed a surprising voracity, probably having eaten the most out of the four women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two were lovely people,\" Susan said, making small-talk. \"And their costumes were amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda looked over at Susan. \"Oh, those weren't costumes. They were the Invisible Woman and Medusa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan showed her head towards Wanda. \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're from an alternate universe. Somehow, I ended up at their Baxter Building this morning. That's why I was late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't think to... question this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? I was really more concerned about getting some lunch,\" Wanda admitted, smiling softly.</span></div></div>",

Can you come with me to the lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn icy dread descended down Susan's spine. Whenever Reed had \"something happen\" at this hour, it usually meant nothing good. Slowly, Susan rose up from bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed's face was grim. He brought out his right hand. A red holographic image of the Earth with a countdown projected forth from his palm. \"I think the world might be ending soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's stomach dropped. \"I... I don't understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain it in the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything dies. You, me, everyone on this planet. Our sun, our galaxy, and, eventually, our universe. It's inevitable. And I accept it.\" Reed was solemn. \"Or at least... I thought I did.\" Typing at his computer, Reed opened up a projection of two Earth, separated by a dimensional barrier. The two Earths began moving towards each other, culminating in the destruction of both Earths after they collided. \"In another part of the Multiverse, two alternate Earths broke the dimensional barrier separating their universes and collided together in an event called an incursion. The result was the total annihilation of both Earths' individual universes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since then, these incursions have grown alarmingly frequent. Our once infinite Multiverse has now been reduced down to a couple dozen universes. To try to solve this problem, T'Challa reformed the Illuminati. We've been dealing with these incursions as best we can, but it hasn't been enough. Our world will soon collide with another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was. \"The entire Multiverse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed nodded grimly. \"I'm sorry, my love. I couldn't save our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan took a step back. The end of everything was upon them and, for the first time ever, the FF couldn't stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time do we have left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were silent for what seemed like a century. Susan gently made her way over to her husband. Silently, the two embraced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really have put in quite a deal of weight,\" Reed teased gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled softly. \"I really like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed. \"Can we just... Stay here? Until the end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed nodded. \"There's nothing else we can do. I began designing a life raft, but it won't be finished in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Susan. I don't say this often enough, but... I love you. Until the end of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I love you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, everything died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, it almost did.</span></div></div>",

The crisis had been averted, and if another one was coming, then they would have time to prepare for it. N the meantime, Susan could focus on her new goal: gaining weight and getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the past week, Susan had managed to put on an additional 10 pounds.

She loved it in all of its orb-like softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda, for her part, had also gained a noticeable amount of weight. Not as much as Susan had, but enough to widen her hips, thicken her waist, and plumpen her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say I mind, though,\" Wanda said contemplatively. She gave her belly a pat. \"I love this food, and I don't really care about the extra weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks good on you,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.

It had proven so and a short while later they'd helped themselves to a little of everything, and then a lot of some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa patted her now somewhat more well padded purple outfit with both hands. \"Oh that chocolate cake was simply to die for...\" Jennifer Walters nodded, her purple and white outfit normally showed of her considerable abdominal muscles, but a layer of flab had spread over them a the moment. \"And those Belgian waffles...\" Crystal rubbed her own tummy which was currently covered by her electric yellow outfit. \"And the pudding...\" Susan couldn't help but nod. \"I know, normally I eat like a bird, but everything here was just so good I felt like I couldn't help myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few strands of Medusa's red hair reached out and felt up Susan's currently squishy belly. \"You keep coming here Sue and you won't be able to help purchasing clothes at a larger size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan blushed again and then pushed away Medusa's hairs with an invisible forcefield. \"It'll only be a once a month thing, that way I've got plenty of time to work off any pounds I put on, superheroing is hard work after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four slowly stood up pushed in their chairs and began to walk towards the door, though they moved somewhat disjointedly due to the effect of being practically stuffed full to bursting with food. She Hulk looked fondly back at the building as they took their first few steps out into daylight, her emerald and hair glistening as the sunlight fell upon it. \"I don't know who runs that place, but I'm going to have to find out and send them a thank you letter, a meal there would really hit the spot as a way of celebrating after saving the world!\" The other three superheroines nodded, and Medusa gave Crystal a quick proxy hug with her hair. \"Good luck sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an opaque portal created by the Inhuman Lockjaw opened before the red haired queen and she stepped through it. Susan of course knew what she was talking about, Crystal and her brother's on again off again romance was on again. The Invisible Woman hopped it would work this time, life was a lot easier when she didn't have to deal with her brother mopping around. \"So Crys, race you back to headquarters?\" Crystal grabbed her slightly sagging gullet and looked at Susan like she was insane. \"Sue, you should know better than to use your superpowers thirty minutes after you've eaten...\" All three broke up into more uproarious laughter at the orange haired Inhuman's joke.</span></div></div>",

She understand that because she was his sister, he was less likely to listen to her, but since Crystal was his girlfriend, he would listen to her more.

She knew that her husband loved her but Reed Richards could be incredibly single minded about his work, and trying to get him to pull himself awa from it was a more or less hopeless task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo rather than bothering with getting bogged down in a conversation she\u2019d had countless times before Susan turned around and decided to spare herself that particular migraine.

It was hard for her to believe that it was acting like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Superheroine\u2019s Repast she had stuffed herself to the point that she\u2019d felt like bursting and hadn\u2019t been quite sure if she\u2019d be able to walk home under her own power, or even float there with an invisible forcefield holding her up.  Yet now, less than half an hour after she had eaten that monstrous meal she was already starting to feel hungry again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head to clear away such thoughts of confusion Susan made her way to one of the Baxter Building\u2019s many kitchens.

She\u2019d should only need to eat a slice or two to ward off these hunger pangs and then she\u2019d head to her room and grab a nice afternoon nap to sleep off her large meal and after meal snack so as to give the food plenty of time to digest, yeah that was the ticket!</span></div></div>",

As the oven heated up, she walked over to the freezer, pulled out the pizza, and began to let it thaw. She then walked back to the fridge, and pulled out a mountin dew code red soda. She opened it and took a couple sips before setting it down on the table. After a couple of minutes, the oven was ready and the pizza had thawed enough for her to put it in. She slide in the pizza, shut the door, and then set the time. As she waited for the pizza to cook, she headed back into the living room to grab a gossip magazine to read as she waited. She smiled to herself seeing Johnny still playing the game with Crystal watching him. She then grabbed her magazine and headed back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down at the table and drank some more of her soda she flipped through her magazines. After about 20 minues, the timer went off, she got up, and went over to check on the pizza. it was finished, she put on some gloves, and pulled it out. She let it cool for a bit before grabbing a plate and putting two slices on her plate. She then carried the plate back over to the table and took a seat. The pizza looked and smelled so good that she immediately began to eat it as she resumed reading her magazine. She continued to take bite after bite of the first slice until she finished it off. She licked some of the grease off her hands before realizing what she was doing and quickly wiped her hands off with a napkin. She was glad that none of the guys nor her children saw her doing that since she would never leave it done after always being on their case for their table manners. She washed the slice down with a couple more sips of her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even realized it, Susan picked up the next slice of pizza, and before long she had finished it off as well. It was so tasty that she couldn't stop eating it. Once again she licked some of the grease off her fingers before wiping her hands off with another napkin. She then washed it down with a couple sips of her soda. Expecting to feel really full, she was surprised to realize that she felt even hungrier then before. She blushed a little as she heard her stomach growl. She glanced over at the rest of the table and licked her lips. It smelled so good and tasted so good. Having another slice wouldn't hurt right she thought to herself. Feeling a little lazy she used her powers to move the rest of the pizza over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting it down in front of her, Susan helped herself to another slice. Finishing it off quicker then the first two, she helped herself to another, and then another. The pizza was so good and she was still so hungry that she couldn't stop eating it. It wasn't too long before she had finished off the rest of the large pizza which had been a total of eight slices. She licked the grease off her fingers one last time before wiping her hands with a new napkin and then washing it down with the rest of her soda. She blushed when she let out a girly little burp. She was once again glad that neither the guys nor her children were around to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then laid back in her stomach, moaning softly. She felt so incredibly stuffed. She could feel her stomach groaning and churning, trying to digest all that food she had just consumed in this rather short amount of time. Her bloated belly was pushing out through her top even more than before. She was so stuffed that it was a little painful but it was a pleasurable painful. She had to admit that she was enjoying being this stuffed. All that food had made her very tired so she couldn't really think too much more about that then that. After a couple of minutes, she slowly got up, threw away the empty soda bottle after rinising it out, and cleaned off the plate and pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan then slowly made her way back into the bedroom she shared with Reed. She kicked off her pink flip flops, sat down on her bed, and laid down on her bed. She quickly fell into a food coma as her head hit the pillow, falling into a deep stuffed-induced slumber with her hands on top of her bloated belly.</span></div></div>",

That made it easy for her to sit wide awake and look eye to eye with her husband who had awakened her from her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Reed?\"  She awkwardly half said half yawned as she tried to get her barrings on the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to let you know that it's dinner time, but...\"  Reed trailed off as if he wasn't sure what to say.  Susan had no idea why her husband would be so antsy around the idea of telling her that it was dinner time, until she looked down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so memories came flooding back, she'd decided to visit the Superheroine's Repast today for the first time, and she'd ended up eating quite a bit, and then if that hadn't been enough on its own to throw of her normal diet she had ended up devouring an entire pizza on her own once she'd gotten back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she'd decided to take a nap not long after her lunch. she hadn't been asleep for very long, and the food hadn't had much time to digest.   Because of that, Susan's belly was still quite prominent, puffing out of her costume in a bulge about the size of a volley ball give or take.  It was nothing compared with how large she had ended up getting when she was pregnant with Franklin or Valeria, but it was still quite noticeable especially compared to her normally slim form, and dressed in an unstable molecule outfit which clung to her skin in ways that left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\"  Susan blushed.  Then as if she didn't have enough to be embarrassed about her stomach let out a loud rumble that seemed to fill the other wise completely silent room.  Still without saying a word Susan got out of bed rubbing said stomach all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for waking me up Reed, dinner sounds like a marvelous idea!\"  As Susan made this comment she began to look her husband over slowly, now that sleep had been blinked from her eyes Susan would swear that there was something different about him.</span></div></div>",

Reed seemed to have a small gut that was a little noticeable in his tight costume. Susan hadn't noticed this before but now here it was in plain sight. She wasn't sure why she hadn't noticed it before but figured that mattered little. With the exception of his stomach, Reed looked pretty much the same, and she was still attracted to him. In truth, it made her feel a little better that he had gained a little weight as it made her feel a little better about how fat she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Susan looking him over thoughtfully Reed replied, \"Uh, is everything okay hun?\" he asked his wife. Seeing his wife looking big like this outside of her pregnancy and her now looking at him curiously made him a little nervous. His nervousness was due in part to his small gut which he worried that Susan might not like. While he was stunned by how big Susan looked right now, he quite liked how big she looked though he would never admit it to her as he had no doubt that she found find it weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is fine hun. Let's go get some food. I am hungry\" Susan replied with a smile as she got up and walked over to him. She blushed a little when she realized what she had said. She couldn't believe that she was hungry after all she had just eaten but here she was, hungry again. She had already pigged out some much today, she figured one more time wouldn't make much of a difference. She could just go back to her usual diet tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Ben and Alicia made hambergers\" Reed replied. He was very pleased to discover that Susan was hungry again and hoped that she would eat alot again. \"Mm, burgers sound good\" Susan replied with a smile before walking over to him, leaning over and kissing him softly on his lips. She gently took hold of his strong hand in her soft hand and lead him out of the bathroom. Reed discreetly checked out Susan's butt, pleased to see that it looked a little bigger and rounder.</span></div></div>",

No matter how hungry she had been, she'd managed to keep herself from totally gorging like a complete pig in front of her friends family and teamembers, limiting herself to just one burger.  It wasn't much of a victory considering how much else she had already eaten that day, but it nice for the Invisible Woman to prove to herself that she wasn't a total slave to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat back feeling contentedly full she looked over at her husband.  Reed seemed to have no such concerns about watching how much ate as he was currently chewing his way through his third burger.  Susan looked her husband up and down once again with a questioning eye.  The two of them had been through a lot together but she'd never seen Reed eat like this, and she'd never seen him put on weight the way he currently was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it normal for him to eat this much, did he normally do it behind the team's back?  Did he like to sneak treats for himself while he was alone in his lab working on those super important projects that only someone of his super intelligence could understand?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he'd been doing it for a while why was it only starting to show now?  Granted things had been fairly calm for the Fantastic Four recently but Reed wasn't that dependent upon having fighting crime for exercise, was he?  Susan's eyes slowly drifted downwards, the large burgers he had consumed had made her husband's elastic stomach puff up to the point that it was now as big as Susan's.  Was he doing that on purpose, if so it was sweet of him.  She'd have to find a way to make it up to him somehow....</span></div></div>",

It wasn't much of a task tonight tonight though sinced they used all paper plates and untensils. They were given to them along with the food so they saw no sense to dirty their usual plates and utenstils when they could just use these paper ones. As Alicia and Ben cleared the table, Johnny helped Crystal up who had actually eaten two burgers with fires and sodas herself and lead her back into the tv room to go back to the game. Susan sensed that Crystal was trying not to make a total pig of herself in front of the family and she was proud of herself for being able to hold back a little more then Crystal, eating only burger to her two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Reed, let's go out on the balcony\" Susan suggusted sweetly with a warm smile as she slowly got up and made her way towards the balcony. As she walked over to it, she did her sexy little walk that really showed off her butt, especially now since it was rounder. \"Okay hun\" Reed agreed before getting up and following her outside to the balcony. He couldn't take his eyes off her butt. He was greatly turned on by it's growth, loving how it was softer, bigger, and rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out on the balcony, Susan walk over to the railing and gazed out over the beautiful New York skyline as Reed walked over to her and stood next to her. She could help but smile as she felt his strong arm wrap around her soft waist, pulling her closer to him. It seemed to her that Reed seemed a little stronger since he had put on some weight. His arms seemd stronger for her for some reason. Feeling their bigger and softer tummies tough slightly through their uniform, Susan had to admit that it felt kinda nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little nervous to broach the topic about their weight with Reed but knew that not only they should talk about it, but they could. There were a couple and had been through so much together. Clearly they could talk about this. So, she took a deep breathe and began, \"So Reed, I want to talk to you about something\" she said as she looked over at him, looking him in his eyes. \"Okay. I am listining\" Reed replied softly. \"Well as you probably have noticed, I have put on some weight lately. I admit that I have kinda been letting myself go lately\" she said. She paused for a second before continuing. \"I now have just realized that you have also put on some weight. I was wondering if that was on purpose, maybe to help me feel better about my gain, or was it by accident?\" she asked him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed blushed a little. \"Wow, you got me\" he replied with a soft laugh. Due to Susan figuring out what he had done and with her being his wife, he felt comfortable with telling her what he was about to tell her. He was a little nervous to admit what he was going to tell her but it was something he had wanted to tell her for awhile. \"I did notice that you had put on some weight Sue but I must admit that I really liked it. I through you looked really good with the extra weight but you didn't seem too comfortable with it. I decided that maybe if I put on a little weight that you would feel more comfortable with your gain and not try to lose it\" he said. Then he took Sue's soft hand in his strong hands and looked her in her beautiful blue eyes. \"I love you no matter what Sue. I love you for for you. I find you beautiful now and when you were skinner but I must admit that I like you heavier like this and would love it if you would gain more weight\" he continued. He then stopped, gazing into Susan's eyes, waiting for her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was completely shocked. She at first couldn't speak, unable to find the words to say. She thought it was very sweet of Reed to gain a little weight to her feel better about her own gain but she would have never guessed that Reed liked her heavier and wanted her to gain more weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean I\u2019m a part of a superhero team, a big part of it...\u201d  Susan paused for a moment realizing that this was perhaps a poor choice of words.  \u201cI\u2019m a very important part of it, and this costume of mine, well it does a great job of showing off my figure, but that can be a double edged sword.  Ironically even my superpowers aren\u2019t going to be enough to keep people from noticing the fact that I\u2019ve gotten heftier, and I\u2019m not even sure that I want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed gently leaned in himself before starting to rub Susan\u2019s belly with both of his hands. \u201cI never said you have to Susan, this is entirely your choice.

On the other hand judging by the way that Crystal had been eating at dinner there was at least a possibility that it might not be long before he had to watch what he called his heftier sister for fear of offending his equally obese girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know.  I just don\u2019t want to let the team down, I mean if I got fat I\u2019d have a harder time fighting crime, and yes there hasn\u2019t been as much of that going around as there use to be, but still part of the risk of being superheroes is that things only have to go bad one time for it to be all over, and I don\u2019t want my last thoughts to be about how if only I had kept myself in shape this never would have happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed\u2019s arms grew longer and longer wrapping themselves around his wife\u2019s body several times as if he was trying to cacoon her within his flesh.  \u201cLook... why don\u2019t we do this like scientists.  We\u2019ll experiment a little and see how much weight we can gain before it seriously starts to effect our ability to fight crime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan picked up one key words in her husband\u2019s speech which made her eyebrows perk up straight away.  \u201cWe?\u201d  \u201cWe.\u201d  Reed responded calmly and nodding.  \u201cAfter all the more of me there is the more rubbery and bouncy I should get.\u201d  Susan giggled at the mental image of her husband having grown fat enough that she could use his bloated belly as a trampoline without him having to make even the slightest effort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a theory at least.\u201d  She admitted to Reed, wiggling her arms out of his own so that she could clasp his hands in her own.  \u201cBut still, this is something that the others should know about, so that they don\u2019t get taken by surprise, I think that sooner or later we should tell them that we plan on getting fat...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If Reed gained along with her, she definitely wouldn't feel so bad nor as self concious about her own weight gain and using him as a trampline would be quite fun. She knew their kids would like that as well. Also, she liked the prospect of Reed possibly getting stronger as he gained weight. She was also looking forward to getting to eat whatever she wanted, especially fatty foods and sweets without guilt. While she had always exercised, she had never really enjoyed it, just did it to keep fit. She was pulled from her thoughts when she heard Reed agree to tell the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree that we should tell the team. In fact, we may as well just tell them right now. They are our family afterall and should understand\" Reed said with a smile. \"True but you know how my brother he is. He totally will be on my case about my ass getting huge\" she replied with a slight blush and an embarassed little laugh. \"I do know how he is but that is part of the reason why I am gaining with you, if I gain too he won't be able to talk about your own gain\" Reed explained. \"This is true\" Susan agreed with a smile before leaning over and kissing him softly onhis lips. She thought of mentioning to reed about how she thought that Crystal might be gaining weight too but decided against it as she didn't want to sound bitchy or like she was gossiping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go tell them\" Susan agreed as she took hold of his strong hand in her soft hand and lead him out to the living room. Their timing was perfect as just as they had come in, Ben and Alicia had come in from the kitchen and of course Johnny and Crystal was still on the couch. Susan couldn't deny that she was a little nervous about her and Reed's announcement and she could sense that Reed was too. Even though this was their family they were telling, it was still a little nervewracking telling them that they would be gaining weight on purpose so she didn't hold it against Reed for also being nervous despite his confidence with her in private about his idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, knowing Reed well as they were best friends, could also tell that his friend was nervous. \"Yuh got something to tell us Reed?\" he asked, trying to make it easier for his friend. \"Yeah, Sue and I have an announcement to make\" Reed said. Sue stood closer to him as she looked out over their family. Crystal having figured out some of the game used her controller to pause the game as she was sure Johnny was not going to. \"Your sister and brother in law have an announcement to make\" Crystal said as she took the controller out of his hand. \"I can't believe how both you and my sister act like my mom sometimes\" Johnny replied with a chuckle and a smirk. \"Sometimes we have to\" Crystal said before winking at Sue who winked back at her. Sue was glad to have some other women around the house, not only was it nice to also have some girl time but also because they could help her deal with her brother who sometimes would not listen to her because she was his sister. This was especially true with Crystal, since she was his girlfriend, he would listen to her the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. What you got to tell us?\" Johnny asked as he laid back against the couch, looking up at his sister and brother in law as he wrapped am around around Crystal pulling her close. Crystal smiled as she felt Johnny pulled her close and rested her head on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you have probably noticed, Sue and I have both put on some weight recently. We have both found that we liked the extra weight. We would actually like to gain some more weight but we don't want it to affect our crime-fighting abilities so we have decided to see how much weight we can gain before it affects our ability to fight crime\" Reed said. When he finished, Susan looked out over their family nervously, she could feel her heart beating faster, wondering what their reaction would be.</span></div></div>",

And I\u2019m sure Reed and Susan will still be just as hansom as they are now regardless of if they weigh two hundred pounds each, or even three hundred!\u201d  Susan felt a flush of shock coming to her face as she tried to imagine what her always slim and well toned body would look like if she ever actually reached three hundred pounds.  She was intending to let her diet slip, eat larger tastier meals but she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to take it that far.  Still if she was going to throw culinary restraint to the winds, she might find it had happened on its own....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, their announcement made and it clear that the team was okay with it, Reed and Susan withdrew from the room in which they\u2019d made that announcement as Susan wiped a bead of sweat form her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that could have gone worse.\u201d  Reed just smiled and continued to rub his body up against hers sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could have gone much worse, and just think Susan, the best is  yet to come!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She closed her eyes and moaneds oftly as she felt him rub his body up against hers sensually and she rubbed her body up against his sensually. She loved the feeling of their softer bellies pressing against each other. She leaned over, standing up on her tip toes and kissing Reed softly on his lips. She fell happily into the kiss, losing herself in the kiss and moment, letting it linger for a bit. After a minute or so, she gently broke the kiss, slowly opening her eyes, and looking over at Reed with a loving smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think we should go celebrate by going out to Dairy Queen\" Reed said with a mischevious smile. Susan giggled and smiled as she gently patted her belly. \"Sounds good to me hun.You know that I can't say no to sweets\" she replied. \"Oh I do. I remember you how loved the chocolates I brought you when we first started dating\" Reed said as he went over to the closet, getting their coats, and walking back over to Sue. He hung his own coat on his arms as he helped Sue into her coat before putting on his own. He then offered his arm to her, she slide her arm though his and headed over to the elevators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue and Reed rode the elevator down to the lobby, then stepped out, walked through lobby, and went out the front door. They then walked a couple blocks over to the Dairy Queen and headed inside. They took a seat at one of the booths. Even though they were celebrities they were left alone for the most part because they were New York locals. A waitress came over and asked for their order. Sue ordered a Oreo Brownie Earthquake while Reed got a Waffle Bowl Sundae. Since they were only ordering dessert, their order came quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed smiled as he dug into his sundae while watching watching Sue greedily dig into hers. \"Mm\" so good\" Sue moaned softly after taking a bite of one of the brownies. She really did love chocolate, she was a chocaholic which Johnny always tesaed her over. A mix of their being excited about purposely gaining weight, the deliciousness of their desserts, and their both having pretty big sweet tooths, the couple continued to stuff their face with their dessert, eating bite after bite without stopping. Before long, they had both finished their desserts. \"Mm, wasn't that a a great dessert hun?\" Reed asked Sue with a smile as he laid back, patting his gut, feeling quite full. His gut was pretty swollen and pushing out through through his uniform. \"Oh my god, it was! So delicious! Great suggustion hun\" Sue agreed, laying back. She moaned softly in stuffed exctasy as she began to gently rub her swollen belly which was pushing out through her uniform even more than it had after both dinner and lunch.</span></div></div>",

Her husband stayed approvingly silent, waiting for Susan to continue airing her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the two of us were to go for a nice moonlight walk together.  Feel the cool midnight air on our faces, and our bellies, feel the dirt beneath our boots, hold hands, rub bellies.\u201d  Susan paused for a moment as she looked at Reed and resisted the urge to turn the table that they were sitting at invisible so that she could see just how big the two of them had gotten without anything in the way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut such of a display of her powers without proper warning might scare or at least confuse a few people and Susan didn\u2019t want to make a scene any more than she already had by consuming such an extra large dessert with such gusto.  Besides in her heart of hearts she already knew the answer, they were bigger than they had been yesterday and that was big enough for now, though hopefully some day if they ever managed to wedge themselves into a booth like this one they would be able to feel their bellies rub up against one another as they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed nodded in approval of Susan\u2019s suggestion and slowly Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman rose from their seats, having already paid for their meals when they\u2019d ordered them in the first place.  However as they did so, their faces became somewhat tinged with green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan wasn\u2019t anywhere near used to eating this much food in one day and she could feel the contense of her stomach shifting uneasily about, as if searching desperately for one more inch of space that they could occupy.  Reed probably didn\u2019t have that particular problem due to his elastic body, but it was clear from the look on his face that he as well was having seconds thoughts about the possibility of doing much of the way of walking in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to spare her husband the embarrassment of having to admit he had grown too fat to live up to his wife\u2019s wishes Susan\u2019s quickly proposed a new plan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn second thought, lets just head back to the Baxter Building, it\u2019s been a long night and it couldn\u2019t hurt to get a little extra shut eye....\u201d  Reed nodded all too eagerly as the two slowly and hesitantly waddled their way out of the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the Dairy Cream they had gone to was near the Baxter Building and so the two didn\u2019t have far to go, they both became even more green around the gills during the elevator ride up to the top half of the building where their shared bedroom was, but the two managed to keep their massive meals down and collapse into bed with one another smiles on their faces.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Reed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Susan...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged quick kisses (their bellies bumping into each other in the process of course) before the fact that they were feeling so run down, tired, and flat out full finally caught up to them and they both drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Reed wake up the next day and examine their new figures.<br>\r\nAfter watching Susan and Reed waddle to bed Crystal wonders, why can\u2019t that be her and Johnny?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being so full, it didn't take Sue too long to fall fast asleep in a deep sleep. Even though she was in a deep sleep though, she still dreamed. In the dream, she saw herself on the scale, weighing herself but not being able to read it because of her big belly. \"Reed, could you read the number for me please?\" she asked him cutely. \"Of course hun. I would be happy to\" Reed replied as he leaned over to read the scale. As he did so, Sue took a good glance at her husband. He looked to be 300 pound as well. He had a big promient gut to bulged out, pressing his uniform out fair but it wasn't pushing it to it's limit as it was designed to stretch vary far due to his powers which she thought was very lucky. In addition to his big gut he now had some good sized man boobs that were also quite noticeable in his suit. His arms were fatter but his shoulders were also bigger. His face has also gained some weight and was puffy looking. \"302 gorgeous pounds\" Reed said, pulling Sue back to the moment. \"Oh my god! Wow, I am really getting fat\" she giggled excitedly with a slight blush. \"You are and it looks so great on you\" Reed commented to Sue as he gazed over at her lovingly as she stepped off the scale. She smiled feeling her husband's eyes on her and she shook her big butt for him seductively. She then began to look over her own body. She also had a promient gut that was pushing out through her uniform. Her breasts were now D cups which she quite liked and they were pushing out through her uniform as well and much more than Reed's man boobs were obviously. Her thighs were very thick and rubbing together. Her hips were wider. She then glanced at her backside in the mirror and saw that she had a big round soft fat butt. She had always wanted a fat butt in addition to bigger breasts and now she had both. Her arms were fat as well and as her face which was puffy. With Sue's fat being spread out all over her body and her body not designed for stretching, her uniform was dangerously tight and was feeling close to ripping at any moment. It was one of the last oufits she had that she could still fit in and it was always good to have on your uniform in case a villain attacks the city. Reed then stepped on the scale and had the same proud of reading the scale because of his gut. \"Could you read the sacle for me babe?\" he asked Sue. \"Sure hun\" Sue said, bending over, enjoying feeling her soft fat jiggle as she did so. She was so glad and not to mention relieved that it didn't cause her uniform to rip over. \"You are 307 pounds. Wow even fatter then me. Congrats hubby. I got to catch you up now\" Sue purred flirtiously. \"I love it when you talk like that\" Reed winked back. Their weight gain was starting to turn into a competition, trying to see who could gain more weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed and Sue then wadded into the kitchen for breakfast. They now had a cook to cook for them since everyone had gotten to fat and lazy to cook. Ben was larger all over, his chest, arms, legs, gut, and face were all bigger but you couldn't see any fat due to his frame now being solid rock. He looked more like a bigger rock creation more than anything else, he was just more rocky looking all over. Johnny was now teasing calling him his own mini mountain that was drying him crazy. Alicia was definitely looking fatter and softer. Unlike Sue though, her gain was mostly in her belly, breasts, and face. She had a big prominent gut that pushed out through her t-shirt, rolling it up. Her breasts were also D cup nows and pushing out through her shirt, further straining her shirt. Her face was also fatter looking and puffy. Then there was Johnny. The last person she had ever thought would get fat had. Like Reed, Johnny had a big fat gut that was sticking out promiently. His legs were wider and fatter and his butt was bigger and wider too. Unlike Sue's butt though, it didn't have a nice round shape. His arms were also fatter as well but his face remained thin. Crystal had gotten fat too and was about the same size as Sue. Being an inhuman, her soft round breasts were now e cups which pushed out promiently in her blue uniform. She had a big fat gut that pushed out proming thorugh the uniform as well. Her thighs were thich and rubbed together and her hips were wider. She also had a soft round fat big butt as well. Crystal's arms were fatter but her face had remained thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the family was already at the table as they watched Reed and Sue waddle into the room. They both took their seats in their usual chats. Both were a little winded and breathing kinda heavy was it wasn't easy to carry around their 300 plus pound bodies around. Once they were seated, everyone was served. Everyone got huge stacks of chocolate chip pancakes which the whole family loved. There was 10 pancakes in each of the stack covered with butter and maple syrup. Everyone greedily and hungrily dug in, stuffing bite after bite down their throat. They only stopped occasionall for a sip of milk or orange juice as they each had a glass of both. There wasn't much talking as they all eat, they were all too hungry to talk, all they wanted to do was just eat. When everyone finished their pancakes and both glasses of milk and orange juice, they both laid back in their chairs, the guys groaning as they rub their guts and the girls moaning as they rubbed heir guts. They all enjoyed being this extremely stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Challenge you to a burping contest\" Johnny said with a laugh to Ben as Reed and the girls rolled their eyes. In no way did Ben want to do it but he was so stuffed that he couldnt help but release a burp. \"Oh no\" Ben growled as Johnny laughed before letting out a burp of his own. Reed was about to say something but because he was so stuffed he let out a burp accidently as well. The guys continued to have their burping contenst as the Crystal and Sue began to talk. Alicia was feeling so stuffed that all she wanted to do was lay there, moaning softly, rubbing her bloated belly. \"I am so glad that you and Reed decided to get fat Sue. I am really enjoying getting to pig out on all kinds of delicious fatty foods, gain weight from it, and become fat. Exercise is really overated. It's much more food to sit around and stuff our face\" Crystal said with a smile to Sue. \"I am glad we did too and so glad that you all decided to join us. I never really liked exercise to begin with so I much prefer to sit around, be lazy, and pig out\" Sue agreed with a smile and a soft laugh. \"I also think us girls are meant to be fat. Our beauty is ehanced with the each extra pound we get that makes us softer and curvier\" Sue continued as she continued to rub her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a familiar threating vote came from their cook who had their back to them. Sue gasped and felt a shiver down her spine as the cook turned around to be not the cook they though they knew, Doctor Doom in disguise. Doom removed his mask to show his face with a smug smile on his face. The rest of the group turned to look at Doom in equal surprise. \"I am so glad that you girls are enjoying your gain because you are all going to be growing much fatter\" he said with an evil laugh. He then paused, wanting to save this moment of victory before explaining to his enemies what he had done to them. \"I put some very special and rare chemicals into those pancakes you all just consumed like pigs and soon you are all going to be as fat as pigs. Those chemicals will expontentially increase the fat cells in your bodies making you very fat\" he said with an evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue then gasped as she felt her body begin to tingle, it was a tingly good feeling she had to admit before feeling her body start to grow fatter and fatter. Her breasts and belly inflating out in front of her fast, her thighs growing thicker and wider, rubbing together more and spreading out more, and her ass growing bigger and taking up the whole chair. She moaned and screamed as she felt herself continue to grow, stretching her uniform to it's limit before busting off. Still her gain continued and she could hear the chair groan under her weight. She saw this happening to rest of her family but she felt helpless. She felt too stuffed and fat to move. She also felt weak, realizing that she no longer had any strength and had realized some pounds ago that she no longer had any energy. She lay there helplessly as she continued to grow and grow, causing the chair to groan more and more under her weight until it can no longer hold her girth, collasping to the ground, causing Sue to fall flat down on the ground on her big fat butt with Doom laughing evily.</span></div></div>",

It had started out so sweat and warm and comforting, her and the others sitting around a table each and every one of them quite playfully plump, but then it had taken a turn for the nightmarish at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could still feel all that weight she had gained in the dream, as if it was hanging over her, pressing down on, making her wonder if she\u2019d even be able to move her fingers or sit up in bed.  She shook her head and slowly arose proving that she wasn\u2019t a helpless immobile pile of blubber, she was still Susan Richards, she was still thin... well sort of thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan beat a quick retreat to the bathroom that she and Reed shared and after taking care of a little business spent some time examining herself in the mirror.  Her belly had shrunken considerably now that all the food she had eaten had digested, but the size that had once been present there had migrated in bits and pieces all over her body making her arms slightly thicker, her ass slightly plumper, her hips slightly wider, her legs slightly heftier.  Each and any single one of those things on its own didn\u2019t mean much, but taken all together they doubtlessly painted a picture of a pudgier Susan Richards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Invisible Woman shook out her head of golden hairs.  No that was nothing, it was just a bad dream, a bad dream brought on the by the part of her that was still afraid of what others might say if she ever decided to cut loose and start eating and stop exercising for a while.  There was no way that she\u2019d ever get as fat as she was in that dream, three hundred pounds?  It was preposterous!  The largest that she\u2019d ever get was doubling her current weight to two hundred and forty pounds, well maybe go a little bit bigger to an even two hundred and fifty pounds, but that was it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides if she ever noticed that her weight was getting in the way of her being an effective superheroine then Susan would cut back on it, and diet herself a few pounds thinner, she could still do that it she wanted to, it wasn\u2019t like she had no self control any more was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally left the bathroom Susan discovered that Reed had evidently woken up before her and left her a note on the bed.  It said that today was his day to cook breakfast for the team and so he was going to go all out for Susan\u2019s benefit.  Despite her recent worries over the possible side effects of her weight gain Susan licked her lips and headed for the building\u2019s kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw there was more than even she had imagined.  A huge feast was laid out at the table with Johnny, Ben, Alicia and Crystal partaking every bit as voraciously as they had been in the dream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Susan I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re up I made extra for you!\u201d  Reed announced as he elongated an arm to pull out a chair for her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She allowed his elongated arm to push in her chair. As he went to grab her breakfast, she couldn't help but look over at her family. She was amazed to see them all eating voraciously just like they had in her dream although they were much fatter in her dream. While this was a little weird for her considering the dream she told herself to calm. Yes there were such things as aliens and the supernatural but dreams didn't always predict what would happen in reality and she knew this. She took the opportunity to remind herself of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue then smiled as she watched Reed bring over her breakfast and set it down in front of her before retaking his seat. She couldn't help but lick her lips as she looked down at her breakfast which both looked and smelled delicious. She had four chocolate chip pancakes covered with butter and maple syrup, two slices of french toast, and a glass of milk and orange juice each. She was then reminded that in her dream she had eaten chocolate chip pancakes. She quickly pushed that thought away under the thinking that she would be contradicting herself if on the day that she told her family she would be gaining weight on purpose, she eat less while the rest of her family ate more. In no way was she going to let that happen. She the blushed slightly as she heard her stomach grumbe hungrily.  \"I think your stomach is telling you to eat hun\" Reed replied sweetly with a wink to Sue. \"It is. I need to start eating\" she agreed with a smile and a soft laugh. She then gentyl patted her belly, silently telling it that she would feed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue cut up a couple big bites of her pancakes and ate them. \"Mm, so good\" she moaned softly after swalling her first forkful. She saw that though Reed had been eating his own food, he had been watching her curiously, wanting to make sure that she liked her food. \"This is delicous babe. Thank you\" Sue replied back to Reed with a big smile. \"I am so glad you like it. Eat up\" Reed encouraged her before continuing to eat his own food. Sue nodded and continued to eat bite after bite of her delicious pancakes. Unlike in her dream which Sue found comforting, was that their was plenty of talk as they all ate. Reed was telling Ben and Johnny about his latest invention. In truth Johnny was only half listining, he was concentrating more on Crystal's breasts which seemed bigger to them. Sue was talking with Crystal and Alicia as she ate, talking about maybe having a girls day out to get their hair and nails done, have lunch, and do some shopping, They hadn't had a girls day out in awhile and felt like they were due for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing half distracted by the coversation, Sue found herself finishing fourth pancake before she knew it. The rest of the family had finished the rest of their meal now except for her who had come to the table last. She was starting to feel full now but she knew that she had some room left and she didn't want to disapoint her husband. She took a couple sips of her milk before starting on her pancakes. Crystal was really glad that Reed and Sue had decided to gain weight purposefully, especially Sue. She thought the pounds were adding to Sue's beauty. She had put on some weight herself and was liking it. She couldn't get enough of earth's delicious fatty foods. Since she was not going to stop eating all the food she had been eating and was not going to start exercising (she never had to do it at home, it sounded boring from what Sue described, and she had decided she was not going to try it) she knew that she was going to gain more weight. She liked this though and was excited about it. She thought it would be fun for them to grow fat together. She was also glad that Alicia was going to be joining them in gaining. Keep eating girl Crystal thought to herself as she watched Sue slow down in her eating as she ate the french toast. Sue slowly but surely continued to eat the french toast until she had finished it all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue washed down the french toast with her glass of milk before laying back in her chair, moaning in stuffed exctasy as she began to gently rub her bloated belly. Here she was finding herself compleltely stuffed again and loving it.</span></div></div>",

Susan blushed as she looked across the table at the other woman.  Crystal was still dressed in that particular outfit she had worn when first arriving back from Attilian, it was more or less cut along the same lines as a Fantastic Four costume, except that it lacked a logo and was bright yellow in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that Crystal, you're starting to look a bit like a bumble bee from where I'm sitting.\"  Sure enough Crystal's gut had become quite noticeably engorged from the large meal she had already consumed, but evidently it would take still more to dampen her spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm sure!\"  She announced with considerable vigor.  Susan shrugged and summoned up a pair of invisible forcefields that dumped half of the pancakes before her, and half of them before Crystal.  The two women once more got down to eating, devouring the pancakes down to the very last scrap before trying to make conversation again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for agreeing to gain with me Crys, it'll be nice to have another plump superheroine around to prove that I'm not the only one who thinks that a waist is a terrible thing to mind.\"  Crystal giggled, burped, and then patted her belly which happened to now be even lager than Susan's, clearly she had well and truly been stuffing herself through breakfast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its no problem Susan.  Remember I am a princess after all and as such I've got a taste for the finer things in life.\"  She stated calmly before licking a few dollops of syrup from her bare fingers, enjoying the taste of the stuff as she leaned back in her chair too stuffed to think about even standing up....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sue was also still feeling too stuffed to move. She continued to sit there, leaning back in her chair, rubbing her stuffed belly as Crystal did the same. The girls continued talking and along with Alicia agreed to have a girl's day out the following day. Their coversation then moved on to celebrity gossip about the other female superheroes and celebrities. Johnny had gone back to playing his video game a short time ago and Ben went into the gym to light weights. Ben was fine becoming bigger but along with that he also wanted to get stronger. After he felt like he had digested enough, Reed excused himself and got up. \"I am going to go back to my lab but come see me when you can walk again Sue\" he said with a wink causing Sue to blush and Crystal to laugh. Reed then headed back to his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing girls, Sue, Crystal, and Alicia ended up talking for awhile which was just as well since both Sue and Crystal knew that they wouldn't be able to walk for awhile. After about a little over an hour or so, Sue and Crystal regained their strength to get up. Alicia got up and headed into the gym to watch Ben work out. She always found it so hot to watch him work out. Crystal slowly got up, it took her a second to get used to the new heaviness of her belly before slowly heading to the living room. Never had she been so glad to spend more time on the couch with Johnny as he played his videos games then now. She made her way over to the couch and collasped down on it. She was still pretty full so she was a little tired and a little winded as she sat down on the couch next to Johnny. She laid back on the couch, resting her hands on her still bloated belly as she watched Johnny play his game. \" Hey beautiful. I am glad you came to join me\" Johnny replied with a smile as he leaned over to kiss Crystal softly on her cheek and gently pat her belly. He was surprised by the fact that he was finding Crystal's growing belly hot but he was. \"Mm, that feels good Johnny. How about you rub it for me\" Crystal purred seductively as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also took Sue some effor to get up as she slowly got up herself. She was still getting used to the new weight she had gained plus now the added heaviness of her stuffed belly. She then slowly made her to Reed's lab. Like Crystal, she was feeling tired and a little winded from all that food. When she got into Reed's lab, she collasped into one of the chairs,  laying back, gently rubbing and patting her husband.  Reed looked up from his computer where he was working when he heard her, and turned around with a big smile as he saw her laying back in the chair. He was so turned on seeing her so bloated and tired. \"You look so beautiful Sue\" Reed commented sweetly as he looked over at her lovingly before getting up, walking over to her, leaning down, and kissed her softly on her sweet lips before gently patting her belly. He then pulled his chair over to her and took a seat next to her. \"So I have been coming up with a plan for how we can gain our weight\" he said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how full Sue was,  she was definitely up for talking about how they should gain weight. \"Well I am also ear Reed\" she said. \"Alright, well I think we should go out to eat alot and particularily to italian, mexican, and fast food resturants as they have the best tasting and most calorie foods. Second we need to be snacking constantly throughout the day. We need to keep the house stocked with items we like to eat so like chips, poptarts, cookies, donuts, ice cream, etc. We also need to be pretty lazy and sedentary so no exercise and no working out. I can just mostly spend my tiem working in the lab and just relax by reading or watching tv. You should just lay around here all day, reading, watch tv and movies, laying out on the patio to get some sun, and taking naps. While we are being lazy is a good time to constantly snack. Sue considered this all for a moment before nodding her head in agreement. \"I love all of your ideas Reed. They sound really full and I know they will work. I am excited to get started with this\" she replied in a cute and excited tone with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get started\" Reed replied with a big smile. \"I love the way you think\" Sue purred back seductively with a flirtious little wink.</span></div></div>",

As Reed began to near the bottom of the plate Susans got in on the act herself, not much of course, only eating two of the cookies, but still eating them all the same.  Reed nodded in approval as he began to rub Susan\u2019s belly and leaned his own swollen stomach against hers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good Susan.  Don\u2019t worry it\u2019ll get easier as time passes.  The more  you eat the more stretched out and larger your stomach will become allowing you not only to eat more, but you\u2019ll also probably start to feel a lot hungrier than you normally would be.  That\u2019s a good sign of course, once your stomach has been properly stretched out stuffing your face and growing larger won\u2019t be a task any more, it will become a necessity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded along in a sleep like haze as Reed slowly helped her out of the chair she\u2019d seated herself in, and the two wobbled their way back to their bedroom.  Susan didn\u2019t bother changing clothes before she collapsed on the bed and fell asleep.  Reed took the time to place various candies, cakes, brownies, and other fattening morsels all around the room so that when Susan emerged from her current food comma she\u2019d be able to gorge herself anew.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMeanwhile Reed returned to his laboratory and began to work on experiments that he thought might aid the speed and ease with which Susan, himself, Crystal, and any other members of the Fantastic Four who showed an interest in gaining weight would pile on the pounds.</span></div></div>",

They are only enhacing your beauty which I didn't think was possible\" he replied sincerely, looking Crystal in her eyes so that she would know that he meant it. \"So if you want to keep gaining weight, I am all for it and would love to help you gain.

He and Crystal wouldn't be the only ones gaining either, Reed, Sue, Ben, and Alicia would all be gaining as well.

Because of it Crystal\u2019s belly hadn\u2019t had nearly as much time to digest all the food she had eaten earlier in the day and so she ate a surprisingly small amount, thought it was still more than she normally would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny\u2019s stomach on the other hand not having anything approaching the huge backlog of food to be digested from breakfast that Crystal\u2019s did had been able to burn through the tidbits that Crystal had prepared for him earlier in the day and he ended up eating almost twice as much as his girlfriend did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Human Torch was done stuffing his face he leaned back in his chair and belched smiling at Crystal whose green eyes were growing heavy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph... so much food.  I\u2019m not even sure if I can make it to bed, I just want to fall asleep right here and now!\u201d  Johnny smiled back at her, reaching out a hand to gently caress her belly which was now blowing up to be larger than your average volley ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it Crys that sounds like a great idea to me too...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had been already napping for much of the day on her husband\u2019s orders and so the Invisible Woman was ready and raring to go when it came time for dinner.  She shovelled the various breads, meats, and vegetables that Reed had made for her down her throat without looking back.  Susan\u2019s belly grew bigger and bigger until it had reached almost the size of a woman who was about to give birth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrrppp... looks like I\u2019m pregnant with a food baby!\u201d  The bloated blond playfully announced to the others at the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one present who ate more than Susan was her husband.  Reed had eaten quite a lot at breakfast, and been snacking as he worked in his lab for most of the day, but he also possessed an elastic stomach.  This allowed him to cram far more food down his gullet than any normal person possibly could and in point of fact by the time that he was done eating Reed was more or less pinned in place by a belly the size beanbag chair, not that it seemed to bother him very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Alicia while not having made any sort of pact like Reed and Susan were still packing the food away quite noticeably, though they at least moderated their eating enough that they were able to depart from the table when they were finally done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes after they finally let their utensils lay still Johnny and Crystal each holding their bellies pathetically waddled off towards their now shared bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we try an do the same?\u201d  Susan asked feeling a little pathetic for how quickly she was allowing her eating habits to weaken her.  If some supervillian attacked at the moment all she\u2019d be able to would be lay there like a bump on the log.  Reed just smiled back at her, somehow finding the energy to stretch an arm across the gap between their chairs, comfortingly entombing his wife within his own elastic flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy bother?  Johnny and Crystal are making breakfast tomorrow, why don\u2019t we just lay here, they\u2019ll wake us when it times to eat again.\u201d  Susan who felt like she was now draped in the worlds most comfortable sleeping bag gave a small utterance of agreement before she closed her eyes and drifted off to dreamland.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Fantastic Four were giving into to eating lots and being lazy,and more specifically growing fat quickly. He was very pleased with this. He knew the hardest part of the battle was over and now they would be gaining quickly. The time for him to act would be very soon though it wasn't time yet. He smiled as he thought of Reed turning into a ball of blubber. This pleased him as it totally took his main rival for Susan's affection out of commission. He really liked that Reed's power would be more of a liable with the extra weight. Because Reed's power was to stretch, his body would stretch with soft flab as he got fatter and fatter leaving him weak and out of shape. He (Reed) would become a fat helpless blob and lose Sue to him (Namor) which he had always want He always knew that he could best Reed and he had now found a way to do so. While Namor was not sure how gain would affect Johnny's flame power, he was sure that having a big gut and fatter legs would leave him permantly grounded. He figured that if Johnny couldn't fly, it would put him out of comission as well. He was however worried about Ben aka the Thing. He wasn't sure that the extra weight would weaken him at all as he had always been the heaviest member of the team. Oh well, he could handle him and that is what he had his warriors for. He smiled then as began to think of the girl's weight gain. Alicia, having no power was no threat to him but he enjoyed the thought of her becoming fat, with big soft round breasts and a big gut. He then smiled as he thought of Crystal. He found the thought of her with a big belly and bottom heavy so hot. He knew the extra weight would weaken her and make her out of shape thus prevening her from being able to fight for very long and probably not even that effectively. He smiled the greatest when he thought of Susan fat. Her saw her breasts getting bigger, softer, and round which was nice but he was really excited by the thought of her growing a really fat belly, a fat ass, wide hips, and thick thighs. Mm so hot he thought to himself. He saw her being a fat blob as well but one under his watch and turned into a fat blob by his lovingly feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his loyal guards standing next to him was a long and trusted friend. Due to their friendship, he was allowed to ask Namor things and question him on things. Namor allowed this because he trusted his friend and felt it was good to have some challenge him at time. It was part of what made for sucessful goverment. He was curious as to why Namor wanted Susan fat. \"Namor, if I may. I have always wondered, why do you want to make Susan Storm fat?\" Namor was a little annoyed to be pulled from his thoughts but if he were allow anyone to do so, it would be his friend. \"Susan Storm is the most beautiful women ever and as such she deserves to be my queen. Women are supposed to be fat, especially really beautiful ones, and beautiful ones that are queens.  I find women gaining weight so beautiful and hot. It also seems very natural and right because they are designed to get fat which is I say women are supposed to get fat. I can't wait to have Susan as my queen, to lay in bed all day and indule all of her favorite sweet and fatty foods while being pampered with all of our world's finest while never having to lift a finger to do anything.. She will become my beautiful fat spoiled pampered and lazy queen just like she was always meant to be\" Namor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamor's loyal guard considered this for a moment before nodding his head in agreement. Namor had made some really good points and he had to admit that Sue and most women would really look beautiful fat. \"I see. You have me now convinced\" he told his friend with a grin and Namor just laughed. \"I had a feeling that I would turn you into a fat girl lover\" Namor replied back.</span></div></div>",

Her husband just smiled back at her and thrust his hips slightly causing bouncing of his bodies flab to slam playfully into his wife\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Susan, with my elastic arms I\u2019ll always be able to hug you no matter how big you get, and if you can\u2019t hug me back, well a belly bump is as good as a hug from my adoring wife.  Now then lets get down to cooking shall we?\u201d  The pair nodded as they knew that it was there turn to prepare breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had once been an ordinary average day to day task now seemed to take on something of a religious air about it as everyone in the Baxter Building seemed so dedicated to stuffing their faces and growing larger.  Susan used her powers to created invisible forcefields which floated plates around the room as Reed returned to his chair and used his elastic arms to manuever carefully about the room cooking up yet another large feast for his spouse and teamates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Reed we need to be a bit careful...\u201d  Susan admitted slowly as she finished up her half of the cooking.  \u201cAfter all we did promise ourselves that we\u2019d watch our weight gain and if it started to affect our crime fighting then we\u2019d stop.\u201d  She said as if she half regretted the decision before boldly pushing onwards.  \u201cThe problem is that we\u2019re eating such huge meals that we\u2019re too full to even think about trying to fight crime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed seeing that Susan was somewhat distressed by this realization stopped cooking to deliver a warm squishy hug to his beloved.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Susan, I\u2019m sure we can still fight crime with the best of them.  But if it bothers you that much then we\u2019ll both make sure to only eat a little more than we normally do for breakfast and go out on patrol afterwards.\u201d  He sealed this promise to Susan with a kiss on her lips and went back to cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Susan was suprised that the meal didn't satisfy her as much as she thought it would. In solidarity with Reed and Sue, Alicia and Ben ate only a slightly larger breakfast then before. Johnny needed to catch up with the rest of the family's gain and Crystal loved pigging out too much to stop, both totally pigged at breakfast. They were so stuffed, they just sat there for awhile after, relaxing, rubbing their bellies, waiting till they had digest enough for them to get up again. \"Doesn't it feel so nice to be so stuffed Johnny?\" Crystal asked Johnny with a smile as she laid back in her seat, gently rubbing her bloated stuffed belly, admiring it. \"Yes it does Crystal. I am glad that I listened to you\" Johnny replied with a smile as he patted his own bloated stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed and Sue gathered up the dishes and began washing them. \"I can't believe that meal didn't fill me\" Susan admitted with a blush to Reed as she washed dishes with him. Reed grinned at that. \"I am not. I was pretty confident that we had both stretched out our stomachs enough that that wouldn't fill us up anymore. I suggust that we stop for a snack on our patrol if it doesn't look like anything is going on. What do you say?\" Reed asked her with a hopeful smile. With Sue's confession, he felt like it would be more likely that she would agree. \"Yeah, that sounds good\" Sue agreed with a smile. When they finished cleaning the dishes, they said good bye to Crystal and Johnny who were still too stuffed to go. Reed grabbed his money and he and Sue headed for the elevators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rode it down to the lobby and headed out into the fresh air. Reed wrapped one arm around Sue's waist, pulling her closer. He loved how much softer she was now feeling. Sue cuddled closer to him, enjoying how Reed was starting to become like a soft cuddly teddy bear for her. As they walked down the street lovingly, the glanced around the street, looking for any crime or trouble to stop. After going a couple of blocks, they hadn't seen any crime but they were getting alot of looks by passing people by. They were celebrities afterall and anytime a celebrity gained weight, the public took a great notice. Reed and Sue were not going to be an exception to this. Reed just smiled and continued walking, paying it no mind. Sue was having a harder time with it, she was really embarrassed, and she moved her gaze to the ground to avoid all the stares. While she was embarssed about this, she also liked all the attention, being embarassed about her gain and it (her gain) being noticed was a turn on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue was a stress eater which meant that she ate anytime she was stressed and this was definitely one of those times. A mix of her stress caused hunger and not getting a full breakfast was making Sue start to feel very hungry. She tried to tell her belly to wait more but she could herself growing more and more hungrier. She blushed as she heard her stomach grumble hungrily loudly as they went passed another block. Reed looked over at her and said with a chuckle and a wink, \"Yeah, I am\" she admitted with a blush. \"Don't be embarassed Sue, that is a good thing\" Reed comforted her with a smile. Sue nodded as she heard Reed's words, knowing he was right and it made her feel a little better. \"It doesn't look like anything is happening up so how about we stop for that snack now? I am feeling pretty hungry now so I am really ready for a snack\" she replied with a giggle and a flirtious little wink as she gently patted her belly. She couldn't help but blush again when her stomach grumbled hungrily again.</span></div></div>",

She began to stroke it slowly and calmly trying to soothe it, but it refused to be pacified by something so simple as a pleasant touch, it wanted food lots of it.  The Invisible Woman\u2019s face went horribly red as she turned to look at a nearby restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReed I really think we should stop here and get a bite to eat.\u201d  Susan advised and Reed responded with a warm kiss on her cheek.  \u201cWhatever you wish darling.  I do believe that I could go for some additional nourishment as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Reed entered the restraint were seated and ordered.  While they waited for their food to come Susan continued to rub her belly wishing it would stop rumbling so loudly that she was sure people halfway across the room could hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReed... I\u2019m not sure I like this.\u201d  Susan said as she looked down at her midsection, feeling slightly ashamed of herself.  \u201cIts not that gaining weight hasn\u2019t been nice, especially not seeing you get fat either, it\u2019s been wonderful but... Reed I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in control of myself any more.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Susan could go any further down that path a large plate full of the hamburgers she had ordered was brought to the table and Susan began to attack them viciously, devouring one after another after another in only a handful of bites.  Her belly was calmed, but they tasted so good that Susan couldn\u2019t stop.  She just kept eating and eating and eating, until she had cleared the entire plate devouring over half a dozen hamburgers in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Invisible Woman lay back in her bench, her blue belly puffed out quite noticeably as she let loose with a most indelicate belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what I mean Reed?  I just can\u2019t be satisfied with a small meal any more.  And when I try to eat a little bit bigger one than normal I just get hungry as all get out so I just eat and eat and eat until this happens, and now I don\u2019t think I can even stand up let alone fight crime.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed whose own stomach had become quite swollen stretched his neck across the gap between the two and kissed Susan on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it you\u2019ve only been gaining weight for a short while now Susan.  I\u2019m sure your recently heightened caloric intake is simply playing hell with your body\u2019s internal workings.  If you just keep at it for a week or two I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to get a handle on things.  Now then since so you\u2019re so sure that you can\u2019t walk, how about I carry you back home for  a nice nap?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was impressed and also turned on by the fact that even with his extra weight, Reed could pick her up easily. If anything he seemed stronger due to his extra weight. After paying for the meal and picking Sue up, Reed carried her out of the resturant and out onto the street. Sue couldn't but blush again feeling all kinds of stares on her and her husband, especially her and her bloated belly. As embarassing as all these stars were however, she had to admit she kinda liked the attention. The other thing she had to admit was that as embarassing as it was to loose control and pig out on those hamburgers, she ahd fully enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Reed hailed a cab that took them back to the Baxer Building. Reed carried Sue inside and they rode the elevator up to their floor. The elevator door slide open and Reed carried Sue out. Johnny was sitting in the living room in one of the chairs, playing his video game as usual. His belly still bloated and pusing out through his blue uniform. \"Hey Johnny\" Reed said as he carried Sue over to the couch and gently laid her down on it, her head resting on one of the pillows. \"Wow, looks like you ate well sister dear\" Johnny replied teasingly with a chuckle as he put his game on pause. \"Shut up\" Sue moaned softly before gently rubbing her bloated belly. Secretly she was liking his teasing but in no way was she going to let her brother know that and let him get any satisfication from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have some news though. We got a phone call from Namor, inviting us to a feast down in their world. He says it's like a peace offering as he wants to make ammends for his past actions and want us all to be friends. I know that you are the leader so I told him that we needed to decide as a team if we were going to come or not and that we would get back to him\" Johnny explained. \"Thank you Johnny, you did the right thing\". Both Reed and Sue, especially Sue were pleased to see Johnny showing some signs of growing up. Sue attributed alot of Johnny's growing up to his relationship with Crystal which she thought was grew for her brother. Speaking of Crystal though, she didn't see her around. \"Johnny, where's Crystal?\" she asked her brother. \"Her huge breakfast really made her sleepy so I heped her back to bed so she could nap\" Johnny replied with a grin and a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue nodded at that before returning her attention to Reed. She had known Reed not to really like or trust Namor and for good reason since he (Namor) had tried to steal her away from him and make her his bride. While she had no way of knowing if Namor had really changed his ways and wanted to be friends she felt like they should at least give him a chance. It would be worth the risk as if it were true then they would have a powerful ally on their side. If it was all just a ploy to trap them, they had defeated him before and she had no doubt they could do it again even with their extra weight. She could tell that Reed was deep in thought about what to do on this matter. Turning back to Johnny she saw that he had returned to his game but put on headphones so they couldn't hear the game. Satisfied that Johnny wasn't listining to them, Sue turned her attention back to Reed and looked him in his sexy eyes that always captured her attention. \"Reed, I know you don't like or trust Namor and with good reason. I don't fully trust him either but maybe he has changed and matured just like Johnny has. I say we give this a shot and if it proves to be false we will be able to handle him just like we did before\" she said in a soft and sincere tone as she continued to rub her bloated belly. \"Plus, we will get a free meal out of it which is something I know we both will like\" she added with a giggle and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only that but Reed had made sure to install special devices on their costumes which would see to it that as long as they were wearing them, they\u2019d be able to breath normally and be protected from both the freezing cold and the crushing pressure at the bottom of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they first left the sub it seemed unnecessary however as Namor had taken care to see to it that the feast area was filled with ordinary air.  All of his guards were wearing special helmets to make sure they had ample supplies of the water they needed to extract their own oxygen from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in my friends, come in and dine to your hearts content!\u201d  He greeted them jovially as they found themselves in a room the size of your average auditorium hall, and filled more or less completely with one long table covered by countless ecstatic and tasty delicacies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various members of the Fantastic Four (along with Crystal and Alicia who they had brought along for the ride) took one look at all of this food, and then without a second thought raced forward and began to consume it with reckless abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the unlucky group of superheroes and their hangers on Namor had proceeded to season the food with special spices that were designed to speed up the process of digestion to the point where the food worked its way through its hosts body so quickly, it would be almost impossible for them to get full no matter how much they ate!  Now all the king of Atlantis had to do was simply sit back and watch as his hated foes and rival for Susan\u2019s affection were completely and utterly defeated by their own gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed Richards was the first to truly show the effects of the tainted food as he ate more and more of it.  His belly continued to grow outward, but so did the rest of him as well.  After consuming food non stop for nearly half an hour (and his team barely putting a dent in the total amount of consumable Namor had provided them with Mr. Fantastic was a sorry sight to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms were growing larger and larger, heavier and heavier with each passing moment.  Thus even though Reed felt an intense desire to eat more and more his body was stating to betray him as his own limbs grew heavier and heavier, making it harder and harder to manipulate them.  He awkwardly instead settled for stretching out his neck so as to swallow the food whole right on the table further adding to his gluttony.  As the team continued to feast Namor nodded along before finally deciding that his captives had consumed more than enough for him to put the next step of his plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope that you have enjoyed my gracious offerings, as you will be sampling them for the rest of your lives.  From this moment onwards, each and every one of your are my prisoners!\u201d  He bellowed at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reed had arrived feeling very skeptical of Namo'rs change of heart but he had forgotten all about that when he saw the feast and let his guard down. He instantly regretted it when he heard Namor's bellow. He quickly scolded himself before jumping into action without glancing at his family and team. They had heard Namor's words as well afterall so surely they were ready to jump into action to fight back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards! Guards\" Namor called as his armed guards came rasing in to surround the Fantastic Four plus Alicia and Crystal. Reed was feeling bloated and heavy from his big gut but with his stretchy arms and the added muscle the weight helped me put on, he was able to get up. It was then that the trouble started. The guards were coming at him with his staffs and he was having to duck and stretch as quick as he could around them but it wasn't woking to well. His full fat belly was making him sluggish casing his movement and stretch to come at a slower place. Also putting a damper on his ability to fight back, all of his fat was jiggle as though he was stronger, he was not toned anyway. It didn't take long for him to get winded and he was grateful to get to a corner but then he was surrounded by guards. He didn't want to give in but he was not sitting down leaning against the wall and he knew he didn't have the physical strength to fith back anymore. I let my gluttony get the best of me. Sue was right to be worried about us going to far he thought to himself with a sigh as he raised his hands up in surrender. \"I surrender\"  he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he had improved his temper and attitude, Johnny was still a hot head and immediately turned on fire when Namor's true self and plan emergered. His anger powered him to be able to get up without too much of a struggle even though he was very stuffed and his belly pushing out prominently just like Reed's. He began to run at the guards while on fire, trying to knock them back and out with his fire. It was then his trouble started. He found that he couldn't start going at a fast speed for him to knock off the guards and get into the fair. He was finding himself winded and grounded due to his bloated gut but also his overall fatter physique. He had to stop to catch his breathe in one of the empty chairs, collapsing into, raising his hands for surrender. He was so embarssed and felt his cheeks get ready not only from that but from being winded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen immediately got up and started fighting off the guards, throwing them off to the side and into the walls. The weight wasn't effecting him as negatively as it was the others. Namor had anticipated this and had a plan for that. He called his guards off of Ben and walked over in his direction. \"I give you a free shot at getting me human made of brick\" Namor taunted him with an evil smile. Enraged, Ben lunged at him but Namor being  light on his feet due to his muscular physique simply just quickly moved out of the way. Ben realized this too late but was too heavy to stop and ran crashing into the wall hard, leaving a big hole when he came to land in flat on his big gut. He then heard the guards quickly come up to the hole, their weapons raised at him. \"Aw, crap\" he said knowing he too was now defeated. I really gota start learning to stop charging the emeies he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Crystal a little more effort to get up than the guys as being a female she was naturally softer than the guys. Having the ability to control the classic four elements, she planned to use her ability over water to crash it down over Namor and his guards while still keeping herself, Alicia, and the Fantastic Four under the cover of air that Namor had provided. It took a great deal of energy to power up and use the elements. When she was thin and fit it was no problem and didn't think too much about it. Now that she was fat and out of shape, it was a problem. She was too fat and weak to power up to despite her best effort to push herself as far as she could to see if she could power up to but to no avail and she fell back down into her seat, breathing heavily, and sweating a little. Adding insult to energy, the food left in front of her was too temptingly good for her to resisit and she eagerly dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Crystal, Sue had to use a little more effort to get up as due to being female, she was naturally softer than the guys. It was a hopeless situation with the guys now but she felt like she still had a chance to protect herself, Alicia, and Crysta who were all still at the table. Alicia was contining to watch everything in shock and horror as she continued to eat. Normally it took alot out of Sue to bring up the protective force-field even when she was thin and fit. It was now impossible now that she was fat and out of shape. She was too weak to bring it up no matter how hard she tired and concentrated. She was just too fat to bring up. She next tried to go invisible but her being fat prevented her from doing that as well. She was just too fat and out of shape for her powers to work. She collasped into her chair as well, sweating and out of breathe. I knew I was going too far with this weight gain. I lost control she thought to herself in embarassment and shame. She then noticed the food on the table that looked and smelled so good, that plus with her continuing hunger, which was excelerated by her trying to power, made it impossible for her to resist the food eagerly. She greedily dug into the food as well, stuffing bite after bite of delicious food down her throat, moaning after every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reed wanted to protest against this undignified treatment but he was feeling too full and tired to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had become an extra extra extra large the guards proceeded to lift up Johnny and toss him on top of Reed while Namor showed of his incredible strength by being able to heft the new heftier Ben Grimm and toss him onto Reed\u2019s body as well.  After that the guards began to fold Reed\u2019s body about so as to transform into a huge blanket with Ben and Johnny tucked into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that several more guards proceeded to roll Reed out of the room since there was no other possible wave to move him about as his new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReed!\u201d  Susan screamed at the sight of her husband being taken away from her, or at least she tried to.  In truth the words came out horribly grabbled do the fact that she uttered them through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed himself remained stonily silent as the three men were separated from their respective female counterparts.  They were rolled and rolled and rolled until finally the guards began to unpack them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally did, Reed Ben and Johnny found themselves confronted with a horrific sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no... not again...\u201d  Muttered Reed as he discovered that they had been transported to a large cell at least half of which was taken up by still more of the same incredibly tempting food that the Fantastic Four had been stuffed with back in the dinning room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly rising to their feet and moving like awkward plump zombies the heroic trio found themselves being drawn forward towards their next massive meal, evidently Namor would not be satisfied with having truly humiliated the Fantastic Four until they became too fat to move, let alone fight back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the dining hall itself, Crystal, Alice and Susan still snacked away.  They new the food was bad for them, they knew it was transforming them into massive pathetic blue balls of flab that were too tired to fight back, but right now every single scrap of energy they had at the moment was being diverted towards them eating as much as they could and forcing their chunky arms to take food to their fat faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamor sat down next to Susan and began to run his hands along her now much thicker curves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry my sweet you will have a chance to see what has become of your former lover, but for now simply eat and be merry for your growing girth is all too fitting for the new Queen of Atlantis...\u201d  Susan wished she could close her ears and not hear Namor\u2019s words even as she ate.</span></div></div>",

Reed's neck had elongated and against his will as his body started to secrete a slime of some sort. Ben's rocky skin was becoming softer also, and his nose was pointing out, forming a large protrusion not unlike a horn. Johnny's body was parting itself into long, connected strands before his feet became rooted to the ground, forming roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the men of the Fantastic Four were becoming sea monsters. Reed, after observing his changes, was becoming something like a giant eel. Ben was an enormous narwhale. Johnny was a living reef formation with tons of eyes and many mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they had seen their lovers stuffing their faces at Namor's banquet table, they would have realized that they weren't alone in their changes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was the first to notice. After cramming more food into her mouth, she looked down. Her skin was becoming gray and her teeth really hurt for some reason. Her blubbery body expanded more and more as her teeth stretched into two enormous tusks, her feet merging together into some kind of tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia was next to experience the change, her body turning even more blue as she expanded. Out and out her form grew, arms and hands becoming massive fins, her face stretching out, her head increasing as her legs also merged together to form a large tail, the bane of ships everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was last to change though she expected something to happen to her as she observed her friends changing as well. She felt...blobby. Her entire body was becoming softer, surrounded by flab. Instinctively, Crystal knew that this blubber was to protect her from the harsh climes of the deep ocean. Her eyes turned completely black and shimmered with an animal gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamor observed all of these changes with a proud grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eel that had been the most brilliant mind in the cosmos was still smart. But now that intelligence was being used to forge weapons of conquest for Atlantis, the eel's intelligent eyes reminding one of Reed Richards, trapped in this monstrous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen Grimm had went from a thing to a narwhale. He was in charge of guarding Namor's castle and he was quite good at the task. Though inwardly he wanted nothing more than to ram Namor through with his horn, he was powerless to do so as the Atlantean mutant had placed collars around the necks of the transformed humans. Each would shut down the nerves of their wearers if they even attempted to strike Namor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was responsible for the aesthetics of Namor's palace, his reef body serving well as an ornament for Atlantis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the castle proper Namor had the women of the Fantastic Four easily cowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the case of Crystal this was literally true as she had become a sea-cow or manatee. She was the pet of Namor and the Atlantean mutant loved to feed his sea-cow all the scraps from the table, ensuring her a pampered lifestyle and her own bed in the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Alicia, she had become a blue whale, the largest mammal in the world. She was put in charge of managing the stables of whales Namor kept for his personal transportation. Alicia missed Ben and would often visit him, the former Thing quite dominated by the larger blue whale, putting a spin on their original forms where he had towered over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Alicia wasn't the largest of the superheroes. Susan was. She was a walrus but the kind of walrus that could have only existed in the time of the dinosaurs. Her belly was legend and Namor loved nothing more than to rub Susan's furry stomach and cling to it while they slept. Susan's tail fin was often used to sweep the crumbs from her latest meal away, about the only exercise she got now. Finally there were Susan's eyes, holding that trapped humanity within as she stuffed her colossal mouth again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was creature ruled by her stomach, now and forevermore and the jewel of Namor's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue he had not won Susan in her normal form but as a monster he had proven the only one able to satisfy her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor Von Doom spied all of this from his castle in Latveria and placed one of his mighty palms to his armored face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to retire. Perhaps he could take up gardening now that his rival was nothing more than a trapped eel.</span></div></div>",

She was just hungrier than normal today and that could happen sometimes. It happened to her before and it will happen to her again. It happens to everyone, superpowers or not. Seeing that her shirt had rolled up to reveal her belly, she gently pushed it down before walking around to give him a soft kiss on the lips before sauntering out of the bedroom and downstairs to the kitchen. She smiled to herself as she felt Reed's eyes on her perfect round butt. She knew that Reed love her butt and she was proud of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed had not been able to take his eyes off his wife when he saw her stomach bloated. While he loved Sue and thought that she was beautiful no matter what, he also thought that she was a little thin and could use some extra weight on her. He never thought that she would allow herself to put on some weight but after what he just saw, maybe she would. He could only hope and maybe encourage this appetite she had devolped. He had heard of her big lunch from Crystal and could smell the former presence of pizza in the kitchen. He knew it had to have been Sue who ate it, because he knew he didn't and after asking Crystal and Johnny about it, they said they didn't have pizza. He knew it wasn't Ben since he was out so that left Crystal. He had been a little worried that she would catch him starting at her belly, get upset, and vow to go on a diet. For a second, he thought that she was going to call him out on it but to his relief she didn't. When he followed her towards the kitchen, he was pleasantly surprised to see that her perfect round butt seemed bigger as well. He had always wanted to see her get a bigger butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sue arrived in the kitchen followed by Reed, she was greeted warmly by the rest of her family. Alicia, Ben, Crystal, and Johnny. It was Ben's turn to get the food and he had gotten everyone McDonalds. Ben had already served Alicia, Crystal, Johnny, and himself. \"Don'tcha you worry love-birds, I got yuh food right here\" Ben said as he handed over their bags of food after they (Sue and Reed) had taken thier seats. \"Thank you Ben\" Sue said with a smile. \"Yuh welcome\" Ben replied as Reed started on his food. Sue pulled her food out of her bag. She had a double bacon cheeseburger with meidum fries and soda along with a chocolate chip cookie. Ben sure knows my favorites she thought to herself. She was very tempted by the greasy food but she wasn't sure that she should allow herself to eat it after all the food she had eaten earlier, particuarly all the fatty foods she had eaten earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that Reed was so involved with his work that he wouldn't walk in on her and finding her eating more. She still had no idea why she was so hungry this much. Still though, she wasn't really concerned about it. It probably just was hormones related to her period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had already changed into her pajamas which was actually a silky black nightgown. It didn't escape her notice how it clung to figure more, especially around her bloated belly which was pushing out noticeably on it. She wasn't too stressed by this as she knew it was all due to her being bloated. She padded into the kitchen and walked over to the fridge. She opened it, and saw a pint of cookie dough ice cream. Cookie dough ice cream was her favorite so she pulled it out, grabbed a spoon, and sat down at the kitchen table. She opened the pint, and surprisly eagerly dug in. Mm, so good and sweet she thought to herself as she began to eat bite after bite of the delicious ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue tried not to eat too fast but it was so good that she couldn't help herself. Before long, she got a brain freeze and had to take a moment or so to shake it off. Despite her superpowers, human afflictions still affected her which helped to keep her humble. She then resumed eating the ice cream and before long finished half the pint. She then set the pint of ice cream down on the table, laid back in her seat, and began to gently rub her futher bloated belly.

She slid underneath the covers and fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after Sue had fallen asleep, Crystal woke up starving. She had no idea why, but ever since she had eaten at the Superheroes' Repast, she had felt unusually hungry. Only an hour after her return, she had eaten 2 whole bags of chips while watching Johnny play his video game, then taken a brief nap and then ate her whole meal plus most of Johnny's at dinner. \"Ugh,\" she thought to herself. \"I'm such a cow.\" She walked into one of the many kitchens throughout the building and sat down in a chair. She used her wind powers to open the 2nd from the bottom drawer, 4th from the left. This was her stash drawer: Inside lay all of her favorite snacks and treats. The wind brought her a cheesecake as well as a package of Oreos. She closed the drawer and opened a cabinet and the fridge, and brought herself a gallon of milk and a glass. She had managed to do all of this without a sound and without moving. Crystal poured herself a glass of milk (her first real exertion since walking in to the room) and cracked open the package of cookies. Expecting to only want 2 or 3, she started using the air to start dipping the Oreos and placing them in her mouth, before chewing and swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, Crystal had finished the entire 36 pack of Oreos and had drank 3 glasses of milk. Pouring herself another glass, she cut herself a small piece of cheesecake. \"Why am I so hungry?\" she asked herself. \"I guess I'm just a growing girl.\" she said, and giggled. After finishing her first slice, she had a second slightly larger slice, then another and another, so on and so forth, until she had finished the entire thing. Groaning, she used her powers to dispose of the trash and put her glass in the dishwasher, then cradled her bloated belly back to her bedroom and falling asleep instantly.</span></div></div>",

And it had visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were not customers looking for a chance to dine. They were not even of this world. They were the Illuminati, and they sought to save all of existence from an event known as an incursion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt, King of the Inhumans; Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme; Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic; Hank Pym, the Ant-Man; T'Challa, the Black Panther; Hank McCoy, the Beast; Anthony Stark, Iron Man; Namor, King of Atlantis; and Susan Storm-Richards, the Invisible Woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Susan was plumper than the one sleeping peacefully on the other side of the city.

She had known Susan Storm/Richards for quite a while, having joined the Fantastic Four back when she\u2019d still been the Invisible Girl, and had remained fairly close friends with the blond even after she\u2019d left the FF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that she was probably the most powerful memeber of the team (something Jen had become painfully aware of when Susan had easily defeated Jen as Malice) the Invisible Woman was every bit as much of a wallflower as her chosen superheroine name would suggest, especially compared to the boisterous, muscular nearly seven foot tall gamma radiation powered amazon that was She Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always incredibly cute to listen to pauses like the current one that filled the line since they were signs of the fact that Susan wasn\u2019t quite as self confident as someone with her abilities probably should have been.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there have been some big events here in the Baxter Building since we parted ways yesterday, and honestly I think it\u2019d be easier for me to show them to you than to just tell you about them...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer nodded slowly, being a superheroine often did mean having to deal with some pretty important and classified stuff, even if you were one without a secret identity like Susan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right then where should we meet up?  I just got in from running a few miles so I\u2019m a little bushed, but I could probably jog on over to the Baxter Building in about half an hour without much in the way of difficulty...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another ten second or so pause as clearly Susan was busy thinking over what she had just been told and trying to figure out what the best course of action was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I think that maybe we should meet some place other than the Baxter Building.  Yes, it\u2019d probably be best if we met at the Superheroines Repast actually, say around noon?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen looked over a clock on the wall, it was only 10 even after all the exercise she\u2019d already done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoon sounds fine Sue, see you then.\u201d  She hung up the phone only for her stomach to let loose with another gurgle as if wondering why it would have to wait two full hours to sample some of that wonderful restaurants food again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible, what am I going to do with you?\u201d  She asked while slapping her belly playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** What does Sue have to show Jen when she arrives?***</span></div></div>",

Getting zapped by that ray is going to have a big impact on our superheroine careers, no pun intended....  You see Jenny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n** (In regards on the option of being \u201csupercharged\u201d I imagine maybe Susan now has all the powers of the FF and Crystal can manipulate the very building blocks of creation like the Molecule Man instead of just the four elements but if you want to take it a different way by my guest) ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll see what it's like being a big woman for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan shook her head in dismay, wondering how anyone could want to try being fat, and checked the settings of the ray. Her husband was apparently in a joking mood judging by the labels. There was the Sumo setting, giving one the build of a sumo but with some slight muscle underneath. There was the Slobby setting, making one eat, burp, sweat, and scratch wherever. There was the Fat setting, which added two hundred or so pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally picking one, Susan fired, the yellow beam striking She-Hulk squarely in her stomach.</span></div></div>",

The answer seemed likely to be \u201cnothing\u201d but that couldn\u2019t be right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you girls want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked around and for a brief moment there was a flash of recognition. \u201cWell we are in a restaurant, no reason not to order some more food, right?\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Susan the starts using her power to break her fall, she hits the ground with great force qnd lands on a regular grassy plain. Um I could really use some light right now says the beautiful blonde and ( as if she controled the world around her ) the sun shined over the horizen. As this beautiful moment is happening, the light revelles a land like no other, Susan rubs her eyes and looks to see that she fell into a sweet treat sanctuary, gumdrop rain, sugery glazed grass, lollipop trees with caramel covered apples, and a extra thick double chochotate waterfall/river. Wow\" was all the boudatious blonde could say, do you like it says a mesterious voice says, Susan turns around and notices it was just Mr. Fantastic, hello sweetie i see you have fallen into the sweet treat sanctuary says the fantastic man. O sorry Reid Susan says but I just goin, shhh Reid cuts her off dont speak sweet heart, let your taste buds speak for you, just then Mr. Fantastic streches his hand, forms it into a tube, &amp; sticks it into the invisable womans mouth. Umm Reid what are you doing she asks, he responds with \" you will see my big 2 be\" wait what! Before she could react Reid forms his other gad ibto a tube and sticks it into the thick chochotaty waterfall, the chocholaty goodness travels throught his arms and into Susans mouth, muff..muff!! Was all she could say. Suddenly Susaj feels something strange in her body, as if she was expanding in size, her ass and belly were growing the biggest but her boobs were not behind, she watched in horror as her belly inflated at an alarrming rate, growing to the size of a basketball, beach ball, exersize ball, but could not see anymore because her boobs blocked the way( which were now the size of over inflated beach balls, her ass was huge to,thighs wide as tree trunks and an ass 3 times as big as kim kardashians, she has chubby checks but no double chin, Susan was a massive 425 pounds and it didnt look like reid was going to stop anytime soon,but just when she thought it was the end she is.</span></div></div>",

Its pink contrasts with the pink of her tongue, and she holds it there, savoring it.  One of the few pleasures left me, she thinks, and swallows.  The yogurt passes down her throat, becoming tasteless as it was before.  It was only for that moment, when it lingered in her mouth, that it was, in a sense, real.  She swallows another bite.  She has grown tired of feeling real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pleasures--if longer-lasting--were more transitory than this, for they came to an end, and she can still always eat.  They could pluck out her eyes, stop her ears, do everything but kill her, and she would be able to gorge herself still on yogurt or ice cream or chips or whatever.  The pleasure of sex was gone--her young, lithe body naked against Reed's, his advances timid, at first, but soon warming up as they found a rhythm that was completely their own.  This was cut short, of course.  The pleasure of friendship, also, was gone--the  late nights laughing and joking with her brother and Ben, who loved her--who possibly even still would have loved her this way.  No way to tell, though.  Fighting alongside all three of them, for good or the universe or America, or whatever they thought they held dear, when what they all really held dear was the bond--that fantastic bond--by which they all shaped one another.  And slowly, as the other three disappeared into public and private memory, she had also lost her looks.  It seemed at first poor compensation, this over-eating, for the world of pleasure she was grieving.  But it insulated her, it made her feel safe--and paradoxically, in control.  Every day, in the mirror, she watched her body expand to fill the void left by the other three men--brother, friend and lover.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/6222133/2/istockphoto_6222133-beautiful-woman.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbvie...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does not bother much with becoming invisible anymore.  She already is.  No one recognized her now--she's let her hair grow out--and her body grow out--and she never wears blue.  Occasionally, she uses her powers to spy on ex-lovers and old enemies, just to see what they're up to.  She also occasionally strikes up a conversation in a bar with some guy (who would have hounded her when she was thin), watches him become uneasy as he evades her come-ons, and then, quite suddenly, vanishes, leaving him with the realization of WHO it was he had just ignored--Susan Richards, formerly the Invisible Girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/3955001/2/istockphoto_3955001-pretty-eyes.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbvie...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes another slurp of Coke--the cool, sweet bubbles, the caffeine rush--and looks up.  Everyone around her minds their own business.  Except for one pair of eyes, taking in the blonde with the double chin whose body has expanded to fill a once-baggy sweater, who is stuffing food in her face and looking warily around her.  The pair of eyes think of the svelte crimefighter as she once was, comparing her to  the sedentary chunky woman inhaling her food, and they almost give up.  Surely this creature is no longer capable of helping anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, the former Invisible Woman locks eyes with the intruder and her plump fingers release their tight hold on her food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" she whispers, and pushes herself up from the table, to face...</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t want to get to bulky\u201d said a tall muscular blonde man as he flexed in the mirror. This man is Johnny storm better known to the world as the Human Torch. The young cocky hot shot with the power of pyrokinesis. The ability to project fire in a variety of forms. With this power he can transform in a flaming form and fly in the sky and be immunity to heat and fire. Johnny just finished exercising in the Baxter building\u2019 gym. The gym was design to fit the needs of the Fantastic four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look so hot. All the ladies are crying their hearts out knowing that this hot man is off the market.\u201d said Johnny as he flexed another pose in his workout clothes which was only a pair of shorts and a white tank top. It should off his midsize built body. He quickly got lost in the memoires of his wedding a year ago to his skrull wife Lyja. She looked so beautiful in her white wedding dress. The ceremony was a small private one where all of the fantastic four friends and family where there. Many of the superheroes were their dressed in their finest clothes and with their mask to cover their identity. When Lyja throw the flower bouquet many of the heroines started a small super powered brawl only for Black Widow to get it and handcuff Captain America to her which made him go pale as snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, mistress Susan told me that later tonight you need to babysit her kids as her and master Reed need to investigate this strange signal coming from outer space.\u201d said a robotic voice.

I know.\u201d said Johnny as he posed for the last time and left the gym to go to his room and wash up after his work out.  He walked to the elevator and it opened and he got in and it soon went up and got to his floor. He walked to his bathroom and shut the door. After thirty minutes he exited the bathroom and he got dressed in a pair of blue jeans and white short sleeve shirt. He then went to the elevators and he got in it and it went to the kitchen.  When he got out he noticed there on the counter of kitchen island is a double bacon cheese burger with a large side of fries and onion rings. Next to it was a tall chocolate milkshakes and a note. Johnny read the note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>\u201cJohnny, Reed went to talk to Tony about the unusually space signals. I am going to run some errands hours be back later. The kids are taking a nap. Ben is out of town help Alicia in her sculpting competition and Lyja tagged along with me. Lyja made you your lunch as a treat for you to look after my kids and also turn on the T.V. to <br>\r\nchannel 8 as there is a live screening of the government debate of superhero have government handlers.\"<i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sat down and felt a bit uneasy as he was torn that his lunch would negate his workout, but was very hunger. He bit in the burger and his taste buds exploded and he flung restriction to the wind and starting eat the burger and fries and onion rings and sipping the milkshake. He tuned on the T.V. and change the channel to 8 watch with interest about the debate. After an hour or so he watches the debate while subconsciously eating the entire meal causing his belly to visibly budge out with discomfort from being stuffed to the maxed. He knew that many government official support the hero community and many of them or family member were rescued or protected by the superheroes. While heroes do defeat and help contain the villains they do tend to cause a lot of property damage, but many people are pointing out many things can be replaced or be rebuilt but lives cannot be replaced. He turned off the T.V. and laid down on the couch as he felt tired from working out and sleepy from just eating that big lunch. He slowly closed his eyes and fell asleep emitting a light snore with one of his hands on his bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can we order pizza for dinner? as his blond haired nephew Franklin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny loved his hyperactive nephew and his quiet niece. He was glad that Doctor Doom upheld his part of the bargain. The deal was that the fantastic four and some of magical superheroes would help Doctor Doom free his mom\u2019s soul from a magical prison. The heroes managed to free Doom\u2019s mother. Doom\u2019s mother gave her son a very stern talk about turning evil while she was imprisoned. His side of the deal was that he would stop or decrease evil activity and sometime pass information that he heard off if it involved other criminals. His mother told him to play to role as godfather and be nice to his goddaughter Valerie. Johnny\u2019s niece. From what he heard was that Doom\u2019s mother is play matchmaker for her son and trying to get grandkids.

He went to the elevators and went downstairs to the lobby saw a guy in a pizza delivery uniform. He paid the guy and noticed there was three large deluxe pizzas and when asked about it the pizza guy told him that just last month the Fantastic Four saved the pizza owner from when Diablo attacked the city and tried to gain access to rare chemicals. The Fantastic Four defeated the criminal alchemist and the pizza guy said that anytime the Fantastic Four order pizza from his pizza place location it will be fifty percent off and with triple amount of pizza.  Johnny then left and went to the elevators and went back up to the kitchen level and place the two small pizza for his nephew and niece who were glued watching a cartoon show on another T.V. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sat on the couch and turned on the T.V. and started watching the sport game with the three pizzas on the couch next to him and a couple bottles of soda. As he watched the game he would reach for a piece of pizza and eat. He sat there watching the game as it was so good that the subconsciously open and eat the other two pizzas. After four hours of watching the game as it went over time he reached for a slice of pizza only to feel cardboard. He looked and saw he drank all the soda and ate all three pizzas. His belly looked like it was stuffed to the brim and he knew that tomorrow he would have to do an extra-long hard work out.  He remembered that his wife baked a chocolate cake for him after saving an old lady from being hit by a runaway truck when the old lady tried to cross the street.  He gave in the temptation and cut a big slice of cake and started to polish it off with a glass of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny cleaned the glass and plate used for the cake and went to check on his niece and nephew. He found looking sleepy and he got them rid for bed after giving them a bath. Afterward he found that his sister, wife and bother in law returned.

Not a lot of supervillains activity only Hydro Man tried to take the Mayor hostage, but with the combined might of the Fantastic Four the stopped him by trapping him in Sue\u2019s force field bubble and Reed added a chemical that froze him. From what many reformed villains from the team thunderbolts told the superhero community is that there is a civil war between many of the villains as many villains are trying to fight over for the right to rule the Masters of Evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue and Reed are still trying to figure out the signal from space. Lyja\u2019s contacts told her that there have been some skrull activity near earth, but the signal may come from another alien group, but some of the signal contains a some skrull words. Ben has been helping Alice with her sculpting as has entered another contest. Lyja has been taking classes at a college near the Baxter Building on earth culture. She has been taking classes for a few years to try understand humans. She feels a bit uncomfortable as her race tried to impersonate heroes and caused the \u201cSecret Invasion\u201d.  Johnny tied to help and told her that many heroes don\u2019t blamer or hold any resentment to her as the invasion was made by the queen and not by her. Lyja still tried to avoid most hero contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyja has also been cooking and baking a lot as she is currently taking a lot of culinary courses at her college.  For Reed and sue Lyja has been making a lot of light healthy meals and for Valerie and Franklin she made a lot of health tasty meals as both kids don\u2019t like eating their vegetables.  For Johnny and Ben heavier meals like burgers, pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, ribs and more. She also made various cookies, pies, cakes, other baked goods. The rest of the team give her the role as the chef of the team. Lyja knew what each team member liked to eat. For Reed and Sue salad or soup with sandwich on the side. For the kids steamed veggies and pasta or pizza. For the boys the like to eat anything that Lyja wipes up from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBurrrrrrp.\u201d came from the mouth from Johnny as he finished his lunch which consisted of barbeque ribs and potato salads and a huge bowl of potato chips.

Johnny a little warning.\u201d said Ben as he glared at his friend as he just finished eating his third hot dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny laughed as Ben got up from the table and put his dishes in the dishwasher and went to the gym to help clean when Ben destroyed the gym. A few days ago when <br>\r\nBen was working out he got really angry on how a few mission ago Mole Man flicked him away like a ragdoll. Ben went into a frenzy and wrecked the gym. Reed said it would could a long time to get everything back in order as he wanted to make everything more durable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBen just relax. Johnny can be a bit of a jokester, besides I heard that Reed wanted you to do some heavy lifting in the fixing of the gym.\u201d said Lyja she cleared the table from plates and put them in the dish washer. Ben rolled his eyes at Johnny\u2019s behavior and waved to Lyja before heading off to the gym to help in the repairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Johnny don\u2019t always act like a slob. \u201csaid Lyja as she next to Johnny in a chair next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Honey, it was just a joke, besides Ben is not going to hold it against me.\u201d said Johnny as he rubbed his bloated belly filled from his large and heavy lunch. He enjoyed his wife\u2019s cooking and told her many times she is a goddess in the kitchen. A small voice in his head tells him to cut down on the fattening food, but another louder voice tells him to relax and pig out on his tasty wife\u2019s cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Johnny there is a nice long romantic comedy movie marathon coming up on T.V. Care to join me.?\u201d asked Lyja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny sat in thought as he was not a fan of romantic comedies, but he did not want to anger his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you join me for the marathon I will heat up left over apple pie and a tub of ice cream. \u201csaid Lyja in a suggestive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny grinned and walked out with Lyja in hand to the living room and sat down on the couch and turn on the T.V. and change the channel to the movie marathon.  Lyja excused her and went back in to the kitchen and soon returned with a tub of ice cream and two thirds of an apple pie. She sat down on the couch and give the food to Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the couple watched the movies. Lyja watched with great intent and Johnny sat there absently mindedly ate the pie and the ice cream. Near the end of the movie marathon Lyja enjoyed the movie marathon.  While Johnny fell asleep after eating the food as his belly was stuffed past to the brim. If somebody say him they would think he swallowed a bowling ball. He fell the sweet embrace of sleep as he laid his head back on the couch while his wife watched the movie marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week as pasted by and the only criminal activity so far were bank robbers several car hijackings. The police have increased their training and has been able to handle these normal small timed crimes without the need of heroes. The police have a deal where if a criminal is a supervillain then they call the Fantastic Four to deal the super powered villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny has still pigged out on his wife heavily cooking while his sister and Reed find the out the alien signal and Reed also is helping to make sure the gym is \u201cBen proof\u201d.  His wife received word from her contacts that the Skrull words are from a rouge fraction of Skrulls that were exiled from Skrull empire when they tried to get rid of the five nobles house who govern the Skrull Empire. Her contact told her that the Skrull empire sent a team to near Earth to arrest the rouge Skrulls and bring them back for execution. Lyja told both Reed and Sue of what she learned, but did warn them that the signal was not fully decoded and they only translate a small part.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the week of bingeing on his wife heavenly cooking and skipping his daily workouts has caused Johnny to lost some muscle definition. While to the normal eye Johnny is still in great shape, but his wife\u2019s fattening and large portion cooking has caused Johnny to develop some fat which has started to cover his perfect abs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny decided that he wanted to train with his fire powers. He went into the gym designed for the Fantastic Four to train their powers. He started with flying then throwing fireballs and blasts of fire and ending with a controlled fire blast as an ending. He had H.E.R.B.I.E. time him as Johnny wanted to try to best his old time a month ago, Johnny felt the he could beat his time old time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s my time H.E.R.B.I.E. ?\u201d asked Johnny as he exited his \u201cflame on \u201cmode. He watch the room being spray with super cooling mist to get rid of the heat that Johnny generates when trains his powers in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile sir, you are slower than your last time and I have noticed that your reaction time is slower and that you seemed to have spent more energy than your last time\u201d. replied the artificial intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat that\u2019s not right! You must be mistaken. \u201csaid Johnny shocked with disbelief. He did not believe that he was slower than normal.  Johnny thought that maybe Reed\u2019s creation had some bugs in his programming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe sir, that you had not spent time in this gym training your powers and that when engaged in criminal activity, you don\u2019t focus on your powers due to the lack of supervillain criminal movement lately. Another factor to consider is that you focus on physical fitness and you have been consuming a larger amount of food recently made by your wife. \u201csaid the A.I. as he based his opinion of his observation of Johnny\u2019s routine within the past couple of weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lack of usage of powers maybe a factor, but my reaction time and speed should be the same as last time. It isn\u2019t like I have gained any weight. Maybe I need to talk to Reed about your faulty programming. \u201csaid Johnny getting annoyed at the A.I. While he understood logic and reasoning, he still felt a blow to his pride from the building\u2019s brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well sir. I will run a diagnostic and check my calculations again, but I will tell that it will take a few months to a couple months to check my entire programming. I am also helping Reed in trying to decode the alien signal and I will inform him of my unexpected reboot and scan. \u201csaid H.E.R.B.I.E.  as started to shut down his primary program and then did a diagnostic scan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire building\u2019s lights flashed off for a few seconds and then came back on. Luckily for Johnny, Ben was away with Alice and Sue and Reed were at a meeting with the avengers to talk to other scientists like Bruce Banner and Hank Pym about the alien signal. His wife went out for a short errand and his niece and nephew were taking a nap. Nobody was home when the reset happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, your wife requests that you test her freshly baked cinnamon buns. \u201csaid H.E.R.B.I.E in a slower voice.  Johnny smirked as he remembered Reed telling everybody that H.E.R.B.I.E has several backup programming and that each one is slower and the main programming. In case he is hacked or shutdown H.E.R.B.I.E. will start his backup programs and that these programs have limited capacities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny left the gym and went to the elevator and pushed the kitchen button. When he got off the elevator he was hit with a wall of freshly baked goods. He entered the kitchen and saw a dozen or so cinnamon bun on cooling racks.  He thanked his luck as he remembered that his sister and Reed didn\u2019t have a big sweet tooth.  He heard a ding and saw it was his wife who had some groceries in her hands. He went over and help her carry it and then put them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the help sweetie. I just wanted get some last-minute ingredients to make the icing for the cinnamon buns. Go relax and I will call you when the icing is done. \u201csaid Lyja as she got ready to make the icing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny nodded and headed to relax on the couch and watch T.V.  As he watched T.V. he heard his name being called. Johnny turned around and saw it was\u2026. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She motioned him to dig in and he grabbed a large cinnamon bun with a lot of frosting and started to eat it.  Lyja started to wash the dirty dishes used in the baking and half an hour later after she finished putting away all the dried dishes she heard a small burp. Lyja altered turned around and saw Johnny with an empty plate full of cinnamon bun crumbs. She looked up and saw some icing on her husband lips and his belly bloated from the consumed cinnamon buns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny blushed and looked away know his wife saw him after a moment of gluttony. He felt peck on his lips and saw his wife giving him a kiss. He kissed back and Lyja told to go relax in the living room while she will clean up the empty plate. Johnny left and went to relax in the living room. He turned on the T.V. and started to channel surf. He heard the phone ring and answered it. It was Sue calling John tell him that Sue and Reed would be back a couple weeks later as Reed and Tony got side tracked and are in an invention war. Both men wanted to find out who is the better inventor. Both men responded to an attack on the Avenger\u2019s mansion and together wanted to find who attacked them. Sue and the other Avengers know how both me can get carried away with a competition.  Sue hung up after hearing a loud explosion in the background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny went back to channel surfing and soon saw his wife come over and sit down next to him. Johnny told Lyja about Sue and Reed\u2019s extended out of town stay. Lyja nodded and got to go run an errand she forgot when she was out. Johnny quickly fell asleep from getting bored trying to find a good thing to watch on T.V.  Johnny later woke up from the feeling of poking. He opened his eyes and saw it was his nephew stand there with a look of hungry on his face. He got off the couch and stretched to shake off his sleepiness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle Johnny can we have dinner? \u201casked Franklin who looked hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, let\u2019s get tacos. \u201csaid Johnny as he had order H.E.R.B.I.E.  several tacos for his nephew, niece and himself. He looked around to find his wife only to find a note say she is at one of her night classes and she would be home much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered the door bell thirty minutes later and payed the delivery guy only to find out that guy game him extra tacos because there was a mix up on the order and they doubled the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny called over his nephew and niece to get their meal. He turned on the kitchen T.V.  and change the channel to a cartoon show for the two kids. Johnny knew his niece would start packing her luggage to spend next week with Victor and his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny left the kitchen with his food and sat down on the couch in the living room. He turned on the T.V.  and start to chow down his tacos absent mindly as he focused on trying find something good to watch.  He soon finished his sixth tacos and start on the dessert of churros. After stuffing fours churros into his mouth, he found no more food around him. He let out a small burped and his belly started to gurgle of being stuffed to the limit. He grew alarmed that he did not practice self-control on his consumption of food. He heard his name being called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny left the living room and follow his name calling and saw that his niece was wanted help with packing her bags. He calmed down his niece and worked with her on packing her bags. He later helped her get ready for bed and tucker her in. He also tucked in his nephew who fell asleep after eating his dinner. He knew that Victoria would leave the next day to go to Doom and his mother to spend a week with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny clean up the trash from dinner and showered. He later got ready for bed and as he got dressing his pajama pants. He noticed how round his belly gotten after binge eating over the last couple weeks and knew he would have to start a diet and work more to regain his chiseled body back. He heard a snot and saw his wife there looking at him observing his belly. His blushed turned red with embarrassment of his wife seeing him in an embarrassing situation.  He got into bed and his wife wearing an appealing lingerie. She kissed him and quickly went to sleep. He put his thoughts of weight out of his mind and fell asleep spooning his wife.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thanks to about a dozen of the Wizard\u2019s antigravity disks pulling him in different directions at several times the normal force of gravity his elastic body was left unable to stretch at its owners command as it was too busy being pulled in too many different directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Richards AKA The Invisible Woman was currently hovering in midair nearby her husband.  An antigravity disc had been strapped to her chest, one that had been specially designed so that whenever the person it was attached to took noticeably deep breaths it would begin to spin them around fast enough to expose their body to 8Gs or higher.  Such spinning force was guaranteed to render Susan unconscious every time she tired to concentrate and use her powers leaving her equally helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan Storm AKA The Human Torch was at the moment encased in some specially designed paste that the Trapster had cooked up which hardened rather then melted when exposed to extremely high temperatures and so the impetuous youth had ended up creating his own prison as he had attempted to free himself from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin Grimm AKA The Thing was mired down in countless globs of the Trapster\u2019s paste, looking as if his rocky body had been swallowed by some kind of orange blob that left him utterly unable to move.

You recall my compatriots and I injecting you with a compound, correct? That compound has now permanently altered the four of you. From now on each of you will feel hungry and need to eat almost the entire day. Naturally your bodies will quickly digest the food you intake into fat. And Dr. Richards, don't try to look up a cure for this. I've tested every possible one with a Cosmic Cube and still nothing. You'll all still be able to move, I think, but not very well.

Her face was covered in fat as she opened her mouth and poured a large cup brimming with M&amp;M's down, barely pausing to chew, the chemical in her body swiftly transforming the calories into fat. Her belly ripped through her shirt, her butt doing the same to her pants, and still she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed, Ben, and Johnny were of similar body shape as Susan.

She still called herself the Invisible Woman, though Sue wasn\u2019t sure how apt the name was since even with her ability to turn invisible the sounds that she made whenever she moved her four hundred pound body tended to alert anyone nearby to her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless of course she was taking the time an effort to create an invisible platform beneath her feet the way she currently was.  It was a lot less strenuous for Susan than walking, though she was also painfully aware of the fact that she didn\u2019t exactly get any physical exercise doing it either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon the less as she patrolled the city Susan was shocked when from her position soaring over head she caught sight of what looked like an escaped animal from a zoo.  At the moment the huge feline was padding its way up a unoccupied street and yet to Susan\u2019s surprise she didn\u2019t hear any alarms or see any signs of panic regarding the huge creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to take a closer look Susan began to lower herself down toward the ground.  As she did so the Invisible Woman discovered that what she was looking at was no animal, it was still indisputably large however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreer Grant, a former police officer now known as the superheroine Tigra was lumbering along on all fours.  \u201cLumbering\u201d was certainly the word for it to.  Tigra\u2019s black bikini bottoms with small teeth like markings in it was stretched to the breaking point across a backside far bigger than Susan had ever imagined the lithe catgirl might posses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise her black bra was just barely managing to cover up  her bountiful bosom, and her unrestrained belly seemed to be threatening to slap itself against the ground with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan allowed the forcefield to vanish and dropped to the ground beside Tigra, fearing she had a long conversation headed her way, and not wanting to have to deal with the mental strain of keeping focused throughout all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreer what happened to you?\u201d  Tigra lazily twisted her head around to look at Susan and offered her a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Sue, you\u2019re looking nice and round...\u201d  As she spoke the tiger woman slowly rose to her feet proving that she was still capable of walking upright.  She seemed to be a fair bit fatter than Susan probably close to 450 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow I look doesn\u2019t answer the question, the fact remains that you\u2019re way fatter than the last time I saw you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Tigra seemed nonplussed.  \u201cI could say the same thing about you Susy.  Well not really I saw how you Reed and the others were fighting crime while being fat and I thought... you know that looked to be just right for me.  Not only do I get to stop bad guys but I also get to pound down whatever snacks I want...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips in a long and deliberate motion before rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was aghast at her fellow superheroine\u2019s actions.  The Flabtastic Four had gotten fat because of a supervililan\u2019s plot that had nearly left them nothing more than helpless blobs of blubber, and Tigra was going to just eat and eat to her hearts content growing fat because she felt like it?  It seemed completely and utterly unfair, especially given how unworried Tigra was about her weight!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hunger pangs were still as insistent as ever. But, joining them...was a feeling of mild euphoria as she chewed and swallowed the delicious food. It was all soooo good! And the act of eating...of consumption...had never been so satisfying! Valeria giggled and Franklin gaped as she ate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not important. Not at all important. What was important was eating. That her watched her eat, no GORGE herself was cute...but not a problem. Franklin asked if she was okay about the time she finished her seventh helping...and the pangs were lessening. Not vanishing, but diminishing. Fading gradually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Franklin.

She...she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back to the bed with a plate of cookies, a bag of chips, and a 2ltr bottle of Coke. She drank and ate, the sweets making her hornier than ever. Where was her husband? Didn't he want her? Maybe she should be more exciting in bed...more creative. Than he'd spend more time at home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed entered the bedroom and stared at his wife, his face a mix of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...was fat. No, not fat...but fatter. The slight start of a double chin, the softly rounded thighs and arms, the start of a belly pooch, the heavier breasts...she looked fatter while she ate, and she stuffed her last cookie into her mouth quickly, washed it down with soda, and said \"Oh, I NEED you, Reed! I feel so...empty without you, darling. Please...fill me up with your love! Fill me front and back, darling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over and stuck her buttocks in his direction.

True her gaze could not turn people to stone (though her costume did include a black mask which covered much of her face) and while her hair was not composed of snakes, there was something undeniably serpentine about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bright red and long, very long, so long in fact that it fell down to her feet.  Any normal woman who allowed her hair to grow to such lengths would have been horribly encumbered by it, needing to fear that they might trip or trod upon it with every step they took.  Medusa however could  control her hair (even making it grow longer) should the need arise) as easily as most people could move their fingers.  Not only that but possessed strength far beyond the arms of most human body builders and remarkably deftness as well.  There was no task that her hands could preform which her hair could not do as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment the Inhuman Queen\u2019s hair was mostly still though here and there a few tendrils of it floated up and down, up and down in an almost rhythmic pattern.  She\u2019d was serving as a member of the Fantastic Four because for the moment Susan Richards the Invisible Girl had departed from the team over differences with her husband and so they needed a forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan despite being occasionally overlooked by her male companions was quite a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, as Medusa knew since she and Susan had been foes once.  Now however she only sought to be a worthy member of the Fantastic Four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the team was Medusa expected fast asleep, she went exploring the Baxter Building which would be her new home while she served on the team, and promptly discovered one of its kitchens.  Slipping a single hair around the kitchen\u2019s refrigerator door she pulled it open and marvelled at what lay inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fantastic Four kept their larders well stocked and looking at the bounty of food inside Medusa was painfully reminded of those horrible days she\u2019d spent after waking up with no idea who she was, and how frequently she had gone hungry except for what she had been able to steal.  Clearly she\u2019d never have to worry about missing a meal as a member of one of New York\u2019s most prominent superhero teams!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Inhuman Queen licked her lips and nodded to herself, in fact she was rather certain that she could go with a snack right now, so why not help herself?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Medusa opened the box and was instantly hit with a heavenly aroma of baked delight. Her stomach rumbled once again, and Medusa put a hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I suppose a snack is in order...</i> she thought, licking her lips. At once, tendrils of her hair followed her command, grabbing a plate and a spoon off of a nearby countertop. Picking up the knife on the platter holding the cake, Medusa cut herself a very generous slice onto her plate and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate delicately at first, gently spooning small nibbles into her mouth. The first nibble, however, proved to be spectacular, and the second was only better. Medusa's pace increased, and five minutes later, she was left with an empty plate and an unsatisfied appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well... One more slice couldn't hurt...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne slice became two. Two slices became four. Four slices became eight. Each slice only seemed to make Medusa all the hungrier for the next, and she was not to be denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was around her fifth slice that the Inhuman Queen started to feel full. By her seventh slice, Medusa was quite stuffed. And yet, there was an urge in her mind that pushed her to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa had just finished her twelfth slice of cake when she realized that she had eaten the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh...\" she moaned, laying back on the ground beneath the fridge, stuffed to the brim. Her belly bulged forth from her abdomen, round and taut with the result of her feast. Medusa rubbed the food-stuffed orb soothingly, her hair lying limp around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> That was... unusual of me,</i> Medusa mused to herself. <i>Normally, I have more restraint than that.</i> Standing up shakily, Medusa took the empty box out of the fridge and threw it away, taking the platter to the sink and washing it off. She took a moment, stood in silence, and cradled her food baby, caressing it gingerly. <i>And yet... I cannot say I regret it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling softly to herself, Medusa walked gingerly back to her room, collapsing onto her bed and falling deeply into sleep.</span></div></div>",

The memory of the cake was still fresh in her mind as if she had only just eaten it.

She simply had to experience for herself some of the other food this mysterious restaurant offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go right now, if you like.

Both were in Fantastic Four uniforms (although the other woman wore an original design that was black-and-white, while Susan wore the current navy-and-white uniform), and both were obviously the Invisible Woman, given the blonde hair and blue eyes. However, if not for a difference in body type, Medusa could have sworn that the two women looked exactly alike. They had the same facial features (though Susan's were a tad bit plumper), the same height, and the same general build. The woman in white, however, was a bit larger than Susan, with most of her weight having given her an ample potbelly. Susan was just a bit softer all around in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa wasn't the only one to notice the similarities, it seemed. Susan and the woman in white stared at one another for a bit, sizing each other up. Eventually, the woman in white broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both have wonderful costumes,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa raised her hand and was about to tell her that they were not wearing costumes when Susan cut her off, shaking her head at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. So do you. I love the design,\" Susan replied to her doppelg\u00e4nger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in white smiled and nodded. \"Excuse me,\" she said. Susan and Medusa stepped out of her way and watched her leave the restaurant. There was a brief shimmer, almost as if reality had briefly shifted, and the woman was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That was... Strange,\" Medusa mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen stranger. You get used to it after a while.\" Susan made her way to the counter, where a waiter dressed as Spider-Man awaited them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, again!\" the waiter greeted Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Table for two?\" Susan requested politely, gesturing to Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way,\" the Spider-Man waiter said before walking off to a table. Susan and Medusa followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spider-Man waiter pulled up two seats for the two superheroines, in which Susan and Medusa sat down in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, may I take your order?\"</span></div></div>",

Quite literally in this case, she could still feel herself holding it, but no longer see it in the slightest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she could see was Susan waving one of her slightly larger fingers in Medusa's face tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty, naughty, naughty Medusa, if you wanted me to bring you here, then you really should trust my judgement when it comes to what to order...\"  Susan suggested a touch smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa thought about it for a moment and then with a shrug set down her invisible menu which Susan was nice enough to lift her powers from and simply sat back in her chair letting the Invisible Woman take care of ordering for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she did end up ordering to Medusa's mind seemed to be the equivalent of one of everything on the menu (maybe even two of everything) and when it was delivered to their table it looked like a grand feast the kind she'd be used to seeing spread out before her when she was back home in Attilan, except that instead of having her entire family there to eat it was just her and Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't possibly handle all of this...\"  The red headed Inhuman protested as she took in the sight of so much food, though she could feel her lips starting to moisten even as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we don't manage to eat all of it then we'll bring what's left of it back home to the Baxter Building and have more of this place's wonderful food to eat later.  Either way though, why don't we worry about such problems a little further down the road, right now I'm going to focus on chowing down.\"  Susan explained and did exactly that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa was still a little put off by exactly how much food had been ordered for the pair but didn't voice any further protest. Instead she focused on trying to figure out what she should eat first, everything looked so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen however she noticed that one of her hairs was slowly lifting up a large plate before her, and atop it rested a cake, just like the one she had eaten during her midnight \"snack\" back in the Baxter Building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as good a place as any to start...</span></div></div>",

She was a queen, after all, and wife to Black Bolt. Self-control was a trait she possessed boundless quantities of. And she did maintain an element of control throughout her lunch in terms of how she ate. Where she faltered was in just how much she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slices from the cake only got larger and larger. Soon enough, the cake was gone, resting quite comfortably in Medusa's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, however, Medusa found her hair reaching over for another plate of food. The cake should have left her stuffed, and, physically, she was quite full; but there was something that compelled her to eat more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate was loaded with a burger and fries. Seeing as this was lunch, Medusa reasoned that this was the next logical choice of delicacy to proceed with. Medusa grabbed the burger and took a bite, and was immediately smitten with its tantalizing taste. She ate it slowly, savoring every last bite. Once in a while, her hair would grab some fries for Medusa, and they only served to augment her enjoyment of the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that plate was empty, Medusa somehow found it within herself to take another plate of food. This time, it was a bowl of chocolate pudding. Since her arrival in New York, Medusa had found that she had a particular fondness for chocolate, and anything chocolate-flavored was a welcome addition to any meal. Grabbing a spoon, Medusa dug in, her elegant pace increasing ever so slightly after the first spoonful. It was as if she rediscovered why she loved chocolate with each morsel of the pudding. Needless to say, Medusa licked the platter clean. The Inhuman Queen pushed herself back in her seat, at this point quite stuffed and very bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, for her part, continued eating, stuffing numerous different foods into her mouth and down into her ever-growing gullet. What Medusa left on the table, Susan consumed with relish. Soon enough, no food remained on the table, and Susan and Medusa sat at the table, massaging their swollen stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great food, am I right?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have dined in many halls, but never have I ever been so... Enchanted with the culinary skills required to make such a feast,\" Medusa answered glowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Susan giggled.</span></div></div>",

Since both of them were actual superheroines there was no need for them to worry about paying for their meal and instead they could just walk (well waddle) right on out the door as soon as they had finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back to the Baxter Building both Susan and Medusa used their hands to rub their bellies and help sooth their swollen stomachs doing what they could to aid in the digestion of their massive meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who was that other 'you' we bumped into when we first came in?\"  Medusa could help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea, probably just some other big fan of the place who likes to eat there and get a big discount for dressing up as a superherione.  The fact that I don't wear a mask just makes it easier to notice that she looks a little like me.\"  The Invisible Woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa would have pressed the matter further since the other \"Sue\" had been almost a dead ringer for the woman who was currently keeping her company, but decided to let the  matter drop.  She had bigger things on her mind... like what her figure might end up looking like once she finally managed to digest all of the food she'd just eaten....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: Because the idea for choice two is a little weird/complicated I'm going to write it out in full here...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: As more \"Susans\" start to get fat even those versions of her which have never visited the Superheroine's Repast begin to grow larger and heavier.

Waving goodbye, Reed, Johnny, and Ben rocketed off into the New York skyline. The cineplex was having a <i>Star Trek</i> marathon, and the boys decided to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan turned around to face Medusa, who was standing quietly behind her. The two were dressed in casual outfits\u2014Susan in sweatpants and a T-shirt, and Medusa in jeans and a tank top. \"Well,\" Susan began, patting her belly, \"I don't know about you, but I am FAMISHED.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's stomach growled loudly. \"It seems as though you are not the only one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan giggled. \"C'mon. Let's go get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Susan and Medusa were lounging in the dining room of the Baxter Building. Each of them had an Extra-Large cheese pizza ordered from a nearby pizzeria and each of them was halfway done with theirs. Medusa had no idea why, but she had been unable to control her appetite all day. She just had to eat, and it just wasn't satisfying unless she was stuffed to the brim. Even after her unbelievably large lunch at the Superheroine's Repast earlier that day, Medusa still felt like she could eat a whole pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was exactly what she was doing. Eating without cutlery was a strange experience for her, but she found that pizza was, in fact, a very delectable meal, especially hot. It filled her throat and stomach with warmth satisfyingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa and Susan kicked back in their chairs simultaneously, having managed to finish up at the same time. After a few minutes, Susan smiled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for dessert?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other day, Medusa would have called Susan crazy. Today, however, Medusa merely used her to open up the freezer and pull out two quarts of ice cream. \"Shall we?\" she asked, giving one of the containers to Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two of them began stuffing themselves with ice cream. Medusa's stomach cried out to stop, having reached its full capacity three slices ago. Her appetite, however, commanded her to eat, and eat she did, spoonful after spoonful of ice cream delicately entering her mouth and down into her gullet. Halfway through the carton, the button of her jeans burst off with an audible pop, clattering onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, see, this is why I wore sweats,\" Susan said, stretching the waistband of her sweatpants out in front of her. \"More room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa blushed. \"I shall keep that in mind,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled sweetly, and then proceeded with stuffing herself silly with ice cream. Medusa joined in. Occasionally, however, her eyes darted to her own growing belly. <i>How much larger am I going to get?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's inspections did not escape Susan's notice. \"Fighting in the battle of the bulge, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa looked up at Susan. \"I'm afraid that I am unfamiliar with that colloquialism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"Look\u2014you're a superhero. You'll work it off quickly enough. And if you don't, well, then, you make it work. It's not all bad having a little extra pudge,\" Susan said, grabbing some of her newfound belly fat and shaking it. \"It's kinda fun, actually. And I don't feel so guilty anymore about eating the last slice of pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa nodded. \"I am still not sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if it doesn't make you happy, you can change it. But, honestly, I know I put on a few, and I feel better than I have in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa mused silently to herself. Then, she picked up her spoon and continued eating. \"I suppose a little indulgence won't be too terrible,\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan grinned. \"You said it, sister.\"</span></div></div>",

Despite their indulgences over the past week, Medusa and Susan were quite ready and able to deal with whatever threat the alarm was signaling. Rounding a corner, Medusa and Susan readied themselves for battle. The sight that awaited them, however, was a bit unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the hallway was Wanda Maximoff, better known as the Scarlet Witch. Only this Wanda Maximoff was different. It was only recently that the Scarlet Witch had suffered a breakdown and became a pawn of Immortus,* but this Wanda seemed very different. A few years older, with hair longer than it was when that incident had occurred; sporting a new costume, being more akin to a long coat then... Well, whatever she was wearing at the time. The biggest difference, though, was in her figure. While once svelte and sleek, Wanda seemed a mighty bit pudgier than usual, her costume straining against newfound love handles and a bulging potbelly. This Wanda Maximoff wasn't looking for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan? Medusa?\" Wanda asked, confused by the hostility displayed towards her. \"What are you two doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan braced herself for a fight, but Medusa stopped her. \"This Scarlet Witch isn't the one we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa wasn't sure how, but somehow she was able to sense that this Wanda wasn't from this universe. She had received a similar feeling from the white-clad Susan at the Superheroine's Repast, but it was much clearer with Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not the Susan and Medusa that I know,\" Wanda replied. \"They haven't worn those costumes in years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's eyes widened. \"Oh, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa turned towards her. \"Susan...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked up. \"Alternate universe shenanigans. Always confusing,\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sensed that Susan was hiding something, but before she could question her, Wanda's stomach grumbled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" she groaned hungrily. \"I don't know how things work over here, but I've been coming to the Baxter Building for lunch with Susan for a few days, now. Ever since I met her at this one restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Superheroine's Repast?\" Susan said. Almost instantly, all three of the women's stomachs grumbled hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda nodded. \"That's the one.

Would you like some fries?\" Susan deflected, offering her whiteclad doppelg\u00e4nger a box of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the food, the plump Susan's eyes lit up. \"I would love to,\" she said, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. She passed the fries over to her whiteclad doppelg\u00e4nger, who gladly took them and immediately started nibbling on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know,\" the plump Susan began, \"we might have to order more food. This might not be enough for all of us.\" She patted her belly for emphasis. \"It takes a lot for me to be satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry,\" said Wanda, \"you can share with me. I probably won't eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" the plump Susan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Medusa could get a chance to ask the thinner (but still pudgy) Susan any questions, everyone dug in. The plump Susan made her way through a plate full of hamburgers, devouring the meaty sandwiches with zest. The pudgy Susan, for her part, inhaled an order of fried chicken, practically shoveling the food into her mouth. Wanda managed to procure for herself a bowl of noodles with steamed vegetables and was graciously licking the platter clean before moving on to the next bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the aroma of the food in front of her made Medusa's stomach grumble in hunger. Sighing, Medusa grabbed another plate of burgers and began to feast.</span></div></div>",

She wore a navy nightgown, having changed out of her costume before going to bed. Unstable molecules had many uses, but Medusa felt uncomfortable sleeping in a skintight outfit. Medusa got out of bed, working the kinks out of her neck. She drifted slowly to the bathroom where she splashed the sleep out of her eyes. Using her prehensile hair to help out, Medusa changed into her costume as she brushed her teeth. Upon finishing freshening up, Medusa examined herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she'd had time to digest everything she had consumed yesterday and had been without food for a few hours, Medusa was able to guess that she'd gained about 15 pounds. It had distributed evenly on her 5'11\" frame, giving her a generally plusher look. Her hips were wider, her legs were thicker, her arms were softer, and her belly was bigger. Medusa squished some of her belly fat in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa found Susan upstairs stuffing herself silly with a large breakfast. Susan looked up at Medusa and smiled. \"Good morning, Medusa! Want some waffles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's stomach growled quietly in hunger. The Inhuman Queen, however, ignored it. \"No,\" she denied firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's smile faltered. \"Are you sure? They're <i>really</i> good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa remained adamant. \"No,\" she restated, her hair pushing Susan's breakfast off to the side. \"No more distractions. No more misdirections. No more avoiding the questions. It's time for answers. What is going on, Susan? What do you know about the doppelg\u00e4ngers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's smile slowly faded away. She hung her head in defeat and sighed. She was silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything dies,\" Susan began quietly. \"You, me, everyone on this planet. Our sun, our galaxy, and, eventually, our universe. It's inevitable.\" Susan looked up at Medusa. Her eyes were sad. \"That's what my husband told me right before he explained that the multiverse was collapsing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's stomach dropped. \"... The multiverse... Is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded. \"It started a while ago. Two Earths from parallel realities collided together in an event known as an incursion. The universes of both Earths were destroyed. Since then, numerous incursions have taken place. Sometimes, only one of the realities is destroyed, the other one being spared. But most times, it's complete destruction of both universes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But... How does Reed Richards know this? How do you know it?\" Medusa asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed. \"After the Kree-Skrull War, Tony Stark thought it would be a good idea to bring together a group of superheroes to share information about events like these. Reed and I were among the chosen. Black Bolt was, too.\" Medusa's eyes widened at the sound of her husband's name. Susan straightened up in her seat. \"Namor summoned us together after he saw an incursion be prevented by a being known as a Black Swan. She destroyed another Earth that was about to impact our own. She escaped before Namor could grab her, but not before he was able to gather enough information to figure out what was going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa staggered back. Susan used a force-field to pull up a chair for the Inhuman Queen to fall into. \"Is there any way to stop these incursions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's face became grim. \"None that are acceptable. Yet. That's why I left. I went to find a way to stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan pinched the bridge of her nose, resting her elbow on the table. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So... These doppelg\u00e4ngers--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are showing up because the fabric of space and time are weakening in our universe and another universe. Or at least, that's what I think is happening.\" Susan lifted her head up. \"Does that answer your question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa thought for a minute. \"There's one thing I don't understand.\" Susan tilted her head in curiosity. \"How does the Superheroine's Repast fit into all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"I think they're our only hope of a better solution.\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed like the entire world, make that the entire reality since if what Sue had said was true then the destruction wouldn't even be close to limited to Earth alone was going to be coming to an end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but even some of the most brilliant minds in the world were unable to think of a way to deal with the problem, and supposedly one strange restaurant known for serving incredibly good (if incredibly fattening also) food was involved as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan hadn't been able to explain to her how the Superherione's Repast was so important, but all the same the Invisible Woman was quite certain that it was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa just wasn't sure what to make of what she'd been told, compared to the collapse of reality that might be arriving any day now (Sue said it wouldn't be anything close to that soon but how could she be sure) made Medusa's own worries about her slowly growing waistline seem like small potatoes indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone the less she couldn't keep her face from flushing in embarrassment when she realized that her \"random\" walk around New York city had lead to her walking right past the Superheroine's Repast.

Now,\" Medusa began, \"I have a question for you.\" The other Medusa furrowed her brow, a movement obscured by her mask. \"Are you aware of Black Bolt's secret activities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Medusa stiffened. \"...

And though it would not do much to the Beyonders, it would be a final act of resistance before the end. An end worthy of a king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Black Bolt spoke not.

Needless to say, it piqued Medusa's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat next to his wife, his chair appropriated towards her, hands clasped in his lap, and a faint grin on his normally stoic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What amuses you so, husband?\" Medusa asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt merely smiled.  <i>I never took you to be such a gastronome,</i> he said telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa blushed, a lock of her hair flitting an imaginary nuisance away. \"Oh, stop,\" she said with fake annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt merely shrugged, his smile widening ever so subtly.<i> It suits you well,</i> he replied, placing a comforting hand on Medusa's bloated belly. The silent king stroked it gently, his soft touch calming Medusa. While the rest of the Fantastic Four made small talk amongst themselves at the table, Medusa and Black Bolt enjoyed each other's company solitarily. Given their separate responsibilities, quiet moments such as these were gems to them\u2014uncommon, but always appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Medusa awkwardly rose from her seat, taking care to be discreet. Black Bolt stood beside her, knowing full well what his wife intended to do. Leaving the rest of their group behind, Black Bolt and Medusa left the Superheroine's Repast, going for a walk through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet outside of the entrance, Medusa noticed another figure heading in the opposite direction as herself and her husband. She turned her head to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Scarlet Witch from a few days ago, looking just the slightest bit plumper than when Medusa last saw her. In her hand was a bag, and in the bag were donuts that Wanda was busy snacking on. The Scarlet Witch noticed Medusa and waved a greeting, before sitting down on a bench and continuing her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled, then returned her attention to Black Bolt and the road ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took a short stop at the Baxter Building, changing into clothes that wouldn't be quite so flamboyant. Medusa wore a purple turtleneck with a stylish vest and some jeans, and Black Bolt wore a black leather jacket and dark corduroys. The two walked through New York City, blending in with the crowd to the best of their ability. Coming to a stop at Central Park, Black Bolt and Medusa beside one another on a grassy hilltop under a tree. Nearby, a young family played a game of Frisbee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt nuzzled Medusa's shoulder, and Medusa caressed Black Bolt's hair. \"You're quite affectionate today,\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt smiled. <i>I spend so much time worrying about the fate of the world, I often forget that you're my world. And we almost lost both, recently.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...\" Medusa sighed. \"If there's one thing I've learned from my time with the Fantastic Four, it's the wonders we always fight to preserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt nodded. <i>I'd like to stay here forever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled sadly. \"We both know we can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>True. But we have time until then, do we not?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yes. We always do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt wrapped his arm around his wife's shoulder, squeezing her to his side. Medusa wrapped her hair around his, bringing him closer to her. The two sat together on the hilltop, watching the sun set over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, Medusa's stomach grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Bolt smiled. He stood up, and offered a hand to Medusa. <i>Dinner, my love?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa took Black Bolt's hand and rose up gingerly. \"Only if you treat me well. I'm quite ravenous as it were.\"</span></div></div>",

You work with the Wizard. He's not exactly the best with fulfilling his teammates needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Medusa stopped cold. \"... How did you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, Medusalith Amequelin,\" Medusa began, using her full name and leaning in, \"I am you. I know everything there is to know about you. Your future... And your past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Medusa stared. Suddenly, her hair thrashed about angrily. \"NO\u2014IT'S A TRICK! YOU'RE TRYING TO TRICK ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name,\" Medusa spoke calmly, \"is Medusalith Amequelin. Sister to Crystalia Amequelin and lover of Blackagar Boltagon. You are an Inhuman, and your home is Attilan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Medusa fell to the floor, clutching her head and shrieking. \"What did you do to me!?\" she hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you about yourself, Medusa. I helped you break free from that madman's control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Medusa shook her head, still clutched between her hands. Standing up shakily, the other Medusa ran out of the restaurant, leaving her cake unfinished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm sure she'll be fine.</i> Medusa reasoned. <i>It would be a shame for this cake to go to waste, though...</i></span></div></div>",

In retrospect what did the other her have to gain by lying to her?  Granted she evidently was a superheroine but so she was on the \"other side\" but they were supposed to be trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, why was she working for the Wizard in the grand scheme of things?  Because she had no idea who she was, no idea where she came from, and due to the way her constantly shifting hair tended to disturb ordinary people no way to survive in the world other than stealing.  That had eventually drawn the attention of more police than evens he could manage and the Wizard had saved her from being captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, after that one particular incident he'd done precious little to reinforce her loyalty to him, preferring instead to harp over how he'd kept her from suffering jail or even worse whenever she'd made a move that he didn't approve of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf what the other Medusa had told her was true, that she had a real proper last name, that she had a family, that she was a queen, well certainly that would be a step up in the world over being some generic supervillianess, after all how could a thief possibly hope to be richer than a queen, if it was true than she might have some great store of wealth just waiting for her to reclaim it at the same time she got back her memories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn which case then being a supervillianess was a foolish waste of her time and the sooner she got it over with and regained her memories, the better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Medusa was pondering doing the right thing for wrong reasons for the hidden position she'd taken for herself atop a building, hidden from sight by a curve in its roof, she noticed a familiar figure walking by.  She was a mousey little thing with her blond hair and her light blue uniform with darker blue gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had seemed appropriate that Wizard had chosen Medusa to be her adversary as Medusa had read enough to know that supposedly the ancient monster who she shared a name with had been defeated by someone with the power of invisibility.  This hero would need to train harder though as Medusa had come out ahead of her every time they met, or at the very least forced a draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was going to give up being a supervillianess, probably best to start with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sense of pride in her powers refused to allow Medusa to simply walk up to her though, instead she gracefully and silently slid down the side of the building using her hair to help hold her steady before a strand of it shot out and wrapped around the other woman's waist and spun her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a squeak of surprise and started to fade from view, not that it did her much good given that Medusa already had a firm grip on her after all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for that... I want... I want to be friends... if possible....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a surprised gasp and Susan Storm the Invisible Girl slowly faded back into view.... </span></div></div>",

Do something. An activity. Between friends. Something that we can do together. As friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa remained unresponsive. It was a rather ridiculous scene, really. Two women, one superhuman, one Inhuman, standing in the middle of a street, trying to be friends, with one having tightly bound the other in her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed. \"Well, at the very least, could you put me down? I won't be going anywhere, and thus is honestly getting awkward, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? ... Oh, right. Yes, of course.\" Medusa freed Susan from the trappings of her hair. \"Do y Do... Have any suggestions for what we can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Susan really wanted to do was run back to the Baxter Building and get the rest of the Fantastic Four to figure out Medusa's true goals. However, something about the redheaded Inhuman made Susan believe that she was actually sincere about being friends. Not the kind of convincing sincerity that supervillains often used to trick superheroes into a trap (although that was still a possibility), but a genuine sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Medusa and Susan's stomachs both rumbled hungrily and loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Susan began, blushing slightly, \"I suppose we could go get lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's eyes brightened. \"Of course!

After a bit of searching, Medusa found a window large enough to accommodate her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been three days since she had started eating at the Superheroine's Repast, but the results were already starting to show on Medusa. Lean, powerful muscle had slowly begun to give way to think, soft chub. Her biceps were flabbier, her thighs were thicker, and her belly was softer. In total, Medusa had put on about 10 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed as though that number was only going to increase, as Medusa began to make her way to the Superheroine's Repast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa was about to tuck in to a very large breakfast when a flash of fuchsia caught her eye. Looking up, her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" she exclaimed in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Medusa turned around to face her doppelg\u00e4nger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" she replied, equally incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two of them could make a move towards the other, the door to the Superheroine's Repast opened. Both Medusa's turned around and found a sight they did not expect.</span></div></div>",

Standing nearby was the Trapster, who held a camera with a blinking recording light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want this time, Wizard?\" Susan asked, more annoyed than anything. Capturing her had stopped being terrifying after the fifth time, and now it was more of a nuisance than an actual threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the usual\u2014money, power, recognition, et cetera,\" the Wizard answered smugly. \"We've also noticed that you've been getting rather friendly with dear Madam Medusa, and we simply can't lose her to your side. Which is why...\" the Wizard turned to face the camera, \"I'm broadcasting this message to our redheaded friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa leaned back in her chair, sufficiently stuffed to the brim. While she had eaten less than her plumper cohorts, she still had consumed quite a bit of food\u2014enough to serve as three meals for a day, let alone one breakfast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer peaceful engorgement was interrupted, however, by her belt buckle, which had started vibrating. Curious, Medusa unlatched it from her belt and opened it up, revealing a video-communicator. On the screen was the Wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Madam Medusa,\" he greeted, grinning. \"I trust you've been well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Bentley?\" Medusa asked curtly. She did not want to deal with that pompous oafs whining, especially so early in the morning and after such a large breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wizard pouted mockingly. \"Why, Medusa, I am HURT. Is that anyway to talk to a friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were never my friend. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not much. I just wanted to let you know that we miss you here in the Frightful Four and do very much want you to join us for our next caper.\" The Wizard bowed out, and the camera panned to the trapped Invisible Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE RANSOMING OF THE INVISIBLE GIRL!\" the Wizard cried out in villainous delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's jaw dropped, mostly because of the sight of her friend captured by the likes of the Wizard but also in part because the Wizard was trying the same hare-brained scheme again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I suppose what they say about insanity is true...</i> Medusa joked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you want to make sure that your new friend is safe, you'll know where to find us. Ta-ta for now!\" The screen blinked, and the transmission was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sat in her seat, unsure of what to do. After a moment, the other Medusas noticed something was amiss with their hooded companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" the navy-clad Medusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa sighed. \"It's the Wizard. He's kidnapped the Invisible Girl. He says that if I want to make sure she's safe, I have to rejoin them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe navy-clad Medusa stiffened. She had an encounter with the Wizard not too long ago. It was not a happy memory for her in the slightest, and she still held a bit of a grudge against the old villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we must rescue her!\" the violet-clad Medusa declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded Medusa shook her head. \"I'll go rejoin them. At the very least, I can make sure the Invisible Girl is comfortable. Until then, I don't want to risk it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from her seat unsteadily, the hooded Medusa left her doppelg\u00e4ngers and headed to the secret hideout of the Frightful Four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining two Medusas looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we both know what we have to do, yes?\" the navy-clad Medusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violet-clad Medusa nodded. \"We have to save the Invisible Girl.\"</span></div></div>",

She strode in confidently, and behind her followed two others: the violet-clad Medusa and a plump Scarlet Witch. Dragging behind the violet-clad Medusa was the Trapster, bound and gagged in her hair.

Their mission? To investigate the nature of the new world that many denizens of other universes had now found themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed Richards, Tony Stark, Namor, T'Challa T'Chaka, Hank Pym, Hank McCoy, Stephen Strange, Blackagar Boltagon, and Susan Storm-Richards were all gathered together in Reed's lab in the Baxter Building. Reed Richards stood at the front, a blackboard behind him and chalk in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he said, carefully  drawing on the blackboard, \"is what we know was supposed to happen during a normal incursion.\" Reed stepped back, showing an elaborate diagram of an incursion on the blackboard. \"Two alternate Earths phasing into one universe and colliding at an incursion point, resulting in the death of either one or both of the universes from which the Earths hail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed drew another diagram on the board. \"And this,\" he said, stepping aside, \"is what happened with our final incursion: multiple parallel Earths joining together into one massive super-world because of the intervention of what seem to be Beyonders, similar to the individual Beyonder that some of us encountered during an event since given the nomenclature of 'the Secret Wars.'\" Reed flipped the blackboard to its other side. \"And this,\" he said, writing something on the blackboard, \"is what appears to be the focal point of this new Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree words were written in block letters on the blackboard: \"THE SUPERHEROINE'S REPAST.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, if you will,\" Reed said, gesturing Susan to come up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan made her way to the blackboard. \"Here's what we know: the current focal point of our new universe was once a restaurant that existed at certain weakpoints in the fabric of the spacetime continuum. There was only ever one restaurant, which allowed it to serve as a nexus point for the various universes that are now part of this super-world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, the restaurant also had an intriguing effect on the populace of each world.\" Susan smiled. \"You may have noticed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other men of the Illuminati looked at each other sheepishly, mumbling incoherently and awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, still amused, pinched some belly fat and gave it a jiggle. \"Superheroines started gaining weight and getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Illuminati all shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Susan couldn't help but chuckle to herself. Here was a group who had faced down the likes of Galactus, and what made them flinch was talking about her weight. Thoroughly entertained, Susan continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the formation of the super-world, this trend has continued. Every day, more and more superheroines are going to the restaurant, and they all leave stuffed to the brim after every trip. From our own universe, such patrons have included myself, Alicia Masters, Medusa, and Crystal. Since we learned of the incursions, I have also encountered alternate versions of myself, Medusa, Wanda Maximoff, Carol Danvers, Jennifer Walters, and Jessica Drew. Since I first encountered them, each has gained a significant amount of weight and gone back to the restaurant multiple times, where they display a previously unprecedented gluttony for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,  there is one exception to this rule,\" Susan said. Grabbing a remote from a table near the blackboard, Susan activated a digital display, which projected a photograph. \"Alicia Masters. Since Alicia has gone to the same restaurant, she has not experienced any significant fluctuations in her weight. We don't know why that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've since linked the existence of this restaurant to the Beyonders. Radiation readings from the day of the incursion reveals a trail of signatures matching the radiation of the Beyonders coming from the restaurant. Based off of this, we can conclude that the Superheroine's Repast is a crucial element to the Beyonders agenda. We don't know why they chose to save our worlds, and that is an ambiguity we need to have an explanation for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen Strange and Hank McCoy both rose from their seats and made their way down to the blackboard. Susan stepped back, giving Doctor Strange the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began. \"There are two plans of action that the Richardses, Dr. McCoy, and I have discussed. The first is to summon the Beyonders directly and ask them ourselves. I have volunteered my talents for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second is a bit more experimental,\" Hank McCoy, AKA Beast, said, stepping forward. \"Using a headband I designed to monitor brain activity, we send an agent to the Superheroine's Repast and monitor any potential mental effects that the restaurant has on its patrons. This will be conducted in three phases, which I will let Dr. Storm-Richards explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast gestured to Susan, who in turn used the remote to change the digital display. Now, instead of Alicia Masters, there were three versions of Susan\u2014the navy-uniformed one standing before the Illuminati, a slimmer Susan wearing a red Fantastic Four uniform, and a Susan in jeans and an oversized sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the formation of the super-world, I have come into contact with these alternate versions of myself. We're all roughly the same age. However, this Susan,\" she elaborated, pointing at her slimmer counterpart in a costume, \"has never been to the Superheroine's Repast. This version,\" she said, referring to her slimmer counterpart in civilian clothes, \"is a regular human being who never became the Invisible Woman. They have both agreed to help us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As part of the first phase, I'll go to the restaurant wearing the headband, which will record my brain activity throughout the trip. Accompanying me will be the other Susans, who will also be wearing headbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the second phase, we'll observe each of us over the next week, keeping track of the frequency of our visits to the restaurant, any fluctuations in our weights, and any potential changes in brain activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the third phase, we'll analyze the data we have collected after a week and see what results can be yielded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast stepped forward. \"In the meantime, Dr. Pym has agreed to shrink down to the subatomic level and observe the new universe and see if he can find a way to potentially reverse the process of our multiverse becoming a super-world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each plan has its own strengths and weaknesses. We all know that. With that said, we have decided to hold a vote to determine which plan we shall implement,\" Doctor Strange explained. The epidermal displays in all of the members of the Illuminati lit up, showing two checkboxes. \"If you would be so kind as to cast your vote...\"</span></div></div>",

Going in,\" Susan said. She was standing across the street from the entrance to the Superheroine's Repast. The navy-clad Invisible Woman of the Illuminati, was across town at one of the many Baxter Buildings in this new world. The rest of the Illuminati were there with her. Each of the three Susan's had taken on codenames to help distinguish themselves from one another in conversation. Red Alert was the codename that the red-clad Susan had chosen for herself, although most of the others referred to her simply as Susan-Red. The navy-clad Susan had chosen Susan Illuminatus, (\"Illuminatus\" for short,) and the non-powered Susan had chosen Susie Q.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan levitated herself on an invisible force-field and floated across the street, taking care to hover just above the oncoming traffic. As she made her way to the restaurant, she saw two pudgy women in costume stumble their way out of the Repast with extremely food-stuffed bellies. The first had shoulder-length blonde hair and wore a red-and-blue suit with golden highlights and buttons, a star on her chest, and a sash wrapped around her waist. The second had a head of very fluffy jet-black hair. She wore an unzipped red biker jacket with a yellow design resembling a spider emblazoned on the front, a white T-shirt that could not quite cover her swollen gut, and yellow-tinted sunglasses with red rims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy, Jess,\" the blonde-haired woman moaned to her companion. \"We really overdid it this time.\" She put a hand to her mouth and belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, Carol,\" Jess said, \"is the understatement of the year. And one that's becoming alarmingly frequent...\" Jess pinched some fat around her waist for emphasis, giving it a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it,\" Carol replied. \"One month of eating like this and I've already gone up a dress size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Marvel and Spider-Woman had passed well out of earshot by the time Susan touched down on the other side of the street. Their exchange had left Susan with a bit of trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eating here can't be</i> that <i> fattening... can it?</i> she thought to herself. She imagined herself as heavy as Susan-Illuminatus. Was that really what it was going to be like for her after this experiment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well... it wouldn't be too terrible,</i> Susan reasoned. <i>She seems perfectly happy with herself.</i> Shaking her head, Susan made her way to the entrance of the restaurant and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" greeted a waiter dressed as Spider-Man. \"If you'll follow me,\" he said, directing Susan to a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spider-Man waiter pulled out a chair for Susan, in which she sat down graciously, and brought a notepad out from a pocket in his apron. \"And what can we get for you today?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

That is true, I suppose,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa Purple nodded her head. Then, suddenly, something caught her eye. It was something that should have been obvious, and was very obvious. But it was so excessively obvious that it had become normal. Just a detail noted unconsciously at the back of her mind. But now that she was on this current train of thought, that little background detail came into focus in Medusa Purple's mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery superheroine in the Superheroine's Repast was stuffing herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few civilians dressed up as superheroines who were also eating, and a few of them were looking a bit full. But the actual superheroines who fought crime and saved the world on a regular basis were all gorging their bellies taut with food. There was a Captain Marvel having a contest of sorts with a Spider-Woman; a Scarlet Witch scarfing down on donuts galore; even an Invisible Woman\u2014a new one, slimmer and trimmer than the others that Medusa Purple had encountered\u2014was quickly making stacks of pancakes vanish into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a Rogue making her way through a large helping of grits; a Jean Grey demolishing an entire apple pie; a woman that Medusa didn't know in a gray-and-black costume with a red webbing pattern nursing a food baby\u2014they we all stuffed or getting stuffed. And Medusa could guarantee that those stuffings were going to leave a lot of extra weight on their waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it... Medusa wasn't the only one who had put on weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Um,\" Medusa Frightful said, trying to draw her doppelg\u00e4nger's attention. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa Purple was silent, then nodded. \"I'm fine.

Now, the stuffing contest at the Baxter Building only had two participants: Medusa Navy and Susan Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit surprising, really. Of the four of them, Susan was the smallest, both in stature and in weight. And yet, here she was, neck-and-neck with Medusa Navy\u2014the largest of the four\u2014in the final leg of the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an audible pop, and Susan looked down to see that the button on her fat pants had finally snapped under the pressure, her bloated belly having undone the zipper as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting full?\" Medusa Navy said before she stuffed another slice of cake into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making room,\" Susan answered with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes of eating, Medusa Navy collapsed back into the ground, her tenth cake half-finished. Susan had already polished off her eleventh, and reached over to finish Medusa's final cake. By that point, she was incredibly stuffed and felt ready to blow, but she really did enjoy the look on the Medusas' faces when she ate Medusa Navy's final cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victory!\" Susan shouted triumphantly before letting out a massive belch. The other Medusas giggled, and Susan started giggling with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, my friend,\" Medusa Navy said. \"You've out-eaten me. Keep this up and you'll outgrow me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan beamed. \"Can't wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa Purple, upon hearing those words, remembered the sight she saw at the Superheroine's Repast earlier that day, with every superheroine stuffing themselves silly and looking noticeably pudgier. She was about to start questioning it again, but a question from Medusa Frightful interrupted her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do next?\" she asked.</span></div></div>",

What I do know is that there were a series of multiversal collisions known as incursions taking place that were destroying alternate Earths, but ours and a few other Earths were saved by two beings known as Beyonders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute\u2014are you saying there are living Beyonders on this world?\" Reed asked, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I'm aware, yes,\" Medusa Purple answered. \"Why are you so surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I thought that the Victor Von Doom of my world killed them all.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Susan looked at her reflection in the full-size bedroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier that day, she had found herself in this exact position, self-evaluating after an incredibly hectic week. While she knew that many would have disagreed with her (some more respectfully than others), when she looked in the mirror, the image that stared back was one that Susan found mediocre. A trivial concern, to be sure, but a less-exhausting change of pace for the haggard heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, whatever gripes she had with herself had all but disappeared. Stranger still, Susan's change in attitude could be traced back to one minor, temporary alteration in her physique:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time between her first inspection and this current examination, Susan and the rest of the Fantastic Four had shared their first meal with Ben Grimm's girlfriend Blair. Ben Grimm was a man known for many things, but his culinary prowess was more muddled in infamy than esteemed in fame. And yet, the ever-lovin', blue-eyed Thing had surprised Susan by preparing an absolutely delectable spread--a decent portion of which had found itself crammed into Susan's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought her to her current ponderings. While many people wished that their midriffs would shrink back and flatten out, Susan was... intrigued by its roundness and heft. For whatever reason, the more Susan examined her bloated self, the more attractive she felt. And the fonder she grew of her bulging belly... the more she wondered what she'd look like if the rest of her was just as big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't... could I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rumble from her belly drew her attention back to the present moment. Amazingly, Susan was hungry. And there was only one thing she craved to satisfy that hunger--ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't,\" Susan said to herself, rubbing her belly. But the image of her with a jelly-belly just wouldn't leave her mind... and only got more appealing by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well, I can always lose the weight if I don't like it.\" And thus, it was decided--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Storm was going to get fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't long after that when I went to the Superheroine's Repast for the first time,\" Illuminatus--the white-clad Susan--continued. \"I'd gained a decent amount of weight by then, but my progress only accelerated after I started eating there regularly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that makes sense for you--you were actively trying to get fat,\" the other Susan replied. \"But how does that explain everybody else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll allow me,\" Reed interjected. Illuminatus stepped back to let her husband forward. \"For the past few weeks, our version of the Illuminati had been conducting an experiment to test Susan--sorry, \"Illuminatus\"--'s theory...\" Reed then went on to explain how they gathered the alternate Susans and monitored their brainwave activity and weight fluctuations during regularly scheduled visits to the Superheroine's Repast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we began, only two Susans displayed significant changes--the two who also operated as the Invisible Woman,\" Reed continued, projecting a holographic display of the three Susan's involved in the experiment. Suzy-Q was relatively unchanged from the start of the experiment, but Illuminatus had gained another 15 pounds, and Red Alert was now sporting a soft, cushy potbelly. \"Those two Susans also enjoyed the food more, as we could tell from the readings their pleasure centers gave out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just in my normal life, I've noticed alternate versions of superpowered women I know--myself included--who, if they hadn't gone there already, started getting much rounder in the middle after a trip to the Superheroine's Repast,\" Illuminatus added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bearded Reed scratched his beard. \"So, to summarize--we're currently on a patchwork planet put together by two adolescent Beyonders made out of alternate Earths from our--mostly destroyed--Multiverse, and the reason that these Earths were saved was because they all had costumed superheroines who had the desire--or at least, the potential--to get fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, pretty much,\" Illuminatus said, shrugging. \"Nailed it right on the head.\" Her stomach growled audibly. \"Are you two done with that burger? I'm feeling a little peckish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan handed the burger to her double, who gratefully dug into the meaty meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if the worlds were saved to prevent there destruction with the rest of the Multiverse,\" Reed pondered, \"... then what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" his clean-shaven doppelganger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Multiverse was saved. Susan, the children, and I are rebuilding it.*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we came here,\" Susan added. \"This was the first time we'd seen a world that had survived the incursions, and the second time a patchwork world was created.**\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlluminatus and her husband looked at each other. \"Then... shouldn't the Beyonders' experiment be over by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">\"Not quite yet.\"</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">*See Jonathan Hickman/Esad Ribic's <i>Secret Wars</i> for more, true believers!<br>\r\n**<i>Secret Wars</i> again, and the <i>Secret Wars: Battleworld</i> tie-ins!

Medusa Frightful's sister rubbed her greatly swollen gut to alleviate the intense pressure from all of the food she had just packed into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stack of pancakes later, she was joined by her doppelg\u00e4nger, who simply pushed her plate away with a groan and stretched out in her seat to accommodate her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Amateurs,</i> Medusa Purple joked to herself before cutting herself her fifteenth slice of cake that meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four women had been enjoying quite the veritable feast for breakfast for about half an hour at this point. Both Crystals had each initially ordered a small (if filling) plate of pancakes, but once those were gone, they were quickly followed by seconds. Then thirds. Then fourths, then fifths...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Medusas, for their part, had no illusions about how much they were going to eat. They both ordered two plates of pancakes and three servings of chocolate cake right off the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa Frightful let out a mighty belch. \"Excuse me,\" she said, patting her belly. She reached over for another slice of cake and managed to eat her way halfway through it before she stopped with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done?\" Medusa Purple asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't eat another bite... No matter how much I may want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa Purple nodded sympathetically. Truth be told, she'd been feeling full for a while, now. But the food was just SO GOOD that she just <i>had</i> to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Even still... it'd be a shame for all of this to go to waste.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to two slices of cake that Medusa Purple had ordered for herself, her doppelg\u00e4nger had left behind a plate stacked high with pancakes and a chocolate cake. Medusa brought all of those dishes to her seat and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pancakes were the first to go--thick, buttery, and drenched in syrup. Medusa felt each morsel explode on her tastebuds and stuff itself into her gullet. Despite her fullness, each bite left her eager for the next. She brought her fork down for one more nibble, but found that she had licked the platter clean, somewhat disappointingly. Her mood instantly changed when she made her way to the final course--the cakes. Nine-and-a-half slices of rich, fluffy, baked chocolate perfection just waiting tantalizingly in front of Medusa to be consumed. Medusa licked her lips and dove in with gusto, savoring every molecule that passed her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty groan, Medusa set down her knife and fork, pushed back her chair, and began to massage her engorged tummy with her arms and her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite the display,\" her sister said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever seen anyone eat that much in one sitting,\" said Medusa Frightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could eat like that,\" said the other Crystal. \"Honestly--it's almost a skill with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa merely burped contentedly. \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to need it,\" remarked a voice from behind. Medusa turned around to see the plump, navy-clad figure of the Susan of her world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning, Susan,\" greeted Crystal. \"Would you care to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What do you mean, 'I'm going to need it'? Need what\" Medusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled wryly. \"It's the only way to restore ourselves into the Multiverse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa cocked an eyebrow, confused. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed. \"The Beyonders have no intention of restoring the worlds that make up this patchwork planet. Not unless you go through one last trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't say. But the Beyonders have spoken. In order for our worlds to be returned to the way they were, you have to participate in a contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa mulled this over. It was a heavy piece of information to take in. The fate of the world--no, the fate of many worlds--now depended on her. And all she had to do was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan pinched her nose. \"You're not gonna believe this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Right.\" Susan took a deep breath. \"It's an eating contest. If you can manage to eat the most food, the Beyonders will restore everything back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa's jaw dropped. \"That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah. It's... yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But if it's a contest, who am I competing against?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked up at Medusa. She opened her mouth to answer: </span></div></div>",

On the one hand, the entire thing was utterly ridiculous--these interdimensional \"Beyonders\" possess powers and abilities far beyond those of even immortals, and they go out of their way at every opportunity to get women to eat inordinate amounts of food? They essentially take over the universe, and this is what they do with that power? Really? Save reality from a destructive experiment perpetrated by their elders--and for this? And now the fate of multiple universes is going to be determined by a contest where two women eat enormous amounts of food? Really? THIS is what her world had become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, it beat non-existence by a long-shot, and if all she had to do was eat more food than her friend to restore the Multiverse, it wasn't that bad. Better than a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you had breakfast yet?\" Medusa asked Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's stomach grumbled hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Have some breakfast. Then we'll go to this contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to train first?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa slapped her belly, causing it to jiggle slightly. \"Susan, my dear--I've been training for the past few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Crystal asked her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mid-afternoon at this point. The two stood in the vom of the World Amphitheater. Beyond the shadowy entrance, Medusa could make out the roar of the crowd gathered together by the Beyonders for the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As anyone can ever be,\" Medusa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only three rounds. You can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, sister,\" Medusa said, rubbing her belly, \"I just want to eat. I feel incredibly hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal smiled. \"Same,\" she chuckled, patting her own growing gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fanfare resounded through the Amphitheater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\" Crystal gave her sister a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Medusa walked out into the center of the Amphitheater. Cheers resounded loudly as the crowd saw their champion. From the other side of the field, Medusa could see Susan. The two met in the middle, where the Spider-Man waiter stood with an additional referee uniform over his costume. Eventually, the noise of the crowd died down, and a thunderous voice boomed throughout the Amphitheater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">Citizens of the world! We are from Beyond! From annihilation, we gave you salvation! From salvation, exhibition! And from this exhibition, we shall see if we give you restoration!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long-winded bunch, aren't they?\" Susan whispered. Medusa snickered quietly. Susan pointed. \"Spider-Man's not too happy about the referee's outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa squinted in the direction of Medusa's finger. Sure enough, a red-and-blue figure sat, arms crossed in a huff, the lenses of his mask aimed squarely at Monsieur Spider-Coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them aren't,\" noted Medusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">Today, these two champions shall partake in a triathlon the likes of which has never been seen in this or any universe before--an EATING triathlon!

All Medusa wanted to do was fall back against the table and give her distended gut a massage. Even with her regular binges and superhuman stamina, Medusa was fast approaching the limit of her capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...\" she groaned, stuffing a slice of cake into her mouth. She gave her tight belly a soothing rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Medusa watched as Susan sluggishly made her way through a bowl of pudding. While Medusa had managed to get an early lead, Susan was a foot or two closer than Medusa to the halfway mark. However, even she was slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa quickly assessed her situation. She was bigger than Susan, given her height; but Susan's stomach was more used to large stuffing sessions. The two were evenly matched. Except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa squinted and noticed a glint under Susan's nostril. Thin, red, and trailing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense--Susan had been using her powers continuously for hours--she must be exhausted. Medusa was a different story. Her powers were physically manifested. They were extensions of her body. She could use them without getting tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer determination renewed, Medusa gorged the rest of the cake, every morsel making its way into her gullet.With one hand constantly rubbing her belly, Medusa attacked the rest of the food in front of her, stuffing mouthful after mouthful into her mouth and down into her ever-growing paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the two superheroines were neck-and-neck, the halfway lines just inches away. The fate of a dozen worlds depended on Medusa's ability to eat her way to victory, but even her reinvigorated momentum had slowed down. Just as she was about to lie down, though, Susan collapsed--unable to eat another bite. Medusa pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winner is... MEDUSA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers erupted throughout the auditorium. Medusa beamed with pride, raising a hand to wave to the crowd before bringing it back down to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*<b>BURRRRP!</b>* Ohhhh...\" Medusa moaned, rubbing her round, bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very royal of you,\" a weak voiced chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa turn to see Susan, sitting up awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still Inhuman,\" Medusa replied amusedly. \"You were a worthy opponent, my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"Just be glad I didn't have my husband's powers.

If they had any hope of restoring the world--the multiverse, even--back to some semblance of normalcy, that would be dependent on her ability to lose this contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this determination to be defeated conflicted with two things: the honor of competition, and her craving for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help it. The food from the Superheroine's Repast was truly irresistible, and the food that the Beyonders conjured up for this contest was even better. It practically exploded in her mouth with the most pleasurable of flavors, delighting every taste bud on her tongue with its rich delectablility. Eating it was an experience, one that made her feel so good, so full, and so... big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had to admit: she loved gaining weight and getting fat. She loved feeling her belly soften and grow, swelling with every bite and redistributing every extra calorie across her formerly slim frame. She wanted to swell up like a balloon, and with her husband's powers, that only got easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, this was a contest: it wouldn't be honorable to just throw it. Susan just hoped that Medusa's drive to win would be stronger than her own desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trumpet sounded, indicating that the round had begun. Susan licked her lips, stretching her arms out a particularly scrumptious-looking pile of desserts in front of her. She wrapped her hands around them and brought them to her awaiting maw, closing her eyes in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning... her hands were empty. Susan opened her eyes to find not a collection of pastries and sweets, but crumbs. She looked around... only to see Medusa, her prehensile hair holding the very food Susan herself had intended to eat. With breakneck speed, Medusa inhaled the stolen goods, her already hefty belly bloating out further with each bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled. \"Clever girl...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the contest processed as such: Susan reaching out for large quantities of food, and Medusa snatching it away before Susan could eat it. Sometimes, Susan would prove too fast for Medusa, but that only served to invigorate the Inhuman Queen and her determination to win.</span></div></div>",

The Inhuman Queen wasn't sure if she'd already consumed more than half the food that had been provided for them, but she couldn't risk it, and she couldn't let Susan stuff herself to the point of victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead she stretched out her hair towards her opponent once again as Sue grabbed up a pair of large pizzas, and lashed it forward, Susan Richards didn't pay much attention to the bright red locks, as she was too busy focusing on stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time rather than just trying to pull the food away and slinking off if Sue managed to gobble it down first, Medusa wrapped her hair tightly around Susan's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive Power Susan Richards, but less than nothing compared to Madame Medusa!\"  The red haired woman chided the Invisible Woman calling back to their first encounter.  In this case, Medusa twisted Susan's arms around her back in a knot to limit how much she could use them.  Then Medusa went so far as to grab Susan's legs and wrap them around her arms, before doing the same with her head trying to turn the temporarily elastic Invisible Woman into a gigantic bundle of knots!  She even made sure to do the same with Sue's neck since it would make it harder for her to be able to swallow down food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan tried to fight back, but while she had figured out how to use her rubbery powers to stuff her face she was not skilled enough with them to properly fight back against Medusa who had been controlling her hair her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Susan twisted up into a helpless tangle of flexible flesh that left Medusa free to stuff herself to her hearts content, and unquestionably the winner of this challenge!</span></div></div>",

There was still time left on the clock, and she had a lead to maintain if she wanted to win this contest once and for all. She grabbed a large cake and stuffed it in her mouth, using her free hand to give her swollen belly a soothing rub. She could almost feel the inches and pounds get added to her waist as she ate, making her ever so slightly bigger and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the trumpet sounded, indicating the end of the contest. Medusa collapsed to the ground with a groan, rubbing her overtaxed gut. Her belly stuck up like a large, round, spandex-covered balloon of fat and food from her abdomen, taut with an insane amount of calories yet soft to the touch with adipose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few events were a blur. After untangling Susan and restoring her regular powers, the two were then weighed--really? She's gained THAT much?--and Medusa declared the winner by a 12-pound margin. The two women were reunited with their families and loved ones, and soon, the Beyonders went to work restoring the worlds of their patchwork planet to their original states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process would take the better part of a day, (these Beyonders were young and inexperienced, after all,) so the denizens of this world returned to their dwellings with the promise of awaking in their old homes they next day. Farewells were exchanged between friends from across universes, and when night fell, Medusa wanted nothing more than to lay in bed with her beloved Black Bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved the world, my love,\" he said in the mindspace they shared, wrapping his arms around her prodigiously plump potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloating had gone down from the contest, but it was still quite large and somewhat sore. Black Bolt's hands massaged Medusa's midriff in gentle circles, lightly kneading the soft layer of quivering, jelly-like flab with his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't so hard, husband,\" she replied, moaning a little as he continued pampering her. \"All I had to do was eat. I've had a lot of practice with that... as you can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It suits you, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Black Bolt's hands took on an electric energy as they made their way down Medusa's belly, \"<i>I</i> certainly enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa shivered with pleasure as she felt her husband's advances. \"In that case...\" she said, biting her lip. \"You're going to have to convince me.\" She turned to face Black Bolt and drew him into a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa woke to a new day in a new world, refreshed and reinvigorated. Black Bolt lay silently in bed, clearly exhausted from the night's... activities. The Inhuman Queen yawned deeply, stretching the drowsiness from her body. She scratched her tummy absentmindedly, but something felt... different. Shrugging, Medusa got up and made her way to the bathroom in their room in the Baxter Building. She caught sight of herself in the mirror and almost did a double-take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the multiverse wasn't the only thing the Beyonders restored...</span></div></div>",

Susan had decided to make pancakes for the two of them, a process that grew more and more aromatic as it went on.

Don't tell me you didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa was about to answer her, but then stopped to ponder her question. Aside from minor inconveniences, there hadn't been anything really bad about her heavier days. She'd certainly enjoyed eating good food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I suppose I did not mind it. And the effects were mostly cosmetic, ultimately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides--those dinners sure were fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled. \"I foresee quite a bit more of them to get you where you want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be so much fun to watch myself gain it all back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\"Why wait?\"</b></span> an impish little voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Medusa's bellies both grumbled, but this time with an odd twist--they bloated out in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What strange manner of...? Medusa began, utterly confounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, jeez...\" Susan sighed. \"What do <i>you</i> want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cartoonish pop and a purple cloud, a weird, green, alien-looking jokester with pointed ears and a big grin appeared in front of Susan and Medusa, hovering over the oven. Even with all the things she had encountered across her storied life, Medusa still needed a moment to take in the sight of this strange being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Susan repeated. She seemed more wary than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\"Why should the Beyond-Bores have all the fun?\"</b></span> he said. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\"If superheroines want to stuff themselves silly and get fat and happy, then why not let me help out?

She opened her mouth to ask a question, and the pancakes immediately flew in, cramming themselves into her mouth, down her throat, and into her gullet. Medusa burped, and her body fattened up in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\"Or maybe you wanna slim down, get nice and trim?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, a giant straw appeared above the Inhuman queen, and Medusa suddenly felt herself get slurped up out of the top, hang in the air for a good three seconds, and land with a thud on the floor below when the straw winked out of existence. Dazed, she looked down and found herself back to her original figure and weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\"ANYTHING'S possible with the Impossible Man!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa stood up and dusted herself off, but as she did, her body reinflated to how it was this morning. She looked over at Susan, who appeared to have gone through the same thing, but with a much duller sense of surprise.

It had all started when Susan, her girlfriend and gifted lawyer Jennifer Walters, Susan's sister Jenna Storm, and scientist/pilotRegina Richards had volunteered to test an experimental space shuttle for NASA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat no one counted on was the solar winds carrying high powered cosmic radiation blanketing the shuttle and the entire crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they had successfully landed the shuttle back on Earth, their lives were forever changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was the first to change. The normally mousy lawyer growing taller by several feet, her hair lengthening, her skin turning green along with her hair and eyes. Her body became toned and incredibly muscled, at first, before copious amounts of fat covered these muscles, giving Jennifer an enormous gut, a massive, hugely fat butt, firm but fat breasts, touching thighs, chubby cheeks, and two extra chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt six hundred and seventy pounds with green skin, Jennifer's powers were her incredible super strength and, ironically enough for a now fat woman, super speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first horrified at her appearance, Susan managed to calm Jennifer down, reaffirming her love for her now green skinned girlfriend with a kiss, Susan's own changes becoming apparent shortly after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body felt...rubbery. That was the only way Susan could describe it. Testing something, she stretched out her arm thirty yards ahead of her before retracting it back into her body. Further exploration revealed that she could stretch or mold any part of her now rubbery body, including her butt cheeks and the cuticles of her fingers, much to her amusement. Of course Susan was scared by her changes but managed to quell her fear with the earlier fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's body became wind. Then fire, then water, then rock, until they realized that was her new power, a control of the different elements when she was in these forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina had gained the power to go invisible and to project bubble-like forcefields wherever she wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the four had wanted to go into seclusion, these new powers sure to be met with fear and mistrust by the general populace, but Regina, along with Jenna, eventually came up with a new idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would become superheroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the Fantastic Four were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been two years to the day of that incident and Susan Walters, Jennifer having proposed a year ago, made her way downstairs to the breakfast table. Jennifer and the rest were already there, though none had started eating as they were waiting for Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan greeted her wife with a peck on the lips and soon enough had her own plate, consisting of one pancake and a slice of toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's stomach let out an enormous growl then and they started eating, Jennifer's appetite making quick work of the three stacks of pancakes, pound of bacon, and four breakfast burritos on her first plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she ate, Jennifer looked at Susan's meager meal and inwardly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, despite now being made of rubber, was still very thin. Jennifer hadn't talked to Susan just yet about this, fearing that Susan would be upset, but she decided as some more time passed at the breakfast table that tonight she would ask Susan... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So it should be a simple matter to reverse the changes by wanting the opposite-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" It was Susan who shouted this, turning to look at Jen as best she could. \"Jennifer, I...I love you like this! I wish you were always fat and happy but still able to be embarrassed by your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish the same thing, only I want your butt to always be the largest part of you,\" Jennifer replied with a grin. The cube glowed brightly then and both women expanded just that much more, loud belches erupting from their mouths as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the belching?\" Reena couldn't help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it,\" Susan said, Jennifer agreeing with a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apparently there's no problem here, seeing as how you both really want this and now I suppose there's no way to change you back.\"</span></div></div>",

Not the most catchy name but the villains soon stopped struggling with their expanding bodies and grew to love every new pound. Food became just as important as their own goals and desires on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ruled the prison with a flabby fist, with both their intelligence and their ruthlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour flabby bodies jiggled as they laughed, their plates empty but their hearts filled with anticipation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Storm, The Invisible Woman and wife of Reed Richards, stared at the compound that would be her home for the foreseeable future. Female Authority Terminus was enormous, at times looking like the most high tech prison Susan had ever seen and at other times resembling a Gothic castle, heavily fortified from without and within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Susan were She Hulk, Tigra, and the mutant Shadowcat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll were being sent to prison thanks to Skrull impersonators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that was what the story was in the official record. The truth was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick Fury, head of SHIELD, had given them a mission to investigate this prison. The number of supervillains were on the decline since the prison had opened five years ago and Fury had had enough of not knowing what was going on in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he had sent the heroes in to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mission was to last at least longer than a year, in which time Susan and her friends were to gather enough evidence to show wrongdoing if that was the case, enough to shut the prison down for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach woman wore an orange prison jumper and were led past a relatively normal looking checkpoint station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something was off and as Susan looked at the other inmates she realized just what it was: each inmate was fat, tremendously so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow none of this had gotten out by now, Susan didn't know, but as a woman who minded her own figure with zeal she was going to make sure whoever was responsible for this abnormal weight gain would pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the processing station, Susan and company were led to an elevator, the transport finally stopping at the fiftieth floor...underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle prods to get moving were gone as soon as the elevators opened, replaced by hard shoves and eventually dragging. Susan, She Hulk, Tigra, and Shadowcat struggled but were no match for the Amazon-like guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir superpowers were useless to them, as they had power dampeners inserted into every inch of the building, to say nothing of the collar at their necks that made them human. Jen and Tigra still looked like they normally did but only possessed the same amount of strength and reflexes as a normal woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and the rest continued to be dragged past a narrow doorway one by one until they came to large room. Four gurneys waited for them, all placed next to each other. Behind those was an odd machine and some female scientists or doctors were nearby, disturbing smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was helpless, as were the rest, to resist as they were strapped to the gurneys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its belly bobbed up and down with each step that it took, threatening to bounce off the floor as it made its way over to the pile of raw steaks and began to dig in hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing two of the dozen or so that were provided Raven took a moment to lick her whiskers and turn to her cell mate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you want any or do I have them all to myself?\u201d  The word came from her tiger throat without the slightest difficult, obviously a side effect of her shapeshifting powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreer blushed beneath her fur.  Not at the offer but at the fact that the longer and closer she looked at the fattened feline form that Mystique had adopted, the fewer differences she could pick out between this real life tubby tiger and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay there was the fact that Raven\u2019s paws both front and back were in no way prehensile, and her spine seemed to be shaped a bit differently which would have made it impossible for Mystique to walk on only two legs at the moment, but on the other hand the heftier Greer got the more she wanted to drop onto all fours as well just to more evenly distribute her new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen such rational thoughts were wiped clean out of her mind as the scent of the steaks finally completed its journey to her nose and before she knew it she sprang out of bed, snatched one of the steaks right out from under Mystique\u2019s paws, tore it apart with her bare hands and started to devour it hungrily.  She could feel her black outfit being pushed outwards already as her belly, breasts and ass grew bigger with each bite.

When I'm done with you you'll be putting your blubbery girlfriend She Hulk to shame, that's for sure.\" Tigra could only glare as more and more of the liquid entered her, her round stomach rounding out even more as time passed. \"Mmmmm...this reminds me of when Destiny and I would stuff each other all those years ago...you should be grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk was a bit wary as the cell door was open and ten carts full of greasy cheeseburgers were wheeled in. Titania looked positively radiant as she eyed them, clapping her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so happy?\" She Hulk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad to see all that food, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't want to see another bit of food for as long as I live after my last binge.\" She Hulk's stomach chose that moment to rumble, apparently the gut was up for more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That gut of yours tells me otherwise, She Bulk. How about we have a little wager...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I eat more than you, you have to say that I'm stronger than you are. If you eat more than me then I'll concede that you are truly the strongest woman in the world, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk, to blinded by her hunger and her need to prove herself the best, agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get a burger each and start eating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eat they did, or at least eat Jen did. Titania, while Jen was too engrossed in her food, merely took an empty, crumb-filled plate from where Jen had put it down and showed it to She Hulk as her \"evidence\" that she had eaten a burger. She Hulk, still blind to everything save filling her gut, kept on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, She Hulk finished the last burger, giving a mighty belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I won,\" She Hulk said, but soon enough ten more carts were brought in, this one full of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try the best two out of three,\" Titania suggested, grinning as She Hulk's gut let out another huge roar. The appetite stimulants laced into the burgers were making sure that She Hulk would continue to pig out long past the point of no return and as long as Titania kept on bringing up their rivalry, she knew She Hulk would eat on. \"I'm sure Tigra will love dating the strongest woman in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk had time only to blush before she dug into the ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sat up in her bed, stretching her arms out as far as she could before looking around. Medusa was smiling as she watched Susan struggle to get to her feet, her big gut, enormous rear end, and squished thighs making it quite the task for Susan and when the Invisible Woman finally was on her feet she was sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry Suzy? The guards were nice enough to drop off a veritable mountain of cookies and milk for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of food Susan's stomach let out truly ferocious growl and Susan blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...well...maybe a little bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Then let's work on filling that gut of yours, little Suzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Susan said softly, not knowing why she did so. Medusa knew. The villain knew all about the pills that had been ground up in Susan's portion of the meal because she had put them there. They were designed to lower the willpower of whoever ate them and make them more submissive, traits currently showing all over Susan's blushing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa patted her huge lap and Susan waddled over, sitting on Medusa's lap. Medusa tickled Susan's gut, eliciting a laugh from Susan. \"Open up Suzy, say aww for Mama Medusa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa beamed with happiness as Susan did so and she shoved the first of many cookies into Susan's mouth. Strand after strand of hair followed after that first cookie, each carrying more. After stuffing her with those, Medusa took a large bottle filled with milk and had Susan drink the whole bottle. After doing this, Susan appeared a bit full so Medusa patted her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a good girl Suzy. But we have a lot of food still to eat.\" Medusa patted Susan's waist. \"You'll be very large when we're done today, Ultra Waist, yes you will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan opened her mouth, eager for more as Medusa fed her, the villain pleased to have reduced this once proud hero into a hungry glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was hers and Medusa was sure her compatriots were dominating their heroic cellmates just as easily as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait to see all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they walked to the table, Kitty's hunger gradually increased. She was, by far, the smallest of the women here. She had tried to resist the food being offered, but as the days went on, her weight was creeping up. She was nowhere near the size of Susan or She Hulk, but her uniform was getting tighter and tighter. Most of the other women had either torn through their costumes or began to overflow them, with Emma being the most obvious example - her huge gut now hanging over her tight white pants, while her enlarged breasts threatened to explode out of her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the dining room, the other heroine's were slowly waddling in. Susan and She-Hulk looked even bigger than they had been yesterday, while Greer's huge stomach already looked like it was bloated to the max. Kitty took her seat at the table, her overstretched blue and yellow uniform creaking audibly as she sat down. Emma sat beside her, loaded up a plate, and passed it along. Kitty barely noticed what Emma was doing, as she was already grabbing handfuls of food, hoping to get what she could before the other supersized heroines sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Better eat up before the others take it all...\"</i> Emma telepathically planted the thought in Kitty's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, not realising that her thoughts (and her appetite) were being manipulated, eagerly ate what was placed before her. She stuffed handfulls into her mouth, propelled onwards by Emma's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk gave a groan as she sat opposite the young X-Woman, quickly loading up her plate. \"Well...you've certainly gained an appetite,\" she said, looking over at Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty heard her, but only grunted in response before chowing down on her second plate. Her stomach was starting to bloat outwards at an alarming rate, pushing her skintight outfit to it's limits. With Emma's help, it seemed as though Shadowcat's hunger had grown stronger than anyone else's. Even Susan, who was likely the biggest woman at the table, was having trouble keeping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URP!\" Kitty gave a mild belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I won't be the only fat cat around here...\" Tigra smirked, patting her growing pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not...URRRP...fat...\" Kitty protested, even as she grabbed another plate. \"I'm just really hungry today for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women continued to stuff themselves, their bellies bloating to outrageous sizes, their clothing stretching to tearing point and their mouths releasing nothing but groans, moans and belches. Kitty did not let up, even for a second, she was cramming everything in sight into her open mouth, demolishing every scrap of food she could get her hands on. Her stomach had expanded to a ridiculously large size, and her uniform only drew more attention to her inflated gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Kitty gave her loudest belch yet, then covered her mouth in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked up as she finally satisfied her rumbling belly, and was shocked at the engorged state of the young girl opposite her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel...so...full...\" Kitty moaned, her hands lowering to her globe of a belly. \"Never...eaten this much...before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, why don't you wash that down with a nice jug of milk...\" Emma suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White grabbed a large milk jug and forced it into Shadowcat's hands. Obediently, the bloated girl put it to her lips and began to chug it down. She greedily drank every last drop, much to the shock of the other heroes. When she placed the jug down, she wiped her mouth clean and let out another loud belch. Finally, it seemed as though she was full. Having out-eaten everyone at the table, Kitty slumped back into her chair in a daze, rubbing her swollen stomach...</span></div></div>",

She was about to protest, but the giant blue ball that was Mystique shook her head, and Tigra remained silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you have in mind for our chubby heroine's new costumes?\" Emma asked. \"Personally, I'm in favour of simply letting them outgrow everything they have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they'd be...naked...\" Tygra said, looking down at her own skimpy outfit, which was looking on the verge of bursting apart any day now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As fun as that would be, I have another idea,\" Medusa said. Her long strands of hair spread out across the room and began picking up different items of clothing. \"I made these in anticipation of this morning's events...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women smiled as Medusa held up three different outfits. All of them looked familiar - there was Susan's blue body suit, Kitty's yellow and blue costume and She Hulk's white and purple leotard. At first, the group was confused, until they noticed the gaping holes in the middle of each outfit. Smiles crept across the villain's faces as they realised that Medusa had produced clothing explicitly designed to show off the heroine's growing guts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful...\" Emma smirked, tracing her fat fingers over Kitty's outfit. \"There's certainly more room for them to grow into these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it should show off those big bellies they're developing...\" Titania chuckled, her huge gut wobbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, everyone out, go fetch our expanding cell mates. It's time for them to change,\" Medusa ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group waddled back out, and within moments, they returned with Susan, Jen and Kitty, supporting their weighty companions, who were still too stuffed to move on their own. The overfed heroine's slumped down into three empty chairs in Medusa's workshop as the the villains took their leave and closed the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URP!\" Kitty seemed unable to cease her loud belching. She groaned as she rubbed her exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving torn through their costumes, the women were struggling to hold onto the clothing they had left. The spandex material of their outfits had remained in place around their thick thighs and wide rears, but had completely ripped apart across their hugely stuffed pot bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...are you going to fix our outfits?\" Susan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than that my dear...\" Medusa smiled down at the chubby blonde, her hair already snaking around her cell mate's bloated gut. \"I've designed something new for you, which should be more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" She Hulk groaned, patting her exposed tummy. \"If I carry on eating like this...I'll have outgrown all my clothes by midnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa held up the newly stitched outfits for the girl's inspection. They were so exhausted from this morning's feast that they barely noticed the modifications, until Susan leaned in for a closer look. \"Is that...a hole?\" She asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can hardly wear a full body suit at the rate you're growing,\" Medusa replied. \"This will allow your stomach to expand freely, and spare you the embarrassment of bursting out during meal time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go around with <i>this </i>thing on display!\" Susan protested, grabbing her beach ball sized belly and shaking it for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa gestured to her own gigantic stomach. \"Why not? The rest of us do.\"</span></div></div>",

Hand it over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled as she handed She Hulk her plus sized leotard, then turned to Kitty, who seemed to be regaining her senses after her breakfast binge. The young X-woman looked in horror at the midriff exposing new costume that had been designed for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wear that,\" Kitty shook her head. \"Besides, I'm not even that fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa gave a chuckle as she surveyed Shadowcat's growing form. \"You might still be the only one here under two hundred and fifty pounds, but that won't last long. After this morning, you'll be outgrowing your costume in no time. If I was you, I'd take my offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked down at her naked stomach and gulped nervously. She silently accepted the new costume, unable to believe just how much food she had consumed this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just leaves you,\" Medusa said, turning to Susan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Susan said, snatching the outfit away from her cell mate's grasp. \"I'll wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Medusa smiled warmly. \"Trust me, you'll thank me for this later. Now, you'd better change while you have some privacy. I'll be outside if you need me.\" She turned and waddled out of the room, closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superheroine's looked around at each other, then down at their new costumes. While prison life meant that they had seen one another naked in the showers anyway, they still felt a little strange undressing in front of each other...or at least, Susan and Kitty did. When they looked over at She Hulk, she was on her feet, pulling her skin tight leotard away from her flabby green body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was quite a difficult task for Jen, as her leotard clung so tightly to her green skin that it was hard to remove. Instead, she simply started to tear it to pieces with her enhanced strength. She made quick work of what had once been a perfect fitting costume, until she stood before her friends completely nude. Her massive bely jutted out in front of her, while her breasts were allowed to bounce free. Jen gave a moan of relief as she freed herself from her constricting clothes and bared her chubby body to the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez She Hulk...put some clothes on...\" Kitty groaned, blushing at the sight of the naked woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen laughed and pulled on her new outfit. The modified leotard had been made with what seemed to be an extra stretchy type of spandex, and it fit her newly fattened up body perfectly. The circular gap in the midriff allowed her fat gut to pooch through, unhindered by fabric and free to grow. She patted her belly proudly, \"not bad, not bad at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was the next to begin changing, she struggled with her blue costume, which was stretched across her bulging body so tightly that it was taking all of her strength to remove it. \"Erm...Jen...think you could help me out a little here?\" Susan asked, her face turning red with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Jen said, eagerly stepping up and helping Susan to unzip the back of her suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I couldn't reach the zipper,\" Susan said, feeling immense relief as Jen slid the metal zip down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the zipper unfastened, Susan began to pull her costume away from the front of her body. She was amazed at just how large she had become, and as she peeled her suit away, her body seemed to bulge to an even larger size, finally free of it's spandex prison. Her boobs, which had stayed surprisingly round and firm, rested comfortably atop her giant gut. It took some wriggling and struggling, but she eventually managed to pull down the suit over her bulging behind, which jiggled free as Susan finally stepped out of the now useless outfit and stood naked before her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jen said, pinching a roll of flab from Susan's globe of a belly. \"You're even bigger than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan blushed and folded her thick arms across her massive breasts. \"I do seem to be getting a bit of a belly...\" she shuddered as she stared down at her heavily bloated stomach, which prevented her from seeing her feet. \"I might need a little help getting into my new...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more,\" Jen smiled, before helping her overweight friend into her new costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty was having problems of her own. Still tired and bloated, she didn't have the strength to tug her costume down over her thickening thighs. Every time she tried to unzip herself, she caused more tears to appear, until soon, she had practically destroyed her outfit - which was only hanging together via a few overstretched threads. \"Stupid thing...\" she grunted, trying to wriggle free. \"Why won't it come off?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had Jen zip up her new outfit, which was a perfect fit. Medusa had certainly gotten her measurements right. She wasn't sure she liked her belly being on display, but it was certainly more comfortable than her old uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRIP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise came from the other side of the room and Susan and Jen turned their attention to Kitty, who was now standing in the tattered remains of her old costume, trying hard to cover herself up. Susan was surprised by how quickly Kitty had grown overnight, and how big her belly had become since this morning. The poor young girl seemed paralysed as she looked down over her naked body, clearly having burst right out of her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...think I've gained a little weight...\" Kitty blushed, covering her larger boobs with her arm. \"Could you guys look away while I change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Jen obliged, while Kitty quickly grabbed her new outift and slipped it on. It was an immense relief to be wearing something that actually fit her newly enhanced body, but she hated the way it left her belly exposed. \"Great, like we needed a reminder of how fat we're getting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Kitty, we'll fire a way out of this,\" Susan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so...\" Kitty groaned, rubbing a hand over her growing pot belly. </span></div></div>",

Once they arrived at the table however they were shocked to discover two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was that Tigra was no longer sitting at the table.  Instead she was laying on her belly and eating a great deal of meat (it looked like enough to have come from one entire fully grown cow in fact!) out of one bowl and drinking water out of another.  She looked up at her fellow superheroines, and it was just possible to detect a few faint traces of a blush upon her furry face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, getting my big fat furry ass on the table seemed like too much of an ordeal so why not make myself at home down here?  It's not like I'm cold or anything with all this fur and fat to keep me warm.\"  She pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan doubtlessly would have objected to seeing a fellow superherione demean herself in such a matter but there was the other surprise she had to deal with first.  Sitting next to Medusa, Titania, and Emma were three huge plates piled high with just about every form of food imaginable which the supervillianesses were quite obviously ignoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she as a piece of metal being drawn by a magnet Sue felt compelled to sit before the plate next to Medusa but slowly gazed up and down at in silence unsure what to make of the huge collection of food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter Invisible Woman?\"  Asked a short sharp voice form behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan slowly turned her now rather ponderously pudgy body around and found herself gazing a short woman in a well trimmed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering what all this food is doing here...\"  Sue admitted not sure how to address the first thin woman she had seen in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well to put your mind at ease, I am Warden Excella Danforth, and as for what all that food is doing on your plate its your lunch...\"  She explained without so much as batting an eyelash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan slowly turned around to gaze at the veritable mountain of a meal behind her and then back to the warden.  \"I'm not sure I can eat that much.\"  She admitted feeling awkward about how the Invisible Woman who had become powerful enough to face down Doctor Doom himself was feeling skittish about one huge pile of grains and meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's prison policy that you do!\"  Excella said while taking a step forward to wrap Susan's bloated belly with her right hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lot of you are still dangerously thin as far as I'm concerned.  I haven't had any escapes from my prison and I'm determined not to break my perfect record.  The fact that you used to be a superheroine doesn't change things, so now that your body has had some time to adapt to larger meals its time to take it to the next step, eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan once again slowly turned around and gazed at Jen and Kitty both of whom were sitting spellbound by the massive plates of food before them.  None of them had taken so much as a nibble at the moment as if waiting to see what their defacto leader did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan herself wasn't sure of what she was going to do, she still felt somewhat full but the food smelled so tasty and she didn't want to create a scene either.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She staired down at the thing as if fearing it was poisoned, and took a huge bit out of it none the less a few moments later.

Reed, Susan and Ben were all starting to grow more and more bloated with each bite of food they took.

Everyone was meant to have a certain percentage of body fat, whatever was doing this to them was seemingly radically increasing that percentage and their bodies were adapting to compensate; the majority of the hunger they were feeling was simply their bodies trying to drive them to get \u201cback up to weight\u201d similar to people who had been starved or undernourished for some time, backing this up was the way the rest of their bodies were being altered to compensate for what was now to be their new \u201cnatural\u201d state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir skin was becoming tougher, their bones, muscles, tendons and connective tissue reinforced; this was happening to all three of them but was especially prevalent in Val, presumably because at her younger age her biology was more plaint than either her mother or Uncle. These changes would allow them to remain mobile, and counter most, if not all of the harmful side effects of their increased weight, but also resulted in them gaining physiologies not totally dissimilar to the mutant Frederick Dukes aka The Blob...essentially on top of whatever powers or abilities they may already have, his wife, daughter and brother-in-law were becoming what was commonly referred to as Bricks...if anything that...jiggled quit that much when it moved could really be referred to by a name quite that solid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result was that whatever weight they ended up, would be their \u201cnatural\u201d weight...so even if they somehow managed to crash diet their was down to the weight they had before, they would in fact be dangerously UNDER weight with all the potentially lethal health problems that could imply...frankly they almost certainly die before they ever reached their former weights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Lyja being a Skrull and biologically completly different from himself, Reed was seeing similarities in the changes in their respective physiologies, that lead him to believe they might be heading towards similar destinations, though what those might be he had yet to fully determine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was Ben\u2019s results that were the most shocking...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jen maybe this wasn\u2019t such a good idea...\u201d  The Invisible Woman moaned pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk was at least able to keep her feet, though her face seemed to be turning green, at least more green than her face normally was anyway.  She opened up her mouth to say something to Susan, however all that came out was another loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process of giving that belch however Jennifer\u2019s belly puffed up quite noticeably making her look as if she had just swallowed a beachball.  Susan suddenly felt the own pressure in her stomach lighten slightly as she began to giggle at the annoyed look on She Hulk\u2019s face before her pearls of laughter transformed themselves into an equally loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ended with a rubbery \u201cTHWACK\u201d as Susan\u2019s growing belly slapped against the ground.  \u201cOh my.\u201d  Sue muttered in shock unsure what to make of her new proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen just smiled at her grandly let loose with another belch, this one seeming... more confident if such a thing was possible to be said of a belch.

Jennifer now stood 15 feet tall and weighed a ton and a half, Susan was 12 feet tall and weighed a full ton, both women\u2019s entire bodies puffed up in every conceivable way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this is new..\u201d Jennifer admitted as she awkwardly tried to walk around at her new size, getting a feel for her bloated belly.  Susan followed suit however she wasn\u2019t anywhere near as sued to being big as Jen was and ended up tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed against the ground with a rubbery \u201cBOING\u201d sound effect and bounced high in the air.  As if just to prove it wasn\u2019t a fluke when she came down there was another rubbery \u201cBOING\u201d and she was lifted right back up in the air.  This process might have repeated itself over an  over again if Jen hadn\u2019t been there to catch Sue when she came down a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s new...\u201d  The Invisible Woman admitted for lack of anything more obvious to say.

It was the closest thing that they could find to a comfortable fit that would support their new bodies and even then it left a fair bit to be desired.  Susan had needed to use her elastic powers in order to squeeze into the thing, and Jennifer looked like she was only one long exhale away from being able to break the one she was sitting on in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, feeling strangely comfortable and less self conscious now than she ever had been before, just smiled and laughed off the comment.  \u201cI\u2019m still not as big as I\u2019ve seen you grow Janet, it\u2019s just that what there is of me is a lot more compressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a lot stronger!\u201d Jennifer added as well, wishing that there was something within easy reach that she could use in order to demonstrate her newfound strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened to you exactly?\u201d Tigra asked, the furry feline lounging across a couch that for the moment at least seemed to fit her perfectly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I got interested in sumo when I was in Japan with my teamates, and I decided to try it out for myself, become a \u2018sumoheroine\u2019 if you will.  Reed was very supportive and made these four pills which were lased with the DNA of The Blob to make me and Jen grow and big and powerful as he is!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey worked to, despite how massive we are me and Jen can move around easily!  Not only that but also I became as elastic as my husband Reed and she now can manage to get bigger and fatter as she gets angrier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan explained while holding up the two remaining pills that seemed to be incredibly small in her bloated hand.  \u201cSo we thought, well Medusa and Crystal are going to try and become sumo wrestlers the normal way but honestly I\u2019m not sure how much of a competition they could put up against us, and even if they can it will still take them a long time to train themselves up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we thought that maybe you two might like to try living life in the \u2018fat lane\u2019 for once.\u201d  The Invisible Woman went onto explain all about the pills and how once they were taken their was probably no going back, but even then the increase in powers they brought with them seemed to be more than worth it to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTigra was unsure but Janet simply smiled and held out her hand.  \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve changed sizes in my life, maybe I can develop a new line of clothing just for female sumo wrestlers.  Sure lets go ahead and see if I can\u2019t make the transition from Winsome Wasp to Bloated Bumblebee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this Tigra held out her own furry paw. \u201cGuess I might as well if Jan is gonna do it, lets find out what kind of fat cat I become.....\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing happened to the floor the pollen touched but Janet flew around some more until she was in front of the mass that was Susan's rubbery right butt cheek. Focusing her new power, the pollen struck Susan's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan jerked up a bit at the feeling of something on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet, what did you-\" but Susan was cut off as she felt her rubbery, elastic butt, start to sag and fill with fat! In fact, her butt was now twice as wide as before and felt heavy. \"You...can change the molecules in a persons body to fat with that pollen. Incredible!\" Susan then changed into her human sumo form and marveled at how much more she weighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to her rubber body, Susan beamed at Janet, who returned to normal human size, or sumo size as the case may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you do Tigra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, let's find out.\" Figuring it had something to do with changing forms, an image of a fat tiger came into Tigra's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body transformed and Tigra noticed that Janet, Susan, and Jennifer were larger than before. In fact the whole room was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, how cute!\" Jennifer said, picking up Tigra and taking her over to a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTigra's feline eyes widened as she looked at her reflection. She was a fat kitten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're a real fat cat now,\" Jennifer said, petting Tigra's furry head. The flabby cat purred loudly then and was about to speak once more when she felt a hairball in the back of her mouth. Hacking an coughing, she spat one out, the ball hitting Jennifer in stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's stomach expanded then, stretching out her uniform even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTigra thought of her normal form and returned to human size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Janet and I can make people fat. Not as useful as both of your powers but handy at ruining the plans of a villain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded and both Jan and Tigra hugged each other in excitement, enjoying their flabby bellies pressing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the Sumo Four!\" Susan proclaimed, causing Jen, Jan, and Tigra to laugh. \"Well it's not the best name but I'd like to see you three come up with a better one!\"</span></div></div>",

She-Bulk, the Invisible Blimp, Bumble Bee, Fat Cat, they will all fall before our might!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, exactly, are we going to get fat enough to deal with them?\" Moonstone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania smiled at that and stepped back to reveal four white pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These little babies were stolen by myself last week from SHIELD. They were made for the purpose of piling on weight for disguise but I've modified them a bit with some technology on loan from Dr. Doom. All we have to do is eat them and we'll gain both fat and new powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three women walked up to the table, each taking a pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go first,\" Moonstone said to Titania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villianess nodded and downed her pill, the other three following suit...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The chorus of belches that erupted from the mouths of these evil women would have drawn the attention of any curious citizen nearby, but luckily for the new evil team there were no people around the abandoned warehouse Titania had chosen for their meeting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania belched a final belch, her belly and butt both touching the floor by this point. Getting to her feet, she noticed she was thirteen feet tall now with her fat distributed all around her body. Rubbing her huge belly, she looked at her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellowjacket was next to get up, the Wasp nemesis now ten feet tall and a huge butt. Unlike Titania, Yellojacket's weight was focused in her butt and stomach, though she did posses more than one chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Maiden was eleven feet tall and had the largest breasts Titania had ever seen, though the rest of her body was hugely fat, her breasts overtook everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat loud belch had come from the finely formed mouth of one Moonstone, the last to finish her transformation as she got to her feet. Moonstone was a foot taller than Titania and was the largest out of all of them with a gut that could contain an elephant, a butt that was twice the size of Yellowjacket's, four chins, and thighs that were more of a force of nature than mere thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone, Yellowjacket, and Iron Maiden all felt their new flabby forms, eventually grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were large and in charge now and they couldn't wait to meet their skinny, supermodel-like nemeses Ms. Marvel and Black Widow. Yellowjacket was certain she could take the Wasp too, sumoheroine though she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we have to test our new powers,\" Titania said. Saying so, Titania felt something stirring within her. Thinking of She-Hulk made her angry and as her anger grew Titania's body started to grow taller, her skin turning red, her eyes yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Titania's body stopped growing at fifteen feet. She was now able to turn into a Red She-Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone was next. Her stomach churned as she tried to use a regular bolt but instead of coming out of her hands, Moonstone's mouth opened and a wave of energy was belched out, stinking horribly and knocking all of the other sumovillians to the floor on their well padded rear ends. Moonstone also felt her hands tingling then and she approached Titania's red form, touching her belly. Titania's stomach decreased in size by fifty pounds and Moonstone's own gut filled up with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a fat absorber and energy belcher it seems...neat...I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Maiden was next. It was odd for her, never really having powers before, she had no idea how to access them, but her instincts told her it involved her massive mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her breasts buzz a bit and wondered what that was about until a stream of milk shot out, homing in on Moonstone's mouth. Once the liquid had entered, Moonstone's belly felt full and she moaned a bit, belching and trying to relieve the pressure of her full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, this fullness was gone and Iron Maiden had discovered another power: she could surround her body in her old armor, custom fitted to her sumo size and also much stronger than her original exoskeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stronger armor and milk that auto-tracks and makes one full, effective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellowjacket was last and she somehow knew, much like The Wasp had, to shrink to her tiny form. In this form, Yellowjacket's body was even larger than her normal sized form and again like The Wasp, Yellowjacket now had a pollen she could shoot out. Deciding to test this ability on Moonstone, Yellowjacket watched as Moonstone's eyes turned glassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must...eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone then ran towards the food Titania had provided for this get together and started eating until all of it was gone, leaving a full, stuffed, Moonstone rubbing her fatter belly, having come out of her trance-like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind altering pollen that makes my target want to do nothing but eat. I can't wait to use this more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania cleared her throat, getting all of their attention. Now back in her normal sumo form, Titania spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are now The Frightful Sumos, arch-rivals of the Flabtastic Four. I am Titanic Gut, the leader!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Yellow Butt!\" Yellowjacket said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be The Iron Breasts!\" Iron Maiden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll, urp, be Moonbelcher!\" Moonstone said, waddling over to join her compatriots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had also thoroughly trounced the superskrull, while he might have been a dangerous opponent to the Invisible Woman, with her new increased forcefield powers (not to mention her amazingly powerful teamates) it had been easy for the Invisible Blimp to take care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I was a little worried at firs when I thought about being a sumoheroine that all of the weight would get in my way.  At the moment though I feel like I should have done it sooner!

The villainesses seemed to be so fat that ordinary bullets couldn\u2019t penetrate their skins.  Before she could add anything else, the watching sumoheroines could just barely make out a faint dusting of something yellow striking the reporter.  She dropped her microphone and turned away from the camera.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat... must eat... must eat...\u201d  They could hear her moaning as she ambled towards the bakery that was being robbed as if in a daze.  Susan had no idea what to make of this other than the obvious one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell girls it looks like we should hustle our big butts over to the Flabtasticar, and head out there, who knows, maybe if we manage to wrap this case up in record time that bakery owner will be kind enough to give us some free samples!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they\u2019d just finished lunch, She Bulk, Bumble Bee, and Fat Cat\u2019s eyes lit up in delight at the idea of being able to stop a crime and not even have to head back to base in order to grab another meal.

I-\" but whatever Titania was going to say was cut off as She-Bulk crashed into her nemesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining members scouted out the bakery, looking for signs of the other foes they had to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was in her normal sumo form, which turned out to be a mistake as she felt a hand touch her back and voice whisper in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a load off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Susan felt dizzy as at least a hundred pounds was absorbed incredibly fast. Groaning, Susan stumbled around, only to be bumped from behind by a massive belly, the force knocking Susan out of the fight and rendering her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the large bakery, Bumble Bee was flying around in her pixie form and looking behind her as she thought she heard movement. This turned out to be a big mistake, as she ran into something incredibly squishy. It was an enormous pair of breasts and before Bumble Bee could get a shot of pollen off a heavy glob of milk escaped those breasts, the stuff somehow homing in on Janet's pixie-sized mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool, creamy milk made it's way into her stomach and instantly Janet felt full, moaning as she returned to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat was in her massive tiger form, looking around for the enemy her scent told her was very close. Changing into her human form, Tigra knew the enemy couldn't be more than two feet away from her. Slashing in all directions, Tigra waited for a cry of pain or some sound but was met with silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Tigra felt something sprinkle on her. Looking up, her eyes already turning glazed, Tigra was covered in inches of the pollen. Instantly, Tigra dived into a pile of knocked over eclairs, munching away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Bulk had managed to knock Titania to the ground with her big butt, confident in her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can never beat me Titania so just give up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania started laughing then, glaring at her nemesis as all the rage she felt was unleashed in a primal roar. Getting to her feet, Titania's skin started turning red and her eyes yellow. Taller and taller she grew until Jen was actually looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned at what was happening, Jen could only offer one word before a fist knocked her into next week: \"Eep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Susan came to, still weak, she saw the four foes standing in front of the four incapacitated members of the Flabtastic Four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Invisible Blimp! Normally we'd use this moment to kill you but this was just to test ourselves. Next time, if you're this easy to beat, we'll devour you! We're the Frightful Sumos and your archenemies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman Susan recognized as Moonstone picked up the rest of her teammates with super strength and the Frightful Sumos escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Fat Cat had come out of her eating haze, Bumble Bee had stopped feeling full, and She-Bulk had regained consciousness, the Flabtastic Four made their way back to the Baxter Building, dejected and depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had turned into rubber and was shoving food into her mouth to regain her lost weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three watched as their leader paused in her stuffing to talk to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you three see Iron Maiden and Moonstone in that group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we'll need some help from Black Widow and Ms. Marvel if we're going to win next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think they'll want to join us?\" Fat Cat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but we'll need their help anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden Susan felt heavier, much heavier, so heavy in fact that her body couldn\u2019t support itself and instead was crushed to the ground as if the air itself weighed several thousand tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Marvel smiled at this discovery as she patted her own hefty belly.  \u201cWell I do believe this must make me Miss Massive, given my new size and the fact that I can control how much things weigh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she let up Susan was able to reform her body back to its normal flabby appearance and turned to face Black Widow.  \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former secret agent paused for a moment and then suddenly held out her hands.  She shot out strands of whit immaterial like spider man\u2019s webbing that wrapped up She Bulk in a cacoon.  Except that the stuff seemed to pulsate with energy and a few moments later Jennifer burst out of her trap, looking to have gained several hundred pounds of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems like not only can I imprison people within these strands, but also anyone who I catch ends up growing fatter and fatter within them.  So I suppose that my new name should be the Wobbly Webspinner... at least until I think of something better...\u201d  She admitted since after all the code name Black Widow had existed before she took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded in agreement, with these reinforcements there was no way that Titania would be able to make a fool out of her the next time the two groups did battle... right?</span></div></div>",

Luckily they soon found two such women: Lady Bullseye and Nightshade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth took the pills and after belches, expanding, and height, two new Frightful Sumo members were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade, now known as Nightfat, was twelve feet tall, her weight centered around her hips and belly.

Charging forward, Moonstone was sent to the ground, her stomach roaring with hunger.

I can't lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what happens to you if you do lose?\" Titania asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that will ever happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...anyway ladies, before we wreck havoc on the lives of both sumoheroines and normal people, it's time for us to enjoy ourselves with a vacation to Hawaii!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Frightful Sumos beamed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhle, in the Baxter Building....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why we'll be heading to Hawaii!\" Susan said to her teammates, everyone filled with glee at the news of a vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try out my new swimsuit!\" Janet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all can wear swimsuits and make those skinny sticks on the beach jealous!\" Jennifer put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed, Ben, and Johnny were going as well, Johnny especially excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, Crystal and Medusa are coming as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be interesting to see what they're like now,\" Susan admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sight of such a massive beast, especially one that wasn\u2019t native to the region in any way shape or form proceeded to scare the pants off of more than a few other vacations, but Greer Grant felt it was all in good fun, and it wasn\u2019t like she decided to chock up any fattening hairballs at people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more than one could say about Bumble Bee, as Janet lay on her own chair playfully and carefully letting lost with one blast of her pollen after another, seeing if she could figure out just the right amount to fatten up a woman enough to make her burst out of the swimsuit she was currently wearing.  Of course to make up for the pain and suffering she\u2019d also see to it that the poor deer received a rather large gift certificate to one of her many chains of clothing stores, all of which now stocked some very impressive selections of clothing for women \u2018of a certain stature\u2019 to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive made herself light as a feather allowing her to float in midair, slowly rolling over in order to make sure that she tanned perfectly on both sides.

They had been at it for an hour but finally She-Bulk one, ensuring The Blimp's constant stuffing for at least two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course these were all distractions so Titania and Nightshade could enact true evil: making Reed, Johnny, and Ben stuff themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade approached the hotel room of the guests of the Sumo Six and opened the door, eyes widening as she saw...</span></div></div>",

I was just looking around and you happened to leave your door unlocked...\u201d  She replied without seeming the least bit flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does too matter!\u201d  Medusa shot back, the Inhuman Queen being well versed in all of the major supervillianesses in the human world, and thus able to recognize the former Nightshade even at her new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade just patted her even more massive belly and shook her head.  \u201cNot really, you have to know the rules about how if two groups of superheroines and supervillianesses are on vacation and the supervilliansses aren\u2019t there to commit crimes then neither one will try to ruin the other\u2019s vacation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa relaxed slightly pulling back a few strands of her hair that had been previously pointed at Nightfat like deadly weapons.  \u201cHow do I know what you say is true?\u201d  She asked in irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightfat waved her hands in front of the red head\u2019s face.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but on the other hand it doesn\u2019t matter... does it slave?\u201d  Medusa\u2019 green eyes suddenly became vacant as she had spent far too long gazing directly into the sumo sized supervillianesses\u2019s face for her to have a chance to resist the hypnotic special ability that she had gained when she\u2019d become one of the Frightful Sumos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... it doesn\u2019t mistress....\u201d  Medusa mumbled sleepily.  Nightfat placed one of her chubby hands on Medusa\u2019s puffy belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, looks like you\u2019re trying to become a sumowrestler as well, well if you want to be one up to the mistress\u2019 standards you\u2019re going to have to do better than this!  Go down to the all you can eat buffe in the lobby and start stuffing yourself!\u201d  Medusa nodded and began to waddle downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightfat quickly retreated back to Titanic Gut\u2019s side.  It was hard to say for certain what would happen next, but she knew that once Medusa recovered from her gorging session in about an hour or so, then she\u2019d tell her friends about what she\u2019d seen.  If the Frightful Sumos wanted to break the code and attack the Sumo Six while they were on vacation and do it with a good chance of success they\u2019d have to do it now, while they still had the element of surprise completely on their side.  But would Titanic Gut be up for the idea?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking out a wadded up and sweat drenched copy of the Charter of Costumed Agression, Titania double checked the vacation clause. It turned out that they could attack during a vacation with impunity, the only thing the villians needing to look out for being the retaliation from the heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Titania plotted and planned with her teammates. Each would take a member of the Sumo Six on in single combat, incapacitating them as best they could, giving the Frightful Sumos the perfect opportunity to strike at the guests of the Six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania ordered each member of her team to a part of the resort, suited for the talents of each Frightful Sumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the plan was set in motion, Titania observing all from her post at her hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first match was Iron Maiden vs. Miss Massive by the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive scored the first attack, ramming into Iron Maiden and sending her to the ground. Luckily her armored form protected her from most of the damage and she got to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext it was Iron Maiden's turn to collide with Miss Massive. The two sumo sized combatants tussled for awhile but eventually Iron Maiden gained the upper hand through clever use of her exoskeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive was panting, sweat pouring from her body as she got to her feet on wobbly legs. She pointed a finger at Iron Maiden, almost summoning her weight power but was stopped by a steady stream of milk entering her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GLUG!\" was all Miss Massive was able to say as more and more milk entered her mouth. On and on the flow went, the amount of milk actually causing Miss Massive's gut to expand. Still Iron Maiden kept the flow going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after twenty minutes of milk, Iron Maiden stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive was looking more like a beached whale than a superhero. Her fat arms were unable to reach her stomach, full as it was with milk. But what was worse than the fullness of the milk was the effect of Iron Maiden's powers, causing Miss Massive to feel as if every square inch of her body was full of her favorite food: pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Massive Down,\" Iron Maiden reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second match was between Moonstone and Wobbly Webshooter on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone got the first attack off, a belch of energy that sent Wobbly flying. Wobbly managed to send out a few strands of webbing and hit Moonstone, but the added poundage didn't slow her down. Instead, Moonstone took the pounds with a smile before punching Wobbly hard in the gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoozy, Wobbly Webshooter tried to fire another web but was cut off by Moonstone's hand touching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with all that weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone then abosrbed as much flab as she possibly could from the dazed hero, her own body expanding to an incredible size as Wobbly slimmed down. Unfortunately for Moonstone, her powers only allowed her to absorb four hundred pounds at a time, leaving Wobbly at three hundred and fifty pounds of hero. Still that was nothing compared to Moonstone's new weight and the villian easily knocked out the hero, tying her up and placing her in a nearby shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wobbly tied up,\" Moonstone reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third match was Yellowjacket vs. Bumble Bee at the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rivals started of slamming their flabby bodies together but soon enough switched to pixie size, dodging the other's blasts as they flew, fat bodies jiggling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellowjacket led Bumble Bee on a chase, dodging the shoes and other objects of the citizens all around until she suddenly dove upward. Bumble Bee, going far too fast to make a correction in time, slammed into the counter of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing her opportunity, Yellowjacket laid on the pollen, making Janet soak up the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yellowjacket watched her rival revert to human size and started attacking the bar, she reported in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bumble Bee bloated.\" Such was indeed the case, as Bumble Bee had already snatched up a hose of beer and was sucking it down like her life depended on it, causing her stomach to bloat out and large belches to escape her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth match was Lady Bullseye vs. Fat Cat at the hotel lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two traded multiple blows but neither was really hurt thanks to all the blubber both women had. Next, Fat Cat shifted into her tiger form, roaring as she charged Lady Bullseye. Dodging, Lady Bullseye kicked out a leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Fat Cat had already shifted into her kitten form and scrambled up the outstretched leg, scratching Lady Bullseye and drawing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing, Lady Bullseye gave a might belly bump, sending the kitten Fat Cat tumbling through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Fat Cat was on her feat and in her normal form, it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I challenge you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her will, Fat Cat assumed a sumo stance, Lady Bullseye doing the same. They slammed against one another, Lady Bullseye the victor. As soon as she lost, Fat Cat felt an immense hunger, her stomach roaring louder than the Invisible Blimp could belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lady Bullseye wasn't done yet. Pointing to Fat Cat and a slim civilian trying to avoid being seen, she spoke. \"Both of you sumo, now! And after you've both lost ten times, go stuff yourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lady Bullseye watched the first match end in Fat Cat's victory, she reported in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat Cat sumoed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth match was She-Bulk vs. Titania in the hallway outside Titania's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly both sumo sized opponents grappled, the force of their impact causing the hall to shake. Titania turned into her Red She-Hulk form, overpowering She-Bulk for a few minutes before She-Bulk got angrier. Soon it was She-Bulk who was overpowering Titania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring, Titania tried to match that strength but was unable to. Defeat seemed a foregone conclusion in Titania's facial expression before the villian smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just remembered what makes Red Hulks especially dangerous!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Bulk then felt her strength fading as Titainia asborbed it, leeching the gamma radiation from the hero's body, soon enough leaving just a fat Jennifer Walters with regular human sumo strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking the human Jennifer out with a flick, Titania tied her to a chair and stuck a funnel full of weight gain shake into her mouth, laughing as she departed, locking the triple reinforced steel and titanium door she had custom made for her hotel room behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She-Bulk reverted,\" Titania reported, a bit disappointed that she wouldn't be able to view the final match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid final match consisted of Nightshade vs. The Invisible Blimp at the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was invisible and in her rubber form, hoping to surprise her opponent. She did, catching Nightshade across the jaw with a stretchy right hook but the attack didn't finish Nightshade off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Nightshade started running in place, working up a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering just what her opponent was trying to achieve, Susan turned visible and moved closer, fist held high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that proved to be her undoing, as Susan took a breath of Nightshade's suggestive scent, along with other patrons at the buffet, five women and two men coming up to Nightshade along with Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, can you turn back to your human form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything Mistress, as long as you feed me!\" Susan said, despite all her willpower. Once she was human and not elastic, Nightshade ordered her other slaves to keep Susan's mouth full at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This goes for you too Susan. Don't waste any food and eat as much as you can, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course mistress, I obey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade smirked as she watched the Invisible Blimp waddle towards the dessert section of the buffet, sticking her mouth under a nozzle and sucking down ice cream while the other bewitched citizens crowded around Susan, hands already full of food ready to stuff into Susan's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Invisible Blimp under my thrall,\" Nightshade reported in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the matches were done, the Frightful Sumos were all gathered in Nightshade's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that those bratty blimps are incapacitated, we have free reign to attack their guests. Let's get to it!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She found herself in a strange room that looked like a prison cell more or less.  Granted there were no bunks or sign of any other furniture, but the walls was depressingly devoid of windows or any sort of ornamentation completely and utterly unlike the ones she was used to back at the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she also quickly realized that she wasn\u2019t alone.  Not only were the other members of the Sumo Six in there with her, but also so were Medusa, Crystal, Reed, Ben and Johnny.  Susan was shocked by this, especially because the three male occupants of the room, seemed to have put on quite a bit of weight since Sue had last laid eyes on them none too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReed what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, what has happened to you?\u201d  He shot back leaving Sue feeling utterly and completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband pointed towards the floor.  Turning into rubber Susan stretched out her neck so that she could see past her belly.  Looking down at the ground she was able to see her reflection perfectly.  It didn\u2019t look much like the any Susan Richards she had seen before, be it the Invisible Girl, Invisible Woman, or Invisible Blimp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was still wearing her costume, everything it didn\u2019t cover was instead covered by a thick layer of blond fur.  Looking around she saw that the others were the same, Johnny and Miss Marvel had blond fur like herself.  Crystal had orange, Reed had brown, Medusa and Wobbly Webspinner had red, Reed had brown, She Bulk had Green, Ben even had a few tufts of.. only Fat Cat seemed to remain noticeably unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, though Greer hadn\u2019t grown any new fur, her appearance had changed whereas which previously had been sharp and pointed were now big and round, like satellite dishes... or a mouses....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling out her teeth with her tongue Susan was able to discover that it did seem as if she was a little buck toothed.  She could also feel something new, something strange twisting about inside her pants, was it a tail?  Waddling over to the one door in this strange room she opened it and found that it lead to a twisty turny corridor whose walls were completely and utterly uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the roof above Susan\u2019s head fell away and she was squashed flat by a huge wheel of cheese, that seemed to be the size of a car compared to her.  As she pulled herself free Susan could hear a mocking voice from above.  \u201cWell it looks like our little mousies are getting themselves used to their new cage.  Don\u2019t you agree Susy Wuusy?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she managed to return her rubbery body from some semblance of order Susan looked up and found.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Titania was huge!  Sue felt intense dismay. She must also be the size of a mouse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to us?!\" Sue said, horrified that her voice was now mixed with a mouse's squeak.<br>\r\nTitania laughed and her booming voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We discovered a pill laced with the Blob's DNA, no doubt what you six used to become the Sumo Six. We managed to reverse engineer the pills, except the DNA was that of a mouse! We also added something special to the mix but you'll find that out soon enough. I leave you mice to your meal, ta ta for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roof was then replaced and Sue pondered over just what Titania meant when the smell of the cheese wheel came to her new nose. Turning her attention to the food, Sue felt drool escape her furry lips as she lunged forward, taking the largest bite she could from the wheel. The rest of her mousy companions did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first bite alone made Sue feel strangely full, then realized what the cheese was made out of: it was made from Iron Maiden's milk! Her stomach was full but her brain commanded her to eat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she did. And another, and another, and another, and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania opened the roof of the large maze. Said maze was located in the tiniest province of Europe in a warehouse that was used to store jumbo jets. The maze nearly took up the whole hangar. Again thanks to Dr. Doom, the Frightful Sumos were able to receive all these amenities for their revenge, Titania thanking the heavens that Doom wasn't upset with them for changing his nemesis Mr. Fantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe observed eleven stuffed mice, each bloated beyond belief, their little furry bellies stuffed to the brim, the cheese wheel completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up Sue, who made no visible resistance, Titania brought her up to her face and smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, does poor little Sue need a belly rub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIC...we'll...HIC...get you,\" Sue managed to say. Summoning up all her effort, Sue unleashed her gambit, a forcefield springing into life around Titania's head. But the villian only laughed, the forefield flea-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed you were able to do that, Susy. But your powers just aren't up to snuff. Yes you can do little tricks with them but they will never be a threat to human sized opponents. No doubt you've noticed the little gift we gave you. Whenever you eat cheese in your mouse form, and trust me when I say that's all you'll ever eat again, your mind wants more until there is none left. Even though the traces of Iron Maiden's milk makes you think you're full, you're really not. You'll get fatter and fatter, wider and wider. But don't worry, you won't be powerless blobs of flab. You'll retain mobility, just not very much and I do say you'll work up a sweat lugging your fat around. Now how about that belly rub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue was powerless to resist as Titania placed her index finger on the round belly that Sue now had, rubbing as gently as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania grinned at the belch and pressed harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you can belch louder than that Susy. We all want to hear you after all.\" The rest of the Frightful Four appeared in Sue's bleary sight then, and the finger pressed harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cute! What a good belcher!\" Titania then let Sue down to the rest of her bloated friends and put the lid back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sue and the rest weren't feeling so stuffed anymore, they observed how their weight was now distributed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue had a gut now thanks to their latest meal and the largest butt out of all of them, her massive thighs touching no matter what. Reed had a huge belly and the largest pair of man boobs out of himself, Johnny, and Ben.  Johnny had the largest butt out of the guys and Ben had a larger belly than Reed or Johnny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk looked the worst with her weight, no doubt thanks to Titania's wish to see her rival even more humiliated. She Hulk's cheeks were massive, almost as large as her breasts, belly, and butt. Her butt was covered in green fur like the rest of her and she possessed the longest tail out of all the mouse heroes. Her ears were the biggest and her buck teeth the most pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa and Crystal had the same weight in the same areas, consisting of a big belly and large breasts with only a chubby butt and thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp and Tigra were on opposite ends of the weight distribution spectrum, with Tigra having a big belly and breasts while Janet had a large butt, thighs, and a few extra chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Marvel and Black Widow had all their weight concentrated in one area of their bodies, Miss Marvel's being her belly, and Black Widow's being her butt. The rest of their bodies were slim and toned, though thanks to the cheese they had all eaten earlier, these were covered in slightly flabby layers now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first week involved attempts at escape from Mr. Fantastic, who tried to stretch his way to freedom, Miss Marvel, who tried to fly but only managed to get an inch off the ground, Tigra, who drew a drop of blood from Lady Bullseye, Black Widow, who spat at Iron Maiden, Medusa and Crystal who only managed to give one of the Frightful Sumo a slight pinch and a tickle thanks to Medusa's hair, Johnny, who gave them a sun tan but meant to burn them, Ben, who was too weak for his punches to be effective, and The Wasp, who stung with her energy bolts to little effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of these rebellions were met with humilation, Reed stretched like taffy, and the rest forced to eat an entire cheese wheel by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania saved She-Hulk for last. Taking her out of the maze, she plopped She Hulk on the ground and told her to punch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure,\" She Hulk squeaked, punching with all her might. Titania laughed at the tiny fist and picked She Hulk up again, taking up a mouse-sized diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen She Hulk was placed back in the maze, she was too stuffed to do anything but hiccup and wear a crinkly diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a few more months past and the mouse heroes were completely cowed but had managed to find some modicum of happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue opened her eyes, snuggled up to Reed, as she kissed him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, honey.\" She had discovered that she was still a tiny bit elastic and stretched her hand to ruffle his hair. Of course in her mouse size she could only stretch an extra foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning dear,\" Reed replied. The couple weighed a ton each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was currently waking up Medusa and Crystal, both agreeing to have a threesome with the young mouse man, Medusa finding it quite enjoyable. One of her strands of hair patted Crystal's butt and fully woke her, Crystal replying with a stuck out tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, The Wasp and Tigra were arguing over who got to wake up Ben, a competition having arisen over who got to be with the mouse Thing, much to Ben's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls, there's enough of me to go around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth super mice blushed at that and quickly hugged Ben, all enjoying their flabby bodies squishing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinniest of the eleven mice was Miss Marvel, who weighed nine hundred and seventy two pounds, but they were sure their weights would continue to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by their thoughts, Titania opened the maze, dropping eleven titanic cheese wheels down, all cheddar, for her prisoners. She picked up each mouse and separated them so that each could eat their own cheese wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the lid, Titania waited an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened it again, she saw eleven stuffed mice, Sue and She Hulk being thelargest. Smirking, Titania picked the both of them up and pet their furry stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...\" Sue murmured, opening her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hic,\" was all She-Hulk managed as her own eyes took in where she currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two stink! Don't they have mouse bathtubs down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both Sue and She-Hulk didn't respond, too stuffed to care that they were incredibly smelly thanks to the amount of sweat they worked up just moving around. Titania shook them fully awake and pressed down hard on She-Hulk's green, furry, stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRAAAAAAAAAP!\"  Putting She-Hulk back in the maze, but not before placing yet another cheese wheel in front of She-Hulk, Titania returned her attention to Sue.  \"C'mon Belchy Susie, give us a big one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stabbed her finger against Sue's stomach then, causing Sue to open her mouth wide and belch for a full minute.  \"There's my Belchy Susie!\" Titania had just put Sue down beside her concerned husband and put the roof of the maze back on, when she heard the doors of the hangar open. Turning around, her eyes went wide.  \"But you said we could-\" but whatever Titania was going to say next was cut off as she was tranquilized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time the maze was opened, the eleven mice saw none other than Doctor Doom himself, the eyes boring into each mouse hero. \"Richards, you know as well as I that the pills are irreversible. So you will all remain mice but mice of Latveria! You shall be fed regular cheese and whatever other meals you wish.

She Hulk, the one responsible, merely nodded her head, a paw reaching down to pat her huge gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were lounging by an enormous pool. Doom had installed a hard light emitter that could create any environment his collection of hero and villain mice wanted. Along with this, he had provided clothing and food replicators, needed after the gluttonous mice nearly ate all the food he had in Castle Doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since he had declared that the two sides get along, the villains and the heroes had done so, moving from rivals to friends, although tempers did tend to flare every now and again. Mostly around size or the volume of belches or how much one could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch contests were soon settled with a feast and the bloated victor was given a belly rub by the loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really filling out there Titania,\" Jennifer complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed ever since her transformation and subsequant first stuffing, Titania had filled out. Most of her weight rested in her belly and face, given the former leader of the Frightful Sumos an incredibly jolly appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk, on the other hand, was in the running for the largest butt. It took ten enormous chairs to comfortably fit her ever expanding green mass of a rear end. Dressed in a tight bikini, that showed off her recent fifty pound gain, She Hulk laid back and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it,\" Titania put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the former maze, Crystal and Johnny were feeding each other great big chunks of cheese. After a few more pieces shoved into Johnny's mouth, Crystal started to get tired, causing Johnny to feed her even more, much to Crystal's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple had the same basic shape: huge thighs, enormous boobs, or moobs in Johnny's case, and a big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa, observing their feedings from a nearby table, was plowing through a bucket of ice cream, her numerous chins covered in the frozen treat. Her hair aided her in this feeding but soon enough she was interuppted by her gut sending the button on her pants flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the pale pool of fat spreading out from its contained prison, Medusa went on eating, occassionly shaking her head at Crystal's stuffed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Lady Sumo were on another large couch, watching a wrestling match on television, both eating some popcorn, their furry bellies steadily expanding as they munched on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had more of a gut but Lady Sumo made up for it with her impressive breast size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the mousy residents of this former maze were in the middle, the hard light emitter giving them a large circular arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the stands around this arena were Moonstone, Nightshade, Iron Maiden, Yellowjacket, The Wasp, Black Widow, and Miss Marvel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach had a bucket of fried chicken in their paws and were munching on the meal, eagerly awaiting the match that was about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the arena, clad in a blue loincloth and nothing else, was Reed Richards. At three tons he was the largest male mouse and his butt was even larger than both Moonstone and Black Widow's rears combined. His moobs were also quite large and put Miss Marvel's bust to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a nearby changing room, Susan Richards was observing her furry form in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blond fur and what was left of her human hair meshed well with her ten chins. Her boobs, thighs, and arms were swaddled in fat. Her belly was growling despite the fact that she had just consumed an entire buffet in preparation for the match waiting for her just outside the changing room doors. But she had a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sumo loincloth wouldn't go up any further. They were stuck halfway up her collosal thighs and couldn't begin to cover the mass that made up her rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was always eating the most out of all the mice. Whether it was to cope with her situation, a need, or merely a sexual desire, Susan was the fattest out of all the mice. At ten tons the only other mouse who came close in girth to her was She Hulk at five tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Susan took off the loincloth and headed out to meet her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer steps shook the stands and when the other women noticed her naked body, they started to gossip about the reason. Reed's jaw hung open and quite a few feet downwards as well. Susan, blushing, but smiling, waddled forward, assuming the classic sumo stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat trip in Japan had changed more in Susan's life than she could ever have expected. But things had come full circle and as she charged towards her husband, their fat jiggling and smooshing together, she had the happiest smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a sumo and she was happy.</span></div></div>",

The mousy hero's rocky skin had begun to crack shortly after the transformation, fur sprouting up in its place, though the fur was orange. He now weighed four tons and was currently being hugged by She Hulk, Titania, Lady Bullseye, and Black Widow. Above his head, but still close, floated Miss Marvel and Moonstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero and villain had slowly transformed into their current forms: balloons. They were still fat and felt all their weight but still floated in the air, moving around by belching. The change had ended their need for food but they would still eat, just out of their desire for food. Both women had a largely spherical shape, with Moonstone's body having a rounder stomach and Miss Marvel possessing a larger butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they weren't the only ones to have gone through these odd changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow was taking on a vaguely spider like appearance with eight limbs and a huge, bulbous body with a tiny head. She still looked mostly human though and hadn't gained any extra eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk and Titania weren't really changing into anything different but they were becoming increasingly more mouse like. Jen would squeak whenever something startled her and Titania was scared of Tigra whenever she was around. Their teeth were longer, their tails as well, and they had more fur to go along with their increased blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Bullseye was mostly the same save for an increased propensity towards laziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wasn't the only one with a harem, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny Storm watched as Tigra walked over to him, on all fours. Her mutation had caused her to become more cat like in behavior and could no longer stand on two legs. Of course she still had her mouse ears, mouse tail, and fur, creating an amusing irony for her. She licked Johnny's hand and Johnny scratched behind her ear, eliciting a purr from the four ton mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp flitted by Johnny's ear with her newly regained wings. She also was growing a stinger from her quite huge rear end but other than that she was still the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBumblebee had the same transformation and was currently eating some honey, the mouse/insect buzzing with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightfat and Iron Maiden were rubbing Johnny's stuffed belly, gleeful as could be after the feast they had just eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal was the largest out of the women and even had fifty pounds on Johnny himself. She was the one who suggested the harem and the women loved her just as much as they loved Johnny. Crystal was six tons, only two less than her sister, and gained mostly in her belly these days. She was on the same couch as Johnny and munching on some honey that Janet had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa lived in the same complex as Reed and Susan and kept to herself for the most part, only occasionly participating in some sumo matches, prefering the company of her hair and a buffet to the others. The main mutation for her was the fur all over her body could be lengthened and controlled just like the full head of human hair on the top of her head, earning Medusa the nickname, from She Hulk, as Cousin It. Of course Medusa didn't care what she was called anymore, so enthralled was she by this new ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight was largely centered on her thighs and breasts, giving her the largest hourglass shape out of all the women and at eight tons she was the second largest female after Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Susan and Reed Richards, they were currently snuggled together on their large bed, their fat flopping around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir transformation was the strangest for while both were still mice, their bodies were almost jelly like. Their body parts could even detach completely from their body only for a new one to soon grow in to replace the one that was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's butt was constantly vanishing and whenever one of the others stumbled upon it, Susan could feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to interesting games for Reed and Sue where Reed would lose his ears and Susan would lose her breasts. Susan would whisper into Reed's ear something naughty and Reed would play with Sue's breasts, eliciting several squeaks of pleasure from Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir original powerset had completely vanished, save for some tiny, tiny elasticity. The most either could stretch was about two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sighed as she felt her belly dissolve from her, her gut soon replaced by a duplicate. Reed grinned and grabbed the cast off gut, rubbing it, Susan feeling it and letting loose a loud belch, which caused her mouth to fly off to a corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mouth grew back, Susan laughed as she grew a new mouth, using her regained lips to kiss Reed deep on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould their changes ever end?</span></div></div>",

Of course to do that properly, we\u2019ll need to figure out where they\u2019ve gotten themselves to.  Bumble Bee, you and me will be in charge of that.  You can shrink yourself down to the size of your namesake and I can turn invisible and we can both fly or at least hover around the island, and something tells me that it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to notice Titania and her lot given how big they\u2019ve gotten.\u201d  As for the rest of you, stay on alert in case Titania decides to make things even more heated than they already are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were nods all around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed I\u2019m sure the master would be proud with what we\u2019ve already managed, but after we take these pills, we\u2019ll really be able to show them a thing or two!\u201d  Medusa pointed out as she held the pill in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later and the two Inhuman sisters knocked back their glasses of water and pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough their room was filled with the sound of one great big belch after another as they bloated up.

After all they were all too... large to be very good at hiding any more, with the possible exception of Yellow Jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus while Susan and her sumo slobs were out combing the beaches and the countryside to try and locate just where the Terrible Sumos had gotten themselves to, Titanic Gut saw to it that she got her team\u2019s reservations changed, and moved them all into the exact same hotel as Susan and her team was staying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus when She Bulk returned from a hard day of plodding around the beaches, sweet dribbling off her green body in miniature waterfalls (she was extremely tired both from having to do so much moving around and having to do it out in the hot sun) she found her old enemy waiting for her at the restaurants bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment Titanic Gut was sucking down a keg as if was a normal sized drink, but then on the other hand given how large she was and how much extra fat she had to dilute the liquor perhaps the scale wasn\u2019t that far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed in her normal spiked purple costume and the first thing she did to great Jennifer was let loose with a loud belch in her direction.

It was completely by accident that our two teams wound up going to this place on vacation at the same time, and therefore neither of us is allowed to spoil it for the other!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer Walter\u2019s slowly unclenched her hands that had been curled into fists and sat down on the stool next to Titanic Gut (well actually it was real two stools over since she was so large she occupied enough space for two normal people) the twos giggling guts bumping into one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now exactly then?\u201d  She asked in irritation that she might find herself so close to her old enemy and unable to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was thinking the two of us could just sit chat and maybe drink a little, you know relax.  I\u2019m paying so what exactly do you have to loose?

Looking over at Janet, who was shoving four hotdogs into her mouth at once, and then realizing that she herself was about to cram eight into her fat maw, Yellowjacket got a firsthand experience of her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, gorged on hot dogs, the two size changers parted ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellowjacket's curses reached Janet's ears as the latter rested in her room, the former's butt far too large to clear her own bedroom door.</span></div></div>",

I'll always be the largest of the Fantastic Four, got it?\" Susan valiantly said before shifting her body into her human sumo form and shoving a massive bunch of fries into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade waddled away, her wedgie hurting incredibly, and returned to the room she shared with Moonstone, hoping her teammate would be able to remove this affliction and ashamed that Susan managed to play such a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd back at the table, Susan, her husband, Johnny, and Ben were still stuffing their faces. The Fantastic Four's guts expanded, their butts increased, and their faces softened as time wore on until finally, six hours later, Ben, Johnny, and Reed came to, the sight of the sumo Susan still eating consuming their vision, not yet noticing all the extra hundred pounds each had gained. </span></div></div>",

Finally there was a ring drawn in the sand, and at the moment two obese women were struggling, each attempting to push the other one out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take them long to locate who was in charge of this change, since both Moon Belcher and the former Lady Bullseye, both of them lounging in specially prepared chairs watching the battle with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what is going on here?\u201d  Demanded Miss Massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon Belcher who of course recognized the fact that both of these two who had come to join them were less experienced at being sumoheroines than the rest of Susan\u2019s team, decided that this might be just the perfect situation to play another good prank on them, and do it right in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my friend and I, decided that we were tired of there being such a great big gap between those of us with superpowers and those of us without them, when both groups are here to enjoy the beach, and so she decided that clearly the right thing to do was to introduce there people to the wonders of sumo wrestling.  You don\u2019t have a problem with that, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two members of the Sumo Six blushed, as they searched their minds trying to find a reason to object to this behavior when after all it had been Susan in the first place who had brought the wonders of sumo wrestling to them.  How could they fault anyone, even supervillianesses for doing the same for others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later there was a loud \u201cTWUMP\u201d as one of the two women in the circle managed to toss the other one out.  The formerly slim sharpshooter began to clap her hands together in excitement before pointing at their two new guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cExcellent, now then why don\u2019t the two of you go have a match and show the other people here what a real sumo fight looks like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it Miss Massive and Wobbly Webspinner were on opposite sides of the sumo ring, both unable to take their eyes off the way that the woman who had lost was stuffing her face, and wondering to themselves why exactly they had decided to go along with that request, and yet unable to back down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The former black widow knew that even with her increased strength from growing to sumo size she was still no proper match for her blond opponent who could have easily defeated her with her super strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no idea...\u201d  Miss Massive admitted as the two struggle against one another, their limbs moving of their own volition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedusa said when she ran into Nightfat her scent could trick people into doing things but she isn\u2019t hear, and Yellowjacket\u2019s pollen can make people extra hungry, but what kind of weird superpower is it that makes people sumo wrestle?\u201d  The weight controlling sumoheroine wondered allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe kind that we\u2019re under right now.  And its also pretty clear that whoever looses si going to have to stuff their face.  What do we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment Miss Massive was simply glad that her full powers hadn\u2019t kicked in on their own or she already would have thrown Natasha halfway across the beach.  \u201cI don\u2019t know... maybe we can tie...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if the power thinks that means we\u2019ve both lost?\u201d  Wobbly Webspinner asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did seem exactly like the kind of thing a supervillinaesses power would do.  So there was only one choice available to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive suddenly made her teamate light as a feather and easily lifted her up above her head, whispering to the former Black Widow\u2019s ears what her plan was.  Then she threw Wobbly Webspinner out of the ring, way out of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came crashing down on top of the two members of the Frightful Sumos letting loose with a blast of her fattening webfluid in all directions that promptly enveloped the two girls before her eyes glazed over with hunger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive flew over and grabbed the still light Wobbly Webspinner by the hem of her collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhoops, looks like I over did it well I need to get my friend her back to the hotel so she can really chow down see you later!\u201d  She added before flying off with Natasha, before either of the two supervillianesses got fat enough to burst free from their respective cacoons.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reed had worked hard to loose much of the weight he had gained under Nightfat\u2019s influence, and once again Mr. Fantastic could easily fit his stretchy body within the folds of his large wife\u2019s flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to know unless I find out come on ladies let go investigate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Susan lead her team inside the large bakery.  The found not the Frightful Sumos, but only their leader Titanic Gut waiting for them inside standing behind the cash register.  She said nothing as one after another member of the Sumo Six waddled into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after they were all present did she utter two words.  \u201cGot you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she slammed her feet against the floor, hard.  It gave way almost instantly between the fact that it had been specially designed to carry only so much weight and so between the supervillianesses mighty stomp and the half a dozen sumoheroines standing on top of it, the thing caved in at once, or at least the section of the floor that Titanic Gut wasn\u2019t standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and the other plummeted downwards, but their fall was soon broken as they landed in an industrial sized tank of milk.  It all happened too fast for Susan to think to create an invisible forcefield to break her fall, and Bumble Bee was too afraid that she might get hit and knocked out by a piece of shrapnel from the shattered floor if she shrank down to try and fly or hover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplurtting and spluttering they kicked their way to the surface of the tank and climbed out.  As they did so Miss Massive grabbed hold of her stomach, at first simply attempting to wipe a bit of the offending white liquid off of it, but a moment later after the task was done she grasped  her belly awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... not good...\u201d  She moaned patting her stomach and trying to give it a soothing massage.  \u201cDamn, I don\u2019t know what it is but all of a sudden I just feel like I ate my way through three different buffets!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Cat ever well versed about her liquid dairy products realized what this meant herself as she dropped to all fours resting her stomach against the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat tank... it must have been filled to the brim with Iron Maiden\u2019s milk!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the Invisible Blimp with her elastic waistline was starting to feel like she was stuffed to the gills.  \u201cUhh... hold it together girls, we can\u2019t let the fact that we accidentally sucked down a couple of teaspoons of tainted milk get to us, if we do it\u2019ll be over before it starts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a rousing speech might have done a better job of rallying her troops if a moment later some sort of tube didn\u2019t descend a top  of Susan and suck her upwards away from her teamates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself being shot out of the tube into another room where Titanic Gut was waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey there Susy, its time to finish this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your dreams!\u201d Shot back Susan Richards as she created an invisible forcefield around Titanic Gut to hold her at bay.  The red haired supervillianess however simply delivered one good punch and the field shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try, Susy, but you should know that the power of your forcefields is only as strong as your concentration its not easy to concentrate with that poor rumbly tummy of yours is it?\u201d  Titanic Gut asked, her voice pathetically cute mocking Sue with every syllable she uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan blushed heavily, Titanic Gut was right, not only did she have a stomach feeling painfully full but now she also had a headache to go with it.  \u201cOkay big deal, it doesn\u2019t matter how strong you are against a foe who can bounce back from any blow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan announced proudly while transforming her body into its rubber mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny you should mention... bouncing...\u201d  Her foe joked before crossing the distance between them in one stride and kicking Sue squarely in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superpowerful blow didn\u2019t harm her at all but it did send the Invisible Blimp rochetting around the room like an oversized dodge ball.  Several times she slammed off of Titanic Gut\u2019s... well gut, but this only made her seem to bounce around faster much to the delight of the villainess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after a full five minuets of this treatment she finally caught Susan midbounce snatching her out of the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy my.. it looks like my little Susy is so very woozy indeed!\u201d  She joked as Susan\u2019s eyes were spinning circles around their sockets from all the bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Susan couldn\u2019t even hold herself together as she began to awkwardly slosh back and forth like a large chunk of melted rubber.  Titania vacuumed Susan up with a device she\u2019d prepared for just this event and stored her in an air tight can that should hold her for at least a few hours... now she just had to sit back and relax as her Frightful Sumos finished kicking the huge asses of Susan\u2019s pathetic squad of fatties!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did you see what I did to your wife? She's safe and sound in my little vacuum prison. If you want her back safe and sound, follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, Johnny, don't follow me. Scout the area for the other Frightful Sumos and do not separate, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Johnny nodded and watched as Reed walked away, stretching himself to go farther faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Reed had vanished from their view, Ben and Johnny went east, into the tall isles of the bakery. They traveled for half an hour with no sight of any enemy. What they found instead was a massive table loaded with pastries. The pastries were donuts and crullers of various shapes and sizes, all slathered in yellow frosting with what looked like cinnamon on every one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, feeling a bit hungry, took one and bit into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did so, laughter rang out all around both men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha, oh rocky boy, you just made the biggest mistake of your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade's face appeared on a monitor in one of the aisles, her many chins wobbling as she observed The Thing start to eat uncontrollably, his blue eyes glazed over as pastry after pastry was demolished by his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him?\" Johnny demanded, turning into his flame form just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't me. One of my teammates used her special pollen on all those pastries. Your friend will be fat in no time and out of the picture. Now, what should we do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitor went black then, Johnny taking the air, not wanting to leave Ben to his fate, but knowing there was nothing he could do for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny had flown a hundred yards when a fat woman flew right in front of him. He knew from Susan's information that this was Moonbelcher and shot a blast of fire towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching loudly, the energy blast from her mouth ripped through Johnny's flame and struck him so hard he fell out of his flame form, striking the ground hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoozy but still conscious, he got to his feet and managed to burn Moonbelcher right on her fat butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEOWCH! Why you little firebug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbelcher readied another blast but Johnny was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing, Moonbelcher informed her teammates over their earpieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Moon, he's in my sights,\" one of her cohorts replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was looking around for another opponent, not realizing that he was heading towards a pit much like the one that had trapped the Sumo Six in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step, his foot plunged through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splash, the Human Torch, was in a giant chamber of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in his flame form, Johnny wasn't worried as his flaming mouth served as a barrier to any of the liquid entering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attempted to swim but suddenly felt as if he had swallowed a bowling ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to move, Human Torch. You're in my milk bowl, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked to the left, where the voice had come from, and saw Iron Maiden walking towards the glass tank, placing her hand on the surface. Despite how full he felt, Johnny concentrated and increased his flame, but the fullness only increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Torch, what does fire do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was too full to reply and Iron Maiden smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It consumes anything it comes into contact with. You're evaporating my milk and breathing the fumes in, silly boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny burned brighter and brighter still, the glass in the tank starting to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Maiden's eyes knew fear then as she backed away, knowing that the power of Johnny Storm's Supernova technique was too much for the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon enough the flame died out, Johnny exhausted from his full body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titania, this is Maiden. The flame is out, repeat, the flame is out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania, standing in front of Reed Richards, grinned as she heard the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're the last Fantastic Four member left, Reed old boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the antics and show me where my wife is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extended fist almost caught Titania in the jaw but she had ducked, striking back with a belly bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed countered by turning into a human sized rubber ball and slamming into her again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, much like his wife, the technique proved useless against Titania. Still Reed didn't become dizzy, Mr. Fantastic long used to being able to meld his elastic body. After dodging one another for several minutes, Reed finally managed to land a hard punch to Titania's gut, knocking the wind from her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounding away, Titania was breathing heavily and clutching her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff...Huff...you're better than your wife at being elastic, Richards, I'll give you that. But you've made me angry and you....wouldn't like me when I'm ANGRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Reed's startled eyes, Titania became a Red She-Hulk, her fatty fist pounding into his head and knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania grinned and picked up the vacuum containing the KOed Susan Richards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join your wife for awhile Reed, you'll be seeing a lot more of each other when you both wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania started laughing then, a great, booming, victory laugh that would have been the envy of evildoers everywhere if she wasn't still panting from exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...this fat girl needs to take a breather. Then back to my special guests!\"</span></div></div>",

She had room to move only a few feet and took a step, her rubbery body bouncing against the floor of whatever structure she was in. Her foot sank into the rubbery material of her cell and Susan waited for Titania to reveal herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no monitor hung down, no heavy steps or doors opened to reveal her enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called out for anyone to answer her and received silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least for all of two minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally up, Incredible Fatso?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titania! What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to? Why nothing bad, I assure you. I just wanted you and your husband to have some quality time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My husband? What are you-\" but Susan stopped talking as she noticed the steady inhale and exhale of her chamber. \"Reed! What happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your husband is quite the blimp now Susan. I hope you appreciate the irony. He had to eat for two whole days to get to the size he is now and putting you in there was no easy task for his mouth, elastic though it may be. And speaking of elastic, I recommend you don't try and blow up too much in your elastic form. He's pretty full as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, who changed into her flesh and blood form after Titania's warning, tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard machinery moving outside and then saw a light appear, no doubt Reed's mouth being forced open, a funnel appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Susan, we're going to fill up your husband even more. It's quite painful. At least I think it is, he was screaming in pain a few hours ago. You should know what to do if you don't want him to suffer while we fill him up yet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilk soon started flowing down that funnel and Susan was worried that it was from Iron Maiden. Still there was only one way to find out. Cupping a bit of it, she took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCool, creamy, but no fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Susan had no time to relax, as she noticed the milk had already covered her fat foot. So, grabbing the funnel, Susan did the only heroic thing she could at the moment: she shoved the funnel into her own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Titania listened as she heard swallowing, much different from Reed's own, and grinned. Signaling to Moonstone, the driver of the truck, Titania waited with baited breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone pressed a button, the funnel now drawing milk from another tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Reed, Susan had noticed the slowing of the flow but it lasted only a moment. Thinking nothing of it, she resumed swallowing as much milk as she could until she felt it. The fullness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she felt something else besides that...she felt...compelled to drink more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening as she realized Titania's scheme, Susan tried to pry her mouth away but it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Maiden's milk mixed with Yellowjacket's pollen had trapped her. Reed was too stuffed with both his wife and food to be anything but a round sphere, no matter how much he tried to move or speak and inside him his wife grew fatter and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of yards beyond the stuffed sphere of Reed Richards and the steadily growing prisoner that was his wife, Ben Grimm opened his eyes, moaning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was pressing on him and when he realized what it was, the Thing tried to back away but even his great strength was useless against the mountain of pastries he was buried under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had to be over ninety tons of baked goods on top of him if he couldn't move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of someone eating, Ben looked over and saw She Hulk, her body the skinniest Ben had seen since she started being a sumoheroine. But as he craned his neck, he saw She Hulk's huge gut and bulging buttocks as she crammed pastry after pastry into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was grunting at Ben, motioning with her hands as best she could despite the fact that they were growing fatter by the minute. Ben caught on and sighed, knowing she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way out was to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a pastry, Ben bit into it, stuffing his face to aid his friend the only thing he could do in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny awoke in a new tank of milk, the fullness having subsided. He opened his mouth to call for aid when some of the milk managed to trickle in. Once again the fullness returned and the Torch kept his mouth shut for once in his life as he felt more milk enter the tank from above, Johnny frantically trying to keep his head above water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive moaned as she woke up, Black Widow calling her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright, I think,\" Miss Massive said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no you're really not,\" Nightshade's voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Massive and Black Widow tried to get to their feet but were stopped by a butt bump from Lady Sumo, who had been standing behind the women the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and dizzy, both sumoheroines almost made it to their feet before a pair of flabby arms embraced them in a hug and more importantly, embraced their faces directly under both of those huge armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat was breathed in through both women's noses and the arms kept them there for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after half an hour, and both sumo heroes almost passed out, the arms released them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir minds were no longer their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshade beamed at her two new slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Massive, turn yourself into a balloon and float up until you hit the highest point in this place. Then make yourself crash to the ground under your weight. When you wake up from that, do it again and again, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress,\" Miss Massive moaned in pleasure, swiftly doing what Nightshade ordered, the sumo woman now a fat balloon floating to the ceiling, still a hundred feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you Wobbly, do you see that hole?\" Wobbly turned her fat body around and indeed saw a huge hole, large enough for a hundred Wobbly Webspinners to fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Jump down in that hole and web yourself up, becoming so fat that you'll be stuck down there, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbly nodded and jumped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole was twenty feet deep but luckily Wobbly's big butt saved her from injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was cushioned, Wobbly spun her webs, cocooning herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Wobbly didn't grow fat in one big gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead some heroic part of Wobbly's subconscious added one pound at a time, fulfilling Nightshade's order to get fat, but at Wobbly's own pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA similar part of Miss Massive's now light head was taking it's sweet time raising Miss Massive up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was all the resistance they could offer and with each foot of height or pound gained, they were still dooming themselves.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But her paw was grabbed by the Frightful Sumo and Greer was lifted up, out of the water, and towards a massive breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nipple was forced past her lips and the milk flowing into her already stuffed belly expanded it even further, Greer meowing in pain from her stuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, don't worry kitten, just relax and enjoy your final stuffing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it, she had actually defeated the Sumo Six, humiliating them at the same time, as viewers all over the world had seen their fate as it happened live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlapping her big belly, Titania gave a roaring laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it would have been a selection at the villain Oscar's if her laugh wasn't cut off halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this interruption was the large hole blasted into the side of the bakery, two fat shadows soon revealing themselves to be...</span></div></div>",

Flying over to Greer, who was still too full to change out of her kitten form, Wasp gave Fat Cat a belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreer's belly was still a hindrance and would take some time to recede even an inch, so for the moment she was the pet of the team, not that she minded that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk and The Thing had no muscle on them anymore, She Hulk balking a bit at the training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still plenty strong!\" She Hulk whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Fatdusa poked She Hulk's massive body, the finger sinking into entire feet of fat coated by She Hulk's green skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the Sumo Six, She Hulk was the fattest, weighing six tons, all of it fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing was five tons, his fat gut almost a match for Reed's round proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny was being comforted by Crystal on one of the large couches Reed had made, the Human Torch not that heavy, only possessing a gut and a rounder butt, but he was ashamed for not being able to save his sister and the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal hugged him, his body sinking into her combination of flab and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo cheer him up, she farted out an element light show, Johnny smiling for the first time in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Reed and Susan's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed was now two tons and still possessed a largely spherical shape, with his arms and legs mostly useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Reed, we'll get through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed merely nodded, staring at the mound of fat that was his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any muscle left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan shook her head sadly, patting her huge gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All flab I'm afraid. And I can't...I can't change into my rubber form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed's eyes met hers then and he embraced her as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have this image of you in pain, getting rounder and rounder and my body refuses to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan...I'm going to join you in your sumo training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's eyes widened at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I need it if I ever want to slim down to help Janet. Also if I ever want to properly embrace you again, I should get below a ton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan laughed at that and hugged him as best as she was able. Reed's arms were still at his sides and his embrace earlier was merely rubbing his big belly against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan started to sweat from the effort of hugging him and she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need it to,\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two huge bellies roared and the fat couple blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get something to eat first,\" Susan said, Reed agreeing with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, give me five pushups,\" Medusa ordered. Susan, body slick with sweat and panting, was clad only in a fundoshi, the traditional sumo fashion, and managed to get to her fat knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was at two tons, losing weight thanks to a slimmer Reed managing to invent a device that aided the body in slimming up, but found most actions still incredibly tiring. And five pushups were something she had never tried before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\" Susan said, sweat pouring in buckets now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tw-\" but Susan's fat arms failed her and she sunk to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're running two laps around the building,\" Medusa said to the large woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan groaned and got to her feet, waddling towards the super sized elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk wasn't training. Instead, she was sitting on her wider butt, eating junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa glared as she got Jennifer slacking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! No more junk food! You will only be eating rice from now on! Now go join Susan  and run ten laps around the building!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Hulk whined at first but Medusa's stomach fat turned into a snarling monster, roaring at the green fatty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, She Hulk somehow got to her feet, and waddled after her team leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp, Wobbly Webspinner, Miss Massive, and Tigra were her best students, Medusa thought, turning to them. Most had built up the necessary muscles underneath their flab, the only exception being Tigra, who still lacked that muscle around her butt and belly, but was getting there. She had managed to turn back into her human form a month ago but was still used to being the pet of the group, something Wasp used as an excuse to treat Tigra whenever she wanted, slipping her dinner scraps under the table to the fat kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed was also coming along nicely, the scientist now able to make things again but decided to stay with sumo training as long as Susan did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting after his own latest jog around the building, he offered Medusa a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a break Reed. I know you want to go back into the lab and tinker around with things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Reed did just that, his fat jiggling as he waddled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was the fastest to regain his fighting ability, whether that was due to his rocky physique or his guts, whatever the reason, the only sign of fat on the Thing was a gut that refused to slim down. But since it didn't really bother him in fighting, he kept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Johnny and Crystal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal decided to help train the other Sumo Six, but only in an advisory capacity. Her older sister would be sure to succeed, Crystal was positive about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, Crystal, ironically, decided to soften up her sumo muscle into pure fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't alone in this. Johnny had decided to join her and the two could often be found in the living room, ever expanding butts parked on the couch, each plowing through piles of junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal had already ballooned up to two tons and Johnny was at three hundred pounds, a massive imbalance to be sure, but Crystal liked being the largest in the relationship. It gave her a strong sense of her own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her jog, with her friend She Hulk still having several laps to go, Susan waddled into the elevator and thought about that fateful day all those months ago when she decided to become a sumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had come full circle, as if karma had at first rewarded, then punished, then finally gave her her wish. Susan was going to be a proper sumo now and would make sure to curb her more gluttonous side, though the thought of an extra large deep dish pizza was calling to her, Susan ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the elevator had opened at the top floor, Susan grinned as she waddled towards her larger family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fat, a sumo, and happy and nothing could ever break the bonds she held with her friends and family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCastle Doom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix bloated, stuffed, and thoroughly defeated villains sat on a truly massive couch their flab rubbing against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor Von Doom strode into his newly renovated living room, his body larger than all of the Frightful Sumo's combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like this new punishment, ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Doom turned his back to them and lowered his titanic rear end, the shadow of his despotic butt looming over each sumo villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania gulped before Doom sat on them, knowing he would be back to his muscular body after he felt they had suffered this punishment enough. Then he would punish them again and again for the rest of their lives in twisted ways. Richards was his, Doom had explained their first night in his castle, his to toy with, his to transform, his to destroy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Doom ground his butt into the extra \"padding\" that was his seat, he ate some popcorn from a large bowl and watched television, laughing maniacally at the exploits of Tom and Jerry, his favorite cartoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So he released them, forbidding them from ever entering Latveria for the rest of their flabby lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach woman agreed, grateful to even be alive at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce safely back in New York, the team was still together, but now they mostly spent their days pigging out on junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, on a day eight months later, Titania stood up, massive body jiggling as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to have revenge on Susan and Reed for making us endure Dr. Doom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that, Gut, didn't you hear that Reed is off limits?\" Moonbelcher put in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Details, details, all we have to do is make sure he never finds out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach woman seemed skeptical at that plan but Titania's forceful personality and position as leader of the team eventually won them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first we need a few more members...\" Titania said, rubbing her fourth chin in contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo such new recruits were found a week later. Both were mutants but in appearance they were night and day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven Darkholme, or Mystique, was the first. Her blue skin, yellow eyes, and red hair all gave her an exotic air and her shapely form made even the straightest woman in the room take notice. The mutant shapeshifter agreed to take the pill after being promised a large cut of the profits from any ventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma Frost, also known as the White Queen, was next. Her long blond hair and icy demeanor were clear as she listened to Titania's plan. Rubbing a palm over her trim, well-formed abs, Emma didn't reply for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll join. But I want a few of those pills to change some annoying X Men after we're done with this mission, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania and the rest agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystique allowed Emma to go first and watched as The White Queen downed her pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight room shaking belches later, Emma had gone from the White Queen to The Obese Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most prominent part of Emma to gain was her butt, with her belly the next biggest. Rubbing her now enormous gut and butt, Emma slapped her fat a few times, enjoying the jiggling and ripples all over her seven hundred pound body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd that she didn't weight nearly as much as the others when they had changed but they overlooked it. Emma then felt something different about her powers and focused on her diamond form. But it wasn't diamond that Emma changed into. Instead, her whole form turned purple. You could actually see right through her. Reaching out a now goopy hand, Emma licked one of fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm...grape jelly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slammed her own hand hard into her gut, some of Emma splattering away from her. This chunk of Emma soon formed into a tiny version of Emma and Emma's own jelly body soon regained what it had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Emma said. Her mental powers were unchanged but this new form was fascinating. \"Call me Jelly Belly from now on,\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystique then took her pill and belched heartily for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was over, Mystique was eleven feet tall and much wider. With the fattest belly out of any of the women there and the largest butt as well, she was truly huge. Mystique estimated her body to now weigh close to a ton, the slightest movement sending wave after wave of flab into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing her powers, Mystique felt something different. Changing into Wolverine, she focused harder and soon enough adamantium claws escaped her hands. There was no pain. Changing again, Mystique became Emma Frost in her slim, original form, turning into diamond soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can now have the powers of the people I turn into and not just the appearance! Call me Massive Mystery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania grinned at her new team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need to change our name. We are no longer the Frightful Sumos! Instead we are the Terrible Tubbies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere on the Mediterranean Sea, aboard the SS Fatty, Susan Storm shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong honey?\" Reed asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were now around four hundred pounds of fat and grateful for the added mobility, enjoying a cruise through Greece and Italy that should take three months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just felt cold, nothing to be worried about,\" Susan replied, though deep down she had a foreboding about the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as Janet rose to her tiny feet, she ran over to a large bowl of mashed potatoes and shoved her face in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Sumo watched as Janet's butt expanded even more, wedging the sumo hero into the bowl. Giving a booming laugh, Lady Sumo slapped her gut and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the best sumo wrestler of all time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she had already defeated Wasp twenty times in a sumo match, ensuring her constant stuffing for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Lady Sumo liked seeing the defiance in Wasp's eyes as her own body betrayed her, constantly stuffing her face as her butt and belly grew larger and larger every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Wasp would be a helpless ball of blubber, too fat to do much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightfat had two sumo heroines under her thrall, those being Miss Marvel and Black Widow. She had actually injected them with her sweat, ensuring that they both remained constantly forced to do what she said. Nightfat knew both were keenly aware of what they were doing but were powerless to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to modifications provided by Dr. Doom, Black Widow now had eight spider legs to move around with and a bulbous behind that could secrete fattening webbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Miss Marvel received her own modifications, her body rounder, like a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently both sumo heroes were stuffing the other's face, Nightfat having ordered them to act like lesbians while doing so, enjoying the sight as the spider woman and the balloon woman kissed after stuffing their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in the actual living quarters of the sumo villians, Johnny Storm and Crystal had been turned into gluttons, both seeking to outdo the other thanks to a little mental reprogramming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal's gut actually touched the floor of the room they were in, even though she was sitting on the blue \"couch\" that had once been Reed Richards. All three were aware of themselves but unable to do anything. Reed was often fed by Crystal and Johnny when the two took a break to rest their stuffed bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wasn't far away from the three of them but was unable to do anything save blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the Frightful Sumo's had turned Ben into a living statue. Everyday he had to watch the two gluttons pig out on top of the piece of furniture that used to be his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another corner of the house, Iron Maiden pet her house cat, Tigra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Tigra was also changed. A collar was around her fat neck, the piece of metal impossible to remove. Whenever Iron Maiden wished it, Tigra would become either a kitten, her tiger form, or her regular human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Tigra was in her human form, suckling at Iron Maiden's breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Tigra was in her kitten form, belly rounding out as more and more of the milk entered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowing in pain, Tigra lashed out with a paw, drawing some blood from Iron Maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad Kitty!\" Iron Maiden chastised. \"Now go eat all the food in your bowl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTigra's body moved against her will, padding towards the kitchen and the massive steak that was her meal. Though her belly already felt full, Tigra was made to eat because of the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching, Tigra returned to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonbelcher was in charge of Medusa, the former Queen of the Inhumans know dressed in nothing but a large diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty!\" Medusa said with a lisp, pointing towards the still munching Tigra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is a kitty. Now are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa nodded and Moonbelcher gave her a large bottle. Once Medusa had drunk her fill, Moonbelcher picked her up and belched her, Medusa soon going to sleep, her true self watching these events with horror from the deepest recesses of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good baby,\" Moonbelcher cooed to the sleeping, infantile, sumo hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania yawned, knowing that it had been a long day, and she needed her rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling towards her bedroom, she opened the door, spying her massive bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was blue and wobbled as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titania...\" the bed moaned, revealing itself to actually be Susan Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Susan.\" She then jumped onto her bed, Susan groaning in pain, her flab wobbling to and fro, the useless stubs that were her arms and legs jiggling helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't won,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now? And what can you possibly do to stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other heroes will come. They won't let us vanish without a trace and then-\" but Titania ground her butt into the general area of Susan's mouth, the bed forced silent by the flab grinding into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned for several minutes, until Titania spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had beans for lunch Susan, did I tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later a loud fart blasted all over Susan's face, the sumo heroine/bed helpless against the stench, passing out, and wishing that she had never gotten hooked into sumo all those months ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The heroes of the world, those that were still slim enough to fight back, were still around sure, but were all underground, hiding as much from the people they normally protected as well as Titania's fatty villain troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaskmaster, still slim and muscular, in fact possibly the only individual who was nowadays, was in charge of training all these troops, not that hard for the mercenary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there Titanic Gut had managed to get the best sorcerers to mask the Earth from cosmic forces for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich led her to today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes from the pleasant dreams she had had, Titanic Gut greeted the day with a bout of morning flatulence, the methane absorbed by her bed, formerly just Susan Storm, now a melded together bed consisting of Susan Storm and Reed Richards, the two heroes heads at the end of said bed, moaning in agony at the stench. It was a somewhat macabre sight, those two heads with their massively fat cheeks and agonized eyes, but it didn't bother Titania at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlopping onto her huge belly, Titania wiggled over to Susan's head, belching in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Susan! You and your hubby are such a good bed for my fat ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither replied but Titania smirked anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on her feet, Titania listened to the status report from her various spies and informants around the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the briefing, she waddled to the kitchen, eager for a sumo-sized breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, the best way for any villain to start their day was with a delicious meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After eating a breakfast large enough to befit the ruler of the world Titanic Gut decided to go check on how the rest of her prisoners, the remaining members of the Sumo Six were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to that question was either terribly bad, or terribly well depending upon if you were interested in their well being or their progress towards becoming completely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreer Grant, AKA Fat Cat was now permanently mode locked into her large tiger from.  It had become so flabby that her puffy paws couldn\u2019t touch the ground and instead she just lay their on her bloated belly day in day out, her tail twitching awkwardly back and forth every now and again.  Her neck had grown so puffy and fat that she couldn\u2019t even turn it enough to properly aim her fattening hairballs, meaning that the flabby feline was harmless as a kittens o long as you approached her from any angle other than straight on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Fat Cat got of \u201clightly\u201d compared to some of the others.  Carol Danvers AKA Miss Massive had now completed the transformation that Titanic Gut had started her on not long after capturing her.  The Sumo Heroine was now no longer a person, but instead a brightly colored black balloon with a golden thunderbolt symbol on it.  It bobbed around Titanic Gut\u2019s liar lazily, with no head, face, arms or legs, Carol didn\u2019t need to eat or breath in this form which was just as well since it would have been next to impossible for her to do so.  She was nothing but an extra large weather balloon or very small zeppelin that lazily drifted from the floor to the ceiling and back again, not to mention being frequently tossed about by Titanic Gut and the others like a beachball at a concert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbly Webspinner had become just as bloated and disgusting as most real life spiders.  Also like most spiders, she now no longer left her webs, just laying their supported by her own strands of fattening spider silk, growing bigger all the time.  In another decade or so she might grow too heavy for even her own webs to keep her aloft and then she\u2019d probably crash to the ground and just lay there, too unused to moving to even try to scuttle about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet Van Dyne AKA Bumblebee was now effectively queen of her hive.  From her large (for an insect at least) waist down she was mired in some special sticky extra fattening honey unable to leave it no matter how hard she tried.  She was however waited on hand and foot by a small army of mechanical worker drones that saw to it that even if she wasn\u2019t in the mood to snack on her scale shattering honey she\u2019d be stuffed with other formes of food as well, growing larger and larger with each passing day, even though the small scale of her body meant she might only gain ounces where others gained dozens of pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally there was Titanic Gut\u2019s old nemesis Jennifer Walters AKA She Bulk, or She Pig as the case might be.  Like Fat Cat her belly had grown so large that her bloated pig hooves couldn\u2019t touch the ground and so now she just chiefly laid around oinking pathetically and sticking her nose into her feet trough in order to eat more and grow even larger.  Oh yes, the Sumo Six now amounted to one half of Titanic Gut\u2019s throne, two overfed pets, a pair of blobby bugs, and a completely mindless swollen sphere.  Titanic Gut looked forward to seeing them be able to try  and rise up against her any time soon with handicaps like those to weigh them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But as much fun as this check up with her first conquests was, Titania's mind soon turned to the newest additions in her fattening stable. Bidding her former enemies adieu, Titania waddled her way to an express elevator and traveled down towards a more high tech area of her fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, past hundreds of feet of triple reinforced titanium, vibranium, and just plain rock, was the prisoner testing areas. Scientists and guards busied their way outside the cells but all saluted as Titania waddled by. Returning the salute though she was panting at the action of raising her flabby arm, Titania soon moved past them and into a cell holding her two newest captures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first that caught her eye was Felicia Hardy aka the Black Cat. However Titania had had her scientists inject a formula into Felicia's body that made her cells secrete something vastly different from the Super Solider serum derivative that had given Black Cat her powers. This something was chocolate milkshake, Felicia's body now saggy and incredibly fat all over, as her digestive system quickly converted all of those empty milkshake calories into fat, ensuring Felicia's helplessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as her body expanded a bit more, Felicia glared at Titania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't...ugh...get away with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please sweetie, I've heard that from stronger fatties than you. Now just lay there and get fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud belch came from the other end of the cell. There, strapped to a chair bolted to the floor, was X-23, or Laura Kinney, the female clone of Wolverine. The belch was the only word she was able to get out before a robotic hand shoved the long neck of a beer bottle down her throat. Thanks to Laura's healing factor, she couldn't get drunk. But the healing factor was not enough to protect her from gaining weight and since Titania had first strapped X-23 to that chair a week ago, the mutant had gained two hundred pounds, nearly every bit of it in her huge gut, the round orb a literal beer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer to X-23, Titania had the robots stop filling her up for the moment and the sumo villain rubbed the huge beer gut of her captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My oh my, look at this cute little tummy you have Laura! It has so much more room to grow and I'm sure you'll look adorable with another ton or two on you!\" She then moved her gaze lower and pinched Laura's slightly chubby butt. \"This poor thing needs some help to get nice and big, yes it does,\" Titania cooed. \"I'll have some of my men inject a nice little cocktail into that butt of yours and soon it'll be just as big as your gut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...URPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP...kill you bitch!\" Laura yelled defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitania yawned at the threat and instead picked up a huge beer bottle, swiftly opening it and making Laura drink all of it in one go before having the robots take over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gulp...Gulp...Gulp...\" went Laura's throat, unable to do anything but drink thanks to the injection one of Titania's scientists had given her when she was first captured. Titania observed for a few more moments as Laura's gut increased the tiniest amount, Titania smiling once she noticed and petting the gut like it was her favorite pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good belly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However there was something Kitty failed to think about as she phased through the next wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty Pryde had a habit of sweating, especially when she was exerting her now two hundred pound body.

Instantly both her bra and sweat pants began to quiver as if silently wondering to themselves just what could possibly be worse than the humiliation that had already been forced upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitantic Gut removed Reed and Sue, snapping the former across the room like an oversized rubber band.  She wasn't at all abashed by being naked at the moment since after all her own namesake drooped down in front of her nether regions when she stood up.  As she did so both Susan and Reed managed to return to their human forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly that was all the super slobs were capable of.  After spending so much time as pieces of furniture and clothing for Titanic Gut their muscles had atrophied greatly leaving them weak as kittens.  It took all the strength they could muster just to stay standing as they remained utterly helpless before Titanic Gut like a pair of human sized jello molds quivering and bouncing in fear and failed attempts to move about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supreme supervillianess waddled up to the pair of them slowly as if savoring the looks of absolute fear and helplessness both of them were sporting.  She then pulled a hose from a wall and stuck it in Reed's mouth before turning it on.  There was a loud \"THUNK\" as Reed's gut grew big enough to slam against the ground.  \"WHUNK\" then came his ass cheeks also having outgrown his legs.  In fact Reed Richards seemed to be simply out and out outgrowing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly grew larger and larger with every passing moment absorbing first his arms and legs, then his hands and feet, and finally while a turly pathetic look played upon his face, even his head vanished beneath the rolls of flab.  Medusa pulled the hose out of the mass of dark blue flesh and smiled as she slapped it watching it bounce around like a well tuned violin string.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what I've done with your chubby hubby Susy?  I just gave hima  years worth of the slop I've been pumping She Pork full of, he's now not even a human being anymore just a gigantic lump of lard that I can use as a bed, couch, table, or even a prison since people weaker than me would never be able to pry their way free from his blubbery belly, he'd be like a gigantic marhsmellow straightjacket!\"  Then Titanic Gut began to approach Susan who in a feet of truly heroic effort managed to take a single step away from her before collapsing on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitantic Gut laughed long and hard at this show of utter impotence on Sue's part before grabbing her with both arms and lifting her up into the air.  \"Don't worry Immobile Woman, you aren't going to end up a faceless blob like Mr. Flabtastic, I have something else in mind for you.\"  She stuck the hose into Sue's mouth and gave it a quick squeeze.  A moment later Susan who had previously only been 400 or so pounds doubled her weight puffing outwards like an overstuffed plush toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitanic Gut then grabbed Susan's hands and squeezed.  Her fingers already painfully plump were crushed completely under the force of Titantic Gut's grip  and remolded into one solid lump.  Then holding Sue upside down the supervilianess did the same thing to her feat.  After this she drove a powerful elbow into Susan's back and dropped her to the ground.  Out of instinct Susan threw out her limbs to land as best she could and was shocked when she discovered she'd landed on four hooves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Suzy you're gonna be a piggy just like your friend Jennny....\"  Titanitc Gut grabbed Susan's ears and stretched them out into flppy big versions of themselves.  She hooked two huge fingers in Susan's nostrils and forced her nose up adn spread it out into a pig snout.  She grabbed Susan's ass and stretched it out to give her a pigs tail and then delivered a powerful kick to her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan helplessly bounced down the side of the pit that the former She Hulk was kept in and landed face first in as trough of super fattening brain deadening slop.  She looked over at what remained of her teammate Jeniffer Walters.  Jen now looked even more like a pig than Sue did, the only thing even vaugely human about her was her green hair.  Then to her horror, Susan found her neck lowering itself and starting to scoff up even more of the slop her belly growing ever bigger as a mindless oink echoed from Jen's lips.</span></div></div>",

As if to prove her point, she placed a trough of slop in front of the two former heroes, who within seconds of seeing the slop proceeded to stuff their faces full of the liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of gluttony, the two pigs were interrupted from their mindless bliss when the trough was taken out of reach. The two heroes tried to follow the slop as it was slowly moved out of reach, with Sue lasting a little longer due to her elastic powers. Soon even Sue\u2019s elastic powers could not reach the food. Soon the two could only groan in frustration as they had long since passed the threshold of mobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet down you two,\u201d Titanic Gut commanded, giving the two heroes a hard slap on their huge bellies, with each producing a wave of giggle. While the massive fat of their bodies took the brunt of the impact, the waves it produced on their bodies was very uncomfortable resulting in a few groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want more of the slop, you will follow my instructions,\u201d Gut decreed. At this point the two basically needed the slop as they were comply addicted to the liquid, so the promise of slop quickly caused the former heroes to shut their mouths. \u201c Much better, now be quiet and behave yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pigs found themselves being picked up by their captor, slowly being moved to the far side of the room. As they were faced back towards the pit, they were not completely certain where they were headed. Sue vaguely recalled the that the direction they were headed was where she was positioned when she a bed, but wasn't certain what had replaced her. They would soon find out as despite their massive weight, they were being carried quiet quickly across the room. As fat as Titanic Gut had gotten, she seemed to have only gotten stronger with this weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue\u2019s guess was correct as they arrived at Gut\u2019s new bed. Sue found herself being placed down first on right side of the bed. As soon as Sue landed on the bed a small groan could be heard, which only got louder after She Hulk was placed on the bed. Finally after Gut sat between her two pigs which in response caused the bed made a loud whimper, clearly not used to the massive weight being placed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress, it\u2019s too heavy,\u201d cried Titanic\u2019s new bed, which turned out to be Felicia Hardy also known as Black Cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sue had become her newest pet pig, the super villain was left without a place to sleep. Not one to simply buy a normal bed and always wanting to give a little punishment to her foes, she decided to simply make another bed. Thankfully a certain burglar was in detainment right now, being made into a massive blob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief wasn't previously a big enemy of Titanic Gut in the past, but the foolish girl had tried to  rob the massive fortune the Sumo Six had acquired from their conquest of the world. The girl was very talented as she did make it all the way to the vault, but her success ironically lead to her demise. While she did avoid the normal security, she could not stop the constant flow of gas that was slowly expanding her figure. Despite this development she knew that this might be her only chance, so she pushed on forwards. By the time she reached the vault, the once nimble burglar was very bloated. Not accustomed to her new weight, when she finally got in the vault she accidentally stumbled into one of the sensor leading to the closure of the vault and the release of knock out gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia was quickly brought to the lab for study of the super serum that coursed though her veins. The study however quickly turned into pay back for the attempted theft, after the group had learned of this intruder. A formula was injected which made her cells secrete a substance that had the constancy of a chocolate milkshake. The empty calories were quickly absorbed into her body, which quickly converted into fat. She helplessly watched her own body be used against her as she slowly inched towards immobility. When Gut had come to retrieve her one day she was hopeful, believing the villain had finally gotten bored with her and planned to release her. Little did she know her fate was much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was horrified when she found out her future, was being a piece of furniture for her insane captor. For the first few months she tried to rebel against Titanic, but was met with similar punishments that Sue had received. After some time she became passive towards her jailer, especially after she was shown what had become of Sue and She-Hulk, letting her know her fate could have been much worse. All the while her cells continued to fatten her up, quickly losing what mobility she had left. Eventually Black Cat gave up resisting completely, submitting herself to the desires of her new mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gut had seen Felicia\u2019s will was broken, the villain became a lot nicer to her new bed. Her cells were changed back to no longer constantly fatten her up. Also punishments for disobedience were replaced with rewards for obedience, such as delicious treats to munch on, the occasional belly rubs, and when the mistress was in the mood some good old fashion love making. Life had gotten pretty good, except for now as she felt like she was being crushed under the combined weight of the three massive women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold on my comfortable bed, just endure this quietly for a little bit and I will give you an extra special reward,\u201d Titanic promised as she reached for her remote control. After receiving an affirmative nod from Felicia, she hit the button to start a broadcast to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings my loyal subjects,\u201d declared Titanic Gut, sporting a big smirk. \u201cIt has come to attention that some of you are helping the rebels who seek to dispose of me. I\u2019m not sure why you are doing such a foolish act, but let me remind you who you are dealing with. See these two blobs next to me, this is what remains of the two known as She-Hulk and Susan Storm. This is what happens to people who oppose me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019m willing to be merciful on this matter,\u201d Gut continued after a small pause. \u201cIf you turn over the location or any information on these rebels you will be pardoned, but if your continue on this path you will suffer my wraith.\u201d To illustrate her power, she grabbed her two pigs and easily lifted them into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to the rebels that I\u2019m sure are watching this announcement consider this a warning,\u201d threatened the villain, lowering the two heroes back onto the bed. \u201cTurn yourself in now and I may let you off with a small punishment, but continued deviance may land you in similar position as these two. Who knows maybe I can come up with even better punishments in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo all my loyal subjects the same goes as usual, rewards are given to those who give any information regarding rebels to my authorities,\u201d the villain stated with a lighter tone. \u201cOn a quick side note, a new flavor of trans bar should be hitting shelves within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that. That concludes my announcements for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the villain switched off the video stream. True to her word she moved the She-Hulk and Sue back to their pen, where a bigger trough full of the mind numbing slob was waiting for the two. The heroes squealed in excitement as they went to town, devouring their reward. Titanic Gut then returned to Black Cat, ready to give her loyal bed a reward as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a nice job as usual my pet,\u201d complimented Titanic. \u201cFor your excellent service over the past months, I decided to get you a special treat. Red would you join us please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps could be heard as a surprisingly thin red haired woman entered the room. The woman in question was Mary Jane, who was recently captured trying to protect the hero known as Spider-Man. While normally this would have lead to a very fattened model, the Sumo Six had found themselves desiring a maid to clean up their lair. With the help of a little mind control, Mary Jane was happy to provide them this service. Of course she would not be a very good maid if she was transformed into an immobile blob like the other prisoners, so she was mostly left alone. Titania however couldn't help but have a little fun with the girl, giving her a massive ass and adding more mass to her already impressive breasts. With the small outfit they provided her, one might mistake her for a stripper rather then a maid. With a sultry walk she was instructed to do, she quickly made her way over to her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Felicia I know you are quiet lonely in here when I'm out,\u201d Titanic Gut admitted. \u201cI\u2019m also well aware you and this girl have some history, so I'm making her your new companion. Red you are deeply in love with Black Cat and will follow any commands she gives as long as they present no harm to the Sumo Six. You will report to this room everyday after you have finished your daily duties. Is that clear?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, mistress,\" Mary Jane dully replied, as her mind processed these new orders. Her demeanor quickly changed from a blank expression to a one full of lust as she stared at her new lover. After receiving a nod of encouragement from Titanic Gut, she jumped onto the bed making her way up Felicia's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you mistress, that is very kind of \u2026,\u201d Black Cat started to say, before she was interrupted by a pair of lips smacking into hers. Not content with only a kiss, Mary Jane proceeded to play with the bed\u2019s pillows also known as Felicia\u2019s enormous breasts. The maid\u2019s skills were making Black Cat\u2019s libido to spike, causing her to return the kiss in full force. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The phasing mutant had grown fat just like all of Titanic Gut's captives, but that hadn't been the only change that she had gone through.  Her brown hair had lengthened considerably, and her body had sprouted thick black fur as her hands and feet turned into paws and her face elongated into a somewhat feline muzzle.  She'd been stripped of her full body suit and now wore more of a yellow bikini style outfit, which ironically when mixed with her fur meant that she managed to keep the same color balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the weight of her belly pulling her bloated belly pulling her forward Kitty was incapable of standing up straight, meaning she needed to waddle along on all fours, and even then her bloated belly would frequently bounce up and down against the ground.  Bouncing was something that Kitty did very well since Titanic Gut had also had some of her prized pudgy prisoner Susan Storm's DNA added to the mix making Shadowfat much bouncier than most \"normal\" women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight cat woman creature who Kitty had become was Titanic Gut's personal pet and she eagerly bounced to her Mistress' side once Titanic Gut entered the room, bumping herself up against the villainess' bloated belly causing her to giggle as the feline captive rebounded off of it and let loose with a girlish giggle of her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitanic Gut smiled to see a once proud superheroine so fully transformed into a pudgy animalistic parody of herself.  Of course the question she could never quite be certain of was just how much of Kathrine Pryde remained with in the furry fat body of her new pet....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little did Titania know that the brainwashing was having a major effect on her feline pet. The process wasn't just making ShadowFat loyal to her new mistress, it was also rewiring the former X-Men\u2019s mind to accept this new reality. As far as the pet was concerned, she had always been in this feline state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKatherine Pride\u2019s earliest memory is when she was adopted into the loving home of the Charles Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. The family of mutants had long wanted a pet to make the students feel more at home and young Ms Pride fit the bill perfectly. While initially tense about her new home, her nerves were put to ease from an assault of gentle scratches and pets. She turned out to be adored by all the X-Men, with even grumpy Wolverine seeming to have a soft spot for the young girl. She was especially popular among three of the female members of the X-Men team known as Dazzler, Jubilee and Jean Grey. She fondly remembered playing fun games of chase Dazzler\u2019s light power, Jubilee grooming her fur and snuggling at night with Jean. As much as she loved her new mistress, her heart still wished to go back to those pleasant times. Sadly the cat knew this was impossible to go back to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer last memory of her wonderful mansion life was a bitter one. She was woken from her nap by the screams of students running past her and sounds of explosions in the distance. The chaos only frightened the poor girl, who curled up in one of the corners of the room as she watched students rush by. Thankfully Storm noticed Kitty huddled in the corner, picking her up as she made her way out of the building. As they ran away from the campus grounds, Kitty watched in horror as students were scattering all over the place from the collapsing manor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen they finally reach safety, she heard the full story of what had transpired at the mansion. An evil organization of super villains had attacked the mansion in search of cerebro. The device could be used by a telepath to locate mutants or even specific individuals if the user was powerful enough. While the cerebro system couldn't be moved away from the mansion in time, the professor knew the organization had no telepaths that were capable of using such a device. So rather then try to fight a battle they would most likely not win, it was decided to try to evaluate the school and keep their telepaths out of the villain\u2019s reach. Small teams of two to three students were grouped to escape the manor together in order to cause enough chaos to hide the powerful telepaths of the X-Men such as Psylocke, Emma Frost and Jean Grey. Storm had no idea if the plan succeeded as communications were deemed too risky with the enemy monitoring. For the most part the two were on their own for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA couple days after the attack, the two tired and hungry girls found themselves among a group of fellow heroes. While Kitty napped, Storm learned a lot about the events of the Frightful Six and the fate of the Sumo Six. Not wanting to leave any of her colleagues to suffer, Storm volunteered to do recon for a rescue attempt of the captured heroes. Storm reluctantly took Kitty along on the dangerous mission, as she did not want to leave her alone among strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe mission quickly turned south as Ms Pride found herself all alone, having no idea what had happened to Storm. Before she could fret too much, she was found by her new owner Titania. While she was initially frightened by the sumo sized woman, her worries were squashed from a few well placed scratches. After hearing about the girl\u2019s plight, Titania promised that she would help find her friends. In the meantime she offered a new home to live in, which her friends were welcome to join when they were found. Kitty accepted the kind offer, which honestly sounded too good to be true.<br>\r\n\tWhen they arrived at Titania\u2019s lair Ms Pride was delighted to find out that she was an amazing owner, giving the young kitten everything she could need. A soft bed, playmates, scratches and tons of food were at her disposal. The food Ms Pride had taken full advantage of becoming quite plump, but she couldn't help herself. The food was so delicious and she was almost always quite hungry. The thought of food reminded her belly that it could go for another round, letting off a loud growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy my, whose a hungry kitty,\u201d Titania teased while rubbing the pet\u2019s belly. Kitty purred at the soft and relaxing touch. \u201cLet us get you some nice milk to fill you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTitania instructed Katherine to follow her to Iron\u2019s Maiden room for some nice thick milk to fill her belly. However when the two entered Maiden\u2019s room they found the villain sleeping soundly with her pet Gneer following suit on her enormous gut. Not wanting to wake her comrade from her nap, she decided to head to the kitchen to use the other milk tank Lyja. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tLyja is a skrull giving her the ability to shape shift forms. She decided to try to use this power to infiltrate the Frightful Sixes\u2019 lair to attempt to rescue her on and off romantic interest Johnny Storm. Unfortunately for her disguises can only get you so far, as she didn't know the proper security procedure to get past the guards. Having dealt with a few breakthroughs of heroes in the past, the security team had developed a genius safeguard against disguised intruders. The guards would never ask for any identification, but they were trained to look for a rotation of special signals. Since Lyja failed to present any form of signal, the guards knew she wasn't a loyal servant and slyly redirected her to a detainment room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen it was discovered that Lyja was no ordinary human mutant, she was quickly brought to the science team. After doing some research on the stolen Fantastic Four network, they discovered that the subject was a member of the Skrull Empire. The team also got a glimpse of how the shape shifting worked and the limitations of only being able to extend 1.5 of the Skrull\u2019s original mass. Some additional files were also found of previous encounters with the species, one case being where agents pretended to be the Fantastic Four. After the agents were caught they were punished by making them transform into human cows and hypnotizing themselves to believe they were always as such. Titania found this bit of information hilarious, deciding this was to be the fate of their prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter Lyja was properly bound, she was fed a modified version of the brain numbing slop for a couple reasons. Lyja was a Skrull solider who went through a vigorous training program, making her will very strong. Her mind would first need to be weakened so the program could properly brain wash the green girl. The second reason was that Skrull shape shifting abilities are limited to the amount of mass they originally have. This means that a Skrull with more weight would be granted extra materials to transform with. Lastly a new modification to the slob would make the subjects body start to produce milk for lactation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter her mind began to muddle and her body plumped up, the science team started to play the hypnotic program. Slowly but surely this weakened the Skrull\u2019s resistance until it was non existent as the woman started mooing like crazy. As her mind started to accept that she was a cow, her body started to match what she believed she now looked like. Her boobs started to swell, an udder formed, followed by horns pointing from her head, until finally she was hundred percent cow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTitania who found the process very funny, rushed off to show off her latest project. She ran into MoonBelcher near her room but the villain seemed to be busy with something so she left her be. Iron Maiden on the other hand was more than willing to check out her amusing work. After getting a good laugh at the green woman\u2019s misfortune, Iron Maiden had a request for the prisoners fate. Tigra\u2019s hunger was only growing and her boobs could only take so much sucking a day. So Maiden wanted to know if they could use their new cow to help provide milk. Titania accepted Maiden\u2019s suggestion as she saw no harm in it, though they would need to make a few modifications. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey certainly couldn't have a literal cow next to all their food supplies in the kitchen. Extra brainwashing was required to make the girl follow orders from the Frightful Sumos, which allowed them to order the girl to transform to whatever they desire. With the green cow under there complete control, they started to shape her into the form she would spend a lot of her time in. For the most part she was back to her old self, all be it a 200 pound heavier version of herself. The major addition to her was the extra pair of massive breasts bellow her already insanely huge rack. Both sets of breasts were also made to constantly produce deliciously creamy milk for consumption. With their newest milk source all squared away, they made her a nice area on the kitchen to reside in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Titania with her pet rounded the corner to Lyra\u2019s stall, they found her enjoying the pleasure of the milking machines. A decent amount of Lyra\u2019s time was spend on these pumps, unless a Frightful Six member wanted to play around with her shape shifting powers. Just two days ago, Titania herself made the girl turn into a cowgirl hybrid with udders and horns. Now was not one of those times however, as she had a hungry kitty to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLyra my pet needs some of delicious milk, would you be a dear and feed her,\u201d asked Titania. After receiving a happy moo from the green women, she handed over Ms Pride to Lyra. Lyra positioned the former X-men almost as if she was her baby, before shoving her head into one of her breasts. As the hungry kitty happy started sucking down as much she could swallow, Lyra cried out in pleasure as her eyes rolled back. While the machines did a decent job pleasing her, the hands on experience was still way more rewarding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>        Titania decided that she wouldn't mind a drink of her own while her pet was happily filling up her belly. Deciding that some beer wouldn't be the worst right now, she made her way over to their container. After grabbing a huge mug, she turned the stoppers on both sides of the container to fill up her glass. The action seemed to have quiet the effect on the tank, as she started to moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOhhhh keep doing what you are doing it feels great,\u201d X-23(Laura) drunkly moaned. The goofy expression she sporting along with the slur in her words was all the proof of how smashed the girl was.\u201cI was so full before, the release feels so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tX-23 had been a difficult foe to capture, requiring multiple members of the team to subdue her.  Her capture had been difficult due her to residence to sleeping agents, super human stamina, good reflexes and determination to fight until she couldn't fight anymore. Thankfully for the team she was not immune to Nightfat\u2019s mind control abilities. After catching the girl off guard, the team held her down while NightFat moved in for the kill. With little time to react, X-23 was completely under NightFat\u2019s control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDue to NightFats huge role in X-23s capture, she would have ultimate say in deciding the girl\u2019s fate. Thinking that Laura took life way to seriously, she suggested that they should feed her some beers so she would lighten up. So after being carefully strapped down, X-23 was subjected to a machine force feeding her a constant flow alcohol. Laura had gained quite the beer gut after a week of non stop drinking, with it almost extending to the floor. Despite the massive gain, Laura did not show any sign of the alcohol effecting her. Deciding that they might need a lot more to surpass the girl\u2019s healing abilities, they decided to continue the feeding though not before Titania injected the girl with a special cocktail to help spread out the fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter about a month it was clear that they would have to use a different approach on the problem, though handling the girl had become a lot easier. After a month of non-stop chugging, X-23 had become massive. Her beer gut had exploded, easily touching the floor even if the poor girl could stand. Thanks to the special cocktail her ass had overflowed the chair multiple times, until they decided to just sit her on a large mat. Her breasts also had grow plump, almost now twice the size of her head. While Laura was now immobile, her weight gain had only fueled her anger as she continued to shout threats when she could sneak them in. Still though, the girl\u2019s healing factor keep her in a very sober state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTitania was about to give up on the project until NightFat came strolling in with a big grin on her face. NightFat apparently had one of her scientists work on a special project to try to overcome the girl\u2019s healing factor. After a month of hard work they finally had come up with a solution. The problem with the previous method was that X-23 simply couldn't drink fast enough to match her super-power enhanced liver\u2019s speed.  However if they skipped the middle man and had her body make the alcohol, they could generate a way larger quantity of alcohol a lot faster and easily overwhelm her system. The process would cause no harm to Laura\u2019s body as her healing factor would stop any permanent damage, but it wouldn't protect her from getting hammered from all the excess alcohol in her system. As a safely measure, when the alcohol reached a certain point it would be stored in her breasts and would act the same as breast milk. For extra good measure in the likely case that she was an angry drunk, they would also increase her sensitively and libido to try to sway her into a good mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe procedure took about an hour, but the results were definitely worth the time. As soon as Laura woke up she seemed very confused and a tad frightened from the unfamiliar feeling of the booze actually effecting her. After a couple minutes the alcohol seemed to take full effect as X-23 was sporting a big dopey grin, leading the villains to believe that she strangely was naturally a happy drunk. All that was left was to make sure the fail safes worked on the girl\u2019s breasts, leading NightFat to climb up the mound of X-23\u2019s gut fat to reach her boobs. NightFat began to stuck on the girl\u2019s rack, eventually being met with a splurge of delicious beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith everything in order, NightFat congratulated her science team on a job well done. As the science team left, Titania asked what she planned to do with her successful project. Nightfat admitted she hadn't really thought that far ahead, more focused on getting to this point first. Titania, who had just recently finished Lyra\u2019s transformation, suggested that a never ending supply of beer would be an excellent addition to their kitchen. The other villain agreed and with a little extra work, the Frightful Six had a new never ending beer cooler at their disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt definitely had been worth the trouble Titania thought as she sipped down her now full mug. Not only was the process very convenient as they didn't have to keep ordering more, but the beverage was one of the best she had ever tasted. As she filled up another round, the beer container seemed to have a question for the villain.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey I heard Black Cat and the red head maid are now an item,\u201d X-23 drunkly slurred, as her hands slowly massaged her breasts. \u201c When do I get my own personal playmate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmmm, I suppose you may deserve one. You have been pretty well behaved for a while now,\u201d replied Titania, as she starting playing with the girl\u2019s huge ass. \u201cDo you have anyone in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh I made loads of friends all over on my travels, I wouldn't mind seeing any of them again,\u201d Laura responded with a little more clarity. Draining her breasts helped balance out the girl\u2019s alcohol level, leaving her in a tipsy state for a little while until her body replaced the lost booze. \u201cI also wouldn't mind catching up with some X-men pals like Jubilee or fool around with Kitty over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore Titania could respond her transponder started ringing. As she opened the device she noticed it was her maintenance team calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey bb-boss, this is the rr-reactor team,\u201d stuttered one of her workers. From what it sounded like the poor girl must have been a newer recruit, as she was still absolutely terrified of the villains. While it was smart to fear them a little, most of the workers quickly learned that the group was pretty lenient and you had to seriously mess up to earn their wraith. \u201cWe need some help down in the reactor room if you have the chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCopy that I\u2019m on my way,\u201d Titania declared, heading down the hall until she heard liquid dripping on the floor. In her haste she had completely forgotten about closing up X-23 and finishing her conversation. Heading back over to X-23 she closed the clamps on her nipples back up, blocking the flow of booze that was slowly dripping on the floor. The action earned a loud whimper from the clone as her sensitive skin was set on fire. \u201cLaura, I\u2019ll see what I can manage but I won\u2019t promise anything. In meanwhile, Kitty why don't you show your old friend a good time after you finish up your snack.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>       As Titania rounded the corridor she noticed one of her scientists outside the generator room, nervously swaying while pretending to read her notepad. From a quick glance, Titania assumed this was a new employee, as she didn't remember hiring a girl with pink hair, though perhaps someone dyed their hair since the last time she had been down here. When the scientist heard Titania\u2019s booming steps, she immediately lifted her head from her notes and gave the titan an awkward hello wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tAfter seeing her face, Titania was certain this was a new recruit as she had never seen this cute puppy before. The female in question was very young, looking like she belonged on a college campus rather than a Villain\u2019s Lair. She was sporting a white lab coat which had her name tag on her left breast and a Frightful Six Emblem imprinted on her right breast. Speaking of breasts, the girl was very well endowed sporting a healthy double e breast size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Boss,\u201d the pink haired girl said in an uneasy voice. The sound made Titania return focus to the girls face, where a very bright blush was now visible. Apparently, Titania had not been subtle with her ogling, though when you are the queen of the entire world you don't really need to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think we have met before, I would never forget a pretty flower such as yourself,\u201d Titania replied. If the girl truly was a flower she would be a rose, as the compliment turned her bright red though left her a little disoriented. Amusing as it was watching the girl squirm around she did have other stuff to do today, so she started to make her way towards the lab. The dazed girl shook her head before starting to catch up to Titania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name is Rose,\u201d replied the girl, who seemingly recovered her senses. \u201cI\u2019m the college girl you guys took on to help improve your systems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, so you are the famed Rose my staff was telling me about,\u201d beamed Titania. Her recruiters did mention a new young member for her lab staff, but they failed to mention how cute she was. Definitely a matter she would bring up with them later. \u201cYou were the one who devised a way to improve on my reactors. I would love to hear your explanation of it at a later date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, actually speaking of reactors today was the day we were going to install the new upgrades,\u201d answered Rose who suddenly looked like the kid who got caught stealing from the cookie jar. \u201cHowever before we could finish we sorta had an accident\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat sort of accident,\u201d Titania warily stated as she entered the power station. She quickly got her answer as her normally clean and tidy generator room was a mess. Mechanical parts were scattered around the floor, which seemed to have originated from a very now broken crane. Not only that but her giant power cell, also known as the X-men Surge, currently was having her face smushed down on the floor by her own humongous body. Quickly putting two and two together the Titania could only let out a sigh. \u201cOh, that kind of accident.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, sorry boss, tubby over here put on way more than our poor crane could handle,\u201d apologized Sam, one of her senior staff memories at this station, who was walking towards the pair. \u201cCould you lend us a hand with PlasmaBlob over there while we finish installing the upgrades?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don't know it would be pretty amusing to watch you all try to lift her up,\u201d joked Titania. \u201cHowever I suppose not having power would be a real bummer. I will have to \u201cpunish\u201d someone for breaking my crane later though,\u201d she continued with a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope it's my turn this time,\u201d grinned Sam as she licked her lips. She turned her head towards Rose who was clearly confused by banter between the two. Rose had not been here long enough to realize that while Titania is a terror to her enemies, she greatly rewards those who show her loyalty. Maybe she would be the lucky one to get \u201cpunished\u201d by Titania. \u201cCome on Rose let\u2019s get these finish with these upgrades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tAs the two got to work, Titania slowly made her way over to pool of flesh splattered on the floor. It was no wonder that the crane couldn't handle all of Surge, as she properly weighed more than the crane at this point. Her body was so full of fat that her appendages had all but vanished into her fleshy rolls. Surge\u2019s genes did give her one blessing though as her face was left mostly untouched, having only a single extra chin despite all of the excess fat. Surge definitely had made quite the change the time of her capture that\u2019s for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSurge\u2019s capture had been a challenge, to say the least. From what Titania learned from integrating the former X-Men is that she was part of one of the rogue cells who still opposed her. Surge was out on a scouting mission when her old friend's Storm and Shadow Cat found themselves among the rebel group. By the time she returned back to base Storm and Kitty went out and failed their rescue attempt mission, not that the rogue cell knew the latter. When the group leader refused to use any resources to attempt a rescue attempt, Surge went after the duo herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tNow here in the tale, Titania had to admit there was a good reason Surge was chosen to be the leader of the new X-men as she had a solid plan. Knowing that a direct approach would have been suicide, she decided to attack an oversight of the cocky Frightful Six. Their headquarters actually was using an offsite generator to power their base. Disabling that power source would leave the base venerable for a couple minutes before reinforcements could arrive. A couple minutes would be all she needed as absorbing all that energy would allow her to use her speed boost for a long time, almost making her seem like she was Quicksilver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tThe plan would have worked if she choose a different time to attack the base. Unfortunately for her, the day she had chosen was a training day for new recruits, meaning not only was the base crawling with soldiers but that all six of the FrightFul Six were present to recruit for their individual squads. As she made her way to the base, she quickly discovered her folly but knew this was her one opportunity. If she waited they certainly would have filled this hole in their defenses. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \tTitania had to confess Surge was a dangerous foe as she had amble energy to spend from absorbing a power generators worth of electricity. She had evaded and blasted her way deeper then most previous invaders had gotten before her. However, numbers would be her ultimate downfall in the end. The Frightful Six were eventually able to corral Surge into a certain pathway, which Iron Maiden had covered the floor with her milk. As she rounded the corner she noticed the trap too late, slamming straight into a metal wall, knocking the girl unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t After containing and fattening up Surge so she would no longer be a threat, the Six had to deal with the matter of the security flaw. Had the rebels planned a large-scale attack on a day when their forces were stretched thinner, the rebels could have done some serious damage to the base. The obvious solution to this problem was to build a new generator inside the base, however, that would take some time to build. Titania suggested in the meantime they had a perfectly good electric battery in their lockup right now. Since Surge was the one who stole their power, she should have to give her it back as their new generator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTitania did not however fully understand how Surge\u2019s powers worked, as she was more like a battery than a generator as she stored power but could not produce power out of thin air. Titania also didn't realize that without her gauntlets Surge would suck up all the electricity around her, making them have to make the gauntlets fit her growing frame. Titania was about to give up on the project before one her scientists had a genius idea. Certain foods that are high in acidity or potassium conduct electricity. While Surge can\u2019t generate her own power, she can process that food into electricity for the base. Willing to give it a shot the plan proceeded and after two days the room was all set up. The only thing left was to bring in the now immobile Surge.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tPredictably Surge was not too thrilled about the prospect, throwing many curses at her captor. Surge\u2019s willpower was going to be put to the test as Titania had a plan to break it down. As with most prisoners of the FrightFul Six, Surge\u2019s appetite had been greatly enhanced. Using this fact to her advantage, Titania set up an electric feeding mechanism that would be powered by Surge\u2019s new station as a generator. If Surge wanted to sate her new appetite, she would have to power the base. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Surge\u2019s strong willpower helped her fight the temptation for nearly two days, eventually she had to give in to her bodies needs. She started to let go of the power she had been holding onto from her failed break-in, which in turn activated her feeding tool. She had thought about trying to overload the system with an insane spike of electricity but the scientists had modified her gauntlets into to not allow such an excess output. For now, she decided to try to enjoy the deliciously addictive treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter two weeks of her new job as the FrightFul sumo\u2019s personal generator, Surge could no longer ignore the reality of her situation. No rescue would be coming to break her out of here. Even if she did get rescued it would take a lot of work to slim her back down to a mobile size. So like most of the super villain\u2019s captives before her, she decided to stop fighting back against them and try to make the most of her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSurge quickly learned that this was a smart choice as Titania tends to reward compliance of her pets with gifts. After Titania had noticed Surge\u2019s new behavior, Titania had ordered the scientists install a voice-activated library of books for her captive. Surge was ecstatic about development as her first week on the job had been quite boring, with the only the occasional chat with workers to pass the time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs more time passed her situation greatly improved to the point where she didn't mind her new life too badly. This change was heavily due to one of the brand new recruit named Rose. Evidently, the girl had been a college level genius in electrostatics. After acing her finals, her professors wanted to provide her an environment in which she could grow her skills. Since Titania\u2019s lab had quickly become one of the most advanced labs in the world, they asked if she could work there. The team was skeptical of letting a college kid work here, so to discourage her they send her a challenging problem of upgrading their reactor. When they got a response back in two days, they initially thought the girl had resigned her application. After opening the email they were shocked to find two different theoretical upgrades to their system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tWhile this definitely earned her a spot at the lab, the older scientists were not too thrilled with this new addition. What they initially saw as a distraction in the lab became a threat to their job hood. The team very much enjoyed their positions as Titania\u2019s favorites and became worried this girl would replace one of them. They devised a new plan of giving the girl the cold shoulder to make her want to not work their anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t    This plan fell apart on Rose\u2019s first day in the lab, as she was the most adorable girl they had ever met. She could best be described as having a face and personality of a stereotypical shy girl with the body of a cheerleader. This lead to half the staff wanting to adopt her with the other half wanting to sleep with her. All of the attention did leave Rose a little overwhelmed, making her lose her voice a for her first work days. Eventually Rose had gotten past her initial shy phase and quickly tried to befriend everyone in the lab crew, even the lab\u2019s prisoner Surge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl had apparently been rescued from the X-Men back when she was a teenager in high school and was quite the fan of the team. She asked if Surge could tell her what it was like being part of the team. After seeing the excitement in her eyes and having grown tired of reading, Surge was happy to talk about some of her exciting adventures. Surge barely made a dent in her past before one of the scientists asked if Rose had finished her readings yet. Rose quickly finished her previously forgotten work and promised Surge to return to hear the rest of it. From that day on the two had quickly become friends, with Rose\u2019s visits becoming a daily occurrence. They had moved on from only talking about Surge\u2019s adventures, discussing a plethora of topics such as books, movies, and sometimes just daily life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tDuring one of their sessions, out of the blue Rose asked if Surge was happy. Surge was caught off guard by this question, who hadn't really thought about the dramatic change her life took since her capture. While she did miss her career as an X-men, she didn't want to worry her new friend of troubles outside of her control. So she told her that she was fine, though joked about being sick of reading books all the time. The answer seemed to satisfy Rose, though she quickly ran off with the excuse of forgetting to take some readings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tThe following day Surge awoke to a pleasant surprise as her library had now gained video capability. When Surge asked Rose about the upgrade she pretended to be just as surprised by it, though a small blush on face gave her away. This day marked the start of a trend of her set up in lab greatly improving. After talking about favorite foods one day, Surge had suddenly gained a snack period where she got to choose her meal. After complaining about her uncomfortable clothes, two days later she received a brand new outfit. Eventually, she stopped trying to be subtle and asked Surge directly for everything she would be interested in having, as she was about to revamp the whole system.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \tToday was finally the day when that system was finally getting implemented, which is how Surge found herself in her current mess. As smart as the science team was they were still human. Someone had made a small error in the amount of mass their crane could handle lifting up. Surge embarrassingly was a tad over that amount, causing the crane to break and drop her. While drop did not physically hurt that much as she had plenty of built-in cushions, the position was not really pleasant as her face was down on the ground. Mentally it also was not reassuring on how much of a blob she truly had become. After a few minutes of waiting, Surge heard some loud stomping, followed by being risen up to the sight of a smirking of Titania <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTrying to roll away, are we? For shame I thought you liked our hospitality,\u201d joked Titania as moved Surge to the side of the room. Surge could only roll her eyes as Titania still wore that same shit-eating grin she always seemed to wear since her capture. \u201cNow what do you have to say Surge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you, mistress,\u201d Surge choked up, knowing that the golden word would earn her some praise. While she had accepted that the fact that she had been thoroughly defeated, she still tried to hold onto her some of her pride. Lately thought even that was starting to slip as Titania induced more rewards for \u201cdesired behavior\u201d. Looking back at Titania proved her assessment accurate as she somehow had a bigger grin than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tWith their subject out of the way, the team could finally install the last upgrades to the lab and eagerly got to work. That is except for Rose, who was left dumbstruck by the how easily Titania moved the giant girl. She heard the stories about how strong Titania was but hearing is way different than seeing. Sam, however, reminded her that Titania didn't want to be there all day so she should install her new upgrades to the system already, which got Rose into the working zone. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \tAfter a few minutes, the new and improved system was all ready for operation, only requiring the power source. Titania moved Surge back into her normal place, with the science team attaching equipment to their subject. Finally with everything in place it was up to Surge to start up the system. Surge who had gone almost two hours without eating wasted no time in powering up machines to get her snack.  As the juice started flowing the staff eagerly checked their measurements finding that the systems were indeed working at a 1.5 times more efficient way. After a couple minutes the team had to take a break from their readings as Titania slowly made her way to the center of the room, seemingly to make an announcement to the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook\u2019s like you guys did a good job,\u201d praised Titania. \u201cThe task that was seemingly impossible before was made possible by your efforts. You guys continue to impress me and I am not one to not reward good work. So not only are the drinks on me tonight, but you can also enjoy a nice salary increase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis decree elicited cheers from the lab member\u2019s. While not the most uncommon reward for success, the team were always thankful for these gifts. Luckily for them, Titania learned early on in her rulership that although threats of death definitely were handy in dealing with foes, positive reinforcement was way better long term to produce good results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \tAs her team went back work Titania got a chance to get a good look at all the new tech. While most of the team's effort had gone into maximizing the efficiency of the energy output, there had been a decent amount of upgrades to her prisoner\u2019s setup. A neural-based controller was added to allow her to use controllers without the use of her immobile hands. A massaging system was added that was activate-able by voice command. She even some interesting devices to help \u201crelieve stress\u201d. Honestly, besides being an immobile blob, it would be hard to call Surge a prisoner and not a Queen at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile Titania did approve these additions, as Surge giving up fighting her and submitted to her new mistress, she was curious why her team had asked her for these enhancements. Deciding to quell her curiously, she returned to Sam who was doing some scans with Rose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Sam I gotta know, why did you guys request all these quality of life changes for plasma blob over there. She starting to grow on you guys or something,\u201d Titania asked. While Sam seemed unfazed by the question, Rose seemed to stiffen but quickly shook it off and continued on with her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh that\u2019s because Rose over here, developed quite the crush on our blue giant,\u201d Sam nonchalantly replied. This time Rose could not hold back her emotions, as she turned from her work to stare in horror at Sam. Rose looked quite nervous as she quickly turned her head towards Surge. Thankfully for her, the former X-men was seemingly too distracted with her meal to hear their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou promised you wouldn't tell anyone that,\u201d yelled Rose, who was balancing a look of annoyance with one of embarrassment. Remembering that Titania was also present, however, the embarrassment quickly won the battle, especially after Titania shot her a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you like big woman huh. Maybe I need to bring you to my chambers sometime,\u201d Titania said with a flirty tone. Rose seemed to match her namesake as her crimson blush returned at full force. \u201cWell, if you were looking for permission I don't mind some fraternization so long as you remember whose in charge here. If you want I could make her into your love pet with a little brainwashing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUm no that\u2019s okay,\u201d muttered Rose, who seemed more relaxed with Titania\u2019s approval. \u201cIf she doesn't like me that way I don't wanna force it, I am okay with just being friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, speaking of which, why don't you make sure your friend enjoys her new upgrades,\u201d Sam inquired. \u201cMake sure the equipment is all working up there while you are at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEager to leave the awkward conversation Rose quickly nodded her head and started making her way up to Surge. Not before Sam added that she should also ask Surge out, much to Rose\u2019s embarrassment. With Rose hurrying away, Sam directed Titania towards the power station\u2019s main lab area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is the matter I wish to discuss with you before you head out,\u201d stated Sam as they entered the lab. Sam directed Titania attention to one of the big monitors, which showed a holo layout of her secret base and the routes the power took to those rooms. Below the rooms was a large quantity of measurements with one particle data set that was concerning to Titania. Current power was still getting quite close to maximum power, despite the upgrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you can see we saved a little time with the new set up but we still are getting close to our peak,\u201d Sam stated. \u201cSo either need to cut back on expansion and projects which both of us know isn't happening. Or we \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNeed me to gather more power sources,\u201d Titania interrupted, getting a nod from Sam. \u201cAll right I will see if we can find some more electric super heroines add to the collection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks, Titania,\u201d replied Sam, who started to gather notepads to take some readings. Sam started to leave but was stopped as a powerful arm held her shoulder down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \t\u201cI gotta say every time I come down here I feel like I'm leaving with work these days. Did you forget who's the boss here,\u201d Titania tried to threaten, but was betrayed by her cheeky expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen you know what color panties your boss wears, you sometimes forgot,\u201d joked Sam. Titania clearly did not expect that response, and in her momentary haze let go of Sam who continued on her way. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reed Richards formerly the leader of the Fantastic Four had been put through the ringer several times by Titania and her Frightful Sumos.  His rubbery body allowed him to be played with and tormented in ways that no normal person could be, be it fattening him up to the point that his own wife could be squished within his flabby form, used as a living sofa or bed, or even squeeze into something like a piece of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Titania had tired of that however it seemed that she\u2019d been content to have Mr. Flabtastic left more or less alone, since his massive size left him with a truly tremendous appetite that would make sure that he wasn\u2019t able to escape any time soon.  In his new supersize Reed wanted to eat something like five or six times as much as a normal human being did, and only the massive calorie packed meals that the Frightful Sumos had made just for him would provide Mr. Flabtastic with enough sustenance to keep him from spending every hour of the day looking for something else to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was what he got was still only enough that a lot of the time Reed tended to sleep or if he wasn\u2019t actually sleeping was at least spent with his body laying around in the shape of a formless blob in which case most people would barely be able to tell the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Reed awkwardly opened his brown eyes he now found himself face to face with none other than his wife Susan the Invisible Blimp!  She was looking fat, but possibly a little bit skinnier than she had been before she\u2019d gone into the challenge that Titania had set up which had lead to both of them getting captured and fattened up to the point of being the next best thing to utterly helpless flabby slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan\u2026 what is going on?\u201d  Reed asked awkwardly.  It\u2019d been a while since he\u2019d actually needed to or been expected to talk to anyone and so he was a little bit out of practice.  His entire body shook like a gigantic jello mold and began to ooze a little bit closer to Susan, torn between wanting to touch her in order to make sure that she was real, and not wanting to end up half smothering her beneath his blubber body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust come a little closer and I\u2019ll tell you Mr. Flabtastic...\u201d  Susan cooed with a seductive look in her eyes as she gazed deeply into her husband\u2019s fattened face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed obviously couldn\u2019t refuse any request that Susan made of him at the moment and so began to ooze closer to her with renewed vigor, showing about as much enthusiasm as he had for anything ever since he got himself super-stuffed and fattened up to the point of being well and truly worthy of the title of Mr. Flabtastic...</span></div></div>",
