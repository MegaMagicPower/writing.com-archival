Just another boring and ordinary day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate it. How you'd do anything to escape the dullness of your current life and do something exciting for once. Unfortunately for you, your plea is has not gone unheard. You will get your wish. But at a cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the loud horn of an eight-wheeler blast in the air which shouldn't have frightened you. Yet, it did. Something about that horn felt wrong, disturbing you deeply on a primal level. You turn you head to see the truck it originated from, and you entered a state of terror you previously never experienced before. The truck that had an otherworldly aura was speeding your way. You just knew instinctively that the driver, if there is one, is deadset on mowing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTried as you might, your legs can not outrun Truck-Kun, the heavenly 18-wheeler and lord of all trucks. You never had a chance. The divine Kenworth T680 catches up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a grey void where you're the only living thing in this void. This isn't the afterlife you think. You heard the horn of Truck-Kun again, and many portals open in front of you. You are tossed into one of the portals by an unseen force. What portal are you flung into?</span></div></div>",

You grab your head in pain, not that it would do any good to stop the abnormal burning sensation that envelops your brain. The pain momentarily subsides allowing you to notice a new weight on your left arm. You take a look at your arm to find a weird looking device attached to it. Wait, you've seen this thing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a duel disk from the Yugioh anime, specifically one of the standard issue ones the 5ds series. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/e/e5/Player-WC09-M%26F.png/revision/latest?cb=20100215173003\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were younger you and your friends would stick your cards in the duel disk toys and pretend to duel as they did in the show. Good times. You don't recall a toy version of the standard 5ds duel disk ever being made, and it doesn't necessarily feel like it's a toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice there's a deck of cards inside it. You probably need to go to a hospital on account of surviving(you think) being ran over by a truck, but for some reason you don't feel all that bad. You just have a bizarre headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the time to go through the deck you discover they are from deck the player character from the Reverse of Arcadia game originally had before being taken away by a certain psychic duelist. This only adds to the mystery. Who runs a guy over, gives them Yugioh cards, and gives them a duel disk toy(?)? And the cards are also strange. They're not like the typical cards you buy from a pack, they look like they're from the anime. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You need to get out of here before you get mugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way through the alleys you find dozens of faded posters lining up on the dirty walls. A good chunk of them were about where to find duel tournaments at shady sounding locations. One in particular was about something you barely could believe. Unground turbo dueling. You shake your head in confusion, your headache returning. Turbo-dueling doesn't exist in the real world. It only exists in the fictional world of Yugioh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally laughed at dumbest idea you entertained. You were sent the Yugioh world, the 5ds era to be specific, when you got hit by the truck the way some protagonists in animes, mangas, and virtual novels get sent to fantasy worlds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat might explain the cards and duel disk, but it's all too absurd. Your younger self would be extremely happy to be in the world of an anime you loved watching growing up, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are interrupted in your train of thought when a glass bottle makes contact with your head. You feel blood slowly oozing out of the wound, and it does nothing to make your headache any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shucks! He's still up!\" Cackled a deranged voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to see a trio of stereotypical thugs menacingly making their way to you. One held a lead pipe, the other held a switchblade, and the last one had another bottle in his hand. He must have been the one who threw the first one at you. The most striking characteristic about all three of them was they had yellow tattoo-like lines on their faces. The same kind criminals got in 5ds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFug it. You really are in 5ds! And you're about to be mugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can always try what Jack did in that one flashback to scare aways those thugs after Rally. You quickly reach for your deck to take a card out, any card that looks intimidating, and pull out Strong Wing Dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! This will work. You flash Strong Wind Dragon in this manner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mspaintadventures/images/0/07/Ps000013_2.gif/revision/latest?cb=20100924022405\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mspa...</a> in an attempt to look as cool as possible before placing the card on your duel disk. The green dragon materialized as a hologram and unleashed a mighty roar which sounded more realistic than it ought to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does nothing to dissuade the thugs from their goal. You fall to your knees, clenching your head in pain when the headache returns with a vengeance. What happens next wasn't predicted by either you or the thugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrong Wind Dragon inhales before unleashing a blast of powerful wind at the belligerents, knocking them into the brick wall far behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what just happened other than you inflicting real damage similary to what Akiza did in the anime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a psychic duelist?\" You say out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct my new friend.\" You hear a new voice behind you say affirmatively.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's Sayer or Divine as he was called in the Japanese version. This isn't even the presumably nicer Arc-V version of him. It's the manipulative ruthless leader of the Arcadia Movement version of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this Sayer is still alive without a scar you can only assume you are currently in the timeframe before the Dark Signers Arc. Meaning he's still pulling Akiza's strings along with other psychics he's misleading. The man's sick in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about how one moment you got hit by a truck and were sent into an anime world that revolves around a children's card game, got sent to the season that revolves around said card game on motorcycles, and became a psychic before being hit in the head with a bottle is making your headache become extremely unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem that bad off for someone who got hit by a truck, Anon.\" The man says to you, his voice maintaining an illusion of friendliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you not read my mind?\" You ask bluntly. How are you going to keep anything from this guy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get a vibe on you,\" he replies, \"And it's not like I can get too much. That headache of yours plus a million jumbled thoughts running through your mind is making it difficult for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I can tell you already know my name. And I already know your name too. No need for any lengthy introductions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky us.\" You quip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's that unnecessary hostility you have for me out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got hit by a truck and took a bottle to my head on top of having my having my mind feeling like it's about to splinter into a million little pieces as my brain burns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disregarding two of those, I can tell you from experience I know what you're going through, Anon.\" The man said sympathetically, \"Having your powers awaken out of the blue can be quite painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can take a not too wild guess here and  say he wants you to join his little club. You tell him you accept his invitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily you'd want nothing to do with this guy, you've seen what he's really like in the anime and Reverse of Arcadia. However, like it or not Sayer is the expert in controlling psychic powers. Hurting someone, probably yourself included, with your newfound abilities isn't something you want on your conscience. You'll just have to tolerate the wicked psychic before you as long as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also need a place to stay. You don't want to risk getting mugged again. Additionally, you can try your hand at flirting with Akiza and any other psychic babe you come across. </span></div></div>",

For example:<br>\r\n1: Evil Humans and Kishin Eggs both exist as concepts. While only Lord Death and presumably Kid as a full fledged Reaper can tell the difference between a regular human soul and an evil human anyone can see the difference between a human soul, evil or otherwise, and a Kishin Egg Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Generally speaking it really depends on the situation on what causes a person to become a Kishin Egg. Some people can either become them depending on how much madness they have within them, or if an Evil Human has further devolved until they're no longer counted as human but a monster that represents the madness of the person they once were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: Kishin Eggs can eat souls too just like demon weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to the choices here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Student at the DWMA (Meister): you wake up as a student at the DWMA. Pretty simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Student at the DWMA (Weapon): Sams as the above but Truck-Kun felt generous and granted you Demon Weapon genes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: Put on Your Wizard Robe and Hat: You wake up in the Witches' Realm and you are a sorcerer now at least a week before Shaula attacks Death City. What you do is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: Webbed: You wake up as a member of Arachnophobia.

Though your new location is less than welcoming. As your eyes adjust to the room's lighting, not that there is much in, you find yourself on the floor that bears a red spider web pattern with dark green pillars appeared to be made from stone reaching the ceiling. You've seen this place many times before animated and drawn on a manga page. You definitely shouldn't be here. You can even hear that sensual music accompanied by French lyrics playing in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head up to see that giantic spiderweb and there she is. In the center of it is the curvaceous spider witch, looking down upon you with her normally stoic expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now in the Soul Eater, the anime where people can turn into weapons and eat souls, go to an academy where the grim reaper is the headmaster, and try to keep the world safe from those who strayed off into the path of evil and witches. And you just so happened to land into the abode of the witch who's sinister as she is sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a lack of your mind being molested by the overwhelming presence of Asura's madness so you safely assume you are not that far into the anime. Or the manga where Arachne doesn't try to get Asura to fall in love with her but instead leaves her body to become madness which only results in Maka having an easier time killing her. This might actually be a bit of a problem when you think about it. Which version of Soul Eater ARE you in? The anime or the manga? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done gathering your thoughts, Anon?\" Arachne said to you, \"I can only imagine your journey here was pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she know about that and your name? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ok.\" you take a breath \"The main character is named Ruby Rose, Leomond is betraying you and the person taking the Fall Maiden's power is Cinder Fall, she'll be here for the festival with a full team of criminals under cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin was silent for a second and then took out his scroll. He typed something out and looked back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you for the warning.\" He said with a smile \"I'll look into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do, if you don't Ironwood goes insane.\" You say \"Anyway, how long will I be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on you.\" Ozpin says \"If you want I can enroll you under... special circumstances into Beacon Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You said automatically, eager to live out your fantasy. (Possibly some of your dirty fantasies too.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin smile still on his face typed on his scroll some more. \"Eager I see. Well, you'll prove to be a most effective addition to our arsenal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he left you in your room and you fell asleep quickly.</span></div></div>",

You're at Beacon Academy from RWBY now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make sense out of this while you get off the ground. Your body feels different, maybe a few years younger till you're around 17, and as if you've trained for years. Not too weak, not too strong, but the middle ground. You are either having a hallucination on account your head being hit by a speeding truck, or your afterlife is a web animation with anime influences made in Texas. You're not sure what is more rational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens. A swarm of rose petals is coming your way. You know exactly what and more importantly who it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, wearing her volume one outfit, resumes her usual form with open arms, embracing you in a tight hug but also knowing you back to the ground. She's hugging you. Ruby Rose from RWBY is hugging you. You can safely say for a fact you aren't dead. This is feels all too real. You're also enjoying being hugged by one of the cutest girls on the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy you can finally be here with us, big bro!\" Ruby says, utterly confusing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get a chance to even begin with her calling you that your mind is flooded with strange new memories. You couldn't decipher all of them but a few stood out. Ruby's mom Summer trying to comfort a younger you as you both stand in a ruined town, growing up with Ruby and Yang, and you struggling in what you imagine to be a training school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't seem like the regular version of RWBY you are now kn to at all. You have watched your fair share of isekai animes, but one typically don't get sent to an already established fictional world where they get shoehorned into the lives of the characters there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, you can make this work. You wanted an exciting life, and evidently a magic truck heard your wish before granting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do a lot here armed with your knowledge of the show, and who knows what you'll do when you unlock your semblance. With so many possibilities to explore you don't know where you'll end up. However, you are certain some of those possibilities end with you getting your new sisters pregnant.

The light grew warmer and you came across a stone chamber. In the middle, surrounded by 4 torches, was a pedestal with a book. You frowned and the colors of the torches caught your eye. They were four different colors, red, white, yellow, and black. Approaching the book, you jumped back as it opened up automatically and words began to appear.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nGreetings human from Earth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have died and been reborn in the world of Remnant. This world should be familiar to you, so we can skip the explanation. The reason you were summoned was this world needs warriors. The path is up to you. Will you be a villain or hero? There are no second chances. If you die here, you die for good. To help you adjust, you will be given a weapon, skills for how to use it, and a Semblance of your choice. Be warned, Semblances cannot be all powerful and should you choose one that exceeds the limit, you will be given a random one instead. When you exit this chamber, have it in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You muttered. \u201cI\u2019m in RWBY?\u201d You blinked and grin. \u201cI\u2019m in RWBY!\u201d You yelled. It was one of your favorite serious and you loved the characters. Armed with some of the knowledge, you might be able to help out and even bag one of the hot girls. Glancing at the wall, you noticed a weapon. \u201cHuh, a halberd?\u201d You picked it up and knowledge about it flooded into your mind. \u201cSweet, a mechoshift one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned into two hand held axes and those axes could be high caliber pistols. The halberd also had a rifle built in. You shifted it a couple times into all forms and it felt like you\u2019ve been doing it all your life. You practiced a few swings and it felt natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is sooooo cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the only exit that suddenly appeared, you realized you needed to think of a Semblance. You wish you had rules on what was considered \u2018all powerful.\u2019 You assumed that mean no reality warping or immortality. Thinking back to some of the anime and other shows you watched, you finally thought of an idea and stepped through to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Semblance did you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could use that a lot here. Not only did it steal physical abilities and items, but you also might be able to use it for other things. Semblances were supposed to evolve in Remnant. You grinned to yourself as you stepped out into the world with that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun greeted you and fresh air filled your lungs as you emerged from a cave on a cliff side.

You wanted to see if you could use your Semblance to steal an arm or leg. Nothing happened. Frowning, you focused on something smaller, like an organ. If you could wipe out Grimm with just a thought, your life would be much easier. Still nothing. Growling to yourself, you imagined what Ban did in the manga and used his ability to steal power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt stronger. Much stronger. The Grimm collapsed on the ground, having tripped, before continuing its pursuit of you, albeit a much slower pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can steal power from enemies just like Ban. This power was going to be perfect. The Grimm reached you and you swiped through it with your halberd again. This time, there was barely any resistance. As it died, you could feel your new power vanish instantly. Seems your Semblance only let you steal power of alive things. Looking at the other Beowolves coming as you, your halberd was quickly turned into axes and you used this fight to train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to get over the gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last Beowolf fell with the axe firmly embedded in its skull. You were now pretty sure you were proficient enough to survive. Transforming your weapons back into a halberd, you stood before the Ursa. It changed you and you side stepped, it, slashing at it\u2019s leg. You amputated it easily enough and it fell over. Jumping into the air, you brought your weapon down into its back, ending its life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you jumped off the disappearing body and looked up at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot it was time to find your way back to a city. You had a strong feeling to go south and that\u2019s where you went. After traveling for about an hour\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Forever Falls had happened, so Jaune wasn\u2019t being bullied by Cardin anymore, but you were curious as if the battle of the docks where Black, Sun, and Ruby fought Torchwick. Or if the breach happened. You could hardly ask that and decided to let them talk. Once you were in Vale, you could use your scroll to connect to the internet and check on the time line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also traded numbers with Ren and Nora. They were going to be useful.<br>\r\n\u2003<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You enjoyed talking to Ren and Nora. Unlike the show which only gave them limited screen time, they were real people in this world and you got to learn a bit about them. Naturally, they didn\u2019t tell you everything about their past, but they did mention they were orphans. You told them your parents had died too, and were living on your own. That created another bond and Nora now considered you a close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrived in Vale, you waved goodbye to your friends and started looking around. Being in the city was a lot different from actually watching the show. Streets were busy, humans and Faunus were mulling around, and countless stores you never knew existed were open. You sat down on a bench and began to skim the headlines in recent weeks. There was mentions of the Vytal festival, but nothing about a breach. If that had happened from the attack in Mt. Glenn, it would be everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what time had you arrived at?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrowed it a bit before the breach and initiation had occurred. That was still a pretty big gap. Not only that, you had limited amount of Lien. You needed to get a source of income if you wanted to survive. Based on prices of apartments and hotels, you probably could last a month, maybe two if you really ate stingy. You needed a way to either get into Beacon or make a lot of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlllllaaaaaakkkkkeeee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was yelling and you looked up. Rounding the corner were two girls One was blonde and muscular while the other had white hair and shorter. Both were very attractive and you recognized them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang Xiao-Long: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/e/ef/Yang_ProfilePic_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20151201091453\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a> <br>\r\nWeiss Schnee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/4/43/Weiss_ProfilePic_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20161031035106\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlllllllaaaaaaaakkkkkeeeeee!\u201d Yang called again. \u201cCome on out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike yelling is going to work.\u201d Weiss huffed, crossing her arms. \u201cShe ran from us. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to stay out in the open waiting for us to find her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t just yell at people without hearing their side of the story, she wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d Yang growled. \u201cYou always jump to conclusions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZip it.\u201d Yang interrupted. \u201cI know you have reasons, most people do. But when we find her, I am going to make her explain yourself, then you two can talk out all your differences, even if I have to lock you two in a closet until you kiss and make up. Now let\u2019s hurry. Ruby and Penny are searching the other side of the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHah!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now knew what your situation was. Blake had just run away from the others after they discovered she was a Faunus. That meant the attack at the docks was about to happen. If things played out like normal, Roman Torchwick would escape and there would be some explosions. Blake would meet up with her team and things would kind of work out. You could let things play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf things play out, Roman will eventually die and Cinder\u2019s plans would work out. You couldn\u2019t just come out and tell everyone about the situation. Was there something you could do to change things in the long run? Maybe help the main cast subdue him before things get out of hand? However, what if you could do something to solve your problems and put a cog into Cinder\u2019s plans? You might be the bad guy at first, but this could work out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, it was just Ruby and then Penny to help Blake and Sun. You need Weiss and Yang there too. Somehow you had to convince them to be there without contacting the cops. You quickly slipped into a store and got a piece of paper and then a cloak from another, making sure to keep track of where Weiss and Yang were. You quickly wrote down a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Cat Faunus will be at the docks tonight. From your tone today, I assume you didn\u2019t want the police involved. You might want to bring weapons.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should encourage just enough interest for Yang and Weiss would have no choice to come along. Folding the paper into a plane, you carefully aimed and tossed the place before ducking into a store. You head a shout and knew you hit your mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in my hair!?\u201d Yang cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still a second.\u201d Weiss scolded. \u201cIt\u2019s a paper airplane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho threw that?!\u201d Yang demanded, turning around and no one stepping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang\u2026\u201d Weiss said slowly, after opening up the paper. \u201cLook at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely see and hear them out of the window and hoped they wouldn\u2019t notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey know who Blake is\u2026 so it\u2019s a lead.\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe should let Ruby know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t find her, we follow up on this?\u201d Yang asked and Weiss nodded. The two of them took off and you breathed a sigh of relief. That was phase one of your plan. Roman would have a hard time fighting all four at once without an Atlas Paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for stage two. I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubt you could improve your combat skills ahead of time. You would have to rely on your current weapon skills. You could practice using your Semblance though. A couple hours of heavy practice might come in handy. You also had Lien, so shopping for supplies to enact your plan might be required. Of course, it would be a long night, so you might want to think about getting some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was uncomfortable and it wasn\u2019t like you set up some pillows and blankets to cover the cold hard ground. You were also tired, as you spent most of the day practicing your Semblance. Out of everything you could improve, that was the one that could be tested the fastest. Since you could steal items from a distance, even if people were holding them, you figured it would give you a chance to change the tide of battle. People wouldn\u2019t expect for you to suddenly wield their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you had to get to the docks early. You didn\u2019t know exactly when Roman Torchwick would arrive with the White Fang and you couldn\u2019t afford to miss it. You had exactly one shot. Finally, after almost two hours of waiting, you saw Roman Torchwick arrive with the White Fang.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/kz1d78mSFUgSqoqs5\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/kz1d78mSFUgSqo...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrothers and sisters of the White Fang\u2026!\u201d A girl shouted, putting a sword against Roman\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/d/d3/V2_09_00048.png/revision/latest?cb=20141002233120\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time.\u201d You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Blake, giving her speech about the White Fang and them now working for Roman.

I\u2026 want to hear your side of the story.\u201d Blake blinked and looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Roman demanded. \u201cA high school reunion? Shouldn\u2019t it be past your bedtime kids?\u201d He looked around at his troops all falling one after another. \u201cThey\u2019re brats. What the hell is wrong with your animals? Get up and fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d Yang said, slamming her fists together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly knew you had to intervene. You ran out of your hiding spot and pulled out your halberd as she closed in on Roman. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw you approach. Grinning, he stepped back. In a way, you were really impressed. He could tell you were not on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, to your right!\u201d Blake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was able to see you coming just in time and raised her guard as you hit her with a horizontal cleave with your halberd. Her aura absorbed the damage, but the force sent her flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Ruby cried, holding her weapon up. Yang sprung to her feet and prepared herself for a follow up attack that never came from you. Blake and Weiss ran up and lined up with their teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t look friendly after all. With your brown cloak covering most of your body and hair, you also had a makeshift mask to cover your face. It closer resembled a certain bandit leader over the White Fang and gave a distinct impression. You glanced over at Roman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I take it you didn\u2019t help me for no reason.\u201d He said conversationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWandering mercenary looking for some work that pays well,\u201d You reply. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would be interested in hiring my service?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had a good initial impression.\u201d Roman said. \u201cTell you what.

You won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward and put your Halberd on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s up to something.\u201d Weiss warned. \u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they only knew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of them noticed and you couldn\u2019t see any major changes either. Yet you had the objects, so it should work. It had to work or you were in trouble. A quick prayer was in order. Your Scroll was still being held up, as you couldn\u2019t show weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Ruby agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them started forward\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proved to be a terrible mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soooooo glad you had your Scroll on record mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had in your pocket was countless tiny strips of clothes. Your Semblance let you instantly take something from a distance into your hand. You couldn\u2019t pull physical things from people or Grimm, like appendages or organs, which you were kind of glad for. You could steal streangth, but only part of it. The exact limits were still unknown, but you didn\u2019t have time to practice. Because of this, you went for the nice easy option of the least amount you had to steal, but would also not hurt Team RWBY. Not physically at least. Mental scars might remain since you took all the threat holding their clothes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s why as they stepped forward, their clothes literally fell apart off their bodies, leaving them nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as they all looked down at themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream was heard all over the docks. Roman\u2019s mouth was open in shock as you turned around and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to go.\u201d You tell him as you put your Scroll away. \u201cWhy they are distracted.\u201d That snapped him back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way, kid.\u201d Roman dashed off and you followed, the girls too mortified to follow. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumiliation, delay tactic, and future blackmail material,\u201d You replied. \u201cEasiest way to get out of this since the cops are sure to show up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou definitely earned a bonus,\u201d Roman stated. \u201cYour suspicious timing though remains in question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, I came to make sure you don\u2019t die.\u201d You tell him. \u201cKeep up this work and that flame bitch is going to get you killed.\u201d You really hoped he understood that code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his darkening expression, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to talk privately.\u201d He told you.

Move, move, move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you followed him, ignoring the looks from the White Fang members. You were too busy thinking about what was going to happen to you if Team RWBY found you.

Your face was currently being pressed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter Cinder attacks the Vytal festival with the White Fang, you\u2019re eaten by a Grimm,\u201d You tell him, avoiding some of the more specific details. \u201cCinder then convinces Neo it was someone else\u2019s fault and uses her as an attack dog to steal her true objective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is her objective?\u201d Roman asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t it to disrupt the festival and destroy Vale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, her boss wants to destroy everything and she needs a certain relic Ozpin is hiding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight on your back lifted off you and you were able to stand up. Behind you, a diminutive, yet mute, white, pink, and brown girl stood, watching you.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/cDEC5XvY9h5yNXJu5\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/cDEC5XvY9h5yNX...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear more of this.\u201d Roman said. \u201cYou obviously know enough to at least listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question for you now was how much information could you give?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u2019 Roman sighed. \u201cThe reason Cinder is all powerful is because she has this Fall Maiden power that lets her control fire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, half of the power,\u201d You correct him. \u201cThe other half belongs to a girl hidden at Beacon. Also, Maidens can control more than just one element, they can control multiple. They just settle one an element they like. Looking at her name, you can tell. Her actual Semblance is Glass Manipulation. Conjure blades and things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that.\u201d Roman admitted and rubbed his chin. \u201cShe wants the other half of the maiden\u2019s power and a relic at Beacon. So much so she\u2019s going to throw all of Vale into disarray with Grimm and collapse the kingdom to get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d You confirmed. \u201cYou are expendable to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPreaching to the choir, boy.\u201d Roman took out a cigar and started smoking. \u201cI have a meeting with her tomorrow. Shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised it only took this long to convince you,\u201d You admit. \u201cI figured it would take a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid, I\u2019ve seen a lot of strange shit and you filled in gaps I was missing.\u201d Roman eyed him. \u201cI still don\u2019t fully trust you. There doesn\u2019t seem a reason for you to keep my alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly for Neo,\u201d You joked and she tilted her head and then smirked. \u201cSeriously though, it\u2019s cause you\u2019re needed. Someone with your resourcefulness and thinking outside of the box is going to come in handy against Cinder and her allies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If all three of us attacked her, do you think we could win?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo and Roman stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m average at best with my weapon and it\u2019s only cause of my Semblance I can do what I do.\u201d You reached forward toward a rock in the distance and it appeared in your hand. \u201cYou can appreciate it. My ability is Steal. If I can see it, I can take it. Weapons, rocks, threads typing clothes together\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s what you did.\u201d Roman commented and Neo looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d You tossed her your scroll and she played it. A moment later, she fell over laughing. \u201cThought you would enjoy that.\u2019 You turned back to Roman. \u201cCan steal body parts or organs though on a living thing, otherwise I could assassinate her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d Roman sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever said that, I said if we fight her, we would lose.\u201d You corrected him. \u201cYou\u2019re an elite criminal. I assumed you had some plan where we take her out by cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoman laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like this kid, Neo. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay kid, we have to meet her tomorrow night and explain why we failed to get all the dust. She probably knows about you by now from the White Fang, so you and Neo will tag along. After that, we can decide on our next course of action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder was incredibly hot, but extremely deadly. One wrong move and you would die in a fire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You weren\u2019t sure what she was telling Roman, but you felt like it was bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, let the kid rest up. We have some more talking to do.\u201d Roman turned to you and offered you a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You replied and took it. Not that you really liked coffee, but you could drink it with sugar and cream. \u201cI take it you have other idea instead of having me meet Cinder and her team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee!\u201d Roman gestured to you while looking at Neo. \u201cMost of the idiots we work with couldn\u2019t even get that much.\u201d Neo nodded and he turned to you. \u201cPretty much. You indicated you want to avoid changing things too much from what she\u2019s planning, so she doesn\u2019t act outside of your predictions.\u201d You nod your head in agreement. \u201cSo, I had a couple of ideas, but I want to hear yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn how we survive?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could try an assassination attempt,\u201d You admit. \u201cThat will end her and stop all of her plans, but her associates wouldn\u2019t take this lying down. Someone else would show up. They might leave you alone, if you want to risk it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m not risking my life on a maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we could just go along with her plan,\u201d You continue. \u201cIf we meet her, I\u2019ll either pass her inspection or die to her fire. Then you could risk your life with things to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a good option for either of us. Risky, but if you are allowed in the plan, it might help at the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have one other idea,\u201d You admit. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to be the one to do the talking. You can spin it the right way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d He looked interested. \u201cGo on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe go to Ozpin at Beacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cup slammed down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou nuts, kid? Ozpin?! You do remember who I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know enough about the situation that he won\u2019t have a choice but to listen to us,\u201d You remind him. \u201cHe\u2019ll listen to us neutrally. We might be able to convince him to let us stay. Or at least me. This way, I can monitor Cinder\u2019s group from that side. We feed each other information for survival. However, I\u2019m not sure I can explain the situation in a way that would exude confidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Roman glanced at Neo. \u201cAll ideas have risk and merits.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
