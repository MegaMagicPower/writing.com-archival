Just another boring and ordinary day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate it. How you'd do anything to escape the dullness of your current life and do something exciting for once. Unfortunately for you, your plea is has not gone unheard. You will get your wish. But at a cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the loud horn of an eight-wheeler blast in the air which shouldn't have frightened you. Yet, it did. Something about that horn felt wrong, disturbing you deeply on a primal level. You turn you head to see the truck it originated from, and you entered a state of terror you previously never experienced before. The truck that had an otherworldly aura was speeding your way. You just knew instinctively that the driver, if there is one, is deadset on mowing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTried as you might, your legs can not outrun Truck-Kun, the heavenly 18-wheeler and lord of all trucks. You never had a chance. The divine Kenworth T680 catches up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a grey void where you're the only living thing in this void. This isn't the afterlife you think. You heard the horn of Truck-Kun again, and many portals open in front of you. You are tossed into one of the portals by an unseen force. What portal are you flung into?</span></div></div>",

You grab your head in pain, not that it would do any good to stop the abnormal burning sensation that envelops your brain. The pain momentarily subsides allowing you to notice a new weight on your left arm. You take a look at your arm to find a weird looking device attached to it. Wait, you've seen this thing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a duel disk from the Yugioh anime, specifically one of the standard issue ones the 5ds series. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/e/e5/Player-WC09-M%26F.png/revision/latest?cb=20100215173003\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were younger you and your friends would stick your cards in the duel disk toys and pretend to duel as they did in the show. Good times. You don't recall a toy version of the standard 5ds duel disk ever being made, and it doesn't necessarily feel like it's a toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice there's a deck of cards inside it. You probably need to go to a hospital on account of surviving(you think) being ran over by a truck, but for some reason you don't feel all that bad. You just have a bizarre headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the time to go through the deck you discover they are from deck the player character from the Reverse of Arcadia game originally had before being taken away by a certain psychic duelist. This only adds to the mystery. Who runs a guy over, gives them Yugioh cards, and gives them a duel disk toy(?)? And the cards are also strange. They're not like the typical cards you buy from a pack, they look like they're from the anime. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You need to get out of here before you get mugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way through the alleys you find dozens of faded posters lining up on the dirty walls. A good chunk of them were about where to find duel tournaments at shady sounding locations. One in particular was about something you barely could believe. Unground turbo dueling. You shake your head in confusion, your headache returning. Turbo-dueling doesn't exist in the real world. It only exists in the fictional world of Yugioh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally laughed at dumbest idea you entertained. You were sent the Yugioh world, the 5ds era to be specific, when you got hit by the truck the way some protagonists in animes, mangas, and virtual novels get sent to fantasy worlds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat might explain the cards and duel disk, but it's all too absurd. Your younger self would be extremely happy to be in the world of an anime you loved watching growing up, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are interrupted in your train of thought when a glass bottle makes contact with your head. You feel blood slowly oozing out of the wound, and it does nothing to make your headache any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shucks! He's still up!\" Cackled a deranged voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to see a trio of stereotypical thugs menacingly making their way to you. One held a lead pipe, the other held a switchblade, and the last one had another bottle in his hand. He must have been the one who threw the first one at you. The most striking characteristic about all three of them was they had yellow tattoo-like lines on their faces. The same kind criminals got in 5ds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFug it. You really are in 5ds! And you're about to be mugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can always try what Jack did in that one flashback to scare aways those thugs after Rally. You quickly reach for your deck to take a card out, any card that looks intimidating, and pull out Strong Wing Dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! This will work. You flash Strong Wind Dragon in this manner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mspaintadventures/images/0/07/Ps000013_2.gif/revision/latest?cb=20100924022405\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mspa...</a> in an attempt to look as cool as possible before placing the card on your duel disk. The green dragon materialized as a hologram and unleashed a mighty roar which sounded more realistic than it ought to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does nothing to dissuade the thugs from their goal. You fall to your knees, clenching your head in pain when the headache returns with a vengeance. What happens next wasn't predicted by either you or the thugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrong Wind Dragon inhales before unleashing a blast of powerful wind at the belligerents, knocking them into the brick wall far behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what just happened other than you inflicting real damage similary to what Akiza did in the anime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a psychic duelist?\" You say out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct my new friend.\" You hear a new voice behind you say affirmatively.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's Sayer or Divine as he was called in the Japanese version. This isn't even the presumably nicer Arc-V version of him. It's the manipulative ruthless leader of the Arcadia Movement version of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this Sayer is still alive without a scar you can only assume you are currently in the timeframe before the Dark Signers Arc. Meaning he's still pulling Akiza's strings along with other psychics he's misleading. The man's sick in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about how one moment you got hit by a truck and were sent into an anime world that revolves around a children's card game, got sent to the season that revolves around said card game on motorcycles, and became a psychic before being hit in the head with a bottle is making your headache become extremely unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem that bad off for someone who got hit by a truck, Anon.\" The man says to you, his voice maintaining an illusion of friendliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you not read my mind?\" You ask bluntly. How are you going to keep anything from this guy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get a vibe on you,\" he replies, \"And it's not like I can get too much. That headache of yours plus a million jumbled thoughts running through your mind is making it difficult for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I can tell you already know my name. And I already know your name too. No need for any lengthy introductions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky us.\" You quip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's that unnecessary hostility you have for me out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got hit by a truck and took a bottle to my head on top of having my having my mind feeling like it's about to splinter into a million little pieces as my brain burns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disregarding two of those, I can tell you from experience I know what you're going through, Anon.\" The man said sympathetically, \"Having your powers awaken out of the blue can be quite painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can take a not too wild guess here and  say he wants you to join his little club. You tell him you accept his invitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily you'd want nothing to do with this guy, you've seen what he's really like in the anime and Reverse of Arcadia. However, like it or not Sayer is the expert in controlling psychic powers. Hurting someone, probably yourself included, with your newfound abilities isn't something you want on your conscience. You'll just have to tolerate the wicked psychic before you as long as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also need a place to stay. You don't want to risk getting mugged again. Additionally, you can try your hand at flirting with Akiza and any other psychic babe you come across. </span></div></div>",

For example:<br>\r\n1: Evil Humans and Kishin Eggs both exist as concepts. While only Lord Death and presumably Kid as a full fledged Reaper can tell the difference between a regular human soul and an evil human anyone can see the difference between a human soul, evil or otherwise, and a Kishin Egg Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Generally speaking it really depends on the situation on what causes a person to become a Kishin Egg. Some people can either become them depending on how much madness they have within them, or if an Evil Human has further devolved until they're no longer counted as human but a monster that represents the madness of the person they once were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: Kishin Eggs can eat souls too just like demon weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to the choices here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Student at the DWMA (Meister): you wake up as a student at the DWMA. Pretty simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Student at the DWMA (Weapon): Sams as the above but Truck-Kun felt generous and granted you Demon Weapon genes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: Put on Your Wizard Robe and Hat: You wake up in the Witches' Realm and you are a sorcerer now at least a week before Shaula attacks Death City. What you do is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: Webbed: You wake up as a member of Arachnophobia.

Though your new location is less than welcoming. As your eyes adjust to the room's lighting, not that there is much in, you find yourself on the floor that bears a red spider web pattern with dark green pillars appeared to be made from stone reaching the ceiling. You've seen this place many times before animated and drawn on a manga page. You definitely shouldn't be here. You can even hear that sensual music accompanied by French lyrics playing in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head up to see that giantic spiderweb and there she is. In the center of it is the curvaceous spider witch, looking down upon you with her normally stoic expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now in the Soul Eater, the anime where people can turn into weapons and eat souls, go to an academy where the grim reaper is the headmaster, and try to keep the world safe from those who strayed off into the path of evil and witches. And you just so happened to land into the abode of the witch who's sinister as she is sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a lack of your mind being molested by the overwhelming presence of Asura's madness so you safely assume you are not that far into the anime. Or the manga where Arachne doesn't try to get Asura to fall in love with her but instead leaves her body to become madness which only results in Maka having an easier time killing her. This might actually be a bit of a problem when you think about it. Which version of Soul Eater ARE you in? The anime or the manga? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done gathering your thoughts, Anon?\" Arachne said to you, \"I can only imagine your journey here was pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she know about that and your name? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead seeing Saint Peter at the pearly gates your slowly opening eyes find something completely different. You find yourself lying on a paved ground in front of a statue and building you've seen from a certain web animation you have watch. You're at Beacon Academy from RWBY now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make sense out of this while you get off the ground. Your body feels different, maybe a few years younger till you're around 17, and as if you've trained for years. Not too weak, not too strong, but the middle ground. You are either having a hallucination on account your head being hit by a speeding truck, or your afterlife is a web animation with anime influences made in Texas. You're not sure what is more rational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens. A swarm of rose petals is coming your way. You know exactly what and more importantly who it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, wearing her volume one outfit, resumes her usual form with open arms, embracing you in a tight hug but also knowing you back to the ground. She's hugging you. Ruby Rose from RWBY is hugging you. You can safely say for a fact you aren't dead. This is feels all too real. You're also enjoying being hugged by one of the cutest girls on the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy you can finally be here with us, big bro!\" Ruby says, utterly confusing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get a chance to even begin with her calling you that your mind is flooded with strange new memories. You couldn't decipher all of them but a few stood out. Ruby's mom Summer trying to comfort a younger you as you both stand in a ruined town, growing up with Ruby and Yang, and you struggling in what you imagine to be a training school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't seem like the regular version of RWBY you are now kn to at all. You have watched your fair share of isekai animes, but one typically don't get sent to an already established fictional world where they get shoehorned into the lives of the characters there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, you can make this work. You wanted an exciting life, and evidently a magic truck heard your wish before granting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do a lot here armed with your knowledge of the show, and who knows what you'll do when you unlock your semblance. With so many possibilities to explore you don't know where you'll end up. However, you are certain some of those possibilities end with you getting your new sisters pregnant.

You must've just gotten here, you do get air sick and if Jaune's anything to go by that air ship probably didn't do you any favors. \"Oh wow you're green, like really green. HEY! Stay with me! Don't go into the light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yugh.... s-sorry guess I... ate something bad...\" you made up sitting at the statue base. Deep breaths, come on in and out. Oh this would be so much easier if your mind wasn't assaulted with new memories too. Closing your eyes didn't help either, it was like a film was hyper imposed against your eyelids every time you blinked. One second it's you with a little Ruby being dragged around in her wagon by Yang and Yourself. The next its you and your foster father, Tai, getting Ruby ready for beacon a year prior. It only added to nausea, and Ruby was looking more concerned seeing you like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah boy you really need somewhere better to get sick... I know! Let me show you my room!\" Ruby said, grabbing your arm and hoisting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yugh Ruby wait...!\" the sudden lurch almost made you spew, a slight chuckle from your new little sister was the only indication that you started being moved against your will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quit being such a stick in the mud mr.cucumber, besides you got to meet my team and Yang definetely wants to see you.\" she said leading you toward the dorms. Another flash of memory when you blinked gave you the picture of a younger yang giving you a noogie with you trying to get her off by biting the arm she had you locked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anwyay, hey keep your eyes open!\" ugh it hurt a little to do that, actually your head was starting to ease up a little. Ruby was leading you under a archway of some sort, near some of the classrooms with the dorms not too far away. \"Like i was going to say, thats the class hall so you'll be spending alot of time there. The cafeteria is over there and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's it got caution over the door?\" you felt the need to ask. Ruby let out another chuckle just as you realized or rather guessed why that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... haha funny story there was a big food fight a little while ago and.... long story short...\" she started to let out a little embarassed yet still having that same confidence you knew her for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang blew a hole in the ceiling,\": you said remembering that episode from volume 2. To which Ruby looked a little surprised <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guess... did dad tell you about that or something?\" Ruby asked, you realizing that you have no idea what you should or shouldn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... uh... well it's Yang so...\" you quickly made up. Ruby rolled her eyes before nodding <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's true... oh speaking of which.\" she said as she brought you into a building \"Welcome to the dorms! Your home away from home, complete with sisters!\" she said no hauling you up the stairs as she went on \"Youre going to love our room! We got the most space compared to the other teams because we made our beds into bunk beds and...\" as she went on the thought occured to you. that food fight happened in volume 2, early volume 2. So it was clear you weren't in volume 1, though you could've pieced that together since you came to beacon after Ruby. Ever still... when were you in the timeline? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you pondered it more Ruby was already at the door to their room and....</span></div></div>",

Yang looked a little confused before she got a good look at your sickly shade of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, er sorry -anon-.\" Yang let out embarrassed. You could only let out a nod before you found your way to whichever bed seemed closest, thankfully yang's, as you held your stomach and groaned. It had gone from feeling like you wanted to throw up to just stabbing stomach pains. \"Geez that looks bad\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're telling me, didn't even have time to go get his stuff.\" Ruby chimed in as you took a breath, a taste forming the tip of your tongue that you couldn't explain till Yang perked up and hurried out the door to both you and Ruby's confusion. A moment later yang returned with a big glass of... milk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here dude drink up, big sister Yang has the cure for what ailes ya.\" she said handing you the glass. Like most things today you had no idea what this was about until your new memories started to catch up to you, Warm milk, dad's cure all, you took the glass and drank it eagerly. It did seem to help, but whether it was because of something hot going into your stomach or your brain just associating it with feeling better you couldn't tell. All you could tell is that whatever the hell had been stabbing at you had stopped, Yang let out a chuckle \"Glass of milk keeps the doctor away.\" she said, a call back to numerous times where your dad would proclaim the same whenever you three felt Ill. For the most part it seemed to work... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"except for strep\" Ruby added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and for bee stings\" you chimed in as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a appendix bursting.\" Yang finished, a shiver going down everyone's spine. That was not a fun summer for Yang. Ruby started to crack up, probably thinking about how you would piggy back Yang around when she wanted to go outside and how she'd hit you to go faster when Ruby used her semblance to beat you guys in races. It was infectious and soon all three of you were a bunch of laughing dolts as you began to reminisce. Like the time where you and Ruby had a race to see who could climb the most trees in one day and you broke left hand as a result. Or the times that you and Yang would play action figures with Ruby and how those times would result in you two playing the real fight. Or the time mom and dad took you three to vale for a fesitival and you got lost behind a vendor but your uncle Qrow found you and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more time you spent talking about these new memories the more it seemed that you felt a earnest connection with them. Yes in your mind you knew the truth, they were just a couple of characters from a show you loved admittedly but still it was a fiction. Yet in this moment, You could feel in your heart that yes these were your sisters, and you loved them. The three of you spent a while talking about the past before...</span></div></div>",

They were four different colors, red, white, yellow, and black. Approaching the book, you jumped back as it opened up automatically and words began to appear.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nGreetings human from Earth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have died and been reborn in the world of Remnant.

There are no second chances. If you die here, you die for good. To help you adjust, you will be given a weapon, skills for how to use it, and a Semblance of your choice. Be warned, Semblances cannot be all powerful and should you choose one that exceeds the limit, you will be given a random one instead.

The halberd also had a rifle built in. You shifted it a couple times into all forms and it felt like you\u2019ve been doing it all your life.

Copying abilities was considered too, but knew you had to settle on something versatile, that was more defined. However, you were afraid whatever you chose would be too powerful and the world would give you a random useless Semblance, like detecting weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, an idea came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the Seven Deadly Sins manga recently and one of the best characters, Ban, had an amazing skill that could Steal. You could use that a lot here. Not only did it steal physical abilities and items, but you also might be able to use it for other things. Semblances were supposed to evolve in Remnant. You grinned to yourself as you stepped out into the world with that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun greeted you and fresh air filled your lungs as you emerged from a cave on a cliff side. Enjoying the view, you almost tripped over a backpack. Looking down, you found it with some Lien, the currency of RWBY, a Scroll which was a cellphone, clothes, weird cardboard cracker things and a water bottle, and some dust vials. You had no idea how to use dust though, but your weapon used it, so you needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you saw an apply hanging from a tree about twenty feet from you. Now was a good chance to practice your Semblance. You reached out, imagining grabbing that apple and boom, it appeared in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet!\u201d You cried out, biting into it. \u201cSo, I guess the first thing I have to do is find the city.\u201d You looked around and realized you had no idea where to go. \u201cHow about a sign whoever is watching over me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snort to your right drew your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, you saw what looked like a black bipedal wolf.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/ZnBb9cNdrHrUg4oE9\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/ZnBb9cNdrHrUg4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Beowolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was a lot more fearsome in person than in the TV show. It stood taller than you and was big and muscular. You may know how to use your weapon, but killing was something you did not have experience in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The monsters are much more frightening then you read about or watch on a TV. Plus they bled and killing is not as easy as shows made you believe it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled back as the Beowolf slashed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do this!\u201d You tell you self, gritting your teeth. \u201cYou have to or you\u2019re going to die! You have the skills!\u201d The Beowolf slashed at you and you stepped to the side, your body moving by reflex. Raising your halberd, you steadied your reserve and slashed diagonally downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grimm was cut in half with a single blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour strength must have been enhanced when you were brought over or Aura was just that impressive. The Two halves of the Grimm fell over and you collapsed to your knees. Nausea overcame you as the sight of what you just did. There was a little bit of black blood, but the body began to dissolve before a lot gushed out. They didn\u2019t have the same organ structures as true living things did. That helped settle your stomach a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to get use to this, aren\u2019t I?\u201d You muttered.

You wanted to see if you could use your Semblance to steal an arm or leg. Nothing happened. Frowning, you focused on something smaller, like an organ. If you could wipe out Grimm with just a thought, your life would be much easier. Still nothing. Growling to yourself, you imagined what Ban did in the manga and used his ability to steal power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt stronger. Much stronger. The Grimm collapsed on the ground, having tripped, before continuing its pursuit of you, albeit a much slower pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can steal power from enemies just like Ban. This power was going to be perfect. The Grimm reached you and you swiped through it with your halberd again. This time, there was barely any resistance. As it died, you could feel your new power vanish instantly. Seems your Semblance only let you steal power of alive things. Looking at the other Beowolves coming as you, your halberd was quickly turned into axes and you used this fight to train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to get over the gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last Beowolf fell with the axe firmly embedded in its skull. You were now pretty sure you were proficient enough to survive. Transforming your weapons back into a halberd, you stood before the Ursa. It changed you and you side stepped, it, slashing at it\u2019s leg. You amputated it easily enough and it fell over. Jumping into the air, you brought your weapon down into its back, ending its life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you jumped off the disappearing body and looked up at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot it was time to find your way back to a city. You had a strong feeling to go south and that\u2019s where you went. After traveling for about an hour\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It collided into the Grimm\u2019s jaw and sent the Ursa flying. She put a hand over her eyes like a visor to watch. As she did that, a Beowolf snuck up on her and prepared to slash her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d You yell, throwing an axe at the Beowolf. Nora turned around right as the axe hit the Beowolf in the back of it\u2019s head, causing it to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Ren\u2026 you aren\u2019t Ren!\u201d Nora declared, as if you had a choice in the matter. \u201cUnless you learned how to transform. Did you, Ren? That would be so cool.\u201d Before you could answer, someone else did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Nora.\u201d Ren said, stepping into view. \u201cHe\u2019s not me.\u201d<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/GAzbxx8Vkc7BCS8h9\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/GAzbxx8Vkc7BCS...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well then, thanks for the assist.\u201d Before you could say anything, she dashed over to you and wrapped her arms around you.

He and I are partners at Beacon and were out here training. Are you a student too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnon,\u201d You introduce yoru self and shake Ren\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd no. I\u2019m not a student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a full fledged Hunter?!\u201d Nora gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, no.\u201d You laughed. \u201cI was\u2026 not available to take the entrance test, so I\u2019ll have to wait unitl next year unless there\u2019s some special entrance exam I can take.\u201d You shrugged. \u201cI was actually a little lost. I fought a pack of Beowolves and one of them tore up my map. Can you point me in the direction of Vale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat way.\u201d Ren said. \u201cWe were actually about to head back ourselves. You\u2019re welcome to come with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be great, thank you.\u201d You said, going over and picking up your axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that was awesome!\u201d Nora told you. \u201cYou were like, Nora! I\u2019ll save you! And threw your axe. It weaved between three trees and blew up the Grimm on contact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Ren looked amuse and both of you knew that didn\u2019t happen. But this was Nora and she liked to exaggerate. You decided to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty good like that. Takes some practice getting the wrist motion right.\u201d Nora laughed at your words and smacked you in the back, almost knocking you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re awesome!\u201d She said. \u201cWant to be friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d You replied and looked between her and Ren. \u201cI\u2019m new to Vale, so any friends would be great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, you should totally come with us Grimm hunting some time.\u201d Nora said, giving you another bone breaking hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Ren warned. \u201cOnce you\u2019re friends with Nora, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d He nodded at you. \u201cBut I have no issues with being friends. We can introduce you to our teammates some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will love our fearless leader,\u201d Nora assured you. \u201cHe cut a an Ursa Major in half with a single blow once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA single blow?\u201d You asked, interestedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you headed back to Vale, Nora was telling you all about her teammates. You began to get an inkling of where you were in the timeline. Forever Falls had happened, so Jaune wasn\u2019t being bullied by Cardin anymore, but you were curious as if the battle of the docks where Black, Sun, and Ruby fought Torchwick. Or if the breach happened. You could hardly ask that and decided to let them talk. Once you were in Vale, you could use your scroll to connect to the internet and check on the time line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also traded numbers with Ren and Nora.

Unlike the show which only gave them limited screen time, they were real people in this world and you got to learn a bit about them. Naturally, they didn\u2019t tell you everything about their past, but they did mention they were orphans. You told them your parents had died too, and were living on your own. That created another bond and Nora now considered you a close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrived in Vale, you waved goodbye to your friends and started looking around. Being in the city was a lot different from actually watching the show. Streets were busy, humans and Faunus were mulling around, and countless stores you never knew existed were open. You sat down on a bench and began to skim the headlines in recent weeks. There was mentions of the Vytal festival, but nothing about a breach. If that had happened from the attack in Mt. Glenn, it would be everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what time had you arrived at?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrowed it a bit before the breach and initiation had occurred. That was still a pretty big gap. Not only that, you had limited amount of Lien. You needed to get a source of income if you wanted to survive. Based on prices of apartments and hotels, you probably could last a month, maybe two if you really ate stingy.

It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to stay out in the open waiting for us to find her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t just yell at people without hearing their side of the story, she wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d Yang growled. \u201cYou always jump to conclusions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZip it.\u201d Yang interrupted. \u201cI know you have reasons, most people do. But when we find her, I am going to make her explain yourself, then you two can talk out all your differences, even if I have to lock you two in a closet until you kiss and make up. Now let\u2019s hurry. Ruby and Penny are searching the other side of the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHah!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now knew what your situation was. Blake had just run away from the others after they discovered she was a Faunus. That meant the attack at the docks was about to happen. If things played out like normal, Roman Torchwick would escape and there would be some explosions. Blake would meet up with her team and things would kind of work out. You could let things play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf things play out, Roman will eventually die and Cinder\u2019s plans would work out. You couldn\u2019t just come out and tell everyone about the situation. Was there something you could do to change things in the long run? Maybe help the main cast subdue him before things get out of hand? However, what if you could do something to solve your problems and put a cog into Cinder\u2019s plans?

At first, it was just Ruby and then Penny to help Blake and Sun. You need Weiss and Yang there too. Somehow you had to convince them to be there without contacting the cops.

After Roman broke free, the fight started and she was helped by a monkey Faunus you knew was named, Sun.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/8/88/Vol_6_Sun_Wukong.png/revision/latest?cb=20190105050539\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when things began to change do to your influence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake!\u201d A young girl called out and in a flash, several White Fang were knocked away as a girl in a red cape and gothic style dress appeared, wielding an enormous scythe.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/c/ce/Vol3_Ruby_ProfilePic_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20160422133820\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby Rose, the main heroine of RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby?\u201d Blake gasped. \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not alone.\u201d Yang yelled jumping into the fray. \u201cYou are in so much trouble!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang?\u201d Blake gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to have a long talk when we get back.\u201d Weiss said, creating several glyphs and sending White Fang flying. \u201cYou had us all worried sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Weiss.\u201d Blake muttered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to talk.\u201d Weiss said again. \u201cBut after this. I\u2026 want to hear your side of the story.\u201d Blake blinked and looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Roman demanded. \u201cA high school reunion? Shouldn\u2019t it be past your bedtime kids?\u201d He looked around at his troops all falling one after another. \u201cThey\u2019re brats. What the hell is wrong with your animals? Get up and fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d Yang said, slamming her fists together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly knew you had to intervene. You ran out of your hiding spot and pulled out your halberd as she closed in on Roman. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw you approach. Grinning, he stepped back. In a way, you were really impressed. He could tell you were not on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, to your right!\u201d Blake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was able to see you coming just in time and raised her guard as you hit her with a horizontal cleave with your halberd. Her aura absorbed the damage, but the force sent her flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Ruby cried, holding her weapon up. Yang sprung to her feet and prepared herself for a follow up attack that never came from you. Blake and Weiss ran up and lined up with their teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t look friendly after all. With your brown cloak covering most of your body and hair, you also had a makeshift mask to cover your face. It closer resembled a certain bandit leader over the White Fang and gave a distinct impression. You glanced over at Roman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I take it you didn\u2019t help me for no reason.\u201d He said conversationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWandering mercenary looking for some work that pays well,\u201d You reply. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would be interested in hiring my service?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had a good initial impression.\u201d Roman said. \u201cTell you what. I got some transportation about to arrive, you keep me from being captured and you\u2019re hired, along with a hefty sign in bonus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward and put your Halberd on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s up to something.\u201d Weiss warned. \u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they only knew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew what you were taking form them and you needed to concentrate. It was a very small, but important item. \u201cTry to smile for the camera.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost it.\u201d Yang told the others. \u201cLet\u2019s get\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she finished the sentence, you swiped your hand horizontally and then pocketed the bundle in your pocket before they could see it. None of them noticed and you couldn\u2019t see any major changes either. Yet you had the objects, so it should work. It had to work or you were in trouble. A quick prayer was in order. Your Scroll was still being held up, as you couldn\u2019t show weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Ruby agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them started forward\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proved to be a terrible mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soooooo glad you had your Scroll on record mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had in your pocket was countless tiny strips of clothes. Your Semblance let you instantly take something from a distance into your hand. You couldn\u2019t pull physical things from people or Grimm, like appendages or organs, which you were kind of glad for. You could steal streangth, but only part of it. The exact limits were still unknown, but you didn\u2019t have time to practice. Because of this, you went for the nice easy option of the least amount you had to steal, but would also not hurt Team RWBY. Not physically at least. Mental scars might remain since you took all the threat holding their clothes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s why as they stepped forward, their clothes literally fell apart off their bodies, leaving them nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as they all looked down at themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream was heard all over the docks. Roman\u2019s mouth was open in shock as you turned around and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to go.\u201d You tell him as you put your Scroll away. \u201cWhy they are distracted.\u201d That snapped him back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way, kid.\u201d Roman dashed off and you followed, the girls too mortified to follow. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumiliation, delay tactic, and future blackmail material,\u201d You replied. \u201cEasiest way to get out of this since the cops are sure to show up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou definitely earned a bonus,\u201d Roman stated. \u201cYour suspicious timing though remains in question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, I came to make sure you don\u2019t die.\u201d You tell him. \u201cKeep up this work and that flame bitch is going to get you killed.\u201d You really hoped he understood that code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his darkening expression, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to talk privately.\u201d He told you. This was not a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have so much information you will love. You and Neo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stopped talking as you approached some Bullheads on the docks, White Fang loading up a large crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are heading out, boys!\u201d Roman declared. \u201cGot some brats and cops on their way. Move, move, move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you followed him, ignoring the looks from the White Fang members. You were too busy thinking about what was going to happen to you if Team RWBY found you. There was also how much you could tell Roman without altering the future in a way you couldn\u2019t predict.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why the hell were the kids there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one else could answer and you chose not to. The Bullhead landed outside of Vale for a fraction of a second to let you and Roman off, before flying off into the distance. Roman looked at you and snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment a sharp pain hit you in the back of the head as you slammed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, kid.\u201d Roman said, as you felt a piece of cold steal ppress against you neck. \u201cYou will tell me everything you know, why you were at the docks, and what your goal is or my associate is going to run through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeo?\u201d You gasped, as your vision was still swimming due to the blow. The weight on your back shifted slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea how he knows about you,\u201d Roman said to the person on your back. \u201cHe knows about Cinder too, so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want you to kill him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snap was a signal and there was something else for a killing blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou going to talk, or what?\u201d Roman asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, my goal is to keep you alive,\u201d You gasped. \u201cIf you continue this route with Cinder, you\u2019re going to get killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d Roman chuckled. \u201cYou from the future?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s say I believe you,\u201d Roman continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Dust being stolen used for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMt. Glenn underground railroad to blow a hole into Vale to let the Grimm in.\u201d You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pause and you wished you could see his face. Your face was currently being pressed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter Cinder attacks the Vytal festival with the White Fang, you\u2019re eaten by a Grimm,\u201d You tell him, avoiding some of the more specific details. \u201cCinder then convinces Neo it was someone else\u2019s fault and uses her as an attack dog to steal her true objective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is her objective?\u201d Roman asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t it to disrupt the festival and destroy Vale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, her boss wants to destroy everything and she needs a certain relic Ozpin is hiding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight on your back lifted off you and you were able to stand up.

Also, Maidens can control more than just one element, they can control multiple. They just settle one an element they like. Looking at her name, you can tell. Her actual Semblance is Glass Manipulation. Conjure blades and things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that.\u201d Roman admitted and rubbed his chin. \u201cShe wants the other half of the maiden\u2019s power and a relic at Beacon. So much so she\u2019s going to throw all of Vale into disarray with Grimm and collapse the kingdom to get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d You confirmed. \u201cYou are expendable to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPreaching to the choir, boy.\u201d Roman took out a cigar and started smoking. \u201cI have a meeting with her tomorrow. Shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised it only took this long to convince you,\u201d You admit. \u201cI figured it would take a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid, I\u2019ve seen a lot of strange shit and you filled in gaps I was missing.\u201d Roman eyed him. \u201cI still don\u2019t fully trust you. There doesn\u2019t seem a reason for you to keep my alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly for Neo,\u201d You joked and she tilted her head and then smirked. \u201cSeriously though, it\u2019s cause you\u2019re needed. Someone with your resourcefulness and thinking outside of the box is going to come in handy against Cinder and her allies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If all three of us attacked her, do you think we could win?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo and Roman stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m average at best with my weapon and it\u2019s only cause of my Semblance I can do what I do.\u201d You reached forward toward a rock in the distance and it appeared in your hand. \u201cYou can appreciate it. My ability is Steal. If I can see it, I can take it. Weapons, rocks, threads typing clothes together\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s what you did.\u201d Roman commented and Neo looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d You tossed her your scroll and she played it. A moment later, she fell over laughing. \u201cThought you would enjoy that.\u2019 You turned back to Roman. \u201cCan steal body parts or organs though on a living thing, otherwise I could assassinate her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d Roman sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever said that, I said if we fight her, we would lose.\u201d You corrected him. \u201cYou\u2019re an elite criminal. I assumed you had some plan where we take her out by cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoman laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like this kid, Neo. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay kid, we have to meet her tomorrow night and explain why we failed to get all the dust. She probably knows about you by now from the White Fang, so you and Neo will tag along. After that, we can decide on our next course of action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder was incredibly hot, but extremely deadly.

You indicated you want to avoid changing things too much from what she\u2019s planning, so she doesn\u2019t act outside of your predictions.\u201d You nod your head in agreement. \u201cSo, I had a couple of ideas, but I want to hear yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn how we survive?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could try an assassination attempt,\u201d You admit. \u201cThat will end her and stop all of her plans, but her associates wouldn\u2019t take this lying down. Someone else would show up. They might leave you alone, if you want to risk it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m not risking my life on a maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we could just go along with her plan,\u201d You continue. \u201cIf we meet her, I\u2019ll either pass her inspection or die to her fire.

You are then tossed backwards by the same unseeable hands. You turn your head around to see a new golden portal shining brightly with its glory in this dark void. It is also where the unseen hands are throwing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken by the sound of an eighteen wheeler on the move, and look up to see the ceiling of a truck trailer despite the darkness. Was all the portal thing just someone drugging you? Whoever hit you with their truck and kidnapped you is going to have Hell to pay the moment you get your hands on a phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA golden light suddenly illuminated the trailer, washing you over with the greatest warmth you have ever felt. You covered your eyes with an arm as the brightness was too much for you, yet you couldn't escape the light. You hear a booming laugh echo throughout the trailer that rang in your ears. It echoed for what seemed to be forever. You moved down your eyes' shield to see the shape of a figure emerging in the light. Even with the light you could tell the figure possessed a physique of an idealized Roman deity. You felt small by this imposing figure, and in the back of your head you know this was no mere man. He was more than a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips tremble as the words escaped your mouth. \"A-Are you God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, no.\" The figure dismissed casually, his chuckle as warm as the light that shines. \"I go by many names in the myriad of existences,\" he says as the light dims down ever so slowly. \"But you may call me <b>Trucker-Buddha!</b>\" He introduced himself in a rich baritone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light vanished revealing the man who calls himself \"Trucker-Buddha\" wearing a white satin robe with red trim at the end and neck over his muscled body. His face resembled that of a certain blue-collar comedian. \"I found this form to be most pleasing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou questioned yourself over how an idealized form of Larry the Cable Guy was pleasing to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now arise, Anon. We have to discuss your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha snapped his wizen fingers and finely crafted wooden table manifested. He sat crossed leg and you followed suit as it appeared he expected you to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dead?\" Was the first you thing you blurted out without second thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha shaked his head dismissively. \"No, my friend. You are not dead. You have been chosen to be much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrows raised intrigued. \"Chosen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the avatar of the one known as Truck-Kun, the 18-wheeled Ferryman. My lord normally selects an individual and whisks them away to other worlds if the world needs a great hero,\" the trucker fabius explains while your head still aches from being mowed down by the truck king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome way of being chosen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But within you I see something a unique quality,\" he says, his gaze peering into your soul, chills running down your spine. \"You have the qualities needed to become what me and my lord call a <i>Worldwalker</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A world what?\" You reply confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Worldwalker, Anon. You will have the ability to slip between the veils of realities, and traverse through all worlds. Many of these worlds are the fictional worlds you have grown to know and love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became incredibly interested at the sound of those words. Ever since you were a kid and a young teen you wished you could hangout with your favorite characters and to see those worlds with your own eyes. This sounds like a dream come true. However, the rational portion of your brain chimed in saying there is a catch. And the next few words out of Trucker-Buddha's mouth confirmed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you can go run along and explore all these realities, you must perform a few tasks for me and my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your eyes locked with his and asked, \"What kind of tasks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First and foremost, hunting down monsters called <i>Glitches</i>.\" He waved his hand and the image of a creature of medium height, monotone grey, white, and black colored, and triangular spikes all over it. \"They emerge when an error in the fabric of a universe occurs. Some among their ranks are those my lord even sent to said universe they manifest in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all sounds similar to the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts. You make a mental note to play it cool when you encounter Sora and his friends so you don't get sued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll take it.\" You shrug. Being a multi-universal cleanup man/errand boy sounds better than your prospects back at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha shakes his head before telling you one of the perks this job. \"I know that there are many of the fairer sex that you have fantasized over, Anon. You may take as many as you desire as your own.\" Now that got your attention. The thought of turning the entire female cast of fictional settings into your harem girls was enough to be an errand boy worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, how do I travel to universe to universe? I don't have to be ran over by your boss again do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha laughed in reply, his hearty laugh once again echoing throughout the trailer. \"The ability to traverse between the realities will is one of many gifts I shall grant you. Once all the glitches in an area has been slain their energy will open a portal for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGifts? What else does he have for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next gift is to make the appearance of women on the monstrous side appear normal less they bring unwanted attention when you bring them to tag along with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one makes sense. You can't have monstergirls looking like monsters in settings they don't belong in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of different worlds appear in front of you.    <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1880964981\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=174651081&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734919940&amp;searchtext=abstraction\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165805199\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=115510325&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7vfqTJlCI\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7vfqTJ...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1447523209&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=140618773\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=266666023\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2088205613\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1880964981\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=174651081&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you examined them your memory connected the dot.

As long as you didn\u2019t try to fuse with the big bad evil guy of worlds, you would probably be okay. Absorption was going to be useful. Touch a large surface of metal to make your entire body nearly indestructible. Will be useful against glitches. You wondered if you managed to catch a bird for ten minutes at higher levels, could you fuse with it and just keep the wings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething to try down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks good,\u201d You admit. \u201cSo when can I start finding girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor every glitch you defeat, you can take one girl from another world,\u201d He told you. \u201cWhen glitches are beaten, they release a lot of energy, which divides into two things. It creates experience for you and will allow you to bring a girl from their world. To prevent worlds form unbalancing after you take someone out, the enrgy creates a copy of them to keep the universe going. In essence, you get the original and a clone remains. Just in case you have to go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the girls are okay with this?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to convince them to come, willingly, forcefully, or brainwashing.\u201d Trucker-Buddha told you. \u201cNow, the first world I\u2019m going to send you to. It\u2019s a very simple world with a very easy glitch. Think of it as a freebie to test everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portal opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, you\u2019re on your own. A phone will be provided with information to help you get around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d You said excitedly and stepped though into the familiar area.

A sign pointing to a place called Viridian City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alone was enough to tell where you were. You didn\u2019t even have to glance at the familiar animals all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pok\u00e9mon world, more importantly, Kanto, the place it all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d You gasped. \u201cI\u2019m actually here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at yourself and admired your new world clothes. Typical sweatshirt and jeans, with decent shoes. There was also a bag on the ground and you picked it up. Inside you found trail food and water, along with a smart phone. You opened it up and red the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>First Mission Details:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ash Ketchum was united with his Pikachu, he started a journey that stretched over countless lands, video games, books, and shows in your world. That has not happened yet in this world. Soon, the renowned Professor Oak will run into Pikachu and bring it back to his lab. The glitch you are looking for is going to interfere with that event. If it does, the entire future of this world will change. When changed forcefully by a glitch that should not exist, the world itself will start to unravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mission is to defeat the glitch and make sure Pikachu and Professor oak meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag you are carrying will always have food and water. The food is only for survivability and is not top class dishes. If you want those, you need to shop in the world you\u2019re at or have a girl in your base who can cook. There will also be a little money for traveling expenses and necessities. You won\u2019t be able to buy a mansion with it, so don\u2019t try. The phone will work in all universes and won\u2019t draw attention. Once you complete this mission, you will be able to travel to a dimension of your choice and work on getting a girl to join you.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no Pokeballs in the bag, which actually disappointed you for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I know what my mission is now,\u201d You sighed. \u201cNever saw the prequel movie so I don\u2019t know much except Pikachu was in Viridian forest. That has to be the forest.\u201d She sat on a rock and thought to yourself. \u201cNo idea what the glitch looks like, but I bet it\u2019s obvious. That leaves me a couple options. One, look around for more information, or two, start practicing using my new powers. If I can\u2019t beat the glitch, it doesn\u2019t matter if I find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsorption would let him absorb the traits of nonliving objects like the rock you were sitting on, metal, or other similar items. Maybe trees if nonliving meant inanimate with your powers. That would be something to try. The next one was Fusion, which would require another living participant. You WERE in a world of Pok\u00e9mon so fusing with one of them would give you powers and probably some weird monster hybrid form. The difficulty was finding a Pok\u00e9mon or something else that would let you hold them for 10 mins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That would be terrible\u2026 and awkward\u2026 and terrible. Status!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box in midair opened up for you to review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust need to touch it?\u201d You stood up and touched the rock you had been sitting on. Nothing happened. \u201cWow, glad I decided to practice. Let\u2019s concentrate I guess?\u201d You imagined the rock flowing into your arm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a tickling sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as your fingers turned grey like the rock and the color continued up your arm. The more you concentrated, the more it flowed up your arm. When the color reached your shoulder you pulled your hand back and gaped at it. The rock you had been sitting on was slightly smaller, as you absorbed the material into your arm. Your were able to flex your arm and fingers without issue. Yet when you touched it with your other arm, it felt like stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy!\u201d You gasped. Turning around, you walked up to a lone tree. Gritting your teeth, you brought your arm back and punched the tree. A shock rippled through the trunk and the leaves rustled. You found out your hand didn\u2019t hurt at all. It really was stone. \u201cThis is so awesome!\u201d You raised your stone fist into the air and laughed. \u201cNow, how do I defuse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated and the color began to recede. Instead of dripping or falling out, it just vanished. Then you eyed the rock and saw the material you had absorbed returned to the rock. You rushed over to it and touched the smooth stone. No cracks or seams were in the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo after I get rid of what I absorb, it goes back to what I took the stuff from,\u201d You muttered. \u201cHandy.\u201d You touched the tree and concentrated. Your hand became bark like in structure, but when you tried to absorb leaves, it didn\u2019t work. \u201cSo there are rules, good to know. I should carry a metal bar or something around in my bag for emergencies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou defused and looked around. Now that you had a chance to enjoy the scene, you recognized some of the Pok\u00e9mon. This was the starter area, so there were only really basic Pok\u00e9mon. It had been years since you played or watched the original games and shows, but you knew some of the iconic ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several of the purple and white rat Pok\u00e9mon: Rattata<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/1/15/Casey_Rattata.png/revision/latest?cb=20150413205450\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/poke...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a flock of the brown and tan Pok\u00e9mon: Pidgey<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/ae/Pidgey_anime.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/ae/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could be friendly and one might be willing to let you hold it for 10 mins.

All the Pidgeys nearby attracted your attention immediately. The question was how could you get near without them attacking or flying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw your backpack over your shoulder and walked around until you saw a flock of Pidgey\u2019s on the ground, pecking at the grass. Slowly, you walked forward, trying not to act threatening. A couple of the Pok\u00e9mon looked up at you as your approached, tilting their heads curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there,\u201d You whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not a bad guy. I\u2019m just want to be friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got within a couple steps of one of the birds, it hopped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d You were nearly begging. \u201cI just want to touch you for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those words escaped your mouth, you realized how bad they sounded. The Pidgey\u2019s recognized your words too and the next thing that happened was them flapping their wings, sending a small tornado at you. The force of the Gust attack sent you flying back as the birds took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u2026\u201d You sighed. \u201cDo I have to go to Pallet Town and get a starter Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to yourself, you sat down on the rock and pulled our some trail mix from your bag. Popping a few pieces into your mouth, you pondered what to do. A couple minutes of thinking with no success, a shadow passed over you and something landed a few feet away. Looking up, you saw a Pidgey staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was staring at your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo\u2026 Do you want some?\u201d You asked, holding out a few pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA happy caw came from the Pok\u00e9mon and it flapped it\u2019s wings excitedly. It\u2019s beak picked a few pieces of granola from your hand and chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, you\u2019re pretty nice,\u201d You mused. \u201cThe other Pidgey\u2019s don\u2019t like me. I\u2019m new to all this and I just happen to like Pok\u00e9mon. Want to hold one for a bit is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgey tilted its head. Then, without warning, it hopped into your lap and settled down. Surprised at the action, you almost fell back but caught yourself. The Pidgey looked up at you and you swore that it was asking if you felt better. Nothing much you could do but nod and present it more food to keep it happy. It let you pet it\u2019s back and rest an arm around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never to try a fusion. You weren\u2019t sure if this was a male or female Pok\u00e9mon, but honestly, it didn\u2019t matter. It was your only option at the moment. It will be a surprise for you. You also had no idea how the fusion process was going to work. Would it absorb the bird through your touch or will you melt together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why you were going to practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated on fusing with the Pidgey.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It slowly climbed up your arm and spread to the feathers of the Pok\u00e9mon. Warmth followed the glow. It was a pleasant feeling and you continued to concentrate. The Pidgey noticed the warmth and looked around, eyeing the glow, but didn\u2019t do anything to get away. You gave it some more food with your free hand to keep it calm. The glow wasn\u2019t super bright, so it wasn\u2019t startling. Like a glow stick during the day. Noticeable, but unless it was night, easy to overlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s how long it took for the glow to completely engulf both of your bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, things got fuzzy and your body felt hot. Things moved that shouldn\u2019t have moved and you felt like a liquid. The weight in your lap vanished as the Pidgey merged with your body. Neither of you could do anything even if you wanted to. The ability had activated and you two were now combining. The feathers grew from your body and your clothes alternated to accompany your new body. Your eyes had a hard time seeing all the changes until it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting down, alone, the Pidgey gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your body was completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feat had shows that only covered the top of your feet, which now resembled bird talons. Your pants still existed and covered your lower half, but it seemed thinner and shorter. Your height shrunk because the Pidgey was much smaller than you. Your arms were now brown feathery wings with no hands. Your chest was devoid of your hoodie, but covered in tan feathers. However, you noticed something differnet you wouldn\u2019t expect even if you fused before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a pair of breasts on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgey had been a female. Maybe that\u2019s why it was willing to cheer you up. You fused with a female Pok\u00e9mon and now had a female body. You check your pants by pulling it open with the tip of your wing. Yep, a girl. You looked around in a slight panic and hopped over to a nearby pond. Looking at your reflection, you saw your face, which was pretty similar with some large eyebrow feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you didn\u2019t have a beak, though your hair resembled Pidgey a bit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, you looked like a Harpy. Which, thinking about it, made sense as you fused a bird and a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a slightly headache as another consciousness in your head collided with yours. The Pidgey was in your mind too and both of you were sharing the body. Since you initiated the power, you had initial control, but the Pidgey was panicking. You could feel like you could suppress it, but decided on a gentler response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m sorry! This power of mine let me merge with you. I need to find something evil in this area and stop it before it hurts everyone. I swear I\u2019ll defuse us.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgey\u2019s mind relaxed as it understood. Your mind was then flooded with Pidgey\u2019s memories and skills it had. It seemed working with them had it\u2019s uses. If you forcefully suppressed its mind, would it tire you out? The Pidgey currently knew Gust and Sand Attack. It was a young Pok\u00e9mon in the starting area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the fusion was over, you had to try out your new body. No humans were around to bother you, so you spread out your new wings, flapped them, and took off into the sky.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After getting used to flying, you began to circle around, looking for any clues on what to do. You actually flew past a flock of Pidgey\u2019s and they didn\u2019t seem to mind you.

There was no way around it and you dove down to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the glitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping your bag on a tree branch, you flew over the Pikachu and the glitch to get into position. The glitch was catching up and up ahead you noticed a cliff face up ahead that was going to stop Pikachu from escaping. You didn\u2019t have much time. The Pikachu slid to a stop and realized what was happening and turned around to face it\u2019s attackers. Sparks shot out of its cheeks as it prepared to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Glitch shot it\u2019s only lightning at it and you realized being fused with a flying type, you were weak to electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like you had time to do anything else though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dove down above Pikachu and flapped your wings aggressively. Wind formed as you made your first Gust attack. The mini tornado flew forward and collided with the glitch, sending it flying back. The Pikachu looked up at you in surprise, never seeing something like you before. Before you could tell it anything, lightning flew from the glitch at you. Somehow your reflexes moved you out of the way in time, barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d You yelled at Pikachu. \u201cIt\u2019s after you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore lightning flew at you from the glitch and you were forced to fly up to dodge. The Pikachu looked like it wanted to listen, but shook it\u2019s head. Electricity began to spark from its cheeks and then fired a blast at the glitch. It made direct contact and briefly stunned it. This gave you the chance to fire another Gust. The glitch was lifted into the air and slammed into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature flickered, like it was fading away, before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on the ground and look at Pikachu. It was watching you wearily. Sighing, you called on your power and defused from the Pidgey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like my job is done,\u201d You tell Pidgey, as Pikachu watched. \u201cI\u2019ll have to leave soon.\u201d Pidgey cawed and tilted it\u2019s head. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can come. It will be lonely. I\u2019m glad I met you. You helped me save this Pikachu. Thanks for letting me fuse with you for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu and Pidgey were both staring at you. You couldn\u2019t take Pikachu, since the quest required it to be saved. Pidgey would be lonely in your home base, with no other Pok\u00e9mon. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You like the setting and the many factions from the Imperium of Man to the Necrons, but you are greatly aware of the many awful and painful ways that you can die here. However, since not all of the factions are here your ways of death are limited to the Orks killing you for fun, the Imperials thinking you're a heretic and killing you, the Eldar killing you because they find your life, and well most human life in general, to be less than one of their own, or the Chaos Space Marines and cultists here torturing you for fun and to appease the Ruinous Powers.

Probably both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, hearing the voice of a Chaos God over your phone didn't utterly destroy your sanity. \"So, Trucker-Buddha,\" you say around the time Colonel Carus Brom executed the men fleeing for their lives as you've seen already dozens of times before, \"Can you get me out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected the worst and were still disappointed when he said in return, \"No I cannot.

How far your gifts of absorption and fusing can take you at their current levels is yet to be determined, but you can always try grabbing a gun a regular human can use.

Space marine scouts will probably knock you on the floor. But trained genetically engineered super soldiers wearing power armor that at least weighs a ton, centuries old space elf soldiers with better reflexes than you, walking and talking fungus with bat attitudes, the former's evil and spikey counterparts, and daemons are probably out of the question. Well, maybe not all the daemons. You sure as heck won't try your luck at taking on the Bloodthirster that eventually comes up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich leads you to a much bigger problem in hindsight. Sindri Myr. You know for a fact you can't take on that heartless bastard with the way you are now even if he's not a daemon prince yet. He'll flay you alive and rip your soul out to make daemon chow if you tried crossing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you can do the most obvious thing for a person with knowledge of the 40k universe can do in your position can do. Follow Gabriel and tell him about Sindri and the Alpha Legion here. If he doesn't believe, you can get Isador to read your mind and that will solve it. Heck, you can prevent Isador from being corrupted by Sindri, and warn the both of them about Kyras being a follower of Chaos too. You'll save the Blood Ravens from wasting hundreds of their lives by invalidating a chunk of the DoW series' storyline(looking at you Boreale).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that might lead this to become a seperate timeline though? You shrugged remembering the policy of what is and what isn't canon in 40k. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: You decide that it's better if you go off on your own knowing the risks.

You don't believe that your host will allow you select something overpowered, and you also want to stray from choosing something too simple. Like mind reading or just being a wizard. You can easily pick those powers up in some of the worlds you will find yourself in. Trucker-Buddha merely waits for you to come up with your final gift. You are not the first new Worldwalker to find himself in this position, and you most definitely will not be the last. Thankfully for him, he has all the time possible to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile deep in thought the memory of the comments of a certain rapper about a certain president emerge bring with them an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yeah I can make that work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to Trucker-Buddha who was drinking a glass of cold sweet tea while you were busy thinking. From the look in your eyes he gathered you finally came up with an idea. You told him about it, and the heavenly trucker prince nodded affirmatively over it. This idea of your was indeed something he could grant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide tv screen appeared over the table and the following words showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>STATUS: Anon<br>\r\nHealth: 125<br>\r\nMana: 125<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinal gift: <span class=\"clred\">DRAGON ENERGY</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Energy(Phase One): This is your default phase. You will always posse enhanced physical strength and senses above a regular human man in addition to pyrokinetic magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Energy(Phase Two): You will gain the form of half man and half dragon for a set amount of time. Your default abilities will be increased further, you gain protective scales, and the ability to fly.</b>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You said confirming this is what you want. You strength, mobility, and to get a start at magic. You were going to go with something like that American Dragon cartoon that once came on, but you did not desire becoming a man sized dragon. You know for a fact that it would get you killed in certain settings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm glow covers you as your new strength buffs your body, something you find oddly pleasurable. Soon a vortex of fire surrounds your feet and soon consumes you whole. Once the fire subsides you take a look at your phase two form. You're still you but with golden scales with red coloration at the ends cover you mostly from head to toe, at the ends of your hands are sharp menacing claws, a medium length tail emerges from the base of your spine, and a set of wings capable of allowing you to take off come from your upper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha rise up and extends his arms long and wide. \"Now, Anon. Show me your dragon energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understood completely what he meant. Normally you wouldn't do this sort of thing to anyone who asks, but you doubt you'll be able to harm an otherworldly being such as him. You inhaled deeply, and exhaled a gout of flame that enveloped Trucker-Buddha whole. Once you were done you saw that you incinerated his glass of tea and table to ash. Whoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" You heard from the pillar of flame that disappeared with an unharmed Trucker-Buddha as you expected. \"You were right to pick this gift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled from his praise only to be overcome with a sense of weakness. You fall down on your back and to your confusion return to normal. You look up at a new tv screen to see your status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>STATUS: Anon<br>\r\nHealth: 125<br>\r\nMana: 15</b>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This gift while a powerful one is however very taxing you see.\" Explains Trucker-Buddha. \"Your second phase will drain you very quickly as you are now. With time you will be able to overcome this. Try to use your fire magic now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as he said, and after several degrees of failure you manage to conjure up only a measly apple-sized fireball. \"Anything else I need to know?\" He then explains to you that any weapon or spell that is extremely effective on dragons will harm you just the same in your second phase. You will keep that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one more thing, Anon. I know you are undoubtedly ready to begin your new life and to snatch up as many women as you can,\" he says while you shrugged as if you had no idea what he was talking about, \"You must also know that with every glitch slain you gain enough energy to take one girl with you back just as it does with allowing you to exit the world. A replica will take her place to keep said universe from being unbalanced in most circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows in curiosity over that. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a character has played their part and is no longer mentioned in the next story does the plot matter if they fade into obscurity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you think about it like that it sounds less cold than it did at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there are worlds that are just destined for destruction. As we speak right now many worlds are being destroyed by a multitude of things ranging from evil gods, the natural course of things, and rituals being performed in dark places. You may take at least 15 girls from these worlds if you visit them at their time of doom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snaps his fingers and you have a feeling of being refreshed as your mana is restored to its peak. \"Take this,\" he says as a cellphone manifests in your hand. \"We will keep in contact this way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat world do you go to for your first job? </span></div></div>",

After that it's all up to you what you do. You can flip the script entirely with your knowledge of the world you're sent to. Turn the female cast into your harem if you wish it.
