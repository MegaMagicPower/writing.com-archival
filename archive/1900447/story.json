Just another boring and ordinary day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate it. How you'd do anything to escape the dullness of your current life and do something exciting for once. Unfortunately for you, your plea is has not gone unheard. You will get your wish. But at a cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the loud horn of an eight-wheeler blast in the air which shouldn't have frightened you. Yet, it did. Something about that horn felt wrong, disturbing you deeply on a primal level. You turn you head to see the truck it originated from, and you entered a state of terror you previously never experienced before. The truck that had an otherworldly aura was speeding your way. You just knew instinctively that the driver, if there is one, is deadset on mowing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTried as you might, your legs can not outrun Truck-Kun, the heavenly 18-wheeler and lord of all trucks. You never had a chance. The divine Kenworth T680 catches up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a grey void where you're the only living thing in this void. This isn't the afterlife you think. You heard the horn of Truck-Kun again, and many portals open in front of you. You are tossed into one of the portals by an unseen force. What portal are you flung into?</span></div></div>",

You grab your head in pain, not that it would do any good to stop the abnormal burning sensation that envelops your brain. The pain momentarily subsides allowing you to notice a new weight on your left arm. You take a look at your arm to find a weird looking device attached to it. Wait, you've seen this thing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a duel disk from the Yugioh anime, specifically one of the standard issue ones the 5ds series. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/e/e5/Player-WC09-M%26F.png/revision/latest?cb=20100215173003\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were younger you and your friends would stick your cards in the duel disk toys and pretend to duel as they did in the show. Good times. You don't recall a toy version of the standard 5ds duel disk ever being made, and it doesn't necessarily feel like it's a toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice there's a deck of cards inside it. You probably need to go to a hospital on account of surviving(you think) being ran over by a truck, but for some reason you don't feel all that bad. You just have a bizarre headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the time to go through the deck you discover they are from deck the player character from the Reverse of Arcadia game originally had before being taken away by a certain psychic duelist. This only adds to the mystery. Who runs a guy over, gives them Yugioh cards, and gives them a duel disk toy(?)? And the cards are also strange. They're not like the typical cards you buy from a pack, they look like they're from the anime. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You need to get out of here before you get mugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way through the alleys you find dozens of faded posters lining up on the dirty walls. A good chunk of them were about where to find duel tournaments at shady sounding locations. One in particular was about something you barely could believe. Unground turbo dueling. You shake your head in confusion, your headache returning. Turbo-dueling doesn't exist in the real world. It only exists in the fictional world of Yugioh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally laughed at dumbest idea you entertained. You were sent the Yugioh world, the 5ds era to be specific, when you got hit by the truck the way some protagonists in animes, mangas, and virtual novels get sent to fantasy worlds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat might explain the cards and duel disk, but it's all too absurd. Your younger self would be extremely happy to be in the world of an anime you loved watching growing up, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are interrupted in your train of thought when a glass bottle makes contact with your head. You feel blood slowly oozing out of the wound, and it does nothing to make your headache any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shucks! He's still up!\" Cackled a deranged voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to see a trio of stereotypical thugs menacingly making their way to you. One held a lead pipe, the other held a switchblade, and the last one had another bottle in his hand. He must have been the one who threw the first one at you. The most striking characteristic about all three of them was they had yellow tattoo-like lines on their faces. The same kind criminals got in 5ds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFug it. You really are in 5ds! And you're about to be mugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can always try what Jack did in that one flashback to scare aways those thugs after Rally. You quickly reach for your deck to take a card out, any card that looks intimidating, and pull out Strong Wing Dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! This will work. You flash Strong Wind Dragon in this manner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mspaintadventures/images/0/07/Ps000013_2.gif/revision/latest?cb=20100924022405\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mspa...</a> in an attempt to look as cool as possible before placing the card on your duel disk. The green dragon materialized as a hologram and unleashed a mighty roar which sounded more realistic than it ought to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does nothing to dissuade the thugs from their goal. You fall to your knees, clenching your head in pain when the headache returns with a vengeance. What happens next wasn't predicted by either you or the thugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrong Wind Dragon inhales before unleashing a blast of powerful wind at the belligerents, knocking them into the brick wall far behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what just happened other than you inflicting real damage similary to what Akiza did in the anime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a psychic duelist?\" You say out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct my new friend.\" You hear a new voice behind you say affirmatively.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's Sayer or Divine as he was called in the Japanese version. This isn't even the presumably nicer Arc-V version of him. It's the manipulative ruthless leader of the Arcadia Movement version of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this Sayer is still alive without a scar you can only assume you are currently in the timeframe before the Dark Signers Arc. Meaning he's still pulling Akiza's strings along with other psychics he's misleading. The man's sick in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about how one moment you got hit by a truck and were sent into an anime world that revolves around a children's card game, got sent to the season that revolves around said card game on motorcycles, and became a psychic before being hit in the head with a bottle is making your headache become extremely unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem that bad off for someone who got hit by a truck, Anon.\" The man says to you, his voice maintaining an illusion of friendliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you not read my mind?\" You ask bluntly. How are you going to keep anything from this guy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get a vibe on you,\" he replies, \"And it's not like I can get too much. That headache of yours plus a million jumbled thoughts running through your mind is making it difficult for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I can tell you already know my name. And I already know your name too. No need for any lengthy introductions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky us.\" You quip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's that unnecessary hostility you have for me out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got hit by a truck and took a bottle to my head on top of having my having my mind feeling like it's about to splinter into a million little pieces as my brain burns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disregarding two of those, I can tell you from experience I know what you're going through, Anon.\" The man said sympathetically, \"Having your powers awaken out of the blue can be quite painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can take a not too wild guess here and  say he wants you to join his little club. You tell him you accept his invitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily you'd want nothing to do with this guy, you've seen what he's really like in the anime and Reverse of Arcadia. However, like it or not Sayer is the expert in controlling psychic powers. Hurting someone, probably yourself included, with your newfound abilities isn't something you want on your conscience. You'll just have to tolerate the wicked psychic before you as long as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also need a place to stay. You don't want to risk getting mugged again. Additionally, you can try your hand at flirting with Akiza and any other psychic babe you come across. </span></div></div>",

For example:<br>\r\n1: Evil Humans and Kishin Eggs both exist as concepts. While only Lord Death and presumably Kid as a full fledged Reaper can tell the difference between a regular human soul and an evil human anyone can see the difference between a human soul, evil or otherwise, and a Kishin Egg Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Generally speaking it really depends on the situation on what causes a person to become a Kishin Egg. Some people can either become them depending on how much madness they have within them, or if an Evil Human has further devolved until they're no longer counted as human but a monster that represents the madness of the person they once were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: Kishin Eggs can eat souls too just like demon weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to the choices here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Student at the DWMA (Meister): you wake up as a student at the DWMA. Pretty simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Student at the DWMA (Weapon): Sams as the above but Truck-Kun felt generous and granted you Demon Weapon genes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: Put on Your Wizard Robe and Hat: You wake up in the Witches' Realm and you are a sorcerer now at least a week before Shaula attacks Death City. What you do is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: Webbed: You wake up as a member of Arachnophobia.

Though your new location is less than welcoming. As your eyes adjust to the room's lighting, not that there is much in, you find yourself on the floor that bears a red spider web pattern with dark green pillars appeared to be made from stone reaching the ceiling. You've seen this place many times before animated and drawn on a manga page. You definitely shouldn't be here. You can even hear that sensual music accompanied by French lyrics playing in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head up to see that giantic spiderweb and there she is. In the center of it is the curvaceous spider witch, looking down upon you with her normally stoic expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now in the Soul Eater, the anime where people can turn into weapons and eat souls, go to an academy where the grim reaper is the headmaster, and try to keep the world safe from those who strayed off into the path of evil and witches. And you just so happened to land into the abode of the witch who's sinister as she is sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a lack of your mind being molested by the overwhelming presence of Asura's madness so you safely assume you are not that far into the anime. Or the manga where Arachne doesn't try to get Asura to fall in love with her but instead leaves her body to become madness which only results in Maka having an easier time killing her. This might actually be a bit of a problem when you think about it. Which version of Soul Eater ARE you in? The anime or the manga? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done gathering your thoughts, Anon?\" Arachne said to you, \"I can only imagine your journey here was pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she know about that and your name? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ok.\" you take a breath \"The main character is named Ruby Rose, Leomond is betraying you and the person taking the Fall Maiden's power is Cinder Fall, she'll be here for the festival with a full team of criminals under cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin was silent for a second and then took out his scroll. He typed something out and looked back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you for the warning.\" He said with a smile \"I'll look into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do, if you don't Ironwood goes insane.\" You say \"Anyway, how long will I be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on you.\" Ozpin says \"If you want I can enroll you under... special circumstances into Beacon Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You said automatically, eager to live out your fantasy. (Possibly some of your dirty fantasies too.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin smile still on his face typed on his scroll some more. \"Eager I see. Well, you'll prove to be a most effective addition to our arsenal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he left you in your room and you fell asleep quickly.</span></div></div>",

You're at Beacon Academy from RWBY now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make sense out of this while you get off the ground. Your body feels different, maybe a few years younger till you're around 17, and as if you've trained for years. Not too weak, not too strong, but the middle ground. You are either having a hallucination on account your head being hit by a speeding truck, or your afterlife is a web animation with anime influences made in Texas. You're not sure what is more rational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens. A swarm of rose petals is coming your way. You know exactly what and more importantly who it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, wearing her volume one outfit, resumes her usual form with open arms, embracing you in a tight hug but also knowing you back to the ground. She's hugging you. Ruby Rose from RWBY is hugging you. You can safely say for a fact you aren't dead. This is feels all too real. You're also enjoying being hugged by one of the cutest girls on the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy you can finally be here with us, big bro!\" Ruby says, utterly confusing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get a chance to even begin with her calling you that your mind is flooded with strange new memories. You couldn't decipher all of them but a few stood out. Ruby's mom Summer trying to comfort a younger you as you both stand in a ruined town, growing up with Ruby and Yang, and you struggling in what you imagine to be a training school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't seem like the regular version of RWBY you are now kn to at all. You have watched your fair share of isekai animes, but one typically don't get sent to an already established fictional world where they get shoehorned into the lives of the characters there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, you can make this work. You wanted an exciting life, and evidently a magic truck heard your wish before granting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do a lot here armed with your knowledge of the show, and who knows what you'll do when you unlock your semblance. With so many possibilities to explore you don't know where you'll end up. However, you are certain some of those possibilities end with you getting your new sisters pregnant.

The light grew warmer and you came across a stone chamber. In the middle, surrounded by 4 torches, was a pedestal with a book. You frowned and the colors of the torches caught your eye. They were four different colors, red, white, yellow, and black. Approaching the book, you jumped back as it opened up automatically and words began to appear.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nGreetings human from Earth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have died and been reborn in the world of Remnant. This world should be familiar to you, so we can skip the explanation. The reason you were summoned was this world needs warriors. The path is up to you. Will you be a villain or hero? There are no second chances. If you die here, you die for good. To help you adjust, you will be given a weapon, skills for how to use it, and a Semblance of your choice. Be warned, Semblances cannot be all powerful and should you choose one that exceeds the limit, you will be given a random one instead. When you exit this chamber, have it in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You muttered. \u201cI\u2019m in RWBY?\u201d You blinked and grin. \u201cI\u2019m in RWBY!\u201d You yelled. It was one of your favorite serious and you loved the characters. Armed with some of the knowledge, you might be able to help out and even bag one of the hot girls. Glancing at the wall, you noticed a weapon. \u201cHuh, a halberd?\u201d You picked it up and knowledge about it flooded into your mind. \u201cSweet, a mechoshift one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned into two hand held axes and those axes could be high caliber pistols. The halberd also had a rifle built in. You shifted it a couple times into all forms and it felt like you\u2019ve been doing it all your life. You practiced a few swings and it felt natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is sooooo cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the only exit that suddenly appeared, you realized you needed to think of a Semblance. You wish you had rules on what was considered \u2018all powerful.\u2019 You assumed that mean no reality warping or immortality. Thinking back to some of the anime and other shows you watched, you finally thought of an idea and stepped through to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Semblance did you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could use that a lot here. Not only did it steal physical abilities and items, but you also might be able to use it for other things. Semblances were supposed to evolve in Remnant. You grinned to yourself as you stepped out into the world with that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun greeted you and fresh air filled your lungs as you emerged from a cave on a cliff side.

You wanted to see if you could use your Semblance to steal an arm or leg. Nothing happened. Frowning, you focused on something smaller, like an organ. If you could wipe out Grimm with just a thought, your life would be much easier. Still nothing. Growling to yourself, you imagined what Ban did in the manga and used his ability to steal power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt stronger. Much stronger. The Grimm collapsed on the ground, having tripped, before continuing its pursuit of you, albeit a much slower pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can steal power from enemies just like Ban. This power was going to be perfect. The Grimm reached you and you swiped through it with your halberd again. This time, there was barely any resistance. As it died, you could feel your new power vanish instantly. Seems your Semblance only let you steal power of alive things. Looking at the other Beowolves coming as you, your halberd was quickly turned into axes and you used this fight to train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to get over the gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last Beowolf fell with the axe firmly embedded in its skull. You were now pretty sure you were proficient enough to survive. Transforming your weapons back into a halberd, you stood before the Ursa. It changed you and you side stepped, it, slashing at it\u2019s leg. You amputated it easily enough and it fell over. Jumping into the air, you brought your weapon down into its back, ending its life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you jumped off the disappearing body and looked up at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot it was time to find your way back to a city. You had a strong feeling to go south and that\u2019s where you went. After traveling for about an hour\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Forever Falls had happened, so Jaune wasn\u2019t being bullied by Cardin anymore, but you were curious as if the battle of the docks where Black, Sun, and Ruby fought Torchwick. Or if the breach happened. You could hardly ask that and decided to let them talk. Once you were in Vale, you could use your scroll to connect to the internet and check on the time line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also traded numbers with Ren and Nora. They were going to be useful.<br>\r\n\u2003<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You enjoyed talking to Ren and Nora. Unlike the show which only gave them limited screen time, they were real people in this world and you got to learn a bit about them. Naturally, they didn\u2019t tell you everything about their past, but they did mention they were orphans. You told them your parents had died too, and were living on your own. That created another bond and Nora now considered you a close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrived in Vale, you waved goodbye to your friends and started looking around. Being in the city was a lot different from actually watching the show. Streets were busy, humans and Faunus were mulling around, and countless stores you never knew existed were open. You sat down on a bench and began to skim the headlines in recent weeks. There was mentions of the Vytal festival, but nothing about a breach. If that had happened from the attack in Mt. Glenn, it would be everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what time had you arrived at?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrowed it a bit before the breach and initiation had occurred. That was still a pretty big gap. Not only that, you had limited amount of Lien. You needed to get a source of income if you wanted to survive. Based on prices of apartments and hotels, you probably could last a month, maybe two if you really ate stingy. You needed a way to either get into Beacon or make a lot of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlllllaaaaaakkkkkeeee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was yelling and you looked up. Rounding the corner were two girls One was blonde and muscular while the other had white hair and shorter. Both were very attractive and you recognized them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang Xiao-Long: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/e/ef/Yang_ProfilePic_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20151201091453\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a> <br>\r\nWeiss Schnee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/4/43/Weiss_ProfilePic_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20161031035106\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlllllllaaaaaaaakkkkkeeeeee!\u201d Yang called again. \u201cCome on out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike yelling is going to work.\u201d Weiss huffed, crossing her arms. \u201cShe ran from us. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to stay out in the open waiting for us to find her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t just yell at people without hearing their side of the story, she wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d Yang growled. \u201cYou always jump to conclusions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZip it.\u201d Yang interrupted. \u201cI know you have reasons, most people do. But when we find her, I am going to make her explain yourself, then you two can talk out all your differences, even if I have to lock you two in a closet until you kiss and make up. Now let\u2019s hurry. Ruby and Penny are searching the other side of the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHah!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now knew what your situation was. Blake had just run away from the others after they discovered she was a Faunus. That meant the attack at the docks was about to happen. If things played out like normal, Roman Torchwick would escape and there would be some explosions. Blake would meet up with her team and things would kind of work out. You could let things play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf things play out, Roman will eventually die and Cinder\u2019s plans would work out. You couldn\u2019t just come out and tell everyone about the situation. Was there something you could do to change things in the long run? Maybe help the main cast subdue him before things get out of hand? However, what if you could do something to solve your problems and put a cog into Cinder\u2019s plans? You might be the bad guy at first, but this could work out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, it was just Ruby and then Penny to help Blake and Sun. You need Weiss and Yang there too. Somehow you had to convince them to be there without contacting the cops. You quickly slipped into a store and got a piece of paper and then a cloak from another, making sure to keep track of where Weiss and Yang were. You quickly wrote down a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Cat Faunus will be at the docks tonight. From your tone today, I assume you didn\u2019t want the police involved. You might want to bring weapons.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should encourage just enough interest for Yang and Weiss would have no choice to come along. Folding the paper into a plane, you carefully aimed and tossed the place before ducking into a store. You head a shout and knew you hit your mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in my hair!?\u201d Yang cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still a second.\u201d Weiss scolded. \u201cIt\u2019s a paper airplane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho threw that?!\u201d Yang demanded, turning around and no one stepping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang\u2026\u201d Weiss said slowly, after opening up the paper. \u201cLook at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely see and hear them out of the window and hoped they wouldn\u2019t notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey know who Blake is\u2026 so it\u2019s a lead.\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe should let Ruby know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t find her, we follow up on this?\u201d Yang asked and Weiss nodded. The two of them took off and you breathed a sigh of relief. That was phase one of your plan. Roman would have a hard time fighting all four at once without an Atlas Paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for stage two. I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubt you could improve your combat skills ahead of time. You would have to rely on your current weapon skills. You could practice using your Semblance though. A couple hours of heavy practice might come in handy. You also had Lien, so shopping for supplies to enact your plan might be required. Of course, it would be a long night, so you might want to think about getting some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was uncomfortable and it wasn\u2019t like you set up some pillows and blankets to cover the cold hard ground. You were also tired, as you spent most of the day practicing your Semblance. Out of everything you could improve, that was the one that could be tested the fastest. Since you could steal items from a distance, even if people were holding them, you figured it would give you a chance to change the tide of battle. People wouldn\u2019t expect for you to suddenly wield their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you had to get to the docks early. You didn\u2019t know exactly when Roman Torchwick would arrive with the White Fang and you couldn\u2019t afford to miss it. You had exactly one shot. Finally, after almost two hours of waiting, you saw Roman Torchwick arrive with the White Fang.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/kz1d78mSFUgSqoqs5\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/kz1d78mSFUgSqo...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrothers and sisters of the White Fang\u2026!\u201d A girl shouted, putting a sword against Roman\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/d/d3/V2_09_00048.png/revision/latest?cb=20141002233120\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time.\u201d You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Blake, giving her speech about the White Fang and them now working for Roman.

I\u2026 want to hear your side of the story.\u201d Blake blinked and looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Roman demanded. \u201cA high school reunion? Shouldn\u2019t it be past your bedtime kids?\u201d He looked around at his troops all falling one after another. \u201cThey\u2019re brats. What the hell is wrong with your animals? Get up and fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d Yang said, slamming her fists together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly knew you had to intervene. You ran out of your hiding spot and pulled out your halberd as she closed in on Roman. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw you approach. Grinning, he stepped back. In a way, you were really impressed. He could tell you were not on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, to your right!\u201d Blake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was able to see you coming just in time and raised her guard as you hit her with a horizontal cleave with your halberd. Her aura absorbed the damage, but the force sent her flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Ruby cried, holding her weapon up. Yang sprung to her feet and prepared herself for a follow up attack that never came from you. Blake and Weiss ran up and lined up with their teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t look friendly after all. With your brown cloak covering most of your body and hair, you also had a makeshift mask to cover your face. It closer resembled a certain bandit leader over the White Fang and gave a distinct impression. You glanced over at Roman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I take it you didn\u2019t help me for no reason.\u201d He said conversationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWandering mercenary looking for some work that pays well,\u201d You reply. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would be interested in hiring my service?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had a good initial impression.\u201d Roman said. \u201cTell you what.

You won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward and put your Halberd on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s up to something.\u201d Weiss warned. \u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they only knew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None of them noticed and you couldn\u2019t see any major changes either. Yet you had the objects, so it should work. It had to work or you were in trouble. A quick prayer was in order. Your Scroll was still being held up, as you couldn\u2019t show weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Ruby agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them started forward\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proved to be a terrible mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soooooo glad you had your Scroll on record mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you had in your pocket was countless tiny strips of clothes. Your Semblance let you instantly take something from a distance into your hand. You couldn\u2019t pull physical things from people or Grimm, like appendages or organs, which you were kind of glad for. You could steal streangth, but only part of it. The exact limits were still unknown, but you didn\u2019t have time to practice. Because of this, you went for the nice easy option of the least amount you had to steal, but would also not hurt Team RWBY. Not physically at least. Mental scars might remain since you took all the threat holding their clothes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s why as they stepped forward, their clothes literally fell apart off their bodies, leaving them nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as they all looked down at themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream was heard all over the docks. Roman\u2019s mouth was open in shock as you turned around and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to go.\u201d You tell him as you put your Scroll away. \u201cWhy they are distracted.\u201d That snapped him back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way, kid.\u201d Roman dashed off and you followed, the girls too mortified to follow. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumiliation, delay tactic, and future blackmail material,\u201d You replied. \u201cEasiest way to get out of this since the cops are sure to show up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou definitely earned a bonus,\u201d Roman stated. \u201cYour suspicious timing though remains in question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, I came to make sure you don\u2019t die.\u201d You tell him. \u201cKeep up this work and that flame bitch is going to get you killed.\u201d You really hoped he understood that code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his darkening expression, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to talk privately.\u201d He told you.

Move, move, move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you followed him, ignoring the looks from the White Fang members. You were too busy thinking about what was going to happen to you if Team RWBY found you.

Your face was currently being pressed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter Cinder attacks the Vytal festival with the White Fang, you\u2019re eaten by a Grimm,\u201d You tell him, avoiding some of the more specific details. \u201cCinder then convinces Neo it was someone else\u2019s fault and uses her as an attack dog to steal her true objective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is her objective?\u201d Roman asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t it to disrupt the festival and destroy Vale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, her boss wants to destroy everything and she needs a certain relic Ozpin is hiding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight on your back lifted off you and you were able to stand up.

Also, Maidens can control more than just one element, they can control multiple. They just settle one an element they like. Looking at her name, you can tell. Her actual Semblance is Glass Manipulation. Conjure blades and things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that.\u201d Roman admitted and rubbed his chin. \u201cShe wants the other half of the maiden\u2019s power and a relic at Beacon. So much so she\u2019s going to throw all of Vale into disarray with Grimm and collapse the kingdom to get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d You confirmed. \u201cYou are expendable to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPreaching to the choir, boy.\u201d Roman took out a cigar and started smoking. \u201cI have a meeting with her tomorrow. Shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprised it only took this long to convince you,\u201d You admit. \u201cI figured it would take a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid, I\u2019ve seen a lot of strange shit and you filled in gaps I was missing.\u201d Roman eyed him. \u201cI still don\u2019t fully trust you. There doesn\u2019t seem a reason for you to keep my alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly for Neo,\u201d You joked and she tilted her head and then smirked. \u201cSeriously though, it\u2019s cause you\u2019re needed. Someone with your resourcefulness and thinking outside of the box is going to come in handy against Cinder and her allies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If all three of us attacked her, do you think we could win?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo and Roman stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m average at best with my weapon and it\u2019s only cause of my Semblance I can do what I do.\u201d You reached forward toward a rock in the distance and it appeared in your hand. \u201cYou can appreciate it. My ability is Steal. If I can see it, I can take it. Weapons, rocks, threads typing clothes together\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s what you did.\u201d Roman commented and Neo looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d You tossed her your scroll and she played it. A moment later, she fell over laughing. \u201cThought you would enjoy that.\u2019 You turned back to Roman. \u201cCan steal body parts or organs though on a living thing, otherwise I could assassinate her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d Roman sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever said that, I said if we fight her, we would lose.\u201d You corrected him. \u201cYou\u2019re an elite criminal. I assumed you had some plan where we take her out by cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoman laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like this kid, Neo. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay kid, we have to meet her tomorrow night and explain why we failed to get all the dust. She probably knows about you by now from the White Fang, so you and Neo will tag along. After that, we can decide on our next course of action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder was incredibly hot, but extremely deadly. One wrong move and you would die in a fire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have some more talking to do.\u201d Roman turned to you and offered you a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You replied and took it.

You indicated you want to avoid changing things too much from what she\u2019s planning, so she doesn\u2019t act outside of your predictions.\u201d You nod your head in agreement. \u201cSo, I had a couple of ideas, but I want to hear yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn how we survive?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could try an assassination attempt,\u201d You admit. \u201cThat will end her and stop all of her plans, but her associates wouldn\u2019t take this lying down. Someone else would show up. They might leave you alone, if you want to risk it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m not risking my life on a maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we could just go along with her plan,\u201d You continue. \u201cIf we meet her, I\u2019ll either pass her inspection or die to her fire. Then you could risk your life with things to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a good option for either of us. Risky, but if you are allowed in the plan, it might help at the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have one other idea,\u201d You admit. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to be the one to do the talking. You can spin it the right way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d He looked interested. \u201cGo on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe go to Ozpin at Beacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cup slammed down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou nuts, kid? Ozpin?! You do remember who I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know enough about the situation that he won\u2019t have a choice but to listen to us,\u201d You remind him. \u201cHe\u2019ll listen to us neutrally. We might be able to convince him to let us stay. Or at least me. This way, I can monitor Cinder\u2019s group from that side. We feed each other information for survival. However, I\u2019m not sure I can explain the situation in a way that would exude confidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Roman glanced at Neo. \u201cAll ideas have risk and merits.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are then tossed backwards by the same unseeable hands. You turn your head around to see a new golden portal shining brightly with its glory in this dark void. It is also where the unseen hands are throwing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken by the sound of an eighteen wheeler on the move, and look up to see the ceiling of a truck trailer despite the darkness. Was all the portal thing just someone drugging you? Whoever hit you with their truck and kidnapped you is going to have Hell to pay the moment you get your hands on a phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA golden light suddenly illuminated the trailer, washing you over with the greatest warmth you have ever felt. You covered your eyes with an arm as the brightness was too much for you, yet you couldn't escape the light. You hear a booming laugh echo throughout the trailer that rang in your ears. It echoed for what seemed to be forever. You moved down your eyes' shield to see the shape of a figure emerging in the light. Even with the light you could tell the figure possessed a physique of an idealized Roman deity. You felt small by this imposing figure, and in the back of your head you know this was no mere man. He was more than a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips tremble as the words escaped your mouth. \"A-Are you God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, no.\" The figure dismissed casually, his chuckle as warm as the light that shines. \"I go by many names in the myriad of existences,\" he says as the light dims down ever so slowly. \"But you may call me <b>Trucker-Buddha!</b>\" He introduced himself in a rich baritone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light vanished revealing the man who calls himself \"Trucker-Buddha\" wearing a white satin robe with red trim at the end and neck over his muscled body. His face resembled that of a certain blue-collar comedian. \"I found this form to be most pleasing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou questioned yourself over how an idealized form of Larry the Cable Guy was pleasing to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now arise, Anon. We have to discuss your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha snapped his wizen fingers and finely crafted wooden table manifested. He sat crossed leg and you followed suit as it appeared he expected you to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dead?\" Was the first you thing you blurted out without second thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha shaked his head dismissively. \"No, my friend. You are not dead. You have been chosen to be much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrows raised intrigued. \"Chosen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the avatar of the one known as Truck-Kun, the 18-wheeled Ferryman. My lord normally selects an individual and whisks them away to other worlds if the world needs a great hero,\" the trucker fabius explains while your head still aches from being mowed down by the truck king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome way of being chosen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But within you I see something a unique,\" he says, his gaze peering into your soul, chills running down your spine. \"You have the qualities needed to become what me and my lord call a <i>Worldwalker</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A world what?\" You reply confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Worldwalker, Anon. You will have the ability to slip between the veils of realities, and traverse through all worlds. Many of these worlds are the fictional worlds you have grown to know and love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became incredibly interested at the sound of those words. Ever since you were a kid and a young teen you wished you could hangout with your favorite characters and to see those worlds with your own eyes. This sounds like a dream come true. However, the rational portion of your brain chimed in saying there is a catch. And the next few words out of Trucker-Buddha's mouth confirmed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you can go run along and explore all these realities, you must perform a few tasks for me and my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your eyes locked with his and asked, \"What kind of tasks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First and foremost, hunting down monsters called <i>Glitches</i>.\" He waved his hand and the image of a creature of medium height, monotone grey, white, and black colored, and triangular spikes all over it. \"They emerge when an error in the fabric of a universe occurs. Some among their ranks are those my lord even sent to said universe they manifest in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all sounds similar to the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts. You make a mental note to play it cool when you encounter Sora and his friends so you don't get sued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll take it.\" You shrug. Being a multi-universal cleanup man/errand boy sounds better than your prospects back at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha shakes his head before telling you one of the perks this job. \"I know that there are many of the fairer sex that you have fantasized over, Anon. You may take as many as you desire as your own.\" Now that got your attention. The thought of turning the entire female cast of fictional settings into your harem girls was enough to be an errand boy worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, how do I travel to universe to universe? I don't have to be ran over by your boss again do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha laughed in reply, his hearty laugh once again echoing throughout the trailer. \"The ability to traverse between the realities will is one of many gifts I shall grant you. Once all the glitches in an area has been slain their energy will open a portal for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGifts? What else does he have for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next gift is to make the appearance of women on the monstrous side appear normal less they bring unwanted attention when you bring them to tag along with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one makes sense. You can't have monstergirls looking like monsters in settings they don't belong in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of different worlds appear in front of you.    <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1880964981\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=174651081&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734919940&amp;searchtext=abstraction\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165805199\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=115510325&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7vfqTJlCI\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7vfqTJ...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1447523209&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=140618773\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=266666023\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2088205613\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1880964981\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=174651081&amp;searchtext=\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you examined them your memory connected the dot.

I\u2019ve seen a lot of interesting things online with those powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Trucker-Buddha considered, rubbing his chin. \u201cI suppose that would be acceptable.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYour mind tells me you know a lot about this type of thing. Your skills will develop over time and start off weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured as much,\u201d You sighed. \u201cHoped otherwise, but I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Trucker-Buddha laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll grant you your abilities.

Example: Touching Iron with your hand will make your hand like Iron. Longer the contact, further it spreads. Small quantity of material can only change so much. Higher levels spell increases absorption speed and requires less material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFusion: (Living) Level 1: Allows you to fuse yourself with another living being. This requires ten minutes of direct contact and concentration, or Fusion will not work. High levels will speed up the time required for a fusion. Higher levels will also allow you to adjust the fused state to keep certain attributes of who you fused with. Max level will let you look exactly like the fused target if you prefer. Warning: If opponent is significantly mentally stronger than you, they may take over the fusion until you defuse.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t like the last sentence very much, but fusing was kind of risky. As long as you didn\u2019t try to fuse with the big bad evil guy of worlds, you would probably be okay. Absorption was going to be useful. Touch a large surface of metal to make your entire body nearly indestructible. Will be useful against glitches. You wondered if you managed to catch a bird for ten minutes at higher levels, could you fuse with it and just keep the wings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething to try down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks good,\u201d You admit. \u201cSo when can I start finding girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucker-Buddha laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor every glitch you defeat, you can take one girl from another world,\u201d He told you. \u201cWhen glitches are beaten, they release a lot of energy, which divides into two things. It creates experience for you and will allow you to bring a girl from their world. To prevent worlds form unbalancing after you take someone out, the enrgy creates a copy of them to keep the universe going. In essence, you get the original and a clone remains. Just in case you have to go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the girls are okay with this?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to convince them to come, willingly, forcefully, or brainwashing.\u201d Trucker-Buddha told you. \u201cNow, the first world I\u2019m going to send you to. It\u2019s a very simple world with a very easy glitch. Think of it as a freebie to test everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portal opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter that, you\u2019re on your own. A phone will be provided with information to help you get around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d You said excitedly and stepped though into the familiar area.

A sign pointing to a place called Viridian City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alone was enough to tell where you were. You didn\u2019t even have to glance at the familiar animals all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pok\u00e9mon world, more importantly, Kanto, the place it all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d You gasped. \u201cI\u2019m actually here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at yourself and admired your new world clothes. Typical sweatshirt and jeans, with decent shoes. There was also a bag on the ground and you picked it up. Inside you found trail food and water, along with a smart phone. You opened it up and red the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>First Mission Details:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ash Ketchum was united with his Pikachu, he started a journey that stretched over countless lands, video games, books, and shows in your world. That has not happened yet in this world. Soon, the renowned Professor Oak will run into Pikachu and bring it back to his lab. The glitch you are looking for is going to interfere with that event. If it does, the entire future of this world will change. When changed forcefully by a glitch that should not exist, the world itself will start to unravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mission is to defeat the glitch and make sure Pikachu and Professor oak meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag you are carrying will always have food and water. The food is only for survivability and is not top class dishes. If you want those, you need to shop in the world you\u2019re at or have a girl in your base who can cook. There will also be a little money for traveling expenses and necessities. You won\u2019t be able to buy a mansion with it, so don\u2019t try. The phone will work in all universes and won\u2019t draw attention. Once you complete this mission, you will be able to travel to a dimension of your choice and work on getting a girl to join you.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no Pokeballs in the bag, which actually disappointed you for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I know what my mission is now,\u201d You sighed. \u201cNever saw the prequel movie so I don\u2019t know much except Pikachu was in Viridian forest. That has to be the forest.\u201d She sat on a rock and thought to yourself. \u201cNo idea what the glitch looks like, but I bet it\u2019s obvious. That leaves me a couple options. One, look around for more information, or two, start practicing using my new powers. If I can\u2019t beat the glitch, it doesn\u2019t matter if I find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsorption would let him absorb the traits of nonliving objects like the rock you were sitting on, metal, or other similar items. Maybe trees if nonliving meant inanimate with your powers. That would be something to try. The next one was Fusion, which would require another living participant. You WERE in a world of Pok\u00e9mon so fusing with one of them would give you powers and probably some weird monster hybrid form. The difficulty was finding a Pok\u00e9mon or something else that would let you hold them for 10 mins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Status!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box in midair opened up for you to review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust need to touch it?\u201d You stood up and touched the rock you had been sitting on. Nothing happened. \u201cWow, glad I decided to practice. Let\u2019s concentrate I guess?\u201d You imagined the rock flowing into your arm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a tickling sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as your fingers turned grey like the rock and the color continued up your arm. The more you concentrated, the more it flowed up your arm. When the color reached your shoulder you pulled your hand back and gaped at it. The rock you had been sitting on was slightly smaller, as you absorbed the material into your arm. Your were able to flex your arm and fingers without issue. Yet when you touched it with your other arm, it felt like stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy!\u201d You gasped. Turning around, you walked up to a lone tree. Gritting your teeth, you brought your arm back and punched the tree. A shock rippled through the trunk and the leaves rustled. You found out your hand didn\u2019t hurt at all. It really was stone. \u201cThis is so awesome!\u201d You raised your stone fist into the air and laughed. \u201cNow, how do I defuse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated and the color began to recede. Instead of dripping or falling out, it just vanished. Then you eyed the rock and saw the material you had absorbed returned to the rock. You rushed over to it and touched the smooth stone. No cracks or seams were in the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo after I get rid of what I absorb, it goes back to what I took the stuff from,\u201d You muttered. \u201cHandy.\u201d You touched the tree and concentrated. Your hand became bark like in structure, but when you tried to absorb leaves, it didn\u2019t work. \u201cSo there are rules, good to know. I should carry a metal bar or something around in my bag for emergencies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou defused and looked around. Now that you had a chance to enjoy the scene, you recognized some of the Pok\u00e9mon. This was the starter area, so there were only really basic Pok\u00e9mon. It had been years since you played or watched the original games and shows, but you knew some of the iconic ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several of the purple and white rat Pok\u00e9mon: Rattata<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/1/15/Casey_Rattata.png/revision/latest?cb=20150413205450\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/poke...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a flock of the brown and tan Pok\u00e9mon: Pidgey<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/ae/Pidgey_anime.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/ae/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could be friendly and one might be willing to let you hold it for 10 mins.

All the Pidgeys nearby attracted your attention immediately. The question was how could you get near without them attacking or flying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw your backpack over your shoulder and walked around until you saw a flock of Pidgey\u2019s on the ground, pecking at the grass. Slowly, you walked forward, trying not to act threatening. A couple of the Pok\u00e9mon looked up at you as your approached, tilting their heads curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there,\u201d You whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not a bad guy. I\u2019m just want to be friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got within a couple steps of one of the birds, it hopped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease?\u201d You were nearly begging. \u201cI just want to touch you for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those words escaped your mouth, you realized how bad they sounded. The Pidgey\u2019s recognized your words too and the next thing that happened was them flapping their wings, sending a small tornado at you. The force of the Gust attack sent you flying back as the birds took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u2026\u201d You sighed. \u201cDo I have to go to Pallet Town and get a starter Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to yourself, you sat down on the rock and pulled our some trail mix from your bag. Popping a few pieces into your mouth, you pondered what to do. A couple minutes of thinking with no success, a shadow passed over you and something landed a few feet away. Looking up, you saw a Pidgey staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was staring at your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo\u2026 Do you want some?\u201d You asked, holding out a few pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA happy caw came from the Pok\u00e9mon and it flapped it\u2019s wings excitedly. It\u2019s beak picked a few pieces of granola from your hand and chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, you\u2019re pretty nice,\u201d You mused. \u201cThe other Pidgey\u2019s don\u2019t like me. I\u2019m new to all this and I just happen to like Pok\u00e9mon. Want to hold one for a bit is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgey tilted its head. Then, without warning, it hopped into your lap and settled down. Surprised at the action, you almost fell back but caught yourself. The Pidgey looked up at you and you swore that it was asking if you felt better. Nothing much you could do but nod and present it more food to keep it happy. It let you pet it\u2019s back and rest an arm around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never to try a fusion. You weren\u2019t sure if this was a male or female Pok\u00e9mon, but honestly, it didn\u2019t matter. It was your only option at the moment. It will be a surprise for you. You also had no idea how the fusion process was going to work. Would it absorb the bird through your touch or will you melt together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why you were going to practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated on fusing with the Pidgey.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It slowly climbed up your arm and spread to the feathers of the Pok\u00e9mon. Warmth followed the glow. It was a pleasant feeling and you continued to concentrate. The Pidgey noticed the warmth and looked around, eyeing the glow, but didn\u2019t do anything to get away. You gave it some more food with your free hand to keep it calm. The glow wasn\u2019t super bright, so it wasn\u2019t startling. Like a glow stick during the day. Noticeable, but unless it was night, easy to overlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s how long it took for the glow to completely engulf both of your bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, things got fuzzy and your body felt hot. Things moved that shouldn\u2019t have moved and you felt like a liquid. The weight in your lap vanished as the Pidgey merged with your body. Neither of you could do anything even if you wanted to. The ability had activated and you two were now combining. The feathers grew from your body and your clothes alternated to accompany your new body. Your eyes had a hard time seeing all the changes until it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting down, alone, the Pidgey gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your body was completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feat had shows that only covered the top of your feet, which now resembled bird talons. Your pants still existed and covered your lower half, but it seemed thinner and shorter. Your height shrunk because the Pidgey was much smaller than you. Your arms were now brown feathery wings with no hands. Your chest was devoid of your hoodie, but covered in tan feathers. However, you noticed something differnet you wouldn\u2019t expect even if you fused before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a pair of breasts on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgey had been a female. Maybe that\u2019s why it was willing to cheer you up. You fused with a female Pok\u00e9mon and now had a female body. You check your pants by pulling it open with the tip of your wing. Yep, a girl. You looked around in a slight panic and hopped over to a nearby pond. Looking at your reflection, you saw your face, which was pretty similar with some large eyebrow feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you didn\u2019t have a beak, though your hair resembled Pidgey a bit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, you looked like a Harpy. Which, thinking about it, made sense as you fused a bird and a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a slightly headache as another consciousness in your head collided with yours. The Pidgey was in your mind too and both of you were sharing the body. Since you initiated the power, you had initial control, but the Pidgey was panicking. You could feel like you could suppress it, but decided on a gentler response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m sorry! This power of mine let me merge with you. I need to find something evil in this area and stop it before it hurts everyone. I swear I\u2019ll defuse us.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgey\u2019s mind relaxed as it understood. Your mind was then flooded with Pidgey\u2019s memories and skills it had. It seemed working with them had it\u2019s uses. If you forcefully suppressed its mind, would it tire you out? The Pidgey currently knew Gust and Sand Attack. It was a young Pok\u00e9mon in the starting area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the fusion was over, you had to try out your new body. No humans were around to bother you, so you spread out your new wings, flapped them, and took off into the sky.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whatever the reason, you flew around with them a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you parted ways and swooped down to pick up your bag with your talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing seemed out of the ordinary,\u201d You sighed. \u201cNot sure what I was expecting. Smoke from the forest? A giant dead zone? Anything?\u201d You sighed again loudly and stretched, your hands touching your feather chest. A shock of pleasure went through your body. \u201cNo, bad. This can be later, right now, focus!\u201d Your snacked your cheeks with the tip of your wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you had a girl harpy body, there was a time and place for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to figure out what I have to do.\u201d You muttered. \u201cWhere am I supposed to go? The forest or town are really only nearby locations.\u201d You looked down at yourself. \u201cProbably shouldn\u2019t go into town like this so I can check out the forest first I guess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat then-\u2026?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped and spun around. An older man with hiking clothes was staring at you in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 hi?\u201d You replied awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can talk!\u201d The man cried out. \u201cMonster!\u201d He turned and ran. \u201cThat\u2019s no Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d You muttered. What did you do now?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You flapped your wings and took off, your bag in your talons. Besides the town, which you couldn\u2019t go in your fused body, there was only the forest. Pikachu was supposed to be from there and you needed to find him. The glitch was after that poor mouse and your job was to protect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew over the tree tops, looking around. You saw a lot of bug and plant Pok\u00e9mon. Seeing all the Pok\u00e9mon you grew up memorizing was crazy, but a once in a life time experience. Though, it was dangerous too. You had to avoid a hive of Beedrills, giant bee Pok\u00e9mon, or risk being attacked. The forest was dense, but not completely covered. There were gaps for you to see everything as you flew over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidgey in your mind began to tell you something. It couldn\u2019t talk, but you understood. It knew what you were looking for and it noticed the yellow mouse running along the forest floor.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/9GZPcdLd9Uj4HK9QA\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/9GZPcdLd9Uj4HK...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is.\u201d You smiled, hoping it was the right one. Pikachu\u2019s were rare and it wasn\u2019t like you expected to see a bunch. You flew off after it to see what it was doing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
