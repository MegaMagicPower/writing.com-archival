She decided to check it out before calling it in to the others incase it was just some simple thugs she could easily take care off. She landed in front of the warehouse the alarm was coming from the lock on it was broken and the door was ajarred open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the area to see if she could see anyone before going in incase it was a trap but not seeing anything she decided to go in. She made some of her black energy cover her hands ready to blast anyone or anything that might jump out at her. She slipped in doing her best not to move the door to much so not to let anyone know someone else might have entered the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around quitely in the warehouse for anyone that wasn't suppose to be here it was a bit hard as the warehouse was big, dark, quite a lot of boxes. As she moved between boxes been quite as she can she hadn't seen anyone else in the warehouse. She soon came to the middle of the warehouse which to see to her surprise was cleaned of any boxes leaving a fifteen foot square space free of anything but one thing a chair. Which was in the center of the cleared space it was bolted to the ground with brown leather and looked comfortable. But she could see bondages on the arms and legs of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what that is for\" Raven said, dropping her guard for a moment which was a moment to long<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you\" A voice said behind her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven turned around to attack the person but it was to late as she felt a sharp pain in the back of her head and then saw complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Some time later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was slowly coming to in a gruggy state her head was still hurting from the hit she tried to raise a hand to rub the sore spot but her hand was stopped. She looked down at her hands thankfully where she was, was still dark so her eyes really didn't need to adjust to anything. She saw that her hand was bonded by some leather strap she pulled it a few times hoping to break them but it held strong. That is when she notice her other hand and even feet where bonded the same she gave them all a pull but again they held strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken her a few seconds but she soon realize she was still in the warehouse and not only that but strap to the chair in the middle of the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Raven said, still trying to break the bonds but her physical strength was good enough to break them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh my magic\" She said, feeling stupid having forgotten about that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azarath Metrion Zinthos\" Raven chanted out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of her bonds releasing her or breaking off or something nothing had happen. Which had surprise and worried Raven a bit she chanted her words again a few times but again nothing happen. She even tried to make her black energy form around her hands but it wasn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening? Why won't my powers work?\" Raven asked no one perticaullar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be because of the amulets\" A voice answered her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven looked up to see who spoke but suddenly a bright light shined down on her from above causing her to shut her eyes. She whinced a little trying to see who was talking but her eyes haven't adjusted yet so she could only see a shadowy blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see I placed three special amulets in the chair they have the effect to cancle any magical abilities in other words your magic is been cancled and you can't use it.\" The voice said, Raven can hear the person grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me? Who are you? Why you doing this?\" Raven asked still struggling against the bonds which made the person laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother I know without your magic your strength is only that of a average human and you will need strengh of that of Cyborg to break out of those\" The voice said laughing still a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? What do you what with me? Raven asked her eyes now starting to adjust to the light as she open them wider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we start with interductions first then get to the why I have you here part\" The voice said as the person stepped in the light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven's eyes where fully adjusted and open them wide to see who it was which only made her eyes go wider as before her stood....?</span></div></div>",

And popped one in her mouth and she ate it her eyes widen as her taste bubs had a orgasim from the flavor it was the best thing she tasted and it tasted just like her most favorite fruit strawberrys. She ate the puff happily with a big smile without her powers going out of control and blowing anything up. Though she was disppointed when she had to swallow it as the flavor was now more a echo in her mouth she looked at the puffs wondering if she could have more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have another if you like\" The old woman said with a smile as if reading Ravens mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Raven said as she popped another one into her mouth moaning a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have as much as you like deary just help yourself\" The old woman said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven could only smile as she started to pop more and more of the puffs happily into her mouth not noticing that as she ate them that her stomach was slowly starting to become softer and bulge a bit out. Soon though the tray was empty as her stomach was now buldging a inch or so out though the half demon didn't seem to notice. She licked her lips getting some of the cream off her lips happily the old woman smiled at her and then brought out another tray full of puffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some more deary\" The old woman said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven licked her lips as she looked at the puffs as her stomach gave a little growl as she rubbed it she was still hungry but wasn't sure if she would like more or not.

Her stomach was buldging another inch or two out making her leotard a bit tighter though she still seemed not to notice or care. The rest of her body seemed to have a bit of fat on it as well though not to noticable as she did seem to be starting to get a second chin and her arms and legs seemed to be a bit bigger. Even her ass and breast seemed to have gotten slight bigger but the dark goth girl wasn't noticing the only one who did was the old woman as she smiled at Raven's growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care for some more my dear.\" The woman asked her smile plastered still to her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you already gave me two tray's of samples?\" Raven asked not wanting to eat them all though she would love to but her good heart was still there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of it's fine I had made well over dozens of tray's I was hoping to use them to get bussiness to pick up but you have been the only one in. So I thought you been the first one in deserves to have as much as you desire so you can have as many puffs you want until your full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok thank you ma'am.\" Raven happily said with a large grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the girl need to hear to take the next tray of puffs from the elderly woman not noticing the slightly evil grin she head or seemed to care. She watched Raven eat the puffs not knowing that the woman had put a spell on them that would fatten women up and increase there gulity and greed for food making them want to eat more and more, and to never feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even if Raven knew this at this point would probably be pointless as she seemed only to care about eating the puffs the women gave her. Raven had probably gone throw at lease seven or nine more since her third tray of the puffs not really keep track of how much she ate. Her stomach was now at lease half if not three fourth the size of a basketball which pressed tightly against her leotard, she had a full formed second chin her cheeks where about twice as big now. Her breast had also gone up a cup size or two also now pressing hard against her leotard if anyone looked they could see her nipples pressing throw the fabic seem to cut throw it. Her arms and legs at lease had two or three inches of fat around them making them look slightly flab. Her thighs where only a inch or so from toughing together and her ass was quiet bigger now at lease about one forth of a size of a basketball. Her leotard starting to become wedged into her growing ass as some of the fat of her ass started to escape from the sides of her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven moaned a bit in pleasure rubbing her belly that was full of food though in her mind she was still quite hungry her stomach even let out another growl of hunger. But she wasn't sure if she should eat more or not the temtastion was quite strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some more to eat dear I have some cookies and pie ready if you like?\" The elderly woman asked with a large plate of a dozen or more cookies on it and a pie in her other hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of both was quite strong and luring the the fat half demon she was even drooling a bit but pulled herself back before taking either food from the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I mean I have ate quite a bit and don't want to eat to much and get fat.\" Raven said not aware how fat she was or if it was the spell from letting her know how fat she had already gotten<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now your a growing girl and growing girls need there food\" The woman said acting as if Raven had gotten fat already<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...?\" Raven then said</span></div></div>",

Raven gorgued throw the cookie's putting one or two cookie's at a time not caring she was having crumbs fly out of her mouth. About half way done with the cookie's Raven started digging into the pie which turned out to be strawberry her favorite she used a fork eating it from it's pan. And as she gorged her body started to swell big with more fat her stomach and breast strained her outfit more the fabic slowly starting to tear on the side and front of her stomach and breast. Though only small rips as her stomach reach the size of a full basketball and her breast at lease now EE or FF-cups now. Her ass cheeks was also now half the size of basket each half them spilling out on each side as the lower part of her leotard became more of a thong now to her growing ass. Her meaty thighs where now finally touch both pushing a lease half a foot out on each side of her, her arms where also more chucky as her fingers where twice as big and her bicups that where nice and thing now wiggling and jiggling with fat as she grabbed food and stuffed it into her fat face. Which now had a third chin and puffy cheeks looking like she had a golf ball stuffed in each one. She hand crumbs and pie filling around her mouth as she ate having become quite slob as her glutiny and greed for food taking full force of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman couldn't help but smile as she watched Raven grow fatter and bigger by the moment as she brought more and more treats for the girl. And not just pie's or cookie's but all kinds of doughnuts, eclairs, cakes, and so on to her, Raven not noticing or caring as long as she had food in front of her to eat she was happy. Soon she throw the fork she was using to eat pie and cake away and grab large chunks and globs of it with her hands and stuffed them into her fat face. Getting more cream and filling around her mouth and face as she ate her body buldging and sweeling around her as the rips on her clothing also go large to make room for her fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let a grunt out of slight pain as she feasted as her clothes reach there limits the rips on her belly showed quite a lot of skin her belly button full few for all to see and her nipples where pretty much showing at this point. The bottom part of her leotard was more of a piece of string to her large cellerite covered ass. But this didn't stop her she kept feast stuffing more and more food until finally a large rip was let out. Her clothen had ripped to rags now as they feel from her body letting her half the size of a beach ball belly cover her large lap. Her basketball size breast bounced and giggled with freedom as they fall to the side of her large gut even her large ass that was now twice the size of her breast pushed out a bit more with freedom. But Raven didn't care she was sitting there naked only wanted to stuff herself with more food which she did. She continued to eat for at lease three more hours before she stopped resting from her feast for a bit rubbing her large gut and now weighted about?</span></div></div>",

Jason also finds himself attracted to Blackfire when they first meet, which in turn, is at a point when Blackfire defends him from some bullies with her \"starbolt capabilities\" out of desire to atone for what she did out of it ending up being that it led to Blackfire feeling ashamed of herself over it all and regretting it all, with it all being that at some point after Blackfire's aforementioned \"residence\" is obtained with her aforementioned methods, Jason immediately starts to find himself attracted to her, and circumstantially living in a residential place of the same type that's on the same floor where and is as such across the hallway side from where Blackfire lives-due to their \"places\" being due to these places they live in being upstairs-and-downstairs house-like residential apartment places in the same flat-roofed-building, he \"contributes\" to Blackfire's \"weight gain\" from trying to cheer up Blackfire with \"foods\" that he brings to her in a way that allows him to do so unnoticed, with that, in turn, being out of Jason being shy, etc.. Though eventually Blackfire knows about Jason \"bringing foods\" to her, etc., only to not care about being skinny or fat anymore, by then. Blackfire finds out about that has been \"bringing her foods\" in the way that he has, etc., after her first day for her part-time-taste-testing job at that, but surprisingly is not angry with Jason about it due to it being that she doesn't care about it due to her appetite and all her other reasons. Thus, eventually, it leads to Blackfire introducing Jason to her sister Starfire when the latter and her friends cross paths with Blackfire. By then, Blackfire and Jason already have managed to admit their attractions to each other and the causes for these attractions, but have not \"gone official about it all\" as far as \"Earth\" \"Terms\" among chosen words used for things like these go, etc..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption II: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit like Option II, but with some differences: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe differences are as follows: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all begins four years before the aforementioned \"Episode\" and \"Episode Stpryline\" events when Blackfire \"arrives\" \"on\" \"Earth\" and obtains her very type of and aforementioned residential place with the methods she uses, combined in Option I with methods of taking an option offered to her by a human-born stranger of business-like stature ends up being one who Blackfire runs into after her mentioned methods and offers her such a \"place\" without \"anyone having known about it\" and allowing it to be that Blackfire remains an \"unidentified individual\" with her \"arriving on Earth\" and \"into Jump Coty\" in a way that allows her to be able to \"start out\" as \"an \"unidentified individual\"\", all the while who \"no one has ever heard the name of or seen the face of\", and all the while this four years before the aforementioned \"Episode\" and \"Episode Storyline\" events when Jason first meets Blackfire when the aforementioned events from Option I occurring when they meet. After the way they first meet goes as described in Option I with it being for the aforementioned reasons, with it being that for a few days, Jason slowly but surely starts to find himself attracted to Blackfire and upon hearing her sounds from her shedding tears of shame, regret, sorrow, etc., while on his way out to the place that they both later on become co-workers for each other at, decides to try and cheer up Blackfire without her knowing of it with the use of \"foods\", with his wanting her to not know of it, his attractions to her or the likes of it especially being out of shyness. Blackfire, by then, however, still doesn't care about being skinny or fat anymore, etc., but eventually is curious about who has been \"continuously\" managed to \"bring food\" to her. All the while, all but in turn, thus, she still finds out about it all and where Jason circumstantially loves, etc., some point after her first part-time taste tester part-time job day, still not caring about it all due to her aforementioned reasons, etc. and still not angry with Jason about it all, but she tells Jason that she wishes he just told her. She helps him overcome his shyness, etc., as well. Though one thing to add here is that after her first part-time-job-as-a-taste-tester-type-part-time job day, she finds out when after a few months of Jason secretly managing to \"secretly \"bring food\"\" \"to\" Blackfire, Jason leaves an undamaged white flower pelt and anonymous note in which he confesses his feelings for her that come from the reasons his feelings for her come from, but without his name being confirmed on the note, it thus ends up being that Blackfire decides to watch out for whoever it is while at her home and finds out it is Jason, with the aforementioned results being what they are, etc., only for Blackfire to have already found herself attracted to Jason and even having invited him over after her first day for her taste-tester-part-time-job via writing on a notepad paper her address, etc., with a suggested time, etc., only for Jason to not show up out of shyness which had depressed Blackfire into binge-eating over-eating sessions that increase her appetite some more up to right when she finds out what Jason has been up to. He confesses his shyness being the reason for his not showing up, with Blackfire still not knowing Jason's feelings for her at that point only for Blackfire to offer to help him overcome his shyness, all the while still without Jason knowing that she, Blackfire, also has feelings for him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings as they say from here, are for readers and/or other users to decide.</span></div></div>",
