Their job was to scout out one of Orochimaru's bases in the Land of Fire and hopefully use the information within to locate more of Orochimaru's hidden bases. just where did everything go wrong. Let's start with the trap door that opened up shortly after her team entered the base. She should have seen it with her Byakugan, but she didn't have it active like she should have. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid, Hinata Hyuuga thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trap door didn't open straight down, instead it opened up into a sort of, slide which then split off in several direction. She tried to steer herself so that she went with at least one of her teammates, but the surfaces of the trap were made of some sort of chakra resistant material that made it impossible to stick to. She eventually came to a stop in some sort of lab. Hinata immediately activated her Byakugan and entered the basic Gentle fist stance ready for anything. Anything except a for a dart that struck her in the neck through the Byakugan's blind spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hinata came to she found herself bound to a table in a different room, COMPLETELY NAKED! She struggled against her bonds in a vain effort to escape. After a few minutes she was stopped by the sound footsteps. As the footsteps owner approached and became visible Hinata's worst fear in this situation were realized, for standing before her was none other than the snake himself Orochimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Orochimaru...Kyaaaa! D-Don't look!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kukuku, But I have already seen all of you, Hinata Hyuuga, Kukuku\" Orochimaru chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked at the Sannin with some amount of fear, \"W-What do you p-plan to do with me?\" Her voice filled with fear and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple my dear you are going to help me destroy Konoha, Kukuku,\" Orochimaru said as he liked his lips with his elongated tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-never, I would soon k-kill myself!\" Hinata retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, You won't be saying that for long. you see, while you were asleep I have been injecting you with a special serum that will make you a slave to my will,\" Orochimaru smirked at Hinata's horrified expression, \"Of course in order for the serum to activate it requires some of my own DNA, to bind you to my will, kukukuku!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your DNA?\" Hinata was truly terrified now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru licked his lips again, \"That's right and I wanted you wake for this part of the procedure. Now what shall I give you some of my blood or perhaps I could inject my DNA into you through...alternative methods, Kukuku.\"</span></div></div>",

One such reason being that as much of an evil mad scientist he may be, he had no real interest in the young girl before him. She could be no older then 14 at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up a nearby syringe, Orochimaru filled it with his own blood in quick and precise motions. Once filled, he turned back towards the trembling young girl and couldn't help but, chuckle evilly as a truly delicious idea came to him. \"Kukukukuku, my dear I believe I already know what my first task for you will be once you are under my control.\" The girl closed her eyes and shook her head, a desperate attempt to try and block out what was happening to her if he ever saw one. Jabbing the needle into her arm he leaned down and whispered to her, \"My first order for you will be to seek out that blond Uzumaki you so adore... And end his life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's eyes snapped open in horror at the knowledge that this twisted man was going to make her kill the boy she loved.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both looked on in surprise at the now gaping hole that had once been a five inch thick steel door only moments before. What was most surprising was who it was that entered through the doorway. \"Kukukuku\", chuckled the snake as his training and experience snapped him from his surprise. \"This is quite the surprise. Never had I thought I'd be entertaining you in my humble abode, Naruto-kun.\" Hinata's eyes widened as hope filled her at hearing her beloved name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice that spoke back however, was different then any that she had heard from her beloved blond. His voice was deeper but, not in the tone expected from growing older. It was dark as well, holding some sort of underlying tone that spoke of something ancient and powerful, not to mention evil. What could have happened to her Naruto-kun to cause this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"WHERE IS HE YOU DAMN SNAKE!?! WHERE IS</b>...\" The boys angry rant was stopped mid-sentence when he noticed the person on the operating table. \"H-hinata?\" Suddenly remembering that she was stark naked in front of the boy she loved, Hinata squeaked and tried desperately to cover herself. Her limbs where still tied down however, causing her to manage nothing more the some awkward squirms. Naruto blushed at the sight of a naked girl, a rather pretty naked girl. He remembered where he was however and soon felt rage unlike anything he'd ever felt before flood his system. \"You... BASTARD! First you take Sasuke from us, and now you try who knows what with Hinata! <b>I. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">WILL!</font> KILL!! <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">YOU!!!</font></b>\", shouted the blond as red bubbling chakra poured out of his body, taking on the one-tailed cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru however, was not amused. The team that the Hyuga came with was easy enough to deal with but, if this boy was here then so was his old teammate Jiraiya. That was one thing he couldn't handle right now. Not to mention he had his notes from all his experiments that he had to grab before leaving. He had no time to play with this annoyance. A shame too, as he had really been looking forward to seeing the Hyuga return to him after killing the boy. Oh well. The concoction he had been pumping her full of would take some months to break down. He'd just have to slip some of his blood into her before that happened. He was about to make his leave when the Nine-Tailed brat charged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take Orochimaru long to deal with the enrage brat, despite the cloak of chakra surrounding his body. All he did was wait till this boy was close enough, then seemingly with a flick of his wrist, Orochimaru cut into the boy with his Sword of Kusanagi. Blood burst from the boys chest much like a geyser as it was revealed that the boy had nearly been bisected by the blade of legend. Neither male noticed how Hinata got a mouthful of Naruto's blood while it was filled with evil and hateful chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the boy lay on the ground bleeding, Orochimaru walked out of his lab, intent on grabbing his notes. He did however notice how the Ky\u016bbi's chakra was working desperately to stitch the blasted child back together while apparently increasing blood production so the boy didn't bleed out. <i>'The child was very lucky to have his demon.'</i>, thought the snake as he left the bleeding boy on the ground while the  frantic and screaming Hyuga tried to break her bonds so as to save the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one of them knew that the compound in the young Hyuga had become active, nor did they know that she had become bound to the darkness hidden in Naruto's heart. Not the Ky\u016bbi but, the darker half of Naruto. The part kept hidden from the world, holding all of his darker desires and urges. Only time would tell how this would change the young Hyuga.</span></div></div>",

The Demon Kyubbi had possessed him once again, with an overflowing amount of Chakra surrounding the pair. His form had Hinata pinned against a tree with claws threatening towards her throat. \"We all do. Sasuke does, Neji does, I do...\" he paused and exhaled. The power was overwhelming Naruto, his livid expression made that apparent. Nonetheless, he leaned in closer to Hinata's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wriggled under Naruto's strong presence. \"No, Naruto...!\" Hinata gasped as Naruto squeezed her tighter. \"It's alright N-Naruto! You don't have to do this!\" She hesitated again under Naruto's mighty grasp, but still found strength within her to try to persuade him to rethink. \"You're good Naruto! You don't have to be like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your breath.\" he growled, grasping her neck. \"You'll need it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nipped at Hinata's neck and played at the skin with his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto...\" she murmured, and gasped as he sunk his teeth into the nape of her neck. He smiled as he watched the trickle of freshly-drawn blood slide down her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget all they've done to you!\" Naruto barked at her, drawing back. \"They ignored you, Hinata! They never saw your gifts! You were part of the main branch and they tossed you aside!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" Hinata cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm right Hinata! You worked so hard and strived for attention! What do you think now knowing it's all for naught?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" Hinata let out a quiet sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pounded his fist on the tree. \"Don't let them get to you! You're just their toy! They don't care!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata glared through closed eyelids. \"W-Why, Naruto. It's just not fair...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked as he noticed her reaction at his words.  \"You know the truth in your heart.\" he growled in her ear. \"Take what's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\" Hinata breathed, a sound of harshness rising through her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now you know what you need to become!\" he howled. All the Chakra that Naruto had released began to swell. The darkness that was clear in his eyes grew stronger and wilder. As the two became almost covered in Chakra, Naruto leaned toward Hinata and said once more, \"Take what's yours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed Hinata, all the Chakra gathered combining into the two where they met. As their tongues collided, all the Chakra Naruto had poured into Hinata's throat. Hinata gasped and struggled as her chest became full of the evil presence within him. The two violently released as Hinata began to cough and choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! What have you done to me?\" she pleaded. Naruto collapsed in exhaustion as he could only murmur; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto fainted, he fell to the forest floor. Hinata cried out as she saw Naruto's stomach, bare as his coat had risen from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tattoo was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gagged again, \"It can't be...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the Chakra, swelling in her chest tightened sharply and constricted around her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now Hinata,' a presence said, rising from inside of her, 'Who will be punished first?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil in Hinata answered, without falter:</span></div></div>",

Suddenly it came to her; Kagome seemed to have developed a new tendency to wander off alone in a fit of rage. Kagura would have to wait but she was sure she could catch Kagome. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Kagura, the Inu-tenshi seemed to be getting along rather well. Sitting and talking around the fire. Occasionally Kagura could hear their laughter. She could not understand how they were still all friends. Kagome had screamed \"sit\" several times, but apparently, what ever happened was not enough to send her marching off in a fury or to disrupt the pleasant time they seemed to be having. If any demon she knew had acted that way towards another, they would be killed, no questions asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura's Musings on the bizarre nature of human relationships helped her pass the time as she waited. She didn\u2019t think she would ever understand them, she had left thinking they all hated each other, but now they were all sitting together amiably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, on the eve of the third day, Kagura found her opening. She heard the first \"Sit\" and strained her ears to hear more but the argument was to far away. Kagura was about to give up when she saw her prey coming towards her in a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped off the tree she was in, intent on collecting her prize when she saw Inuyasha.

He didn\u2019t even notice until he saw the thin line of red ooze down her leg. Delighted that he was able to cause Kikyo\u2019s reincarnation pain, Naraku got a bit heavy handed and cut her a few more times, enjoying the crimson liquid more than he imagined he would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaraku licked the blood of his claws with a pleased smile on his face, letting out the softest moan. He truly loved her taste; it took every ounce of control he had to keep him from taking her right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for only a moment to calm him self., Naraku attached the extra rope from her wrists to the hook he installed on the wall, he left it loose enough that she could sit with out her arms being ripped of but still tight enough that she would have no leeway with which to hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then sat against the wall across from her to meditate on what he had planned for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaraku watched Kagome for a few moments wondering if he\u2019d been wrong about her waking up when, her head shot up and her eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held back a smile as he saw the terror in her eyes quickly covered up by anger. She would be fun to break, but also fun to have as she was. He would defiantly leave the choice up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPriestess,\u201d he began trying to sound uninterested, \u201ctoday you have a choice.\u201d Naraku paused a bit, letting that sink in. \u201cNot to sound clich\u00e9, but we can do this the easy way or the hard way\u201d There was another quick flash of fear but she remained defiant. \u201cDo not think there is another option, or that the mutt will come save you. It will not happen. You will join me on the dark side and you will kill Inuyasha. There is no room for arguments.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaraku reached forward and lifted her chin so she had to look him in the eyes. \u201cYou will either join me by choice, or I will break and make you join me.\u201d Naraku pressed his lips to hers, a stolen kiss. Before standing briskly, \u201cYou will have until the next night fall to decide. Choose wisely.\u201d Naraku headed out the door, pausing to add, \u201cDon\u2019t think you can escape in my absence,\u201d as Kanna appeared in the door way. He left without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanna said nothing as she drifted to sit where her master was previously seated. Kagome was still in shock. She was captured. She was doomed. Her head was pounding from Kagura\u2019s attack and her whole body ached from wounds she suspected were claw marks. And Naraku had <i>kissed</i> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea what to do \u2013 or what either of Naraku\u2019s \u2018choices\u2019 would entail. How ever, she knew Inuyasha would save her. She just didn\u2019t know how long that would take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKanna?\u201d Kagome inquired, opting for a second opinion. \u201cWhat is Naraku planning?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster wouldn\u2019t tell Kanna of such things.\u201d Kanna replied in her dead, monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagome decided to try to change the questioning a bit, \u201cIs this behavior typical of Naraku?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a very long pause before Kanna answered, \u201cNo, master usually doesn\u2019t waste his time on humans, and he never gives them a choice.\u201d There was a pregnant silence before Kanna continued, \u201cKagura says he sent her to spy on you. Kanna wonders what makes you, lowly human, so special\u201d The last statement was so out of character for Kanna, even her voice was different, filled with the peculiar curiosity of a child\u2019s voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagome pondered this in silence. She was being watched. They were being watched. Why did no one notice? Why did Naraku want <i>her</i> to kill Inuyasha? What were the consequences of each choice? Which choice would buy her more time? What should she choose? Some how even with all her pain and all her pondering she managed to fall asleep. Her last coherent thought was the answer to Naraku\u2019s question. An answer that she would soon have to give.</span></div></div>",

She knew her parents were out, Gatomon was laying on her bunk and sleeping by the looks of it, and Tai was at Sora's 'studying' . Dropping her bag on the bedroom floor she headed into the Kitchen to grab a snack, when suddenly she felt a bright light surround her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light cleared away she saw she was bound to a metal slab by some strange enegy bonds. Looking around she saw surrounding her were several metallic skelletons, each with a burning sort of stare.She saw two of the skelletons in front of her part and let through a boy around about 16 through, he was wearing a mask and a black cape that seemed to draw darkness in to concel him \"Ah\" the teen said \"you must be Kari\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Kari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy chuckled \"Here I am known only as Darkness, herald of the changer. I have been observing you for sometime Kari\" he replied \"and I have decided that when the harvest begins, you will be at my side\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never join the side of evil\" Kari growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we might have this problem\" Darkness said, as a strange device shaped like a scorpion's tail was carried in by the skelletons \"my master told me of your current ways and how to... unleash the darker side\". Kari started struggling as she heard the machine start to be powered up. Then with a strange whirring noise she started to lose control of herself. She felt her ideals being corrupted, but she felt pleasure from this. Eventually her last bit of goodness was corrupted by the ray. Her body then started to chage. Her eyes turned blood red, her skin a dark gray. Her clothes change from the tradtional pink to as red as her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restraints were lifted and she slid off the slab, kneeling \"how may I serve the changer?\" she asked. </span></div></div>",

You may go back now.\" Changer ordered. Then Darkness disappeared in a cloud of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" Kari asked. \"Simple to destroy the digidestened.\" Changer explains in a evil voice. Suddenly Kari snaps out of her trance and screams \"Destroy my friends. That is not what I'm going to do.\" Then he realized that the device didn't work. He needed it to become permanent. So he took Kari and strapped her in a chair and strapped her hard so she could not escape. First, he put on a special helmet over Kari's head and uses it to break down Kari until she is weak and vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes it worked. Kari emotions have corrupted her. Then Changer powered up the machine to full blast to turn Kari evil permanently. Kari tried fighting back but it was too much for her and changed back into evil Kari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked \"What is my first mission Master Changer?\" The Changer gave Kari her orders \"First, go and get your digimon and turn it evil too. Once you have done that you get the rest of the digimon worn out so that they would be to wear to fight. Do you under stand Kari?\" \"Yes master.\" She responded. But before Kari can do the Changer's evil bidding she need to be disguised to look normal around everyone else. So the Change changed Kari's appearance to what she look like before she turned evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kari's is back at her house but more evil than ever.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Misty was sitting on the porch of her gym, smoking a cigarette under a parasol, looking wistfully into the distance, like some faithful sailor's wife she thought. It was past noon in the summer and nobody had shown up to the gym for more than a dozen days, she had to let some of the gym's licensed fighters go on vacation, and had been alone at the gym since then. Her sisters were on various show trips throughout Hoenn, and Ash was still in Kalos with what seemed to be his first girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood for him, she thought, with a pang of jealousy, not at being ash's girlfriend, mind you, but at the easygoing traveler life ash seemed to enjoy. She'd thought taking charge of the gym would be a blast, a passage into adulthood and responsibility, the best accomplishment on her long list of feats. But she had been quickly disillusioned, for one, young easygoing trainers like ash, venturing around kanto challenging strong foes for the heck of it were rarer these days, she ended up fighting mostly kids in their twenties who were trying to have a gap year connecting to nature, and were closer to weed type trainers than to grass type, or aggressive fifty-somethings going through their midlife crisis and trying to be pokemon champions. Both ended up being deplorable fighters, and the gym smelt of cheap cologne and illegal substances too much for her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, there was the training programs for cerulean town trainers, the paperwork with the newly unionized gym staff, and counseling for cerulean town trainers, then tax forms to fill, then the public events, where she had to wear the short jean shorts and tiny yellow shirt even in the dead of winter, then some report to file for the league, etc... etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know whether to be grateful or not for the summer vacation, where townsfolk would just migrate to alola to get sunburns on the beaches and leave her alone. On one hand she appreciated not working as much as the next person, but on the other hand, she didn't have much going on in her life. She'd tried to read some books over the summer, but she wasn't in a reading mood, really, she was at this age when you feel the keen sting of lost time, where she could do so much! She was, after all, one of Kanto's most powerful trainers, and were it not for league rules, she'd get out her level 85 team and blast away most of the people who annoyed her. Team rocket was first on her list, then, it was erika, the grass type trainer in celadon city, possibly her sisters, lieutenant surge, who made the mistake of catcalling her at last year's league convention, and since then was doing his best to sound gentlemanly and overtly feminist in a weird roundabout way (his bench-pressing of susan B anthony pamphlets being one of these strange occurrences, what she wouldn't give to douse the man in cold water one of these days)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she really wanted to do was find Giovanni. Last year, the kindly looking gym leader turned out to be team rocket's boss, and he'd gone into hiding in kanto, going full time criminal. Since then, she'd considered dumping the gym on one of her sisters, chasing Giovanni full time, living the ole' renegade traveler life, sleeping out, righteously kicking multiple asses. But she just couldn't do it. Her sisters were thinking of moving to Hoenn permanently, apparently having their respective girlfriends and boyfriends settled there. She couldn't just throw monkey wrenches in people's lives like that. She was a responsible adult now. With boring adult responsibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she pay team rocket to attack her own gym? She idly wondered. Wait until it's destroyed enough, then step in, have a cool fight with many water-related explosions, then go out on a roaring rampage of revenge against all of team rocket, possibly for the next ten to five years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much as she liked the idea, she couldn't close the gym like that. The only reason Cerulean city was ever on a map was her aunt opening the gym some thirty years ago, in what was then the ultimate backwater county. Most of the town's economy relied on there being a gym, an ocearium, water ballets and enough low-quality shops to squeeze money out of unsuspecting visitors. Without the gym, it wouldn't be too long until Cerulean City became one of these driveover towns, like you saw in sinnoh documentaries. So many people depended on her not doing anything, smoking cancer sticks on the gym's porch while wearing sunglasses and a black bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was funny, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd kill for a way out of it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted in her meditations by the shadow of a tallish figure in front of her. Slowly putting away her cigarette and getting her sunglasses on, she then looked the arrivant square in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Both said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you\" They continued. For misty was, in a sense, talking to herself, albeit a differently clothed version, in the trademark yellow crop top, red breeches and jean shorts. It was, of course Duplica, the ditto trainer, she sometimes visited gym leaders for various reasons, asking if she could play their role in a show she was putting up, study their battle tactics, crash down on their couch, etc...  Misty had witnessed the latter over the last two years, and would sometimes wake up with ash doing his morning routine in the garden, or jessie swimming in the pool. It could've been annoying for other people, but misty actually liked having parts of her past walking around in the living room, she enjoyed the artistry of it, how duplica, who had mastered advanced ditto techniques, could be anyone, with no limitations, in a way, eternally free and renewing herself. She did envy that about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted nicely of the weather, of what were the news in Kanto (both had great fun discussing agatha's ass-whooping of koga last week in the council 4 inter-regional battle royale) and how their respective pokemons were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been hanging out with anyone new these days?\" asked misty, after several offhand references to some joke \"a friend told her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glint appeared in the eyes of duplica-misty. \"Matter of fact, i have\" She said, lighting another smoke. \"It's my best paying gig as well, and something i've been meaning to tell someone about for quite some time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked misty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuplica took a big huff of cigarette smoke before squashing it into the ashtray. \"Ditto, ID 78, uniform on, please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore misty's eyes, she saw her redhead form shift into a petite, somewhat plain woman, with a sharp nose and freckles, auburn hair that had seen bette days, and a cleft chin. But the biggest shift was in the clothing duplica was wearing. She had a black beret that could've looked french on a <i>caf\u00e9's terrasse</i>, but beyond that, the uniform was unmistakably team rocket, the classic blackish gray uniform with the big R, the stone grey knee high boots (One of her favorite comedians, Samantha bumblebee, had postulated that most of team rocket's ranks were hardcore foot fetishists in need of a better dating system) The only thing differentiating her from your garden variety grunts were 4 small brooches on her uniform, one purplish, while the other were a striped black and green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better have a good explanation for this Duplica, and for this purple badge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuplica slightly nodded, ordering ditto to forgo the uniform, shifting into a purple rock band t-shirt, raggedy jean bermudas and sandals. \"Don't know if it's good, but i'll try\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then dug out a polaroid photography from a bag misty could've sworn wasn't there a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recognize the pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could, it was an horrendously ugly pokemon, a pink and yellow dunsparce, with abnormally distorted wings, like someone had stuck multiple radishes in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shiny dunsparce, yes, what's your point?\" answered misty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 years ago, this dunsparce was stolen from a research lab in alma. Secret place. Top of the line. They had pokemon rangers here guarding the place. Some elite jennys. I even heard that council 4 members were stationed whenever they feared anything could happen. The research facility itself was owned by a big conglomerate there. Materials for Almia Great Almia. They deal in everything, pok\u00e9mon medications, energy, infrastructure, telecommunications. You name it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, half the facility sinks into the ground, apparently the complex was built over a hidden fault line in almia's mountains. Hundreds injured, immense property damage, the dunsparce, the 3rd shiny dunsparce ever witnessed disappeared completely. Big event, right? Ever heard about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty admitted she didn't<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because there was a big cover-up by the company. They didn't want anybody knowing what they had really lost, or what the dunsparce was for. But Koga knew. He'd used his muk's lilliput so that the thing could go unnoticed and spy on what research was going on. A remarkable job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, the dunsparce can do nuclear fusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It can't all be stocked. It can't all be pee. It sure as hell can't be the air's humidity, that was checked as well, so, where do you think it comes from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always thought it would've something to do with the water not being from this world, maybe from another plane or dimension? I never really spent time thinking about it.\" answered misty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, the truth is we don't exactly know for sure\" she said, pointing at the dunsparce's photography \"But from what Koga had reported, it has to do with this thing's deformed wings. To give you the short version, the things sticking out are thought to be multiple iterations of an organ unique to pokemon. Or maybe it's the same organ but divided or otherwise fucked up. It's also a hundred times the normal size of the things. It's thought that studying this dunsparce long enough could give the answer as of how pokemon function. It's a gift wrapped nobel prize of sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned his pokemon organs being overgrown, does that mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he's the ultimate, most powerful pokemon in all of history?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thing is, nobody knows. The researchers there kept him level 3, because, proportionate to the size of his organs, he attempted defense curl, he could potentially weigh a small moon. The wreck/faultline thing could've been his version of splash, we thought, in the early days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the first message: Team rocket has it. Addressed to the pokemon league, followed by a blurry photo of a dunsparce 2 days after that. We don't know who sent these, we don't know why. But everybody. And i say everybody, i mean the big wigs and the council 4 and the international police everybody, freaks the fuck out. They don't know anything about what the dunsparce can do. Team Rocket seems to know what they're doing, but every operative caught doesn't know anything. Somehow the team always seem to catch the international police agents sent to infiltrate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI needed money then. Lots. Copyright infringement on one of these new Unova gym leaders coupled with bad marketing decisions had left me penniless. The pok\u00e9mon league swiped my debt in a matter of seconds, swiped my debts, and asked me to join Team Rocket. But not deep undercover stuff: as myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" said Misty, who was growing more anxious by the minute<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A false identity would've asked for new pok\u00e9mon, and duplica would've had to disappear, but this way, i could keep doing my shows, rise in the organization with my talents, and then hope to find where they stashed the dunsparce. Think it from the Team rocket's perspective: do you want another nameless girl, or Duplica Identica, Ditto master and world traveler? Plus they knew i had debts. They had no reason to distrust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus the purple badge\" Added misty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus the purple badge\" Echoed duplica<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth knew what the purple badge meant: That you knew who was Giovanni before he fucked everyone over. That you knew of Viridian city's gym leader's ultimate treachery. That you could keep a big-ass secret. It also meant that by not telling, you betrayed all of the people around you: Giovanni had stolen around a small thousand pokemon at the last pokemon league opening ceremony. Most of them were rescued later by special task forces, but they always seemed to find more rattattas and golbats than, say, laprases. Misty's sister's lapras had been missing for the past year, part of her decision to leave kanto and start a new life in Hoenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry\" Said Duplica after a long time, as the late afternoon breezes started to make themselves felt. \"I didn't know about the plan until it was already too late, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry\" cut Misty \"I understand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stayed silent for a little time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is it then, living in team rocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i'd come to talk about that with you actually\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Misty, warily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, for about three months I've been running a unit all by myself, mainly jewelry stores robbery, sometimes we crack down on some of the Alolan triads. Most of the time is spent at our hideout doing strategy meetings and training. Frankly it's better than i expected. So far nobody asked us to steal Pokemons, so, that's a good thing. They tend to respect that stuff. Only problem is i owe them one member\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe them what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, it's sort of like a pyramid scheme, you see, once you go up the ranks enough, you have to sponsor someone you personally know to be a part of Team Rocket, and a six month delay to do it. Don't do it, you're fired. Give them someone untrustworthy, you're fired. Give them someone who rises through the ranks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Said Misty, \"I'm not joining Team Rocket\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuplica paused, clearly uncomfortable with the subject. \"Listen misty, i can't take anyone from the international police. They can't do half of the stuff you do with your lowest level psyducks. My \"ditto show\" crew would gut me if they knew i had a purple badge. Ash or brock won't do. The other gym leaders can't. I'm not even asking you to do it as yourself. Arceus knows what a sacrifice it would be, and since they lost viridian city, they almost certainly would try to weasel their way into the gym. What i want is you, disguised as someone else, being good at fighting for two months, maybe three. Four tops. It's all the time i'll need to find out where the dunsparce is, then, we call in the league, and the Kanto/Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh and Kalos Council 4 rain devastation on their fragile heads. We leave the scene, team rocket doesn't hear from us ever again, and we've saved the world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty had undergone some change during the conversation. She was still firm on her initial \"No\" but she was already thinking about the next steps in duplica's plans. If she left the gym, who could replace her? It would seem suspicious if she disappeared suddenly and then a talented water-type oriented team rocket operative was introduced by duplica to team rocket. So the person who'd replace her would have to be able to imitate her, at least in public, then came the matter of her identity. Who should she disguise herself as? the person she'd replace could be an ideal fit. She would have to be replaced by a person trained enough in water-type handling anyways. She was thinking Melinda from the Gym's fighter union could be a fit? But perhaps Andree, who came from the lavender town inner city would be a better fit in team rocket? Or what about Ondine? The girl could copy her routines perfectly, and even her fighting style? She had this weird crush on her and would do anything to be in her place. But what about..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest Duplica: I don't like this. Not a single bit. I've spent most of my teenage years fighting against thugs like them. I give counseling every week end even though i hate most of the kids in this town, with their weird bug type pokemons, just to avoid team rocket setting foot in my town. You know what happened with my sister's Lapras. You know all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not giving you an answer right now. I'll take some time to think. Alone time. OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuplica nodded in approval. \"Ok. Just another thing, can i crash on your couch tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure. There are some beers in the fridge if you want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Misty, you're the best there is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Duplica made her way inside of the gym, heading towards Misty's top roof flat. Misty put he sunglasses on. She was feeling pretty dizzy. While technically, it wasn't her first time getting thrown into a world-saving situation, it never had been like that. This was pretty frightening, to say the least. She didn't know what to do. One one hand, it was everything she wanted to do earlier: chase the bad guys. Kick asses. It was common knowledge that Team rocket was working on eliminating all of their rival factions. The alolan Mafia. Ex plasma anarchists. The biker gangs. She would enjoy that. She'd hate the team rocket thing. She'll loathe it. She knows she'll hate herself for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once she doesn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's very exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery scary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heads towards the gym, and in the entrance, she presses a number on the visiophone. Ash's. It's 7pm there, in kalos it should be around 9am, he's probably having breakfast or something. The visiophone buzzes ominously, before finally ringing a big doooooooooo <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndooooooooooo<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndooooooooooo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple times more, but there's no reply. She'd like to speak about the weather or his pokemon or something else that would give her a good memory before she does it. Because of course she'll do it. She can only do that. But she can't reach ash, one of the positive forces in her life. She can't find the strength to call her sisters. She doesn't know what to do again. She needs some emotional support before going back inside. Who does she call?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Buu was unaware of the spell he just casted . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma was at Kami's hideout . She and the rest of the crew was greeting Goku farewell . Just when Goku disappeared the spell hit her. She felt a sharp shock of pain going through her body, no one else noticed the suffering she was in,it was as if time had frozen . Her head felt as if it was about to burst  . She placed both hands on her due to all the pain. Then a voice in her head began to speak. ' Bulma, I will give you my power and a blueprint for a device that will defeat Buu, hahaha !' She then felt all her pain had immediately disappeared and she felt herself being surrounded by a dark energy . The energy kept increasing and everything around her became dark. All of a sudden the black energy began to enter, the energies entered her body through all the holes it could find. She felt extreme pleasure and all of a sudden it stopped when all the energy entered her. She felt more powerful, but she could feel there was now darkness deep down inside her. And then time began to move again, Bulma was still a lot sceptical about this device so she decided not to tell anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten and Trunks started with their fusion training under Piccolos supervision while Bulma worked on her strange device. Finally she had finished the device, all she had to do now was to confront Buu . The device looked like some kind of alien Satellite dish that she had to strap on to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajin Buu had just arrived at the lookout, but in the form of  Super Buu. Piccolo pleaded with Buu to wait an hour. Buu agreed and sat in front of the enormous hourglass. Bulma immediately strapped her device on pointed it at Super Buu. Buu was looking deep into the hourglass and was distracted. She turned the device on and it immediately shot a dark beam at Buu before the machine broke into pieces . He was screaming in agonising pain. the beam caused his body to change into a pink energy orb that was floating there. The pink energy orb shot straight at Bulma , before Bulma could react the orb stopped right in front of her and slowly began to enter her body. After a few minutes bulm began shouting intensely she could feel all the power flowing through her veins. Her muscles began to tighten and enlarged a bit causing her clothes to tighten. Her breasts increased in size ,as well as her ass. She became a lot sexier . when she stopped screaming a M appeared on her forehead. She looked around and everyone was staring at her. ' what ,it is the same me. ' she said laughing, but evil had consumed her entire being. Everyone cheered for Bulma and began celebrating. Bulma had become the most powerful being in the universe she could do what ever she wanted . </span></div></div>",

Bulma was just about to head home, she pulled a capsule out of her pocket , but she immediately realised that she didn't need a flying vehicle anymore. She then placed the capsule back in to her pocket. she concentrated a bit and then her feet lifted off the ground. ' Not bad!' she heard a voice say behind her. Bulma turned around and saw that it was the beautiful blonde Android 18. ' not bad who does she think she is? I might as well have some fun with her. ', bulma thought to herself. In a flash bulma was standing right in front of her. ' you sure are fast . ' 18 said surprised. 'I can actually move a lot faster. ' Bulma said with confidence. ' How about we have a little sparing match, I wanted to test these muscles of mine. ' Bulma said flexing a bit. It was then that bulma noticed 18 staring at her with a bit of lust in her eyes and some fear . ' I don't blame her, I do got a sexier body now and I might as well tease her a bit. ' Bulma though to herself . ' earth to 18 do you want to fight? '</span></div></div>",
