Tobias loves his new big boy undies but he hates the potty. He hates it, hates it hates it! He will start crying whenever his mommy or daddy make him sit on it for even just a second. He will happily pee on a tree or in the grass \u2013 or, more often than not, his big boy undies or the carpet. Just not in the potty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Raphael</b>, age three. Raphael lives with his single dad and he has just discovered his new favourite word: \u2018No.\u2019 At first Raphael made good progress with his potty training, he even had had a few completely accident-free days. But recently, just sitting on the potty has become a giant power struggle with him that usually ends in tears and wet pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Noah</b>, age four. Noah\u2019s parents recently divorced. They share custody over him and he spends half the month at his mom\u2019s and the other half with his dad. Noah was fully potty trained over a year ago, but he did not take well to the stress and the new situation and right now he refuses to even sit on the toilet. He will deny he even has to go and only moments later go hide to wet or soil his pants, then he\u2019ll claim it was an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Logan</b>, age five. Logan\u2019s dad once told him that he had to learn to do a thing first before he was allowed to decide he didn\u2019t like it. At the time, his dad had tried to teach Logan, who could be a bit of a scaredy-cat, to ride a bike and that was what he had been talking about. And once Logan had gotten the hang of it, he actually had decided he liked riding his bicycle very much. However, he had taken his dad\u2019s advice to heart and identified a few other things in his life which he definitely knew how to do but decidedly did not like. Using the potty was one of them. His mom was not thrilled about Logan\u2019s decision, to put it mildly. Dad actually thought his little rebellion funny. Mom wasn\u2019t impressed with dad\u2019s attitude, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of little\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He will happily sit on his potty when he is told to, and he loves reading his picture books on it. He fully understands that pee-pee and poo-poo belong into the potty. He has no idea how they are supposed to get there. So far, he has done one poop in the potty, mostly by accident. He has also peed on about every surface in the house at least once by now, twice on the bathroom floor right after he got up from his potty. There are poop stains in all his big boy undies. One time he had been standing in front of his potty and peed himself right as his mommy had been praising him for keeping his big boy briefs dry and he had just interrupted her to correct: \u201cWet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Florian</b>, age three. Florian loves his potty and he takes it with him wherever he goes. Usually, by wearing it on his head as a hat. It makes a great hat. It\u2019s also a great place to store his toys in, it makes a decent step-stool, and he can bathe his dolls in it. It floats like a boat in the bathtub. It can be used as a bucket. On occasion, Florian even uses it as a chair. The one thing he has never done is pee or poo in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marcel</b>, age four. Marcel has always done things at his own speed. He gets that the potty is for peeing and pooping in and he isn\u2019t opposed to the concept. However, he has a hard time understanding the difference between undies and diapers. If he is wearing any pants at all, he will use them like diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stephen</b>, age six. Stephen grew up with his aunt and uncle on an old, rural farm. Stephen has spend more time outdoors, roaming the surrounding wilderness, than indoors. The only toilet at the farm was an old outhouse, basically a hole in the ground, stinky and quite scary to a young child. Stephen used it maybe once or twice in his life. Usually, he would just crouch behind a bush or pee on a tree. So to say he is unfamiliar and uncomfortable with toilets would be an understatement. He has moved to the city recently and started school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of little\u2026</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s just he is still very much figuring out this whole going-potty business and when he realises he has to go, it is usually somewhere on a scale between \u201cI gotta go <i>right now</i>\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m peeing\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hikaru</b>, age four.

He won\u2019t even tell he has to use the potty until he is only seconds away from wet or brown pants. But Hikaru isn\u2019t doing this out of fear or spite. It\u2019s just that nobody has ever told the poor lad that public restrooms exist and other people own toilets as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Joshua</b>, age seven. Little Josh focusses on whatever he is doing a lot. A lot a lot. Sometimes so much so, he doesn\u2019t realise he has to use the bathroom. On occasion, he won\u2019t even notice when he has an accident. Other times, he will panicky realise his need once he feels the first spurt of pee dampen his pants or a little brown turtle pushing out its head. Either way, he still needs the occasional reminder to use the bathroom, or he will have frequent accidents or near-accidents in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Linus</b>, age eight. Linus still has to wear diapers at night for his bedwetting, but at day he is fully potty trained. Technically, at least. Linus knows perfectly well when he has to use the toilet, he even knows when it is getting urgent, but he doesn\u2019t like going. So he always waits until it is really <i>urgent</i> urgent. Sadly, Linus overestimates his ability to hold it by quite a bit and often ends up with an accident in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of little\u2026</span></div></div>",

He is happy enough to pee in it and is almost completely accident free by now. However, he absolutely refuses to poop into anything but a diaper. Once he has held it for three days straight until his parents carved in and put him in a diaper. Nicola is strong-willed and determined and he has a surprising amount of control for his age, his mom couldn\u2019t even \u201cconvince\u201d him to use the potty with a glycerin suppositoriy. He stubbornly waited out its effect to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jamal</b>, age three and a half. Jamal doesn\u2019t like the potty. He doesn\u2019t like the toilet either. Nor does he want to pee on a tree or in the bushes, he doesn\u2019t see why this would be \u201cexciting\u201d, thank you very much. Jamal understands that undies aren\u2019t diapers and can\u2019t be used as such. And he tries not to, honest! But it is hard waiting all day until he is put in a diaper for his afternoon nap or at bedtime in the evening and sometimes he just doesn\u2019t make it. If his mommy and daddy only listened to him and put him back in diapers during the day, none of them would have this problem!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Linus</b>, age eight. Linus still has to wear diapers at night for his bedwetting, but at day he is fully potty trained. Technically, at least. Linus likes the feeling of wearing a diaper. He has learned early how to diaper himself and he often \u201csecretly\u201d puts on one of his night-time diapers during the day. Apparently, his mom can\u2019t count and doesn\u2019t notice him going through diapers far faster than he should. More likely, though, she just lets Linus keep his \u201csecret\u201d. Linus doesn\u2019t really intend to use his diapers, but of cause at some point he either has to or he has to take them off to use the toilet. Since he is unhappy to waste a perfectly good diaper like that, he usually ends up holding it as long as he can before he goes in his diaper after all. He doesn\u2019t like sitting in a full diaper and quickly changes out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Victor</b>, age thirteen. Victor recently found an old pack of his night-time diapers from back when he still wet the bed as a child. It was quite the tight fit, but out of curiosity, he tried one on. He kinda liked the feeling. And he tried using it. He kinda liked that, too. Since then, he has continued to secretly wear them and has long since used up that diaper treasure he found. Yesterday, he finally worked up the courage and bought a pack of pull-ups for bedwetters for himself. He had biked all the way to the next town over just to make sure he wouldn\u2019t run into anyone he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of\u2026</span></div></div>",
