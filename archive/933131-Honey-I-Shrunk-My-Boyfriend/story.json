            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thirty-eight year old Calvin Powell and Thomas Lane, his 26-year-old lover, had been together for the past three years. They had recently taken a cruise to celebrate their third anniversary together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin worked as a pharmalogical research scientist for an international conglomerate that marketed everything from new medical breakthroughs to the latest fashionable cosmetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently investigating some reported side effects from a new brand of skin moisturizer developed by the firm's cosmetics division.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe often brought his work home with him. He was a nervous, compulsive man. He wasn't very tall, only about five feet seven. But, he had a nice body and short dark hair. He had brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis partner, besides being 12 years younger, was a tall, muscular man with sandy blond hair and green eyes. He stood 6'2\" tall. He had a slender waist and broad shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn most situations, Thomas was an easy-going, carefree individual. He worked as a photographer, which allowed him to explore his artistic range but yielded only sporadic paying jobs. Still, with Calvin's work in research, they maintained a comfortable home in the suburbs where Calvin liked to garden on the weekends and Thomas would photograph different aspects of the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Saturday morning found Thomas indulging his latest passion, extreme close-up photographs of blossoms and tiny subjects, such as the bugs and other creatures he found in Calvin's garden.<br>\r\nHe had just finished photographing a fuzzy caterpillar munching along one of Calvin's prize lilies when his lover exited the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to run into the lab for a few hours, hon,\" Calvin said. \"Want me to pick up something for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas, hunched over his camera, said, \"Sure, whatever you want, Cal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin reached out and snatched an ant that he found crawling on his lover's shirt collar. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin flicked the tiny bug into the air to fall somewhere in his carefully tended garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" he said. \"You just had a bug crawling on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shivered. \"Yes, I know. This garden's full of bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nature,\" Cal retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as it leaves me alone, I'll leave it alone,\" Thomas said, screwing closed the lens cap of his camera. \"But, all the weird bugs do make great photo subjects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin laughed and gave Thomas a quick kiss. \"Have a good afternoon,\" he said as he departed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Thomas returned indoors. He went to the kitchen to wash his hands. As he did so, he noticed a tube of moisturizer on the kitchen table. He looked at his hands, which were looking a little chapped. He had been rooting around in the flowerbeds to get just the right composition for his photos. He decided his hands could stand some soothing lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the tube and squirted some of its contents into his hands. He worked the lotion over his fingers, the back of his hands and his palms.<br>\r\nAlthough he didn't need to worry about his appearance, he did so. He liked to keep himself perfectly groomed and in good shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished with the lotion, he felt an odd tingling in his fingers. Nothing unpleasant. Just a mild itch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think any more about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The warm sunlight felt good on his face, and he was having a very good dream when he awoke to Calvin's hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Come on, sleepy head.\" Calvin placed a mug of hot coffee on the nightstand, which Thomas' head happened to be facing. The not disagreeable mixture of salt air and a fresh cappucino  began to work their magic. A broad smile began to cross his lips, even though his eyelids remained defiantly shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later he let out a slow groan and stretched in the bed.  He swallowed, then inhaled sharply. He opened his eyes to see Calvin wearing a white bathrobe looking down at him lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost 10 am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10 am? I thought we were on vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are, sweetums.\" Calvin leaned over and kissed his boyfriend tenderly on the lips. \"You are so cute when you first wake up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin sat down and began brushing Thomas' bangs with his fingers slightly. \"The sunrise was beautiful this morning. There were these fish that jumped way up high out of the water, and the way the light played on the ripples they made was just magical. I wish you could have seen it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my luck to have fallen in love with a morning person.\" Thomas placed back of his left hand dramatically against his forehead and struck the cheesiest pose he could manage.  Calvin chuckled softly. Thomas' absurdist flair was one of the things Calvin loved about him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sunny boy, it's time for you to get dressed\" Calvin kissed his lover's forehead and grasped his hands, pressing them against the young man's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist\". They kissed, and Calvin stood up again and walked to the window while the younger man pulled the sheets aside and placed his feet on the hardwood floor. He reached over and grasped the coffee mug with his hands, feeling the warmth spread from his palms into his hands. He took a long, slow slurp, swallowed, and let out a small grunt of satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife had been good to them. Calvin's job paid well, and the older man was feeling more confident lately, now that his work was beginning to gain some recognition in the scientific community. Thomas didn't know much about what it was that his boyfriend did exactly.  While Calvin was always enthusiastic when he asked for explanations, Thomas never really quite got his head around all that scientific mumbo-jumbo. He'd listen respectfully, nod, and occasionally let out an \"uh-huh\" to show that he was listening, but he really didn't care much about the technical aspects of Calvin's job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin was saying something about the small shops along the boardwalk by the beach, when Thomas looked at the floor. He noticed that while the ball of his foot rested against the smooth floor, the heels didn't quite reach.  That's odd, he thought.  He didn't remember the bed being set that high off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh. He shifted his weight and slid down off the bed, He started walking toward the bathroom and rubbed the sleep from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin made the bed and laid out a few clothes  for his sweetheart.  The younger man brought out his nurturing side, He worried sometimes that Thomas might take offense,. But if he did, he never showed it. In fact, he seemed to like it when Calvin mothered him.  He wondered to himself what Thomas must have been like as a kid growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas towelled off and came into the bedroom. He started to dress. He sat down on the edge of the bed and pulled his shoes on.  Tying the laces, he stood up and took a few steps toward the door when he tripped on the legs of his jeans,, which seemed baggier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin noticed, and commented</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Thomas stopped and faced the full length mirror  by the dresser. His clothes hung loosely on him, his  jeans riding low on his waist. His T-Shirt seemed baggy, and hung lower than he'd remembered.  That's funny, he thought. This shirt used to fit me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I guess so.\" he said, adding emphasis on the final o. He turned around slightly, examining himself. He wondered if maybe it was because he hadn't worked out in a while. He hadn't lost his appetite, as his stomach's soft growl in anticipation of breakfast attested to. Maybe the jeans were someone else's that got left in the dryer in the laundry room downstairs. They looked the same as the ones he usually wore. The tag in the back was even worn in the same places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He'd have to start  excercising more when he got home, he said to himself. At least he wasn't getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     On his way home from work, he stopped into the clinic, Thomas dropped by  the mall to pick up some new clothes. He'd been working out religiously for months now,  and while he looked muscular in the mirror, his clothes had continued their cruel expansion over his frame. He tried not to think about what it could mean. He quietly hoped to himself that it wasn't and STD. He and Calvin had been faithful to each other,  and they had both tested negative for the usual things doctors test gay men for consistently as long as they had been together.  He had an appointment to see his doctor tomorrow, and he looked forward to the event with a sense of impending doom. As he tried on some new clothes in the changing room, he found that he now wore a size 16 1/2, a full size smaller than before. His waist had also shrunk down to a size 32,. He nervously picked up a packet of undershirts in a medium and headed for the checkout counter.<br>\r\n....................................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next 10 days were nerve wracking.  The doctor told him that he didn't have HIV, and that was a relief. But something was making him lose body mass. He asked the doctor if maybe it was  cancer.  His doctor had scheduled an appointment at the oncologists, to reassure him, but said that it was extremely unlikely. When the nurse took Thomas' height and weight he noticed something disturbing on the chart. He used to be 6' 2\" tall. Now, his chart read that he was 5'11'. He'd commented on this, to which the nurse replied that the cartiliage in the spinal column sometimes compressed over the course of the day, due to gravity pressing down on the fluid filled sacs between the vertabrae. The result is that a person is a little taller when they first get up than at the end of the day.  This seemed plausible enough. The doctor had ordered a battery of blood tests and urine samples to be sent up to the lab. In a week and a half, they'd know more, and the appointment with the oncologist was scheduled for a few days after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thomas left the clinic, and walked to his car he stopped to think. It's 9:30 am. I only got up a little while ago. Would my spinal column have shrunk that much in this short a time? He reached around with one hand and ran his fingers against his back, feeling the spaces between the bones nervously. He kept walking to the car, too afraid to think about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........................................................................&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks passed, and he began to feel like a human pincushion. Calvin took time off work to accompany him to the doctor, and held his hand, which after a while had begun to shake like a leaf. The doctor's visits weren't doing anything to help, and in the meantime,  the insurance company had begun to complain about the lack of any specific diagnosis.  Thomas began to suggest going to an acupuncurist or trying an Naturopath.  Calvin  had a scientists mistrust of quackery, but he also wanted to reassure his boyfriend that everything was going to be okay. Besides, he too had begun to grow tired of not knowing what was happening. He reached over to embrace his lover, and stopped he he realised something terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas used to tower over Calvin. Now they could wear the same clothes. He said nothing, for fear of upsetting him further, but the knowledge of this shook him at his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....................................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I can't drink this stuff anymore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas made a disgusted face and hacked a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the stuff you got from the Chinese Herbalist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and it tastes like shit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that stuff, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know exactly. Powdered  deer antlers or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it helping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself. I've been the same size for a month now. It tastes awful, but I've stopped shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank god for that, Calvin thought. The doctors still hadn't reached any conclusion as to what was wrong with Thomas. It had been 3 months since this whole sordid adventure had begun,  and the insurance company had cut them off. One of the physicians had suggested they participate in a research study, but the idea of using Thomas for a lab rat scared Calvin even more than his loss of size. In the span of the last three months, Thomas had begun to wear a boy's XL. His waist was now a svelte 29\", and he stood around 5'5\", slightly smaller than Calvin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin walked over and hugged Thomas closely.  He kissed the young man and patted him slightly on the back.  I love you so much, he thought. You're still my man, even if you're a little different now.  \"I've been loving you a little too long to want to stop now, angel.\", he said.  \"Thick or thin, we'll always be together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas. closed his eyes. He held on to Calvin tightly and rocked slightly in his arms.  Though his world was falling apart, at least he had Calvin there to help him through it. And for that reason, he was the luckiest man alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin started to cry a little. he choked slightly, but managed to let out a reply in a nervous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas started to sob, and he grabbed Calvin more tightly than before. They looked at each other for the first time , each one nervous and happy and confused. They started to laugh and cry at the same time, and then Thomas let out a little whoop while Calvin shouted, \"We're getting married!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas stopped, and looked at Calvin with an intense stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I start shrinking again, will you still love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't care if you were as small as a baby, I'd love you with everything I've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still think I'm sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, you're the hottest man alive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas reached over and began to undo the buckle of Calvin's belt with a smile on his face. Calvin relied by pulling his lover's shirt up over his head. They undressed each other with the slow certainty of two pilgrims taking the first steps toward the holiest adventure of them all. They kissed, deeply, arms around each other,  rigid cocks pressed against each other's hard stomachs, throbbing with the same thunderous rythm that now compelled them to dance that strange dance that requires no other music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm sure\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been two months since the wedding, and they were both looking in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed it when I was walking home from the gym. These kids were playing in the park and one of them came running up to me and asked me what grade I was in. I thought he meant what grade did I teach, but he looked at me funny when I told him I wasn't  a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, you always did look young for your age\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that young\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad. We'll go get you some new clothes, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calvin, I wear a boys' size 12-14 and it's loose on me.. These jeans are practically falling off of my waist. There's only so many more sizes left to shrink down to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to sob a little. This brought out Calvin's nurturting insticts, and he patted Thomas on the back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there. I'm here, baby\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\", Thomas choked on a sob \"Stop calling me baby! Pretty soon I'm going to look like one, and I don't need you to remind me of that with your stupid....\" The words died on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, honey. I just don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so unfair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hated the sound of his piping voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had lost his job because of this, and the money was getting tight. Calvin could support the both of them, but the money wasn't in infinite supply, and all those alternative medical practitioners weren't a cheap.  The herbs had stopped working, and the future was looking very very bleak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin held him close, and pressed his head into his chest. Thomas pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Calvin was of course opposed to the idea, afraid of what would happen seeing his boyfriend become a national spectacle, a freak. But Thomas was determined. The two argued all that day, and Thomas eventually stormed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin didn\u2019t know what happened to Thomas. For days, he heard no word from him. Not from any of his friends, nor the doctors at the clinic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, last night, Thomas called him. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m so sorry to run out  on you like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay and safe. Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been staying with Ted, my old agent. You know how he\u2019s always been something of a father figure for me. Also, he\u2019s been very helpful\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelpful? How so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get angry. But, we\u2019ve gone ahead and made some arrangements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of arrangements?\u201d Calvin was trying to hold back the anger he felt last week. He had never really trusted Ted, and was not happy that he had returned to their life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow, we\u2019re holding a press conference. We\u2019re gonna tell the world what\u2019s happening to me. The doctors and scientists will be there, and we\u2019ve already lined up a ton of reporters and TV stations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, are you crazy? They\u2019re gonna call you a freak, they\u2019re gonna\u2026 You gotta cancel this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late. The story\u2019s already leaked. And the news will report on me and my condition, no matter if I show or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin was silent. After a few moments, Thomas continued, \u201cBabe, don\u2019t be angry. It will be okay.\u201d He was nearly sobbing, \u201cBesides, I need you. I need you to be there with me. I need you to support me during this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin choked up, hearing his husband sound so vulnerable. Reluctantly, he gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the morning of the press conference, and Calvin found shivers run through him as he stood outside the news building where the conference would be held. He checked in, and was directed to wait in a nearby room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, you came!\u201d he heard a familiar voice cry out as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas ran over to him, and embraced him. Calvin wrapped his arm around his lover. He felt so small, he realized, even though he didn\u2019t seem that much smaller than when last they had seen each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they broke the embrace, Calvin stepped back and took a good look at Thomas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5-foot-3,\u201d Thomas said preemptively, and a little uncomfortably. \u201cWell, 5-foot-2 and 3/4.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, that wasn\u2019t what I was thinking\u2026. going to ask\u2026\u201d Calvin said, even though he had been thinking about it. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 Wow, babe, you look\u2026 hot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin stared at his lover. Thomas was wearing an immaculately tailored summer suit that managed to show off his narrow waist and still broad chest. He had a button-down shirt, with the top few buttons unbuttoned, exposing his bronze tan, and pec cleavage. In addition, he was incredibly coiffed and styled. His hair had been trimmed and slightly dyed, exposing new highlights. His face was absolutely unblemished. And, Calvin even though he might be wearing some makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas laughed, and spun around. \u201cYou like? Ted thought I should get really spiffed up. He said the more hunky I look, the more sympathetic I\u2019d appear. And, the more marketable I\u2019d be for news stories and interviews. He hired a tailor and stylist and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarketable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah. Babe, you know we\u2019re low on money, especially with me out of work\u2026 But, with a story as wild as mine, we gotta cash in on this while we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, won\u2019t we be making money today, from all the press\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday? No, today we make nothing. You don\u2019t get paid for press conferences. Ted says, we do the press conference today, then wait for the offers for exclusives to come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin shook his head, confused, worried. \u201cYou mean it won\u2019t stop?\u201d Calvin worried if they\u2019d have privacy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas grabbed Calvin\u2019s hand. \u201cBabe, don\u2019t worry. It will be okay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door, as a man Calvin had met some time ago entered. It was Ted, Thomas\u2019s agent and manager. It had been a couple years since Calvin last saw Ted, not since Thomas had given up fitness modeling. Ted himself had been a model in his youth, and though nearing 50, still maintained the rugged, chiseled look and youthful energy from his past. At 6\u20194\u201d, he towered over the two men, and when he spoke to them, he did so condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Calvin, you made it. Good! This will be very good for today\u2019s conference. The American public likes a good domestic story. They like to see not just the news figures, but the men and women behind those figures\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin had always hated the way Ted spoke. It was like dirty, filthy, greed just seemed to stream from his mouth. \u201cWell, I\u2019m hear to support Thomas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSupport? Of course. Though if you really want to support him, make sure you play it up a bit, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlay it up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, give details, jazz it up, play the emotions. What was it like seeing your giant hunk of a man become smaller than you? What has this done to your relationship? How does it make you feel that you are inadvertently responsible for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, wait a minute!\u201d Calvin said, getting furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Thomas stepped in quickly, \u201cHey now, Ted. That\u2019s too much. You know just as well as I do that this was an accident. Don\u2019t go pissing off my man\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, got a little caught up. You know me, Tommy. Just want to make my clients get big. Real BIG.... Oh, sorry for the choice of words\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin was really beginning to steam, and even Ted realized he had stepped too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how about I wait outside the room, leave you two alone? I\u2019ll knock a couple times when we\u2019re ready for you. Should be not much longer, half hour or so.\u201d Without even waiting for a reply, Ted quickly stepped out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe press conference was a whirl. Though a complete nightmare for Calvin, it was amazing how quickly it all went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Calvin and Thomas were amazed at how many showed up. Evidently, Ted did a great job wrangling reporters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were cameras and microphones everywhere. And voices and questions. Thomas at first was intimidated, especially being in a room surrounded by so many people so much taller than him. But once he sat down and the questions began, he calmed down, and was a natural. He was eloquent and honest and ridiculously telegenic. Calvin sat next to him, mostly silent, and strangely turned on by this side of Thomas he had never seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctors and scientists also were there, discussing theories and discoveries and fears. The crowd gasped when it was revealed Thomas was already almost a foot shorter than his normal height. And they sighed sadly when they had heard that what seemed like a recent cure was no longer working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were questions, questions galore. But Ted stepped in, and stopped the conference early. He really wanted to whet their curiosity. Make them hunger for more. Soon, he ushered the Thomas and Calvin out of the room. Thomas looked anxious, like he was upset to leave. But then soon quieted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, just a half hour later, both men were in Calvin\u2019s car, heading home to await the response.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They must have stretched in the wash or something,\" Thomas said to Calvin. \"You bought me these jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember buying jeans that big for you, \" Calvin replied. \"They must be at least a 36x36.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin tugged at Thomas' jeans from behind to look at the tag. The tag read 32x34. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... You must be losing weight.. The jeans are your size after all,\" Calvin commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, I haven't changed my diet and exercise lately...\" Thomas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas looked at himself in the mirror. Sure enough the jeans looked a few sizes too big. But they were longer than usual as well. Thomas looked like one of those teens trying to pull off the baggy pants look. Except it just looked ridiculous on him being an adult and all. He never liked that new style. Thomas and Calvin didn't really say much more about the baggy jeans and continued their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't really going anywhere for vacation, but they were enjoying having the time off to just relax. Calvin went out into the garden to water, weed, and get a few things done, while Thomas took pictures of bugs in the garden as well as Calvin working in the garden. It was a hot, sunny day, and Calvin and Thomas were feeling parched after their hard work and from being outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a cold glass of water?\" Thomas inquired to his sweaty lover working away in the garden. \"I could use one myself, so I'll go get us each one, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Calvin beamed. \"So thoughtful of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas rushed inside, and opened the cupboard to reach for the cups. Wait... Reach? He almost had to stand on his tip toes to grab cups today. Usually he is almost eye level with them! He set the cups on the counter and grabbed the water pitcher out of the fridge. It seemed heavier than normal. It was quite full. But he didn't remember it ever being this heavy. Thomas carefully poured each glass full of water and set the water pitcher back in the fridge. He made his way outside, a glass of water in each hand. Why did the glasses even feel heavier than usual?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way to Calvin, he noticed that his feet seemed to have more room in his shoes. He had almost reached Calvin when he tripped on his own jeans again. Falling forward, he lost a shoe as he tripped, and the glasses of water went flying, and shattered on the ground right in front of him. Calvin helped Thomas up off the ground. Looking at Thomas as he helped him up, Calvin noticed that the jeans Thomas wore appeared to be even longer now. The cuffs of his jeans dragging on the ground. Calvin helped Thomas bunch up the jeans around his ankles so that he wouldn't trip again. Calvin noticed Thomas' socks appeared to be loose as well as his shoes appearing too big. Calvin noticed he was also now eye level with Thomas, when he had to look up to him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel so good,\" Thomas says, once he brushed himself off from tripping. \"What's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could be seeing things, but it looks to me like you're getting shorter...\" Calvin replied. \"Let's get you inside sweetie. You should lie down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure...\" Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People don't just shrink!\" Thomas thought to himself. \"It's physically impossible, there must be another explanation...\"</span></div></div>",

Just a mild itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas didn't think much more about the tingling, which had slowly spread from his fingers to his hands and arms. He grabbed a towel in the kitchen and rubbed some of the lotion from his hands, but the itchy tingling continued to spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by a knock at the back door, he tossed the towel back onto the kitchen counter. He opened the door and welcomed Darrell, the attractive, young postal carrier who made almost daily visits to their household to deliver parcels from the laboratory to Calvin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's another delivery for Cal,\" Darrell said. The young black man filled out nicely the standard blue and white uniform of a U.S. postal employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for bringing it to the door,\" Thomas said, but as he reached for the package, he stumbled. \"Whoa! Feeling a little dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later, he felt Darrell catch him in two strong arms. \"Yeah, you're getting a little unsteady on your feet, big guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas felt like a telescoping effect as his body seemed to contract rapidly, creating the illusion that Darrell and the kitchen were growing swiftly larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Darrell's astonished gaze, the tall, muscular, blond man quickly shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than seconds, Thomas lost at least half of his six foot-two inch height. The now three-foot-tall man, swimming in his oversized clothing, raised his eyes to gaze up at a very impressive-looking Darrell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Thomas exclaimed, noticing the newly-acquired high pitch of his voice. \"You look 12 feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to you?\" Darrell asked. He had let his bag of letters and other mail slide down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas felt the tell-tale tingling renew with vigor. \"No! It's happening again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen another 12 inches melted from his frame, his clothing simply collapsed around him. He stood barely even with Darrell's shins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call Calvin, please,\" he piped up as he struggled in the heap of collapsed attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell, trying to react with a calmness he didn't truly feel at the moment, went on reflex when he reached down and placed his hands beneath the little man's arms and lifted him out of the clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Thomas protested as he felt the huge man lift him free of his boxers and jeans. He kicked his small legs in the air as Darrell lifted him with no more effort than he would have needed for a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down! Over there, on the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell followed the instructions, but even seated with his bare butt on the kitchen counter, Thomas found himself level with the giant man's waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell felt warring emotions, one being shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as he felt himself stirring in his pants, he recognized the other. He felt a lusty wave of desire as he stared at the much-reduced little man left helpless in his control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, you look...you look so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... I'm a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't gonna say that,\" Darrell said. He licked his lips. \"I was gonna say you look hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas, who had only room for panic in his thoughts, registered the giant black man's remark. At the same time, he saw the bulge, not at all well concealed, forming beneath the crotch of Darrell's uniform. Staring at it, he could suddenly no longer turn his eyes away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he even felt his own dick start to harden and quickly moved his hands down to try to conceal it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell's dark eyes seemed to lock onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you tell me once you and Cal have an open relationship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge, dark hand covered his mouth. \"When does this sort of opportunity happen?\" He asked in a lowered voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" Darrell said persuasively. \"Just, uh, a little fun and then I can take you to Cal.\"</span></div></div>",

His other hand reached inside and, after some maneuvers, pulled out a thick, dark cock at least half the size of the 24-inch form that Thomas found himself reduced to at the moment.  Free of its confines. the hard, rigid organ bobbed at countertop level in front of Thomas's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell looked wickedly pleased with himself and folded his arms across his chest as he stared down at his exposed cock and the little man. Thomas picked up a heady mix of musky scents that left his mind farther clouded as his eyes followed the slowly swinging cock as if hypnotized by it. From his perspective, the heavy organ looked at least three feet long, with several prominent veins encircling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell lowered one of his hands and used it to move his cock in a wide swing, smashing the heavy organ against Thomas, knocking him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't enough, he now let the heavy cock come to rest on top of the little man, now sprawled flat on his back. As Thomas struggled, he only managed to get his arms and legs wrapped around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good job, little man,\" Darrell said with a moan caused by an unintentional squeeze as Thomas worked to free himself from the heavy burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he resisted, Thomas realized how turned on the whole situation had made him.

I just\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarrell looked displeased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\u2026\" Thomas swallowed when he saw the anger in the dark visage looking down at him\u2026 \"sorry Sir, but I\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take care of your master first, runt, and then I might let you jerk off that little pathetic dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Thomas replied, putting aside his aching need to renew his assault on the huge black cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good little man,\" Darrell groaned. He enjoyed the way his absolute control over the shrunken runt left Thomas with no option but to submit to his will and whim.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Darrell's eyes, meanwhile, bugged out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas had never felt so weak and powerless.

Looking all the way up at Darrell's face, Thomas realized he looked to be over 100 feet tall.

Stroking the 4-inch bulge in his pocket disbelievingly he walked back to his van and got in. He felt the tiny figure struggle and this stimulated Derrell even more, knowing it was absolutely useless. Derell quelled these protests by resting his large hand firmly on the pocket and steering with one hand as he held the tiny in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached his apartment building quickly and moved inside fast before his boner had a chance to betray him to the public. This was an incredible opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas thrashed around like an eel inside the dark, hot confines of the pocket but it was no use. The next time he saw light, he was standing on an unfamiliar bed in a small - well, by normal standards - bedroom. He looked around until he saw Derrell, still wearing his uniform, staring down at him - still wearing that shocked, almost bug-eyed expression he had worn when you initially shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing,\" Derrell said. \"The things we could get up to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrell suddenly moved and Thomas recoiled, falling back onto his ass in surprise. The gigantic postman had climbed onto the bed in a kneeling position - he was kneeling directly over Thomas. Towering over him, dominating him, and staring down his nose at him.

He feel asleep and didn't awake until he heard a car door slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned over on his back, he saw their next-door neighbor, Pete, walking past the fence. Pete glanced over the fence and shouted a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful day for that,\" Pete said, noting Thomas's sunbathing attire. \"Maybe I should join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete Carson was thirty-five. He was 5\"10 inches tall, with an average build. He had brown hair and eyes. He also had a neatly trimmed mustache. He managed a fashionable restaurant, which kept him busy in the evenings, but gave him his days free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I've been out long enough,\" Thomas said. As he spoke, he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt odd when his trunks slid along his waist. He gripped them and pulled them up. They were far more roomy than he remembered. He had taken them on the cruise just last month and Calvin had remarked on how cute his butt looked in the tight trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the house, still wondering about the trunks. He went to the room he shared with Calvin and looked for something else to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe choose a T-shirt and a worn pair of jeans. The T-shirt was baggy on his frame and the jeans, which should have been very tight, were a few inches too long and too open at the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Thoma muttered. He walked across the room toward the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as he reached the door, his entire body experienced a sudden jolt of pain. His body felt as if it was on fire. The pain got so bad that he cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like a soothing splash, the pain eased, but not before Thomas had blacked out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His clothes, even his tightest outfits, were far too big for him. He had done a crude estimate of his current height. He wasn't any taller than five feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something\u2014 something's happening to me,\" Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin had never heard his lover so upset. \"What's the matter, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2014 I don't know. It's so weird, Cal. None of my clothes fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no need to panic. We both ate like pigs during our cruise. You probably put on a little weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Cal,\" Thomas said. \"Listen to me. I haven't gained weight. I've gotten shorter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm smaller,\" Thomas blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible,\" Calvin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas let his voice get shrill. \"I'm standing here looking in the fucking mirror, Cal! I know what I see. I'm shorter than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin's scientific mind began racing. \"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Thomas cried. \"Please, come home. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'll be home as soon as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had been told what to expect, Calvin wasn't truly prepared when he walked into his home, Thomas ran to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin, so accustomed to gazing up at his lover, had to look down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me!\" Thomas shouted in a voice growing more shrill and thin. \"I'm only five feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, honey,\" Calvin said, desperate to calm Thomas. \"It's important that we not panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrinking!\" Thomas exclaimed. \"I think I'm entitled to panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin moved closer and ran his fingers through his lover's hair, a trick that usually soothed his occasional agitated states. \"We've just got to figure out what could have caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin urged Thomas to describe in detail what he had done since waking that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas recounted everything up to the point Calvin left for the lab. \"Then I came into the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had entered the kitchen. \"Well, I washed my hands and\u2014\" Thomas stared at the tube of lotion on the kitchen table. He remembered the odd tingling. \"And I used that lotion on my hands. And, afterwards, it felt weird somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Calvin gasped. He rushed to the table. \"This is the lotion we've been testing. There have been some reports of some odd side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas grew pale. \"Was shrinking to five feet tall one of the side effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'll have to place a call to the lab in New York. They assigned us this project. I'll try to run down something more specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be able to fix it, won't you?\" Thomas looked up at his lover with a desperate, hopeful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin could not shake the strangeness he felt at seeing Thomas look up at him. He always had to be the one to look up in their relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go into the den and relax,\" Calvin said. \"I'll make some calls. All right, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Thomas said. Before he left, Calvin had to bend over and plant a kiss on his lover's forehead. \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you. I always do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas smiled. \"Yeah, I know. But, Cal, I can't help wondering. What if I keep shrinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain that won't happen,\" Calvin said. \"You called me two hours ago. Have you gotten any smaller since then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Thomas admitted somewhat reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Calvin walked into the den. Thomas, resting on his back on the sofa, had his eyes closed. Calvin tiptoed across the room, leaned over and kissed Thomas lightly on the lips.<br>\r\n\"Hey, baby,\" Calvin said. \"You get some rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Thomas said. \"Did you hear from the lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. Since its the weekend, I could not find anybody to answer my question about the nature of the side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, call them at home. We've got to find some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will,\" Calvin promised. \"I left a message with the lab's receptionist. Dr. Brevard, the chief of research, will call me back. I know him. He will call me as soon as he gets the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Calvin said, \"Why don't I go out and buy us some dinner? How about Chinese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Thomas answered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He walked through the house. \"Thomas!\" Calvin said, growing worried. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal,\" came a weak, soft voice. \"I'm in here!\"<br>\r\nCalvin stepped into the bathroom adjacent to the bedroom. He gasped when he saw Thomas standing nude and only three feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were tears in his lover's eyes. \"Oh God! Oh my God, Cal. Look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Calvin did look, noticing his lover's still perfectly-proportioned body, which looked even hotter at this scale. Calvin began to feel aroused. But, one look at Thomas's fearful and irritated expression warned him not to voice his feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened again. There's this intense pain, and then I shrank more,\" Thomas explained. \"You've got to do something, Cal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, I will,\" Calvin said. \"Let me give the lab in New York another call. Maybe I can get Dr. Brevard's home number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, they met in the kitchen. Thomas was draped in a huge T-shirt that covered him to below his knees. None of his clothes came close to fitting. When he went to take a seat at the table, he noticed his head barely extended above the tabletop. Calvin, who had trained himself in the little ways of making his lover comfortable, pushed the chair forward. \"Maybe I could get you a cushion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Thomas said. \"I'm fine. Did you reach Dr. Brevard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I still can't get through. I guess the lab is closed for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay like this until Monday!\" Thomas cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honey, maybe it will wear off on its own,\" Calvin said as he handed his lover a plate of Chinese food. The plate looked awkward in his lover's small, almost boyish hands. The hands were certainly not the large, firm hands that Calvin had grown so fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to eat while making routine conversation, but neither man could really get into routine mode. What was happening to Thomas was too bizarre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished their meal quickly. \"I'll tidy up in here,\" Calvin said. \"Go on to the bedroom. I won't be long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cal,\" Thomas said, staring at his lover's waist and then lifting his head, \"I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's late,\" Cal said. \"I'll clean the kitchen in the morning. Let's go to bed. In the morning, we can try to look for answers with a clear head\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Thomas said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin grinned. \"Come on, honey. Let's get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shrugged, which caused his T-shirt to slide off his shoulders. He caught the garment and held it, but was bare to the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalvin touched his lips with the tip of his tongue. He bent over and took Thomas into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas felt extremely strange in the crushing embrace of his enormous lover. He had always enfolded Calvin in his strong, muscular arms. To be held like this emphasized his sudden lack of stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so absorbed in the strangeness of the situation that he didn't immediately responded to Calvin's increased caresses and kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he pulled from Calvin's arms. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you, baby!\" Calvin whispered. \"God, just looking at you like this is turning me so hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This turns you on!\" Thomas exclaimed. \"I look like a freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Calvin said. \"You're so hot. It's so incredible to be the one to wrap you tight in my arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas had to admit the strong embrace had felt pleasurable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might as well take advantage of this situation,\" Calvin dared to suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to bed, and I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Thomas cried out, \"Oh my God! What do you think you're going to do with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was looking with a mixture of awe and horror at Calvin's erection. Everything looked so much more unbelievably huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Calvin begged in a persuasive tone. \"I'll be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas swallowed and took another look at the enormous, eager cock. He knew he wanted it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Caleb takes his first thirsty gulp of lemonade, Thomas can't help looking up at him. Caleb is well-muscled with great chest sculpture and thick legs. He could see somewhat up his tight wardrobe which barely contains a hairy overgrowth in his nethers. Caleb's feet reek of work sweat as well as fresh lawn, as he did all of the work barefoot on top of the trimmed grass. Then it occurred to him that Caleb would be his chance of returning to normal size.

He couldn't see much glare from beneath the canopy of Caleb's body, but beyond his shadow the sky is unimaginable bright. No cloud hangs in the sky. Moisture from the front walk rises like an invisible mist. It feels hot to little Thomas as his carrier wanders towards the patio bench and takes a sit in the shade. He passes by the lawn mower, leaned against the wall. \"He certainly finished it,\" thinks Thomas as the college hottie sprawls on the lawn chair. His toes get close to the edge of the umbrella's shadow and he can feel himself heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden floors rattle as another college dude stomps up the stairs towards him. He's pretty toned and wearing thin gym shorts, white running shoes without socks, and a walkman strapped to his arm. \"Hey man,\" he says as he slaps Caleb's hand and the two shake, which felt like thunder to little Thomas. \"You done here? One of the frats down the road opened up their pool.\" Caleb smiles. \"They're not here, but I'll check by tomorrow for my pay. Lemme grab my bag and we'll go.\" Thomas gets carried off on Caleb's toe as he reaches a pair of neon red flip-flops. As they get slipped on, he jumps out of the way to avoid getting crushed. But fortunately for Thomas, the hold between Caleb's toes would make for a better handle than his toe hairs. With a small bag over his heavy shoulders, the two college hunks head for the frat's pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom little Thomas' perspective, the whole place looks packed with buff bodies, some in speedos or swim trunks. Caleb leaves his sweaty friend saying \"Lemme go change, I'll be by the pool with ya.\" He steps into a small wooden changing room and shuts the door. Without any hesitation, he tosses off his skimpy trunks to reveal his manhood to his unexpected spectator. Buff Caleb surely is quite endowed for little Thomas. He kicks off the shorts and slips on a pair of emerald green speedos. Once complete, Caleb steps into the party, ready for a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas however is...</span></div></div>",

It all happens quickly when his ride falls into the water face-first like a log, only to rise above for a breath before he begins his swimming strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas can not sense well Caleb's breaststroke as he shut his eyes. Nevertheless, water still gets between the lids and irritates the surface with pool chlorine. His ears are full of water, so the splashes from above sound dull in comparison to the turbulence beneath the surface. Caleb's swimming lap ends quickly and finishes with a relaxing sit at the edge of the shallow end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Thomas is in real danger. Though Caleb's lower body can stay submerged for a long period of time, he is running low on oxygen. In a mad struggle, he yanks his legs from the elastic and scrambles to the surface. He breaks the surface in time and gasps for air. Eyes still stinging, he tries his best to examine his surroundings. Many of the partygoers in the distance sunbathe while others hang out in the shade of the garden trees. Along the edge of the pool, some jocks stir the waters with their bare feet. Thomas continues to tread water, panting from exhaustion until a shadow descends over him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up to see a massive giant, more building than man with long messy brown hair that descends towards his mountainous shoulders. He definitely looks ripped with big upper arms, legs, and a pretty toned chest. His size seems to test even his red speedos, which hang gingerly from low on his waist so the base of his cock and his upper pubic carpet breaks above the elastic. This big guy bends his knees before shouting \"CANNONBALL!\" The splash sends great waves on all ends of the pool, and during this event suddenly, Thomas</span></div></div>",

Then there was this massive splash as the big muscled guy leaped into the water. A vortex in the pool of its newest occupant sucks down the tiny man into a deep red cavern. The current runs through the tangled mess of hair like kelp in an ocean. Thomas can not swim against this, but instead he grabs a clump of hair with his right hand and holds tight. The next hand follows, but even then he slides further down towards the tips. He maintains his breath as he holds on for dear life, listening to the sucking of the water draining from the leg holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the water gives way, giving the tiny man a chance for fresh air. From his desperate hold, he looks below as the last of the pool water drains away and seals the gap between the red speedos and the big guy's legs. The view down is only partially obscured by soggy masses of pubic hair, pressed down by moisture. Thomas turns skyward to see the body of the big guy who unknowingly caught him in his swimwear. Unfortunately his face can not be seen as to his perspective, the toned flesh mountains of his chest and belly block this view. Thankfully this guy's member pushes against the tiny red canopy so the elastic opens up despite the leg holes sealed against the skin with pool water. The tiny man, lungs fresh with oxygen, musters his strength and clambers up the mat of pubic hair. The waterlogged mess does allow for simple grips, but great strength to keep from sliding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thomas gets closer and closer to the elastic opening, the big guy struts over to...</span></div></div>",

He sprawls over the elastic opening as he catches his breath, but there's no time for him to rest on his laurels just yet. The big guy is on the move, taking the tiny man along for the ride. Each step doesn't help the passenger's grip, as it causes his member to bounce against the tiny speedos and threating to undo what he worked so hard to achieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the giant's trek only takes him not far from the pool, beside a few lawn chairs and fancy patio furniture. He stretches his calves in front of a similarly tall guy wearing a tank top, sunglasses, and laced swim trunks. He looks buff, but not as toned as the big guy. His blonde hair is slicked back. The giant gets his attention. \"Hey, what's up?\" The other guy turns around, revealing a shaved face with slight but noticeable traces of beard stubble on his square chin - noticeable greatly for tiny Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first guy in speedos tries to break the ice. He engages in small talk, but nowhere close to proper flirting or one-liners. His best technique so far is folding his arms behind his back and leaning back so he faces the sky, showing off his chest. For little Thomas, he can tell the big guy likes what he sees. The thick dick rises slowly until only its upper tip is covered by the speedo. For him, this involuntary arousal builds a little bridge that he uses to climb along the elastic and onto the shaft. He continues slowly along the perilous perch separating him from the pubic forest below, heading for the base of his abs.

He hears a low roar of air rushing like a balloon. Slight quakes shake the moist smooth surface. Before him, he sees a massive panoramic view of the beach god.

Suddenly, six thick pegs touch down on the surface, surrounding him like a cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis can't be a helicopter. They don't have six legs, nor are they hairy. In front of him, a seventh peg touches down last - but it doesn't land as softly as the other ones. Instead it plunges intently into the skin, boring into it. A loud sucking sound follows. Thomas crawls out of the way from beneathe these legs to see the mystery visitor on the jock's skin. It is a mosquito, a little larger than Thomas and hungry for blood. The tiny man gets a good view of the normally tiny creature's large compound eyes. Though he knows it sees him, it continues to suck blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shadow startles the bug, turning Thomas' view skyward.

The blood-sucking fly shows no interest and instead hovers close to the opening, spreading its legs to land and prepare a second feast. Thomas couldn't help but notice that the normal bob of the jaw and head dulls slightly and a shadow falls behind him. It could just be the jock's hair blowing in the wind or the nature shadow of the outer ear itself. He turns around and sees instead the fine outline of a palm heading towards him and the insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes a break for it and slides off the mosquito's leg. He grabs an outer ring of flesh around the ear while the mosquito senses the threat and tries to swerve out of the way. As the jock's hand gets closer to smash the bloodsucker, the tiny man hanging on the edge of his ear would be smashed too. Adrenaline floods his veins as Thomas dashes to the only direct safety he can find - the hole of his ear canal. In the nick of time, he dives inside while his carrier faces its fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns around to see the aftermath at the entrance to the ear canal. From the light outside, he sees the silhouette of a twitching insect leg and wing. It did not last as another shadow falls over the entrance as the jock scratches the bug entrails and carcass from his ear. His only courier to this guy is gone. Thomas turns towards the darkness leading deeper into his head. He must be able to get the jock to hear him. As he crawls through the cave littered with fine hair and earwax chunks, the cave bounces once more as the jog continues. Thomas can not see far into the cave, but he only hopes that he's close enough to the eardrum. One step however stops him. His foot lands in a glob of wet earwax, which sticks fast and impedes his journey. He trips and claws the cave floor, but in turn he gathers more earwax and he sticks to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's now or never....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sucks in a lungful of air and releases it all at once. \"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it work?</span></div></div>",

He passes through the living room, littered with used and well-loved small gym equipment. He kicks the dumbbells aside as he passes by the brilliance of his trophy case. So many years and so many memories, each a notch to his physique. He doesn't hesitate to head into the kitchen and pour some milk into a glass, then he takes a spoonful of protein shake mix and pours it in as well. He works fast with his stirring, as the jog has given him a massive appetite. Shake complete, he chugs it all down his throat. Before it all settles in his stomach, a sharp voice interrupts the rest of his drink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan lowers his glass to scan the kitchen. Nothing's there. Maybe it's the neighbors, or even the college-age jocks at the pool being rowdy. He finishes his shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAN YOU HEAR ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds awfully close, but nobody's in sight. He doesn't recognize the voice, but he feels inclined to investigate. \"Who's there?\" he asks into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?\" it repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can hear you,\" Ryan grows indignant. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Thomas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you? There's nobody here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm inside your ear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan chuckles. \"Oh please. Listen here, 'Thomas,' The name's Ryan and I have a great job and a body to die for. I can't afford to be a schizo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know I'm not going crazy and hearing strange voices in my head?\" He slams his glass down on the kitchen table, maybe it's something in the mix. \"Prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an awful predicament, thinks Thomas. He's inside the ear of a jock, though he's more stuck in a pool of his earwax to be precise. The big guy can hear him, but he just brushed him off and assumes him to be a hallucination of some kind. How can Thomas show he's not an element of Ryan's imagination? </span></div></div>",

Seeing as there was nothing on TV he used his video on demand account to look up a movie he wanted to see badly. It was a superhero movie about a man who had the power to shrink while wearing a special suit. The idea was something strange to him. Why would anyone want that superpower? I mean he could understand it if people wanted to grow, but shrinking that had to be the dumbest thing you could do. Seeing as the plot of the movie wasn't all that he hoped it would be his mind drifted into this dilemma a little more.<br>\r\nBeing able to grow sounded like fun, but then again, you wouldn't fit anywhere. So probably an even better superpower would be the ability to shrink everyone around you. Well, it would never happen anyway, but maybe it would be fun to shrink just one of those college-jocks, a cocky one and bring him literally and figuratively down to size. Ryan chuckles to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time Ryan spends watching his movie and dreaming about shrinking people is a lot less pleasant for you. You have no clue what is going to this mans mind, the fact your currently trapped between a dark blue couch and a yellow clad ass keeps your mind more than occupied. You try to move but find out you can do no more than wiggle your toes and fingers a bit and open and close your mouth. This last bit is a bit of a blessing as you can try to suck in most of your air through your mouth, because breathing through your nose is pure torture. You never liked people that kept walking around in their running short. Calvin did it too at times and you always told him to change before sitting on the furniture. You love him, but you hate the whole sweaty shorts thing. You promise yourself to not pester him about it anymore, because this does feel like Karma that comes to bite you in the ass. Wow, that was a very bad train of thought right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to sit this sitting out by trying some breathing excercises, clearing your mind as much as possible. You register some sounds, like Ryan chuckling to himself and the muffled sounds of action scenes on the television. You try to ignore the fact your body is slowly being covered by this mans ass-sweat. And you get into a rhytm, breath in and breath out. As time passes by you feel yourself relax a little and it actually helps in lessening the discomfort. You kind of mold yourself into your tight prison and this decreases the pain and anxiety you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyans mind keeps drifting off during the movie and the action scenes where okay, but it was just too much computer animated to look believeable. It could never happen. He leans forward to get the remote, giving him a slight wedgy, and turns of the TV. He puts his feet on the ground and gets up. He stretches and turns and from the corner of his eyes he sees the couch. </span></div></div>",

You know you should really make a run for it, but your muscles aren't very co\u00f6perative yet. All you can do is look up at the mountainous man who stretches himself and twist his upper body back and forth, untill he suddenly stops. You don't understand why right away, untill he slowly turns towards the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan loosens his muscles untill suddenly he sees something strange from the corner of his eye. Right in the middle of the couch, where his ass was only a few seconds ago, there's an off-coloured stain. And it seems to move. He turns to face it and looks down and the first thing that comes to mind is that the man from the movie he just watched is now lying on his couch. He kneels down in front of the couch and sticks out a finger to poke the thing lying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's face filled with amazement suddenly closes in on you and a large finger reaches for you and pokes you in the stomach making you grunt. Ryan quickly pulls back his hand and leans in closer. His mouth opens and he whispers, \"No way, a shrunken man?\" You take a deep breath and sit up. No way to avoid him now. \"Hello Ryan, I'm Thomas, the guy you heard in your head earlier.\" The corners of Ryans mouth travel up slightly into a smile. \"You are real? And you were in my ear?\" You nod. \"And... now you're on my couch?\" You nod again \"Yeah, I escaped from your ear as you laid down and tumbled down to the seat.\" Ryan grins, \"The seat, where I've been sitting for the past two hours?\" You look away a bit ashamed before saying. \"erm... unfortunately yes. You kind of trapped me when you sat down.\" You look back as you hear Ryan chuckling, \"You survived my ass for over two hours? Wow, I guess you really have some kind of superpowers. Tell me how was it?\" You raise one eye-brow questioningly, but realise Ryan probably can't discern that. Best thing to do is just answer him for now. If you keep him talking it might turn out fine. \"Erm... well, you luckily your cheeks landed on each of my sides. But the fabric of your shorts pushed me down into the couch. I could barely move a muscle. At first it was a bit painfull, but I forced my body to relax and that made it a little easier. And well, it was quite sweaty, because you hadn't changed after your run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your words you notice to your dismay the look on Ryans face changes slightly from amazement to amusement. You even see a little sparkle of desire in the bright green eyes. After you're done he licks his lips and says, \"Wow that sounds like quite a predicament. I'm really sorry I didn't know you where there.\" There's something in the way he says it that makes a mental alarm go in inside your head. \"Just wait a second right there.\" He adds and walks away. You sit tight and wait for him to come back. When he returns he's carrying a tray with some foods and drink on them and places it off to the side of the couch. He grabs the remote from the table and suddenly turns around and lowers his yellow ass back down right on top of you. You hear the tv turn back on and feel Ryan lean to the right to grab some of the food. He wiggles his ass a bit on top of you. \"Now I know you're down there watching tv will be a lot more satisfying. I guess there's no time like the present to start watching that trilogy of fantasy movies about a ring. I know I'm quite comfortable right here.\" You scream, even though you know it's useless, he won't hear you, \"Please Ryan, get off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you realise he won't be able to hear you over the crunching of the chips in his mouth and the opening overture of the movie. You realise struggling won't do you any good at all. So the best thing is to just wait it out. However Ryan seems to be enjoying himself, he makes sure to occasionaly wriggle around to make your life a living hell.</span></div></div>",

You feel the air escape your body as he leans forward and you thank several higher beings as he gets up and you get a taste of fresh air. Your eyes are a bit teary and you notice the hand picking you up only seconds before it does. You're carried up to Ryans face and see s slight smirk. \"You know, knowing you're down there is a lot of fun. But no matter how much I wiggle I can't actually feel your tiny body.\" You look him in the eye and think, that it's over now. But the smirk turns into a grin. \"So I think I would enjoy it a little more if we removed the fabric between our bodies.\" You cry out in shock and that makes him laugh. No way you think, he's gonna take off his pants? After laughing he looks at you one more time, \"Enjoy the rest of the movie little one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lowers you back down he hasn't removed his shorts yet. But when he reaches you around in his fist you notice his other hand is holding his shorts open at the waste and you can't help but scream as you know what's about to happen. His fist with you in it plunges down into the dark, moist and rank smelling shorts opening up and pressing your body slightly in his crack. As the hand retreats a few second later you hear the waisteband snap closed and you are engulfed in darkness. The walls in front of you open up slightly as you feel yourself moving down. Ryan is sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he hits the couch the pressure from outside pushes you against the greasy skin. You hear Ryan laugh as he rubs his ass over the seat and squeezes his cheeks a few times around you. \"That's better, now I can feel you too. And that makes it all the more enjoyable. I hope you're enjoying the full moon, cause it might be a permanent position for you.\" After all that happened, this is the final straw that breaks your back. You can't help it, you suddenly start sobbing. Tears start running down your cheeks as the movie starts up again. The smell of musk and sweat is overpowering and even though you have a little more room inside of the pants than on the outside, every move you make ends up with you rubbing Ryans ass. And you don't want to do that. Occasionaly Ryan shifts a bit in his seat. But nothing major happens untill. </span></div></div>",

As he starts walking around and cleaning up you hear him hum slightly. It sounds familiar but you can't make it out through the fabric. Suddenly he pats his butt and you hear him.\"Guess I'm gonna go for another run today.\" You scream into the flesh, but he moves and you hear a door open and close. And his pace picks up. Faster and faster he goes. Rubbing his cheeks over your body with every step. And soon he starts to sweat and the salty liquid rolls over your body. The sweat mixes with your own salty tears as you realise that this man is the biggest sadist you could've ended up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems forever he slows down a little and finally comes to a normal walk.

Cause I felt like I really grinded you during my run and here you are, alive.... enough.\" You remain silent under his stern gaze, \"Unfortunately for you, apparantly unlike antman, you can't return to your normal size.\" The way he speaks sends a shiver down your spine. \"So that brings us to the present. You ended up under my ass for some reason. And for some reason you don't seem to happy about it.\" You don't know how to reply to that. So he continuous, \"I know I have a very nice ass and I have had people worship it before. So I guess all we need to do here is a little more time for you to learn how lucky you really are to be so close to it for such an extended period of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he pushes you flat on his hand and reaches back into the toilet bowl and suddenly scrapes you through his ass. Pulling you out covered in shit and sweat. Some even filling your mouth and nose giving you the most awfull tastesensation you've ever had, As he pulls you up he uses a piece of toilet paper to wipe of most of the grime before scraping you through his crack again. This goes on for a few more times as you lay limpless in his hand, hoping this will make it end sooner. Finally he seems satisfied. \"You're a pretty good asswipe, I see, you didn't even struggle. Maybe you do like it, but I think you're just trying to make me think you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets up and walks over to the sink, where he start to clean you roughly under the flowing water. \"Now, I wonder how long it will take me to make you beg to be under my ass all the time.\" You go limp in his hand, all hope seems to flow from your mind. \"And by that I don't mean begging to please me.\"He grins, \"I mean begging because you really feel you want to live in my ass for the rest of your tiny life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think I know exactly how to do just that.\"</span></div></div>",

Thomas looks up, but can not be sure what it is. It's big, but it didn't make that heavy of a thud when it hit the wood. Looking behind him, he can see the enormous pair of yellow flip flops and the jock's toes in his direction. Curious, Thomas approaches and watches a yellow shroud descend from between the feet. He gets a closer look, realizing that it was the pair of yellow speedos, meaning the giant is changing clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approaches him, not too far away from the protective shade of the bench but not too close to the massive toes. There he gets a nice voyeur's eye view of his great endowment. He's big not just in his musculature and height. Still, all that time in the hot sun gave him a pungent sweat smell. Suddenly, a shadow falls before him shortly after the jock leans into the bench. Thomas looks stunned as a massive pile of fabric descends on top of him. Frightened but alive, he crawls through a weird mess of caves. The jock had emptied out a bag of clothes directly on top of him, and the ride is just beginning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jock with the shark tooth necklace grabs the pile and assumes order from it. He didn't bring much. Instead he slips on his boxers in place of his speedos, followed by a short-cut army camouflage pair of shorts. He slips his arms through his grey tank-top, which hugs tightly his well-muscled body. Dressed and ready, he carries his swim gear in the clothing bag and leaves the changing room. He stops with one of the friends to say \"This was a great party, I had fun. I'm gonna head back to the frat now, so I'll see ya.\" All the while, he unknowingly carries little Thomas inside...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, in one terrific lurch, he felt the fabric surface whoosh upward at great speed. He managed to roll onto his back just in time to see the underside of shark tooth guy's big, hairy balls rushing toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, he felt himself trapped beneath the fabric of the guy's boxers and the big, sweaty globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough all this, he managed to pick up a few stray words. \"\u2026 great party, I had fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic blared, then he picked up more of the muffled conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 gonna head back to the frat now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas felt a surge of panic. Shark tooth jock (ridiculous, he thought, that he didn't even know this colossal man's name) was heading back to the frat house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was the one tenuous link tiny Thomas had back to his old world and former life. Caleb, if he could get to him, would at least recognize him. These other giants were strangers with the unpredictable actions of strangers. He squirmed and flailed, but the weight of the giant jock's balls fell perfectly over him to keep him quite pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis movements, however, didn't go entirely unnoticed. Responding to a minor itch, the jock did reach down, scratch himself and then made a quick adjustment as he stepped out of the party house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to do the trick, and he continued on his way back to his frat house in the center of a campus located several miles from the home Thomas shared with Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea of the ordeal taking place in his shorts as a bug-sized man found himself at the mercy of copious amounts of sweat as he almost smothered beneath the damp, rank balls of an enormous college jock. Earlier, what must have been a simple scratch from the giant jock had very nearly reduced him to a smear. Just a fraction of an inch closer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shuddered as he tried to get some fresh air. He didn't really want to think of the close call. He would just have to endure....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the frat house, he saw one of his buddies in the common room. He waved as he headed toward the stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Chad\" his friend yelled in a loud voice. \"Back so soon from the party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Chad answered in an equally loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Josh's boxers, a tiny man realized that, at the very least, he now knew the name of shark tooth guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see how that would make a lot of difference, however.</span></div></div>",

Maybe he can climb up Josh's balls. His hair can be used to pull himself out from beneath them. Thomas claws instead in the opposite direction and grabs the nearest strand of hair to his hand. The surface is pretty oily, he can only use this briefly so all of his strength must count now. He grabs it with his second hand and immediately pulls. The first few bits yield no difference in his situation, but the last few tugs manage to get his legs movable from the trap. The hair slips from his grasp but now Thomas can free his legs and ready for the next step of his escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Phase 2 can begin, a loud groan echoes behind him - like the sound of metal grinding against metal. It sounds very close, maybe the zipper. Suddenly, the canopy of Josh's boxers gives way to light and fresh air. He has unwittingly freed his miniature prisoner, but why? Thomas looks up to see a massive hand descend towards him and fingers wrap around a growing erection. He is free, but now is taken for a ride as he is...</span></div></div>",

He felt he would be reasonably safe in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment he wondered what it would be like if Josh found him. Certainly Josh was a jock - the very definition of it - but he didn't seem like one of those total douchebag jocks. He had an air of decency and friendliness at least that made Thomas feel it wouldn't be such a disaster if he was found. Who knew, though - that was part of the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground vibrated and shook with the impact of Josh's tiny movements, his small shifts across the ground as he finished drying. Thomas was almost in awe of the enormous college kid, almost worshipping him. It was difficult not to be humbled by such unbelievable <i>power</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh reached down and grabbed the clothes and Thomas felt the exciting thrill of danger as he was effortlessly carried through the air along with the clothes. Seemed Josh was carrying them back to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of being rocked madly around - a rollercoaster of a feeling that both thrilled and terrified Thomas - the clothes were dropped roughly on the floor. But the soft fabric of the clothes themselves cushioned Thomas' fall and, though dazed, he crawled out of the shorts pocket with no serious injuries and stared up, all the way up, at the now-naked Josh (the towel lay discarded). The soft, but still intimidatingly large, dick pointed down at Thomas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" boomed the giant, the low hum resonating through the room and sending a shiver down Thomas' spine. \"Need a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without further ado, Josh turned - giving Thomas a great view of a sculpted ass - and climbed into bed, pulling the sheets over himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas almost salivated. A sleeping Josh was nothing more than a Josh that had turned himself into a playground, as far as he was concerned. It was time to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to climb up the leg of the bed, not even waiting for Josh to settle down. It was easy - there were so many handholds that even someone as inexperienced in climbing as Thomas could manage it. Plus, he was driven by primal lust, so that helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough he reached the bed. Time to play...or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is drier closer to the door and getting on his belly, tiny Thomas crawls beneath it and onto the hardwood floor of the hallway on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before his first unaware frat giant appears. He is a big guy pacing towards the bathroom door, possibly within the six-foot range. He's quite toned and tanned from the sun, but he's not quite as built as Josh - more tall but not as beefy. His messy light brown hair dangles over his shoulders, bouncing with each step. His only garments are a watch and a sports jock strap. Thomas steps closer towards the crack of the door, making sure the big guy doesn't smash him beneath his bare toes. However the last footstep lands close to him, just an inch or so from a messy fate.

Fortunately, he spotted the red jock strap and reached for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I would need, to turn all the guys' laundry pink!\" Damian said as he dropped the red jock strap on the floor for a later load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poured some powdered detergent and then punched in the buttons to start the wash. </span></div></div>",

From his size, the surface has received miniscule attention from the other jocks. Dust accumulates in the bubble holes and cracks of the floor. At the edges of the wall by the washer and drier, monolithic dust bunnies share this refuge from the broom and mop with tangled cobwebs. It is these that reminds him of how small he is and if he's not careful, he could be nothing more than a spider's snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns his attention when a sudden earthquake rattles the floor as Nathan's foot descends close to him. He must have been at the pool for a long time, since his foot smells strongly of chlorine as it sprawls from his slide sandal. The toes extend over the edge of the sole like the foot of a mountain. Above, Nathan continues his unwanted duty as he pours in the detergent. Thomas couldn't help but watch the bulge in his speedos. It would be incredible to see this guy this close at this size. He's not just a jock, he's a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slide sandal disappears from view, followed by a growing shadow. Since he's standing beneath Nathan's body, the shadow cast is insignificant to Thomas. But upon seeing the foot itself descend towards him, he panics. \"He's gonna step on me,\" he thinks. Paralyzed with fear, he immediately curls into a ball just before the tough rubber sole hits the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas wakes up. He feels for his body, arms, and legs. Nothing feels smashed. How did he survive? Is it a miracle. He looks out on the horizon to see two great walls. In his duck-and-cover defense, he unknowingly was crouched beneath one of the treads of the slide sandal. Suddenly, the floor falls from beneath him and Thomas braces himself with his arms and legs against the rubber walls. The floor returns suddenly, followed by a sudden shock like a car crash. Nathan must be walking. When the foot ascends a second time, a thin silhouette of something hangs from the ceiling, near the base of Thomas' left wall. It twitches slightly, looks like an arm of some kind but broken somehow. Once some light hits it better, he can see what it truly is - the jointed leg of an insect of some kind, maybe a beetle or an ant. The rest of the body is out of view, most likely pulverized after Nathan stepped on it at the pool. Indeed the whole chasm smells of pool water as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the floor returns from beneath him. He waits a bit, unsure if this is the calm before the storm. Beyond the dismembered insect leg he can see light. Eager for safety and unwilling to stand another treatment beneath Nathan's colossal foot, he releases his grip on the walls and runs towards the opening. He leaves the tread, looking up to notice his pinky toe above him. It seems like Nathan hasn't carried the tiny passenger very far as he's in the rec room...</span></div></div>",

He stands slightly taller than Nathan, probably only a few inches above seeing eye-to-eye with him. His body shows incredible tone, surely he's a frequent sight at the local gym. His thighs seem almost like tree trunks, stretching the leg holes of his black boxers. The little man can not help but look away from this giant's body towards his face, mainly his shiny blonde hair and emerald-green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big guy primes his cue, shifting his left foot so only his toes support him. Thomas realizes that the longer he stays down here, the sooner he gets stepped on by these oblivious jocks and the others to come. It may be better to get off the floor and closer to eye level. Hopefully then he might get a chance to be seen. He makes a run for one of the table legs, not far away from Jase's foot. For the moment it stands motionless like some vicious guardian. The tiny man gives it enough distance, hopefully to avoid an involuntary shift that could unintentionally squish him like a bug. The leg itself has a pitted plastic coating, but it isn't as convenient as a ladder. Thomas must watch his hands and feet as he goes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe manages the first few pits in stride, possibly scuff marks of some activity against the table foot. The middle of it has fewer desired pits or grooves for amateur rock climbers. Suddenly, the entire table rocks violently. Thomas slips a good ways down and behind him, Jase leaves his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to aim for the ball, man, not the table...\" A third guy named Campbell picks up his cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it takes to get it in...\" Jase gives a rude smile as he reaches into a bag of chips Campbell set aside as he makes his shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes several turns between the three giant jocks for Thomas to reach a few inches below the plastic lip, about waist level to them. Jase makes another shot and Thomas braces for impact. Apparently, as he shoots, his free arm knocks against the table side. The little man can't hold on like this and above, the balls ricochet against the walls to contribute their own share of unwanted shaking. He looks behind him as Jase trades positions with Nathan. His efforts would be in vain if this continues, so only one rash decision remains. He jumps off the wall and lands on...</span></div></div>",

From the looks and smell, this piece has been used many times by this guy both in and out of the gym. Behind him, the chasm of his pecs force against the grey canopy, making it hard for him to keep his hands on the surface. He checks below for a better hold, and finds it in an obvious and overlooked place. The shark tooth bounces between the very back of the jock's muscle ravine and the tank top. It's still pretty low, and who only knows what'll happen if he doesn't make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas jumps from his desperate spot onto the inside of the ravine. There isn't much hair for a grip, and the sweat building up doesn't improve his descent. He has only to slide until he can grab the last bit of chain of the necklace. He makes his grip strong as he swings onto the moving object and plants his feet above the metal loop holding the shark tooth in place. Nevertheless, he swings like a pendulum on his new perch. Though the journey to destination unknown is one that'll surely bring nausea to the tiny passenger, it is a better spot to be than clinging onto the tank top fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jock with the shark tooth necklace opens the door to the fraternity and heads into the living room. There, another lean but toned jock sits on the couch with bare feet sprawled across the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chad,\" he says \"How's the party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun,\" says Chad. \"Kinda busy with the heat. Is the AC working, Travis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" says Travis as he crosses his legs in another position. \"I'll get to it later when it cools off a bit. In the meantime, you can borrow the floor fan in my room. Just keep your door closed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks and shut up. You're no clean angel yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad grabs the fan from the other room and carries it into his, gingerly shutting the door to keep Travis happy. With the fan running and window partially-open for a good breeze, he crawls onto his bed for a nap. For tiny Thomas, the ride is over and the ravine is quiet. This would be a nice opportunity to look for help, or get Chad up to help him. Still, how would a big guy like him react to a tiny bug? Well, it's better than just sitting on the necklace waiting for something to happen...</span></div></div>",

He soaked up every detail of the giant's impressive torso, which was darkly tanned and very smooth except for a light trail of hair that started around a crater-like navel only to disappear beneath the tight waistband of the speedos. Thomas lifted his gaze again to stare at the shark-tooth necklace dangling in the steep chasm between two incredible pecs.

The big pecs and abs obscure much of the upper body, but through the chasm, he can see his face. His eyes are closed and he pants, escalating into low moans. The chain rattles as it bounces between his pecs. This jock better not make so much noise, as somebody else would really need to change and instead hear this big guy jacking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moans become louder, the chain rattles more. The hand rubs faster. Thomas can see the dickhead engorged with blood, swelling red and increasing size. He must be getting close. Hands switch. As one rubs the base, the other continues the first's work. This guy is heating up. Suddenly above Thomas, a drop of cum leaves the shaft and descends like a stone towards him. Immediately he starts to run towards the bench's shadow as the drop hits the concrete without any harm to the tiny voyeur. More drops follow and the changing room floor becomes a sticky mine field. Thomas sidesteps as much as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, he hears a low groan of satisfaction. The anaconda returns to its banana-yellow lair, hopefully to stay there until its horny master calls for it again. The wood of the bench creaks as the giant jock gets up and adjusts his speedos. Thomas now finds himself between his two feet amongst the puddles he left behind. He looks back at the shadow beneath the bench.

He did not need to reach far to find something. There is an oily surface with a few tangles of hair. Hands run down the surface towards the base of this, then the end of the oily texture of his waist and the fabric beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicks up. The surface gives way to his foot slightly, but he ends up instead kicking something hard before it gets pressed down again. As Thomas recalls sliding into Caleb's shorts, he could only have tumbled towards his balls.

He can already smell jock and gym locker room a hundredfold from his pubes, it might not be safe to breathe that first hand. Thomas has to work fast. His legs are pinned, but his hands are free.

The air is cooler down here, possibly from the central air. Cool and dark, he claws along the wall at the base of the stairs for a light. Once the light goes on, his eyes glow in delight.
