On the other side of that portal lie another world,  nearly identical to this one, with a few minor differences. The first was that for some reason, Anna's bloodline never came to be, which meant she had no duplicate. The second was that no person in this world exceeded the height of 2 1/2 inches tall. Upon examining this world further, she had found peculiar aspects of it. The tiny people were nearly immune to permanent injury (not to say that they couldn't feel pain) and for some odd reason...she could invade their dreams. Anna found great fun in this, for she had located the tiny duplicate of the girl she had a crush on, and intended to take her as a replacement for the real one.  Anna enjoyed tormenting the tiny for many nights before she intended to bring her little prize home with her. Tonight was the last night.<br>\r\nJourdyn laid back the covers of her bed, crawled inside and pulled the blanket up to her chin. She quietly prayed for a night without the wretched nightmares that had come to plague her. She took one last deep breath before she was plunged into a world of dreams.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm home!\" Jourdyn shouted as she unlocked the door to her house and stepped inside, before instantly stopping in her tracks. There, sitting on the kitchen counter with her legs neatly crossed, was the same brown haired girl from every nightmare. \"Who are you?...\" Jourdyn asked warily as she stepped a bit closer to the girl. \"And how did you get in my house?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Jourdyn,\" the girl said in an overly mock hurt tone, \"Surprised you don't remember me.\" She uncrossed her legs and hopped off the counter. Anna had her hands behind her back, concealing something. \"Well, maybe I could help jog your memory.\" Anna produced a large knife from behind her back and shoved it into Jourdyn's torso, yanking it downwards. Jourdyn screamed in agony as a pain worse than fire ripped through her with the cut of the blade.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, no...\" Jourdyn thought in terror as she saw the girl reach towards the cut in her stomach. The girl tore into the crude cut, retrieving a large, bloody length of Jourdyn's intestine. Anna severed it from the rest and squeezed out the excrement before daintily wrapping it around her neck. As the sadistic girl played with the glistening organ, Jourdyn desperately tried to stop her bleeding and put the organs back into her chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look at me! Look at me! Isn't my new scarf sooo pretty?!\" Anna asked giddily, skipping around the terrified girl.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go away...Go away...Please...\" Jourdyn silently begged her tormentor as the world around them began to melt. The girl's demeanor changed from \"playfully dark\" to \"out for blood\".<br>\r\nShe ran and tackled Jourdyn, although lighter and shorter, she was much stronger than her red-haired counterpart. Anna locked eyes with her prey, her cruel chocolate brown eyes threatening Jourdyn's peaceful gray eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You. Will. Be. MINE!\" Anna hissed before vanishing into thin air, nothing left of her presence but discarded organs and puddles of blood. Jourdyn gasped and sat up in bed, sweat drenching her pajamas and dark rings forming around her eyes. She looked at her alarm clock: 2 a.m. She wouldn't sleep for the rest of the night.<br>\r\nBack in her room, Anna awoke gently from her slumber, having enjoyed her toy's torment to its full potential. It was eight in the morning, time for school. However, she wasn't attending it today. Today she would enter the portal and retrieve her new pet. Anna got dressed in a white t-shirt and gray hoodie with blue skinny jeans and brown boots with a wedge heel.<br>\r\nShe gingerly stepped into the portal of swirling light...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Jourdyn!\" a girl shouted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?!\" Jourdyn bolted upright and fearfully looked around. \"Oh...Oh, it's you, Marissa. Yeah?\u2026What do you need?\" Jourdyn asked as she tried to steady her rapid heart.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, are you okay? You look a little...under the weather.\" Marissa said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah...I'm fine, I've...just been...\" Jourdyn trailed off as she gazed out the window. Her eyes widened in horror as she recognized what she was seeing. An enormous girl was headed straight for the school...the same girl from her nightmares. Jourdyn let out a blood curdling shriek of terror as a giant fist collided with the window, showering several students with bits of pulverized glass. The huge hand snaked its way into the room before firmly grasping Jourdyn by the legs, dragging her out of the school kicking and screaming. \"Help me! HELP ME! PLEASE! DON'T LET ME DIE!\" Jourdyn howled as she was forcibly pulled into the giant's fist. After her little prize had been collected, the giantess turned and left as quickly as she came.<br>\r\nAnna smirked and laughed inwardly as she rampaged through the tiny world on the way back to the portal. She had gotten what she came for, there was no reason to stick around any longer. Anna quickly stepped through the portal and landed in her bedroom, sealing the portal shut so her new toy would have no chance of escape. She quietly removed her boots, the soles and tread caked with flattened bodies of the citizens of the other world. Anna opened her fist and spotted the tiny girl curled into a ball, her knees against her chest and her arms splayed against her head, seemingly whispering and whimpering cries for mercy. Anna silently dropped her new pet into a glass on her nightstand and began to consider the many ways she could break the silence.</span></div></div>",

Her bit of \"fun\" during those nightmares combined with the sleep deprivation and what Jourdyn had experienced earlier would really take a toll on anyone. Jourdyn sat in the glass with her knees to her chest, her head buried in her crossed arms. She was sobbing in fear, she knew that for whatever reason she was here, it wasn't good. She lifted up her head and looked her captor in the eyes, mascara streaking her cheeks in black rivulets.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-what do you want from me?...\" She whispered so quietly she wasn't sure the giant had heard her. \"P-please don't hurt me...\" she added.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I won't,\" the giantess assured her. \"Jourdyn.\"<br>\r\nJourdyn sat there in shock, her already tense body had locked into place and she began to hyperventilate. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-WHAT did you say?!\" Jourdyn hissed through panicked breaths.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said, 'I won't, Jourdyn.'\" the giantess repeated herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah...Ah!\" Jourdyn began to scream and cry. \"Oh, no, no, no, no, no!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is it? What's wrong?\" Anna asked gently.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-you...\" Jourdyn croaked. \"Wh-who ARE you?! How do you...How do you know who I am?!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know a lot of things, Jourdyn.\" Anna replied casually. \"One day, I noticed you, and from that moment onward, I knew that you would be PERFECT.\" Anna had a strange sort of sparkle in her eyes now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-perfect for...what?\" Jourdyn asked, still unsure if she really wanted to know the answer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why, isn't it obvious? YOU are going to be my pet. The minute I set my eyes on you, I KNEW. I KNEW that you were the one. I KNEW that no one else would do. I HAD to have you. And so...here you are.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"B-but...but...You can't do this to me!\" Jourdyn protested. \"I'm a human being!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...\" Anna began to laugh and shook her head condescendingly. \"No...no, you're not.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-what?!\" Jourdyn stuttered. Her head was reeling, this was all too much to take in. Disturbing nightmares that left her sleepless for weeks, being captured by a giantess who ripped her away from her home, the giant girl being aware of who Jourdyn was, being told she was going to be made into a pet, and now being told she wasn't human. Jourdyn was beginning to hope that this was just another dream. \"N-no! Not true, not true, not TRUE!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, believe what you want. But, you'll never leave me. You'll be mine for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no...Please...\" Jourdyn whimpered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, don't worry. I'll take good care of you. I'll feed you, bathe you, maybe even...pleasure you a little. Maybe if you're really good...\"<br>\r\nJourdyn was terrified. She couldn't escape this captivity, and the prospect of being naked in front of this beast sickened her. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no...\" Jourdyn tightly shut her eyes and balled her fists. Hot tears poured from her eyes as she waited for the nightmare world to disappear. She beat her fists against her temples and screamed when she realized that this world was all too real. \"No, no, no, no, NO!\" Jourdyn collapsed in a heap, weakened, her tears staining her clothes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shhh...It'll be okay.\" Anna gently stroked Jourdyn on the back. Picking up Jourdyn by her sides, taking care not to hurt her, Anna carefully brought her over to a cage made of wire, presumably meant for hamsters. She had meticulously covered the bottom in several thick pieces of cloth for Jourdyn's comfort. \"See what I did, Jourdyn? It's all for you.\" Anna quietly opened the door and gently placed her new pet inside. \"Rest now. You've been through a lot.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jourdyn begrudgingly agreed with her captor. She watched sadly as the door to her prison was closed and latched with a hook from the outside, guaranteeing someone of her strength wouldn't be able to escape. Well, she thought, at least it wasn't locked. Jourdyn patted down the blankets covering the bottom of the cage and slipped off her shoes. She laid down and grabbed a loose cloth from the side to cover herself with, and gratefully began to drift to sleep, hoping that she could have a pleasant dream for once.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jourdyn opened her eyes, once again lying in her soft bed. It had all been a dream. A terrible, awful, realistic nightmare, but a dream nonetheless. Jourdyn stretched, wiping her eyes of sleep as she thought about what she had seen. Reflecting back on it, though it was one of the most terrifying and twisted things she could ever think of, she thought it to be rather silly now. A most likely cannibalistic giant from another realm of existence making pets out of her kind? Ridiculous. Horrifying and chilling, but ridiculous. Jourdyn began to laugh as she thought harder about it, slightly wondering why her heart was beating so fast. Jourdyn placed her feet on the floor and stood, the carpet soft to the touch. She walked towards the door and upon grabbing the handle, laughed a bit forcefully as she tried to steady her rapid heartbeat. Jourdyn walked across the hall to the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. She combed her fingers through her frazzled hair then smiled wide, trying desperately to shake the uneasiness in her stomach that seemed oh so out of place. Suddenly there was a clattering of dishes in the kitchen below. Jourdyn jumped back, then took a deep breath. Why was she like this?! It was just a stupid dream! Jourdyn took a deep breath and tried to steady herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Mom?\" Jourdyn called out. Receiving no response, Jourdyn quietly made her way down the stairs. \"M-Mom? Dad? Is that you?\" She called again, slightly more unnerved than the last time. \"C'mon, this isn't funny anymore!\" Jourdyn entered the kitchen, unprepared for what she would see. Her home in a state of complete and utter ruin, her mother and father  nowhere to be seen. Dishes piled and stacked high in the sink, crusted with god knows how old food, crawling with writhing, squirming maggots. Flies buzzed as swarms of beetle collected in various spots on the grime coated floor, the trash bin filled with a disgusting substance that reeked, so far into a state of rot that it could have been poured on the grass and called compost. Jourdyn pulled her shirt up over her nose and coughed, trying not to gag as she continued to trek through the house. She turned towards the window, staring at the unkempt grass, shriveled and brown. What had happened here?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jourdyn?\" A faint voice, no more than a whisper on the wind came forward.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-Mom? Is that you?\" Jourdyn asked as she quickly ran towards her parents' bedroom, narrowly avoiding cobwebs, spiders' webs, and piles of mildew covered, moth hole infested clothing. Jourdyn gagged and retched when she reached the door of her parents' room, overcome by the overpowering stench of rotten flesh. Summoning her courage, Jourdyn grabbed the dusty handle and turned it, forcing open the rickety door covered in chipped and peeling paint. Nothing in the entire world could have prepared her for what she was about to see. Her parents, laid side by side, holding hands. Both of them dead and mummified. Half of her father's face was missing, the revealed skull browned to a caramel color upon being exposed to the elements. His eyes were missing. A large black beetle scurried out of his left eye socket and into his right. Upon closer inspection Jourdyn discovered a pile of writhing maggots nested in his head. His chest was ripped open, as if someone had decided to cut away the flesh from his torso to look at the human anatomy firsthand. All of his organs lay untouched in his chest, a thick layer of dust coating them and the bones, save for the odd glistening as if they had been covered in jelly. Her mother... Oh, her mother... Her mother had been skinned, her whole body, save for her face. Decaying muscles and ligaments prominent. Blood crusted and caked every inch of her. Her hair lay around her in thick, greasy strands. Her mouth had been stretched and sewn into a macabre smile, showing every single yellow and brown cracked tooth. Her empty, lifeless eyes screamed of horrors no human being should ever witness, but she had to face. Jourdyn covered her mouth with her hands, then turned around and vomited onto the floor. \"M-Mommy... D-Daddy... Wh-who...\" She stuttered as she continued to stare. Jourdyn's horrified expression turned to one of blatant insanity as she broke out into an ear to ear grin, climbing up and laying down on the dust caked bed, betwixt her decaying parents. \"Good night, Mom. Good night, Dad.\" Jourdyn beamed as she nestled herself in their corpses before she broke out into a weeping mess, deep sobs wracking her every nerve.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jourdyn snapped her eyes open as tears flowed freely from her eyes. At the moment she wasn't certain what was going on or where she was, all she was certain of were the awful, cruel memories of her dream. Jourdyn slammed her back against the cage's cold metal bars as she sobbed and screamed. She didn't want to be here, trapped like a helpless, delicate butterfly. She wanted to be with her family, with her friends, in a world where everything was her size and everything made sense.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She wanted to go home.</span></div></div>",

Enormous craters decimated the streets, buildings and power lines alike had fallen. Smoke rose from the aftermath in great black billowing clouds. One word went through Jourdyn's mind as she surveyed the destruction. \"Armageddon\". She slowly got to her feet, her clothing ripped in patches. What could have done this? Jourdyn decided it would be best to find someone in this hellish world and began to search.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello? Is anyone here?\" Jourdyn called out as she walked along the cracked pavement. In the distance, in front of a burning building, she spotted a group of people huddled together. Jourdyn gasped in hopefulness and ran towards them. \"Oh, thank god I found you! I just woke up and I-\" Jourdyn touched one of the people on the shoulder and turned them around. \"... Mom?!\" Jourdyn shouted in surprise. A younger blonde girl stood next to her. \"Hayley?!\" Jourdyn cried at her eleven year old sister. \"What are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're searching for refuge, sweetie.\" Jourdyn's \"mother\" replied in monotone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Refuge? But... But I-I was... You ABANDONED ME in the middle of the road, how could you?!\" Jourdyn screamed. \"Refuge?! Am I not good enough to be saved?!\" Jourdyn cried in frustration.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No. I would have saved you... But I can't touch you now.\" Jourdyn's mother replied in the same monotonous voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?! Why?!\" Jourdyn asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not allowed to interfere with her decisions.\" The unemotional voice of one of her loved ones was enough to drive Jourdyn mad.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hiya!\" Jourdyn jumped nearly a foot in the air as a sweet girl's voice sounded behind her, two pale, slender arms wrapping around her waist. \"Hey there! You looked a little confused so I decided to come and introduce myself!\" The girl released Jourdyn's waist and faced her. Jourdyn's jaw dropped in shock, her mouth moving as she tried to find words but none came. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-you... Y-you're...\" Jourdyn struggled to communicate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you not remember me? Of all people?! Ooh, do you have amnesia?!\" the girl asked with genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I...\" Jourdyn stammered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay! I'll help! This is your mom!\" The girl pointed to Jourdyn's mother. \"This is your sister!\" The girl pointed to Hayley. Jourdyn took this time to note that the girl seemed to be the only one... Alive. The rest were standing around, not talking, with glazed over, dead eyed stares. \"And me?\" The girl pointed to herself, then approached the rigid Jourdyn. \"Well, I'm your best friend.\" The girl stated this in a serious tone as she wrapped an arm around Jourdyn's shoulders. \"So don't ever forget that.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-what's your name?\" Jourdyn asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh!\" The girl playfully slapped her head. \"I forgot to tell you who I am! Well... I'm Anna.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Y-you... It-It's you... G-get away from me!\" Jourdyn screamed in horror and revulsion.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't go away now! Besides...\" Anna faced Jourdyn and placed her hands on Jourdyn's shoulders. Her face began to morph into a monstrous form. Her cheeks jaggedly split, as though someone had cut them then tore the skin to give her a disgusting permanent smile. Her teeth sharpened to points, new ones growing to accommodate her now nightmarish mouth. Blood dribbled from her cheeks down those horrible pearl colored things. She fearlessly reached up her hand and ever so delicately plucked out an eye, an otherworldly blue glow filling the empty socket. She repeated the process, this time opting to leave her plucked eyeball hanging halfway down her cheek, connected only by a few bloody tendrils of muscle. A slobbering, black, forked tongue slithered out from her mouth and drooled as this abomination gazed at the screaming Jourdyn, her claws digging into her back. \"You'll always be mine, little Jourdyn.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no... Please, please, please, please, please... Don't do this to me... Please... Please...\" Jourdyn begged, weeping, so taken aback by this monstrosity that she could only pitifully plea for mercy over, and over, and over. She was finally silenced to a whimper when the monster shoved her tongue down Jourdyn's throat for a moment in a farce of a kiss.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shhh... You should sleep now.\" The creature told Jourdyn as she sat on the pavement, forcibly taking Jourdyn down with her and cradling her head. \"It'll be okay, just to to sleep.\" Anna's tongue snaked out of her mouth and lapped at Jourdyn's face, leaving a trail of glistening saliva. Jourdyn sobbed helplessly as demented and psychotic laughter issued forth from this... Thing, surrounding her and resonating in her ears. She felt as if she would go insane herself if she continued to listen. The monster began to sing. \"Hush-a-bye, don't you cry, oh you pretty little baby...\" Jourdyn didn't want to listen, she just wanted to be free of all the madness. But the song was so soothing... Her eyes began to close as she felt the thing's claws in her back and teeth on her neck...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jourdyn's eyes snapped open as she resisted the urge to scream. She quickly sat up and wiped drool off the corner of her mouth. She leaned against the side of the cage and tried to steady her breathing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's no psychotic monster girl.\" Jourdyn whispered to herself. \"There's just... A giant girl who has unknown intentions for me...\" With that statement, Jourdyn buried her head in her knees and began to cry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a wonderful dream that she had confessed her love to Jourdyn and discovered that it was a mutual feeling. After that they had begun to get close and had even had sex. The last thing Anna remembered was being snuggled up next to Jourdyn, kissing her softly. Anna was disappointed to find that it was merely a dream, but comforted by the thought that she had a tiny replacement. Anna approached the doll sized girl seated in the cage and smiled warmly. She would take care of this one forever. Anna's heart melted as she looked at the adorable girl the size of a mouse, but was overcome with an odd emotion once she saw the girl's red puffy eyes, disheveled hair, and tear stained cheeks and clothes. It wasn't remorse exactly, yet it made her feel sick, starting in her stomach and heart and slowly spreading through her body. It took all of her willpower not to rip open the cage door, grab Jourdyn in her hand, and cradle and rock her until she calmed down, with Anna cooing that everything would be alright. She tapped gently on the cage, causing the frightened girl to recoil in horror.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey... It'll be okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.\" Anna whispered. Jourdyn only whimpered in response. Anna opened the cage door and reached inside, wrapping her hand around Jourdyn's frail, trembling form. As Anna pulled out her hand with Jourdyn in tow, Jourdyn began to scream in blood curdling fear. Jourdyn thrashed against the warm flesh of the retracting fist, her socked feet colliding futilely with the giantess' bony fingers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, no, no, no!\" Jourdyn cried, fresh tears pouring from her eyes as she jerked her body, trying desperately to get out of the giant's grasp. \"Let me out of here, LEMME OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shhh... It'll be alright, I won't hurt you.\" Anna cooed, tightening her grip around the girl ever so gently. Anna carefully stroked Jourdyn's hair with her thumb as she finally drew her hand from the cage, closing its door and turning away. \"What's the matter? You can tell me.\" Anna asked as she cradled the frightened girl in her palm. Jourdyn let out a strangled sob as she shook her head, her lips struggling to form words.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-monster... Y-you... Y-you're... Y-you're a... M-m... No...\" Jourdyn sobbed. \"I-I can't... I can't say...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh... That's okay. You don't have to tell me if you really don't want to.\" Anna replied. \"Come on, let's get you cleaned up. Afterwards, I'll get you something to eat, okay?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay...\" Jourdyn whimpered as the giantess made her way to the bathroom across the hall. Anna turned on the tap water and waited for it to get hot. When it was suitable, she closed the drain and allowed the warm water to fill the sink. While she was waiting, she set Jourdyn down on the side of the sink and looked at her expectantly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Get undressed.\" Anna told her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-please don't look at me...\" Jourdyn asked. Her mind relentlessly mocked her for making such a request, as it was obvious that regardless of what Jourdyn asked, the giantess was going to do as she pleased. Jourdyn was a bit shocked when the giantess respected her wishes and covered her eyes. Jourdyn quickly removed her socks, pulled down her pants, and took off her shirt. She unclasped her bra and hesitantly slipped out of of her panties. Jourdyn tentatively stuck one foot in the water before lowering her entire body in, the water's heat a welcome substitute to the frigid morning air.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You in yet?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-yeah.\" Jourdyn replied as she absentmindedly kicked her feet in the water, feeling its warmth slowly melt away her anxieties about the situation. She was snapped out of her trance by a small splash in the water next to her. It was a piece of soap meant for her to wash with. She grabbed the bar and rubbed it in her hands, massaging her body with her hands as she covered herself in sweet scented suds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So...\" Anna began, attempting to make conversation to be rid of the maddening silence, \"You slept in your bra?\" Anna asked, taking notice of the small pile of clothes on the edge of the sink. \"Must've hurt.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-yeah... It did.\" Jourdyn replied as she set the soap down and began to wash it off of her skin. \"But... When your day consisted of being kidnapped by a giant that's at least thirty times your size and being told that you're now their pet, it's sort of the last thing you'd think about.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh... Yeah...\" Anna guiltily looked at the ground. \"Well... I'll try to make your life okay here...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-why here?\" Jourdyn asked. \"Why can't you just let me go?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because...\" Anna responded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, if-if this is a matter of whether or not I'll tell people about your existence, leading to a huge manhunt for you, I won't tell anybody, I swear!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's not it. That's not why.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then what is it?!\" Jourdyn demanded in desperation.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"IT'S BECAUSE THE WAY I GOT YOU IS GONE!\" Anna shouted, leaving herself and Jourdyn staring at each other in silence. Jourdyn's brow furrowed in confusion.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. The way I got you? Big swirly portal thing? It's GONE. Sealed forever. I can never open it AGAIN.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I don't...\" Jourdyn stammered as she closed her eyes and began to cry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey... Don't cry... I'll make it okay...\" Anna cooed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! No you won't!\" Jourdyn shouted in frustration. \"I'll never see anyone I care about again!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You have me!\" Anna objected.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... What?\" Jourdyn asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said, 'you have me'.\" Anna repeated. \"You may not care about me, but I certainly care about you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're a liar! If you really cared, you wouldn't have brought me here in the first place!\" Jourdyn screamed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Which was a lapse in my judgement! If I could change it, I would! But I can't reverse what's already happened!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I...\" Jourdyn stammered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jourdyn... What's done is done. I'll try to make your life the best that I can, alright? But...\" Anna trailed off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But?\" Jourdyn asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But you've got to let me.\" Anna replied. Jourdyn sniffled and wiped at her right eye, tears being replaced by warm water. Jourdyn swallowed hard and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-so there's really no way?\" Jourdyn asked, her voice slightly wavering. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No. I'm sorry...\" Anna answered, sounding genuinely apologetic. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...\" Jourdyn responded as she lifted herself onto the cold porcelain, \"What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Anna replied, grabbing a dry rag off the counter to wrap Jourdyn in, \"If you're hungry we could go get some food, but if you're still tired we could go back to bed...\" As Jourdyn rubbed the soft rag along her body she considered her options. She was quite hungry, as her stomach let out an audible growl, but she also hadn't gotten much sleep the night before...</span></div></div>",

She hungrily licked her plush lips as she stared at the pathetic bug that had once most likely referred to herself as a human being. Anna took great pleasure dwelling on the thought of Jourdyn's blood curdling terror and reality shattering realizations upon the events that had transpired today. The girl was probably scared out of her wits, moments from having a mental break. If she didn't, Anna was going to make her break.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well hello there, you disgusting little bug.\" Anna snarled at Jourdyn, gripping the glass prison so tightly it threatened to shatter in her hand. Jourdyn's head bolted upward, her eyes wild with terror, her eyes transfixed on the cruel brown eyes of her tormentor. She couldn't break the stare no matter how hard she tried, tears slipping down her already slick cheeks. She felt her mouth open as a scream issued forth, one like she had never done before. This scream was a blood curdling, ear piercing scream of terror. Her heart beat faster and faster as what she was seeing sunk into her memory. Her breathing quickened as she scrambled backwards to the edge of the glass, her fists beating furiously and even beginning to bleed as she desperately tried to escape from what she assumed would be the earthly equivalent of Hell.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-please don't hurt me. P-please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.\" Jourdyn begged. Anna's brow furrowed in confusion for a moment. She could here this tiny thing even when she was speaking at her quietest. Anna merely looked to her right and chalked it up to one of the race's traits.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Oh, don't worry, I won't hurt you.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Th-thank you...\" Jourdyn whispered gratefully.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... Much.\" Anna finished, her ear to ear grin flashing Jourdyn a dangerous view of Anna's sharp white teeth. Jourdyn's breathing deepened, becoming even more panicked as she began to slam her entire body against the glass, hopelessly struggling to just get away from this twist of fate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no....\" Jourdyn cried out through sobs. Anna did not reply, she merely laughed uproariously.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now...\" Anna plucked Jourdyn from the glass by her wrists as Jourdyn kicked, screamed, and cried. She held Jourdyn in front of her face. \"You shall never address me by name. Ever. To you, I am Mistress or Puppeteer, for that's all you are.\" Anna paused, then began to slowly rip off Jourdyn's clothing until she hang naked, shivering, and humiliated. Anna picked up an open metal link with a smaller hoop meant for a lead and brought it near Jourdyn's neck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! No! Please!\" Jourdyn screamed as the metal link was placed around her neck and closed with pliers, effectively collaring her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There... Doesn't that look nice?\" Anna asked Jourdyn merely sobbed and weakly thrashed in protest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why... Wh-Why... Why... Are... You... Doing... This... To me?\" Jourdyn gasped through sniffles and sobs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because...\" Anna answered teasingly. Anna's tone and demeanor suddenly turned harsh and serious. \"Because you're everything I've ever wanted to be. Because you're gorgeous, model-esque, everybody's friend, have perfect grades, every boy wants you, and I'm just the homely loser who everyone avoids like she's got the plague and leprosy, and who no one would touch even with a ten foot pole! People mock me, tell me I'm ugly, worthless, nothing, will never amount to anything, am a waste of space, and--\" Anna stopped to catch her breath, her face now red and her cheeks streaked with tears, \"A-and when everyone keeps insisting... You start to believe it yourself.\" Anna's expression hardened again as she pulled out a large, heavy, black lockbox and opened the lid. Anna dangled Jourdyn over the box by one wrist before releasing and sending her sprawling on the hard bottom of the box.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! Please, I'm sorry! I'm sorry they did that to you! I'm sorry--\" Jourdyn begged as she saw the giant reach towards the box's lid, preparing to close it. \"Please! Please don't leave me alone! Please! I'll-I'll... I'll be your friend! I'll give you what they never did! Please! You're beautiful! You're wonderful! You--\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you're lying through your teeth to save your ass.\" Anna sneered as she started to lower the box's lid.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! No, please! Please! Please believe me! I--\" was all Jourdyn could get out before the lid slammed down, the force of it knocking Jourdyn off her feet. Jourdyn sat dejectedly as she heard the heavy locks move into place, trapping her in darkness. Jourdyn let more tears slip from her eyes as she ran her hand along her new collar and whispered one last desperate plea. \"Please...\" As Jourdyn's eyes adjusted to the dark she saw a large black tube about a foot in length running into the box through a hole drilled in the side. Jourdyn put her hand against it and felt a steady stream of air being pumped into the box, making sure whatever was int there didn't suffocate. Jourdyn curled up and sobbed as she realized she would be here for a very, very long time.</span></div></div>",

If you can manage to outrun me and find a safe hiding spot, I'll let you go.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"You promise?\" Jourdyn asked with pleading eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I promise.\" As she said that, Anna quickly crossed her fingers behind her back. \"But if I catch you, well...\" Anna smiled a sly, toothy grin. Jourdyn swallowed hard, knowing in the pit of her stomach she wouldn't succeed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Alright.... I'll... I'll do it.\" Jourdyn agreed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's settled, then.\" Anna picked up Jourdyn and placed her on the wooden floor. \"I'll even give you a head start.\" Anna covered her eyes. \"Ten... Nine... Eight...\" Jourdyn bolted across the floor, trying to get as far away as possible. She struggled to find a suitable hiding place, as Anna had the advantage of having the master bedroom which meant that anywhere Jourdyn could hide was far away enough that she wouldn't reach it before the end of the count. She finally decided on a spot and made a mad dash for underneath Anna's dresser. She managed to make it, cowering among dust bunnies and cobwebs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Please don't look under here. Please don't look under here...\" Jourdyn prayed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Three... Two... One!\" Anna finished. \"Now... Where are you?\" Anna began to stalk the room, getting a rush. For such a small creature, Jourdyn's fear was so thick, Anna could feel it, practically smell it. And she relished that. She started gently moving things around a bit, but grew frustrated when there was no tiny to be found. Anna dropped to her knees and began searching every nook and cranny of the room, seething rage boiling inside her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jourdyn jumped at the sounds of various objects being moved, fearing she would be caught, very, very soon. She buried her head in her knees as tears began to slip down her cheeks when she heard the giantess' grunts of frustration. Jourdyn recoiled in horror and cried out as and enormous slender hand blocked her only exit and began to slither towards her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"WHERE ARE YOU?!\" Anna growled as she began carelessly shoving things aside and practically ripped her room apart. Anna was busy making way through a pile of laundry when something caught her attention out of the corner of her eye. It was small. Doll sized. It could have been one of her little brother's discarded army men, or maybe... Anna quickly made her way to her dresser, a hundred thoughts filling her head, and none of them good natured. Anna shoved her hand underneath, her fingers and long nails making contact with flesh. She made a desperate grab and missed as the little thing dodged her grasp. \"Ugh, you little...!\" Anna shouted, followed by desperate, upset grunts as she slammed herself against the wooden construct.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jourdyn avoided the giant hand that tried to capture her, eliciting a string of cusses from her captor. She managed to run out from under the dresser without the giantess noticing, but she wasn't sure how far she would get before the monstrous girl realized her prey was no longer there. She looked back at the giant girl who was sporadically smashing her body against the dresser. Jourdyn began to run. She wasn't sure where she was going, she assumed it was towards the door. She stopped to catch her breath, holding her hand to her chest. She didn't notice Anna lift up her head with a disturbing ear to ear grin on her face. Anna walked up quietly behind her prey, having been gifted with inhumanly soft footsteps. She stood behind the tiny girl with a look of sadistic joy, waiting for her to turn around. When Jourdyn felt her breathing and heartbeat slow to a normal speed, she took a deep breath and turned around, not prepared for what she would see. The giantess was standing right behind her, but even more importantly, the door was hundreds of feet away. She had been running in the wrong direction the entire time. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"B-but... But I... H-how...\" Jourdyn stammered. Anna smiled with psychotic glee.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"You moron! You never did have a very good sense of direction!\" Anna began to laugh. She sounded insane as she lifted her foot and brought it down hard on Jourdyn. The sound of Anna's insane laughter and her own bones shattering to dust resonated in Jourdyn's ears as the pain flew through her, she could feel every single snap as this giantess uncaringly smeared her into paste. Jourdyn was surprised she hadn't passed out as her body exploded, guts and gore covering the giantess' feet. Anna took a tissue and painstakingly wiped off the red stains from her soles, collecting up what used to be a girl and waited for it to take shape again. The pile of blood, shattered bones, and innards slowly began to coagulate into a human shape, the entirety being covered by skin. Soon, Jourdyn was whole once again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Wha-what happened?...\" Jourdyn asked as she put a hand to her forehead.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Welcome back.\" Anna couldn't wait to use her new toy again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is TOO perfect.\" Anna laughed. \"So tell me, little one...\" Anna leaned in front of her new toy, \"Did it hurt?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Y-yes... It was... It was so painful... Please, please, don't do that again...\" Jourdyn weeped, her tears flowing freely as she recounted the horrible pain of all her bones snapping, her chest collapsing, and having all of her appendages smashed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Mmm... Maybe...\" Anna trailed off indecisively.  \"I want to know what other fun I can have with you.\" Anna turned and grabbed a bottle of deep purple nail polish and began to roll it in between her hands. When she was satisfied, she unscrewed it and put it on the floor. Anna picked up her nervously trembling toy and placed her next to the bottle which was nearly double her size. \"I think you'll start by painting my toenails.\" Anna sat down on her bed and placed her well maintained feet in front of Jourdyn. The scent of cherry blossoms filled Jourdyn's nose as she approached her captor's impossibly enormous feet. She timidly ran a hand along the skin, finding it to be soft and silky. It was obvious that the girl cared for her feet very well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Al-alright...\" Jourdyn replied as she struggled to lift the cap of the nail polish.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Aw, is widdwe Jourdyn having twouble lifting the big, bad bwush?\" Anna laughed. Jourdyn felt smaller than she had in her entire life and the baby talk wasn't helping.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Y-yes... Please... If you want m-me to do it r-right, could you... Help me?\" Jourdyn shyly asked, unsure of the response she would receive. She braced herself for another bone crushing collision with the floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I guess...\" Anna sighed. She got up and retrieved a cap from a bottle of water and the metal end of a paintbrush, bristles intact. Anna carefully filled the cap with polish then handed her slave the brush. \"You had better do a good job, or else.\" Anna raised her foot in a threatening manner. Jourdyn screamed then recoiled in fear. When no instant death came, she lowered her head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I will. I promise.\" Jourdyn dipped the brush into the polish and began to meticulously paint the giant nails. She carefully brought the brush back and forth in even strokes, she was an artist, these nails were her canvas. Jourdyn took a deep breath, trying to eliminate all fear she had of dying. Her only mission for now was to serve her mistress. She was finished with the right foot after some time, her muscles ached, but she pressed on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Come on, now do the left.\" Anna commanded her. Jourdyn complied, her muscles burning like they were on fire. After what seemed like ages, she was finished and dropped the brush, nursing her sore arms. Anna quietly admired her sparkling nails. \"Hmmm... Not bad...\" Jourdyn weakly smiled before her expression turned to one of horror as a giant foot came hurtling down on her, trapping her under enormous toes. \"You did do a good job, but I don't think I'll be leaving you here tomorrow. Better put you somewhere close so I know you won't escape. I could put you in my shoe and wear you all day, but then again, it is hard to do homework on an empty stomach...\" Anna said. Jourdyn's chest twinged with fear as she awaited the giantess' decision.</span></div></div>",

Anna licked her lips in anticipation. Jourdyn screamed in sheer terror.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm... I wonder how you taste... I've never eaten any of your kind before.\" Anna darted her tongue out from her plush pink lips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please don't eat me! Please don't eat me! Please, God, don't eat me! Please!

You do taste pretty good... Very sweet.\" Anna commented as Jourdyn coughed up a mouthful of foreign saliva. Jourdyn didn't know why, but this comment brought tears to her eyes. Perhaps it was the way the taste of her flesh was so casually discussed, as if someone were merely talking about a sample of candy. Maybe it was because in that moment, she realized her fate was sealed. But just because she realized it didn't mean she wouldn't try to stop it from occurring.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please... PLEASE... Don't eat me... I... I can... I can serve you! I'll do anything you want and won't complain, or beg you to let me go, or cry and say I want to go home, because this IS my home! Just... Just don't... Please...\" Jourdyn went from sobbing hysteria to pathetic sniffling as she pleaded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anything I want?\" Anna responded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes! Yes!\" Jourdyn replied, a glint of hope flickering in her eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fine. Then... I want you to strip.\" Anna commanded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh... O-okay...\" Jourdyn replied as she hesitantly began to undress.After removing her shirt, pants, and shoes, she unclasped her bra and stepped out of her panties, leaving herself totally naked. Although she blushed and felt uncomfortable, she would do what she had to to avoid being a giant's next meal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now come here.\" Anna gestured towards herself. Jourdyn obeyed, not even making a sound when she was hoisted into the air by her wrists. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-what are you doing? What's going on?! What's going on?!\" Jourdyn screamed suddenly as she was held in front of her captor's open maw.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You said I could do anything, right?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-yes...\" Jourdyn gulped, horrified by the sudden implications of her poorly-worded promise.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well... I want to eat you.\" Anna replied, smirking. Jourdyn felt as though she had just given someone a baseball bat as a present and they responded by hitting her in the face with it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! No! Please, you can't!\" Jourdyn cried, thrashing her legs in an attempt to get free.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course I can, don't be silly!\" Anna began to lower Jourdyn into her mouth feet first. \"Now don't struggle!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please, no! Please!\" Jourdyn screamed as she was sucked up, her waist lying in between two rows of teeth which with a single gentle bite could sever her torso in half. Her breasts, shoulders, arms, and head were splayed out on Anna's chin, held in place by full, heavy lips. She found herself being forcibly drawn into the mouth and squirreled away into  a cheek so her tormentor could address her clearly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You'll only make it worse for yourself if you try to fight it.\" Anna said, pulling Jourdyn back into her mouth. Jourdyn began to panic again, scrambling desperately to find freedom from her hot, sticky prison. Anna toyed with her for awhile, slamming her up against a wall of enamel, trapping her squirming form under her tongue and tasting every inch of her sweet, sexy body. Once or twice Anna would stick Jourdyn flush with the roof of her mouth, delighting in her writhing. Soon Jourdyn lie on Anna's tongue, beaten, bruised, and exhausted. It was then that Anna saw her chance. She had a copious amount of saliva in her mouth to make the descent easier. She tilted her head back...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! No, wait! Please!\" Jourdyn begged as she began to slide headfirst down Anna's throat. She wanted to struggle but after that fight with Anna's tongue she was too weak. She closed her eyes as she heard a gulp and began to feel pushing on her from all sides. There was no going back now. Jourdyn cringed as a sphincter opened and dropped her into a pool of acid. It was humid and Jourdyn could hardly breathe, but she had a feeling she'd be stuck in this place for awhile. Well, at least it was warm in there...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm... That was tasty...\" Anna crooned as she traced her neck down to below her ribs. She glanced at her clock, she was late for school. \"Oh, shit!\" Anna cussed. She grabbed her bag and ran out the door, coming up with a myriad of excuses to explain her tardiness.</span></div></div>",
