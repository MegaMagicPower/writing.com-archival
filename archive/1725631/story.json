Short yet smooth forest green hair hung down, complimenting a pair of chocolate eyes and pink lips.<br>\r\n\"Verde, mom.\" Verde whispered, almost reading her mother's thought.</span></span></div></div>",

Because of that the indiviual differences are random, and you are a very beautiful, shiny female Alolan Vulpix.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Ash said, and if he wasn't plush now he, now she, would be blushing. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Chansey whispered. \"Next is to give you the special implants that let you use talk both human, and pokemon, plus use the plush versions of Alolan Vulpix's attacks, and abilities, which due to a favor from a legendary to our founder after she saved his life, those attacks and abilities are as effective against real pokemon as the real attack and ability itself, as well as being as durable as a real pokemon.  Our goal is to make plush pokemon into a variation like, shiny, that looks different, but is still functional in life, but also able to provide pokemon for those who can't have regular pokemon for one reason or another, like allergies.  Though for former humans, you can still be a trainer as well, unless you give away your plush ball.\"<br>\r\n\"Plush ball?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Chansey. \"The plush ball is the last thing we give you due to you being former human, right after your new name, which is after the implants are done.  It will act as your pokeball, and behave just like a real one. Until you are old enough for a journey your mom will have it, then will give it to you, and will act as proof you are a former human, so you can be a trainer as well.  If you find someone you want to be your trainer, just take it to a nurse joy, who will go through the procedure to become his or her pokemon, and transfer all of your pokemon to your new trainer.\"<br>\r\n\"So the plush ball lets me be a trainer?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Chansey whispered, \"Now we need to get you the implants, then a new name, then the Plush ball, but first. Would you like to join your daughter as a plush, Mrs. Ketchum? Because of your age you will get the guardian of your own Plush ball.\"</span></div></div>",

Wait a moment.\" and with those Words she leaves Ash and walks to the Costumes. After several minutes she returns with the Costume. \"Ok Ash, here it is.\" Ash then took the Costume and looked at it before he asked her to turn around so he can get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Duplica turned around, Ash began to undress himself until he was naked. Then he took the Costume and began to take it on. First came the legs and Ash smiled as he felt the smooth inside of the Costume on his Skin. \"I'm surprised how smooth the inside it.\" said the Trainer after both of his legs are inside what caused Duplica to smile. \"Selfmade for the best comfort. I sometimes wear the Costumes a few days in a row so comfort is very important.\" said the Mistress of Disguise, still looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then continued with the upper body and felt an shiver going down his spine after the zipper was closed. An pleasurable feeling in his chest and between his legs as an moan escaped his mouth. \"Sounds like you enjoy it~\" Said Duplica. Ash blushed a bit and looked away. \"How are you able to make such costumes? This is pretty amazing.\" The Trainer says as he holds the Mask up, ready to put it on. \"I have my Secrets and Ways Ash. And I keep them for myself.\" said Duplica now turning around and sees how Ash is taking the mask on. After a bit of adjusting the former Trainer turned around and in front of Duplica stood now an nude anthro Virizion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you feel?\" Duplica asked curiously. \"I'm feeling great Duplica. Like a brand new me.\" Ash turned around to her and took an slightly sexy pose, his new Breasts bouncing and revealed, with an new Voice. \"Thank you Duplica.\" said the Virizion Girl. \"You're welcome Ash.\" Duplica smiled with an slight blush as she couldn't help but looking at the Breasts. The former Trainer smiles \"You know, \"Ash\" doesn't fit me anymore. I think I need an new name.\" She smiles at Duplica. \"Would you like to give me a new name, or shall I do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuplica thinks about this and...</span></div></div>",

He wanted to wear the same type of clothes as her and be completely open with her, but he was still afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, when Clemont and Bonnie were separated from them to collect wood and get food, Ash readied his nerves to get it over with.

Ash smiled at her and even let out some happy tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know how happy you just made me, Serena. The truth is, I love you too (At this point Serena asped in surprise). I was just so afraid of how you'd react to my biggest secret, that I pretended not to notice your feelings to me and I tried to keep my own feelings hidden. And you're also an inspiration to me too. Ever since we met as kids, I have admired your sense of style. You're why I wanted to become a girl in the first place and you're the type of girl I want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena also let out tears of joy as she hugged Ash again. \"We are both idiots, huh, Ash? If only we were both more honest, we could have avoided this sense of hiding feelings and secrets from each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better late than never I suppose. And don't call me Ash anymore. Call me Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena smiled at the name. \"Ok, Ashley.\"  </span></div></div>",

As for me, you know that initially I didn't know what my dream was. I eventually learned about Pokemon Showcases and that the best is known as the \"Kalos Queen\". While I have yet to actually preform in my first Showcase yet, I'm practicing hard and I plan to give it my all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena got a more serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My question is, what is your dream? Are you still trying to become a Pokemon Master and compete in Gyms and Leagues? Or do you want to try to become Kalos Queen, which would make us rivals? Or perhaps you've thought of something else? Know that whatever you choose, I'll support you. But if you chose to be my rival to try to become Kalos Queen, that would require a lot more work to make you a girl than some other goals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley realized that what Serena said made a lot of sense. He'd be lying if he said a part of him wasn't intrigued by Pokemon Showcases when he learned about them. And directly competing with Serena would be interesting. But did he actually want to become a Pokemon Performer and retire from challenging gyms and Leagues? He had been doing that for so long, after all.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few months had passed and Ash was still acting like a female Buneary. However, as time went on this was becoming easier and easier for Ash. On some day\u2019s Ash wasn\u2019t even conscientious of \u201cacting\u201d like a female Buneary and rather just was one. Ash even started to enjoy being a Pokemon. She (now refers to self as female pronoun) likes battles, being with her trainer, and being around the other Pokemon, but she most especially liked being around Bunnelby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash continued to wait for a cure to become human again, she started to realize that her acting had started to become more of a reality. Ash didn\u2019t want to admit it but she was also starting to have feelings towards Bunnelby. They had gotten so close during this time, it was only natural, Ash thought from time to time. However, whenever these feelings emerged Ash tried to repress these thoughts and hold onto her goal of becoming human once again. This too though was in question as Pikachu and Greninja has yet to come up with any solid way of changing Ash back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Bunnelby came up to Ash and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Buneary, I know we have been together for a while now but I was wondering if you might like to take this to the next level.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh saw how bashful he looked while saying this and could help but smile. He looked just so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see we have been talking and getting to know each other, but have yet to get physical\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Ash blushed but remained silent, Bunnelby continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I was wondering if you might, you know, be willing to become...ma..mates, or soulmates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Bunnelby covered his face with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, again no pressure but I just like you so much and it seems you like me to, so what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was taken aback at this. She understood what Bunnelby was saying and was honestly quite flattered, but to take this leap might mean forfeiting his life as a human. Ash did admit, she liked Bunnelby, but this was a lot to consider. On the other, there seemed to be no progress in getting Ash back to a human form and it might not be a bad life staying as a Buneary. Who knows, maybe she would like it more. These thoughts were swirling around Ash\u2019s head when she was interrupted by Bunnelby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry because I know this is a big request to ask, but I would love to hear your answer\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stopped thinking for a moment and decided to go with her gut, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBunnelby, I\u2019m flattered by this. It is a lot to consider but I think...\u201d</span></div></div>",
