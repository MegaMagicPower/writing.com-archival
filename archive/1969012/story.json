Rapture's great minds, the ones behind the big daddy's and big sister's, were trying to come up with something better that BOTH the big daddy's and the big sister's put together! They wanted to create something with the speed and agility, of a big sister. and the strength of a big daddy! What they got, was beyond even their expectations! By using only the MOST mentally and physically fit, and most VIRAL men, combined with technology and new procedures, they managed to make something that was faster and MORE agile, than a big sister, and STRONGER than a big daddy! And they called it: the big brother! They best from BOTH the big daddy's AND the big sister's, but BETTER! In a test it was able to take down NINE (9) big daddy's before dying! and in another test, another, managed to kill FOUR (4) big sisters, before dying! Now that you know what a big brother is, does it/you have any specific story, or anything special, or are you just another one of the mindless creatures, that roam the city of rapture?</span></div></div>",
