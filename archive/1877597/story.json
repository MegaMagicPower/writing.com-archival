This encounter will change the life you have planned to achieve and will make you form a unlikely partnership with that person. You will be the Protagonist of the story. What you look and the scenario you become involved in will be created by you and be normal as everyone or you can be given a special ability of your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract Killer: This is the one that had mistaken you as their target. The encounter with you will have a consequence onto them for letting their target get away. Now the Hiring Party believes that they betrayed them and decides to bring you along with them. This person is the Deuteragonist of the story. The description of this person will be revealed by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiring Party: The group that hired the Contract Killer to kill their target. After the encounter they now believe that the Contract Killer has double crossed them. They are the Main Antagonist in the story. The Hiring Party can be one person, a group of people, or a organization, they hired another Contract Killer that will target the Contract Killer and You.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, these three roles will be the most important for this story. Other's can be added in as part of the story as a Plot Device, a Friend, or it will be another Assassin that is a ally to the Contract Killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we start the story with a question, what is the gender of You and the Contract Killer, Male or Female?</span></div></div>",
