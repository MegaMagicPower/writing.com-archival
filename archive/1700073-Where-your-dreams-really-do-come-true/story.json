The bed is bigger than you remember from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, and notice the reflection in the mirror opposite the bed \u2013 a young boy is looking back at you! You pull back the bedclothes, and indeed you now have the body of a boy \u2013 pretty much the same age as Andy. In fact it\u2019s you as you were at 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times, but nothing changes. Um, interesting. Best dream you\u2019ve had for years \u2013 very realistic. Only you knew that you weren\u2019t dreaming, but this was real\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed out of bed. You're still wearing the sleep shorts you had from last night, although they are barely holding up around your waist. You walk across the room to the mirror. Wow. It really was like looking at your youngest son. You had shrunk several inches in height, regained the mop of straw cloured hair you had when you were younger, and your waistline was the slimmest that you could remember it being since, well, since you were ten! You hitch up your shorts to mantain some element of modesty, even though you're on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice a card propped on the dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Tony,\u201d it read, \u201cAt Walt Disney World we take your dreams seriously, and our motto is that here your dreams can come true. Enjoy the day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable, you thought. Oh, well. Real or dreaming, guess you can only try to make the most of the opportunity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that you won\u2019t be able to do much with just these sleep shorts on, so you head for the closet, wondering what you\u2019ve got that might fit your smaller body.

You grab a tee shirt, shorts and a pair of trainers and get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, what next. Guess you\u2019d better venture out to the family area, although you\u2019re now a bit worried. What are your children going to think when they see you younger than they are? This could take some explaining, and you\u2019re not sure you had any answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door, and went out to the living area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s empty. Well, that\u2019s probably for the best. You realise you\u2019re hungry, so get yourself some cereal and a glass of juice, and sit at the kitchen table to eat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to Michael\u2019s bedroom opens and Michael steps out. He glances across at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, morning.\u201d you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right, yeah.\u201d He responds. \u201cLook,\u201d he continues, \u201dI\u2019ve got an invitation to drive the steam train around the park today, but I\u2019ve got to be there early. Can you tell Dad I\u2019ll see him later? Cheers.\u201d With that Michael looped his ultimate pass lanyard around his neck, grabbed his baseball hat, and left the suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that saved an explanation. You obviously look enough like Andy that Michael assumed you were him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a noise behind you.

I think I was riding Space Mountain with my Dad, but that\u2019ll never happen. He has to sit out every time \u2018cos of his stomach.\u201d He gave a quizzical look at you. \u201cAre you my twin I didn\u2019t know I had or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d you reply \u201cbut pretty close. Do you believe in magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, card tricks and things. No, they\u2019re just tricks. Make something appear out of nothing in front of me, and I might believe it. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe card by your bed summed it up pretty good \u2013 seems that here all your dreams will come true \u2013 and mine too...  I\u2019m your Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. Bollocks! Dunno what planet you're from, but I\u2019ll get my Dad to sort you out.\u201d He heads for your bedroom door, pushing it open when he gets there. Of course the room is empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour immediate temptation is to reprimand him for his language, but you hold your tongue. You follow him into your room.  Andy is standing by your bed reading the \u201cGood morning\u201d message, and noticed the child sized clothes around the room. \u201cWow \u2013 are you really my Dad? Shit \u2013 that\u2019s cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite the way you would have liked him to phrase it, but guess it was as big a surprise for him to deal with as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d Andy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that kind of magic.\u201d You say. \u201cI think it picks up on your dreams, so guess I\u2019m like this until tomorrow, and then we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. So what are we doing today then, um, Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink for today you\u2019d better just call me Tony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. Seems that both your dream and Andy\u2019s had been about enjoying the park together, so why not?  \u201cWhatever you fancy\u201d you say. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the rides!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you ponder that fact, you remember that one of the girls in the dream had looked an awful lot like Tammy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you should probably go check on her, since if she was in your dream then you are probably going to end up spending some time with her today anyway. But first, some clothes. You open your closet to find that all of your own clothes have disappeared and replaced by a wardrobe full of fashionable styles suited for your new body. Having brought up a daughter you know full well how a girl should dress, so you quickly select a pair of plain black panties and a bra, then put on a T-shirt and skinny jeans. A few fingers through your hair seems enough to tidy it up, and you head out from your room to locate Tammy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek your head into Tammy's room. \"Tam?

While we were there, you spilled chocolate milk all over your face, doodled on my arm with crayon, and on the way out, you walked into a lamp post.\"<br>\r\nTam's eyes bug out and she runs over and hugs you. \"It is you!\" She exclaims. \"What were you dreaming about?\"<br>\r\n\"I was dreaming about hanging out with my daughter.\" You lie.<br>\r\nTam chuckles. \"Well, you picked a good day to dream about that. I dreamed about my friends back home, and today they called me and said they were here! We can hang out with them all day!\"<br>\r\nYou smile, remembering that some of her closest friends are real stunners. Today was going to be a good day!<br>\r\nTamara's eyes go up and down your body. \"Nice body, but we need to work a bit on your fashion sense,\" She says.<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, you're in your room with Tam having a blast trying out some of your new clothes. Seems that having a girl's body is affecting your mind the same way being 10 years old had.<br>\r\nOverall, it took under an hour to get both of you properly dressed and styled. \"My friends said they'd meet us at the City Hall down on Main Street, then we'll have breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head out, both looking forward to a great day.</span></div></div>",

OK, at least that gives you a few minutes to work out where you might be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel down your body with your hands as best you can. Everything seems to be back to normal, in that you are now an adult again, although you suspect that something is different to normal. You don\u2019t appear to have as much body hair as you used to, and your tummy seems firmer and flatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door to the room opens, and a girl of around 20 enters. Despite her hair being rather bedraggled she\u2019s a stunner. She has shoulder length blond hair, perfectly featured face, and a body worthy of a beauty queen. She is wearing a Tee shirt, and the clear shape of her breasts and nipples indicate that she doesn\u2019t have anything on underneath. You wonder if she has any panties on, but her Tee is just long enough that you can\u2019t tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning everyone!\u201d she calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Jeepers. Now they are going to realise they have an uninvited person in their midst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBodies stir and eyes open, and as the other occupants of the room rise from their slumbers you realise that you are in a room otherwise full of women, with two sharing each of the two double beds. You then realise that they are looking at you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl at the door then turns towards you as well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Tony!\u201d I\u2019m Jemma. Welcome to our home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, good morning.\u201d You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I wasn\u2019t around when you arrived, but its looks like you found your bed OK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes, thanks.\u201d Now you are confused. They were somehow expecting you, and had a bed made up ready? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoffee is brewing, so come and grab some while it\u2019s hot. Normal rota for the bathroom girls. I\u2019m sure Tony won\u2019t mind waiting a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs each of the girls climbs out of their beds to start their morning routine, all you can do is watch in amazement as they proceed to walk around in various states of undress. You can feel yourself getting hard, and are mighty glad that you have the bedclothes over you to hide your erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Jemma returns, and perches on the edge of your bed. \u201cHi again! Sorry if you\u2019re not used to having quite such a crowded place, but we find it keeps the costs down. Also looks like you\u2019re the only guy here today, so guess you\u2019re the lucky one \u2013 we\u2019ll try not to fight over you too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your continued look of confusion Jemma continues to talk, basically explaining the set up of the house. As she talks you understand what is going on. You are in a house occupied by airline crews, and as far as they are concerned you are just another flight attendant who needed a place to stay, and are now having a day off before your next flight. So this bevy of beauties are all cabin crew, and appear to have accepted you into their home without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so a minor issue of what you are going to wear, as under the bedclothes you are naked, and can\u2019t see anything vaguely appropriate to put on. Based on your recent experiences you assume that there are some clothes nearby. Well, seems that the girls are all very comfortable wondering around with nothing on, so guess you could too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your legs out of bed, and sit on the edge, with the bed sheet still strategically placed over your groin. You then catch a glimpse of your reflection in a mirror. Well, you\u2019re not yet back to your normal self. You estimate yourself to be early 20\u2019s, but you also have jet black hair and a slightly Mediterranean complexion. Hum, not bad looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou locate a clutch bag which seems to have suitable clothes. Pulling on some boxers makes you feel somewhat more confident to walk around, although you\u2019re still a little concerned that this may not hide much if any of the semi naked girls return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma re-enters the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Tony. I understanding you\u2019re only with us for a day, so we wondered what you\u2019d like to do. We\u2019ve got unlimited access tickets to the parks, so we could all go there, or we could just stick around here.

Instead you tell her that you\u2019d be happy going along with a majority vote. She disappears back to the living room, and you make a dive into the now vacant bathroom to have a shower and a shave, taking the clutch bag with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief investigation in the bag reveals a neatly folded uniform, and some casual-wear, hopefully suitable for whatever the girls decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed to shower, and then discover a number of male toiletries, presumably from a previous occupant, including shaver and gel. Great - although it' rather weird trying to shave a face that's unfamiliar to you. It's sort of you when you were 20, but not quite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find briefs, shorts and a polo shirt in the bag, which you slip on. OK, now to face the female contingent, and accept their decision on your fate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out to the living area. There are four girls there, including Jemma. All are dressed now, although with quite a severe amount of flesh showing, and you hadn't previously realised how long girls legs could be - on a couple of the girls you can see an awful lot of leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoffee is still hot.\u201d Jemma says, indicating the percolator. You pour yourself a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny decision on what everyone fancies today?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the girls suppress giggles, and one blushes slightly.  OK, possibly bad phrasing of the question there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJemma, clearly the most senior member of the group, responded. \u201cYes, by a vote of three to two, we\u2019re going to a park. As you excluded yourself from the vote, you can decide which one we go to.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick head count tells you someone is missing. Jemma seems to notice you checking around the room.  \u201cSusie\u2019s popped out for a minute.\u201d  She proceeds to introduce you to the others, Becky, Sarah and Terri (the last two being the gigglers).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drink your coffee, and cereal and toast are also on offer, and chatter with the girls. Fortunately as they\u2019re all off duty, nobody wants to talk \u2018shop\u2019, so the conversation is purely social. By the time you all get ready to go you are feeling very comfortable in their company, as if you\u2019ve known them far longer than the 30 minutes or so since the introductions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaxi is waiting outside.\u201d Susie says, and you all pile in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d the driver asks.

Daddy had taken you to the make-up salon in Cinderella's Castle, and you had been dressed up as a Princess, and it was really nice'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you also became aware that you need a wee, so your slumbering must come to an end to satisfy your body's needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open you eyes and look around. Then you remember that you're staying at Walt Disney World, and, wow, isn't your room big.  You sit up, and catch your reflection in the mirror on the closet door, and something doesn't quite fit. You look more closely ' yes that's you alright. The unkempt mop of strawberry blonde hair over your little body dressed in your Minnie Mouse nightie. However, you seem to have memories about being older than the eight years old that you are'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealisation suddenly returns. You aren't eight, you're seventeen. Only you can see full well that you're eight.  Are you still dreaming? You pinch yourself on your arm. Ouch! Well, that was conclusive. You then look down at your body. God! You're wearing a Minnie Mouse nightie! You wouldn't be seen dead in one of those! You also realise how petite you are now, and a quick pat on the front of your nightie confirms that you've lost your two nicest assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what the hell's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice a card propped on the dresser. It was pink, with glitter around the edges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good morning Tammy,' it read, 'At Walt Disney World we take your dreams seriously, and our motto is that here your dreams can come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are expecting you today at the Biddidi Bobbidi Boutique.

'Oh shit!' you say again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this may be your own fault, in a funny sort of way. Well, doesn't seem to be much you can do about it anyway, so guess you'd just as well make the most of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat first? You still need a wee, so you head to the bathroom, yanking off the nightie over your head on route. You then decide to have a shower, patting yourself dry afterwards with what seems to be an enormous fluffy white towel. Then you attempt to brush through your hair, remembering that this seemed to take forever when you were young getting rid of the tangles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, what to wear? Well, you certainly hadn't gone to bed in a Minnie nightie, so hopefully there would be something else here for you to wear too. You return to your bedroom and look in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much of a selection, but there are some small Tees and shorts. You look for underwear, but find only little panties but no bras. Oh, right - no need for a bra now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed in a purple Tinkerbell Tee and a pair of shorts so tight that you'd probably be arrested if you tried wearing them at 17, and consider what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this has happened to you, then it stands to reason that the rest of your family have somehow been affected as well. So you decide to venture out of your room to see what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your bedroom door. It's quiet out in the living area.

Please don\u2019t feel sorry for me!  \u201cI think they\u2019ll be calling in later to see how I\u2019m getting on\u2026.\u201d That seemed to satisfy her, and she beckoned for you to follow her into the boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later you emerged, with your hair neatly plaited, with curls that you didn\u2019t realise you had, pink and purple ribbons, glittery (oh whoops, that would be shimmery) make up and eye shadow, and the best Cinderella gown in the boutique. You had quickly discarded the normal range of Chinese made nylon frocks, and instead opted for the more costly embroidered chiffon version from Europe. Whilst you realise that it doesn\u2019t show off your figure as you would like, having lost the majority of your feminine curves with your age reduction overnight, it did feel smooth and sexy against your skin. Besides, in the heat of the Florida sun, you were quite confident that you\u2019d be a lot cooler in this than the standard nylon outfits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rather enjoyed the included photo-shoot at the end, and felt really quite glamorous, despite the emphasis on glitter. You arranged for the photos to be sent to your suite, and now you\u2019re ready to enjoy the park in your new role as a rather diminutive Disney princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the downside to this was that you were on your own, and you knew that even as a seventeen year old it\u2019s more fun with company. As an eight year old this is going to be a bit tedious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d You turn in response to the voice behind you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s the girl who had been ahead of you when you checked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my name is Samantha.\u201d She said. \u201cDidn't your Daddy come to pick you up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, no.\u201d You reply. \u201cGuess he\u2019s busy with my brothers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can come with us, if you\u2019d like.\u201d She was standing beside a boy in his late teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, he\u2019s nice, you think to yourself. You\u2019re immediately tempted to accompany them quite readily! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents decided to go to the Hall of Presidents. Boring or what! So they\u2019ve left me with my brother for now. Say hello to Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say hello, and introduce yourself. Well, looks like you have some company now after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kyle was not really happy about escorting his little sister, he was under strict instructions from his parents, so suffered his fate in silence. Meanwhile you found yourself quite attracted to him, and tried to find any excuse you could to get closer to him, either holding his hand, or pretending to be afraid on the rides so that you could snuggle up against him. He didn\u2019t seem to mind. In fact you though he quite enjoyed the attention \u2013 meanwhile Samantha was quite happy having someone else with her of her own age (or so she thought). So everyone was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Samantha\u2019s family rejoined with them, and you decide that it\u2019s time to separate. You explain that you\u2019ve just seen your Dad in the queue to \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d, so you think you\u2019d better join him. This satisfied Sam\u2019s parents, who were a bit worried about you being unaccompanied. You thanked Samantha, and gave her a hug. Then you thanked Kyle for looking after you, and stretching up on your tip-toes gave him a kiss, perhaps lingering just a little longer than an 8 year old\u2019s kiss should be. Then you wave bye-bye and disappeared into the crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew! That was OK whilst it lasted, but you didn\u2019t fancy going around with Samantha\u2019s entire family, and her constant childish banter was getting a bit much for you anyway. However, if you come across Kyle again when you\u2019re back to normal you may be tempted to spend a little more time with him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the day you spend dipping in and out of the rides, although it really isn\u2019t so much fun on your own \u2013 especially dressed as a princess, so you decide to head back to the suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, despite your initial reservations about the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, you actually quite enjoyed the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your room and take off your Cinderalla dress, finding a hanger in the closet to hang it up. You find the Minnie Mouse nightie lying on the floor where you had discarded it earlier, and pull this on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you sit at the desk, and open your diary. Well, this has been an interesting day \u2013 how can you summarise this? You start writing, with your handwriting still reflecting the block style of an 8 year old, rather than your usual scrawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you realise that you are really quite tired, so head over to your bed, and within minutes you are fast asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your subconscious mind continues pondering as you drift into and out of dreams. In the end your mind settles down, and you have a dream about \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, the fact that your hair is still pulled back into plaits, and your Cinderella dress is hanging in the closet convince you that it had all happened.

Oh bugger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, guess there\u2019s nothing you can really do about it now, but you will have to try to anticipate events to try to avoid this happening \u2013 if that is at all possible. It\u2019s not as if you really wanted to wander around Disney naked. Shame you couldn\u2019t remember more about the location \u2013 then you could avoid it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a shower, and get dressed in your standard vacation gear: bra and panties, tee and shorts, and leather sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out to the living area to grab some breakfast and try to determine what to do today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad is there.

Sorry I missed you \u2013 I was out early with Andy yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries.\u201d Somehow you weren\u2019t really sure how to tell him that yesterday you were an 8 year old. You also weren\u2019t particularly keen to tell him that today you were going to end up naked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny plans for today?\u201d Dad asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thought I\u2019d go to Hollywood Studios today.\u201d you reply. Now why did you say that? You hadn\u2019t previously given it any thought. Never mind, you quite like the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster and Tower of Terror, so guess it\u2019s as good a place as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s great! I think Michael wanted to go there too \u2013 maybe you could hook up with him. I\u2019ve got something booked at Epcot myself, so I can\u2019t come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst you have nothing against your brother Michael, it\u2019s not as if you really wanted to hang out with him.

Might be able to find out if anything weird happened to him yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you eat your cereal your Dad writes a note, and pins it on the pinboard \u201cGone to Epcot today. Be good everyone! Dad\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, what\u2019s Andy doing today?\u201d you ask, a little concerned that your 10 year old brother may be left on his own \u2013 or even worse try to accompany you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s booked up for today \u2013 he has a behind the scenes tour \u2013 something to do with the firework displays.\u201d You Dad then picks up his lanyard and wallet, gives you a peck on your cheek, and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the clock and realise that the parks are about to open, so you knock on Michael\u2019s door. \u201cHi bro,\u201d you call. After a few seconds he emerges. You outline what your Dad had said, and Michael seems happy enough to go with you. \u201cWhat did you do yesterday?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that was great! I got to drive the steam trains around the park. It was really brill.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo nothing particularly weird there then. What about today you wonder\u2026 \u201cSo that was something of a dream come true for you then. What\u2019d you dream about last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod knows!\u201d he said. \u201cI can never remember my dreams anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Oh blimey. You can\u2019t tell him everything, but guess you\u2019d better break the news to him, just in case he had a dream as bad as yours. \u201cWell, you know that you\u2019re in Disney World, and here they make your dreams come true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t know how they knew I wanted to drive the trains, but that was pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit more complex than that \u2013 and they can make a lot more come true than you\u2019d ever imagine\u2026 You sure you can\u2019t remember anything you dreamt about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sis, no.

You follow her to where you see several other Disney Characters just standing by a closed ride. Once they see you they all smile. Minnie Mouse tells you that to open the ride they need just one more person to be dressed as a Disney character.

Oh, that feels soooooo good. The itching stops, and you instead feel a soothing tingle as the cool water caresses your feet. However, your legs are still itching like hell. Question is how much of your legs you can get under water without actually getting in - which is clearly unthinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffle your bum closer to the edge, and the water now reaches up to your knees. Much better. The itching has eased and the tingling seems to extend up your legs along with the water. After a couple of minutes you think you should really get out again, so you start pulling one leg out of the water, so that you can swivel around to get down from the ledge. However the leg won\u2019t budge, and you merely succeed in shifting your weight further towards the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down into the water. Your feet seem to be stuck together. In fact they\u2019re not just stuck together \u2013 they are fusing together, and as you watch your legs lock together, and start merging together into a single entity. The shock of this is enough for you to loose what little grip you still have on the retaining wall, and your entire body drops into the water. You bob back to the surface and grasp the edge of the tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize than the itching has completely stopped now, and you're tingling all over. As you look down you get another shock. Your legs have fused together completely, and appear to be turning slightly green, with a pattern forming on the skin. You recognize that pattern \u2013 it looks like scales on a fish. Oh bugger. You\u2019re turning into a fish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the change only seems to extend up to your waist, which means that your pussy had also merged into the fishy part of you, leaving only a small slit, although from your belly button up you appear unchanged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, not a fish \u2013 a mermaid. Well you know full well that you won\u2019t be able to pull yourself out of the water like this, and of course you wouldn\u2019t be able to walk away anyway.  So looks like you\u2019re stuck in the water for the moment.  Then you hear a noise \u2013 voices approaching \u2013 guests coming to see the manatees. Well, if you can stay right up against the perimeter wall then you should be out of sight unless they look straight down. You let go of the edge, and drop fully into the water, and stay very still.  You hear the voices come closer, and then gradually fade away again.  Phew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you realize that your changes are not limited to your bottom half. Your bra is now pulling so tight it feels ready to burst, and you have a fold of skin forming either side of your neck.  Whilst you are contemplating this, you look down into the pool and remember to your horror that there is an underwater viewing gallery, and potentially parks guests could be watching you under the water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest bet is to get out \u2013 but how? You notice the daylight across the tank \u2013 of course, there is a large outside area, which is out of public view. All you need to do is get there.  You gently push yourself from the side of the pool and try to move your legs. Hmm, this will take some getting used to. OK, how about trying to kick out. Ah, success, you move forwards. Through a process of trial and error to make your way across the pool, and out into the sunshine. To your relief the manatees are across the other side, so you are not disturbing them. You reach the edge of the pool and pull yourself out, flopping what is now your tail on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here you can see the surface of another larger pool of water. However before doing anything else you need to check out your body. Indeed, you are now a mermaid - half human and half fish. Your shorts and panties have disappeared completely - which you consider just as well, as they would be rather out of place now. Your bra is still pulling incredibly tight, so you reach around to undo the clasp. Oh, relief! You pull off your soaked tee shirt <br>\r\nand examine your breasts. They have grown significantly, but are also incredibly firm and taut, with your nipples more pert that you have ever had. Obviously the way all good mermaids have them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so you're a mermaid. What now? You don't really want to go back into the manatee pool. Will you try to the other pool, or stick around here a bit longer, and see if drying out will turn you back to yourself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re therefore left with the option of going back into the manatee pool again, which you have already discounted, or trying the other larger pool beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffle over to the edge. Now, how the heck are you supposed to get into the water? In the end you decide to roll in, and with a reasonably gentle splash you\u2019re in the pool. You take a deep breath, and dive under the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drop further down you see that you\u2019re in a large tank, with fish swimming below you. You see a turtle making it\u2019s way to the surface to breath. Hmm, something you will need to remember to do, too. Then you realise that you don\u2019t feel the need to breath.

All pretty good, getting the hang of swimming more like a fish now. However, you notice that one side of the pool isn\u2019t a solid wall \u2013 it\u2019s made from glass. Oh bum. It's not just a tank full of fish - you're in the main saltwater aquarium in The Seas. You don\u2019t really want anyone spotting a real life mermaid swimming around \u2013 that could be very difficult to explain. As you scan across the large glass panes you notice that there is someone looking at you - it\u2019s a young girl of about 5 or 6, peering into the water, staring open mouthed at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to be alone at the window. You swim down to her, stop facing her, smile and wave. She waves back, clearly well chuffed with seeing a mermaid.  You swim around a couple of times in front of her, and decide perhaps that\u2019s enough, and head back towards the higher reaches of the tank out of sight of the windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit sorry, really. No doubt you\u2019ve made that little girls\u2019 day, but there\u2019s no way anyone will believe her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, possibly time to get out of here, before anyone else sees you. You head back to the surface and have to look around. Still all quiet. You pull yourself out of the water, and sit on the concrete. The sun is shining hot, and starts drying your skin, and as it does so you can feel changing happening. As you lay there your tail seems to divide, and gradually your legs return. To your relief, so do your short and panties \u2013 albeit soaking wet. Not really sure where they had disappeared to, but you\u2019re glad they are back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and find your tee shirt and bra which you\u2019d taken off earlier. Your breasts seems to have returned to normal size, so you are able to put your bra back on without difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, just need to return to the \u2018public\u2019 area. Easy really \u2013 just need to look for a door which says \u201cOn Stage \u2013 Smile\u201d, and you\u2019ll be there. A few minutes later and you are back inside The Seas, and manage to retrieve your sandals from beside the manatee pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it that going to be the end of your changes today?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can you tell Dad I\u2019ll see him later?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou down a glass of juice, then loop your ultimate pass lanyard around your neck, and leave the suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the Main Street Station to join the first part of your tour \u2013 the 3 hour \u2018standard\u2019 visitors\u2019 tour accompanying the railroad engineers as they prepare the steam engines for the day ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when the other members of the tour group depart, you are invited to stay, and after a couple of hours of tuition on the the footplate of Lilly Belle you are allowed to drive the locomotive a full 1.5 mile circuit of the park. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew are so impressed by your performance that they\u2019re happy to give you an open invitation to return at any time to drive again, and of course the day ends with a photo shoot of you on the footplate with the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the suite late afternoon, totally exhausted, covered in coal dust and grime, but feeling on top of the world! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s nobody around in the suite, which disappoints you a little, as you would love to tell them about your day. However you head to the Columbia Harbour House for something to eat, ignoring the grubby state that you\u2019re in, and mull over your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, well before the park shuts down for the night, you return to the family\u2019s suite, and collapse into your bed, and you are asleep within minutes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvernight your mind filters out any references to steam engines, and your subconscious settles down dreaming about\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stretch and are aware of something pulling around your crotch. You reach down under the bedclothes to loosen your boxers, but instead find something smooth and tight over your manhood. \u201cWhat the heck!\u201d You pull back the bedclothes and look down. You are wearing a pair of girl\u2019s panties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and check everything else. Everything else seems quite normal. The only issue seems to be the girl\u2019s knickers. Weird or what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull them off, and drop them to the floor. Why would someone sneak into your room and put them on you \u2013 and why? The only suspect would be your sister Tamara, but you can\u2019t imagine why would she do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches your eye, and you pick the panties up again and examine them. Well, that\u2019s peculiar. You remember Amy had a pair just like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head into the bathroom and have a shower, then wrap a towel around your waist, and go to the chest of drawers to choose what to wear today. You select a Tee shirt and some shorts. You open your underwear drawer to grab a fresh pair of boxers, but there are none there. In their place there\u2019s a selection of bras and panties! OK \u2013 who\u2019s the joker then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your bedroom door and look out. Tammy was outside having her breakfast. <br>\r\n\u201cOK, very funny.\u201d you say to her. \u201cWe can do a swap back whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara looked rather quizzically at you. \u201cGive me a clue?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on sis, you know full well. The underwear\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clearly hasn\u2019t got a clue what you are talking about, but you can tell from the twinkle in her eye that she knows more than she\u2019s admitting to.  \u201cOK,\u201d you say to her \u201cperhaps you could let me in on the secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, don\u2019t suppose you had another card in your room this morning, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your bedroom, and Tammy follows you in. Indeed, beside your bed is a fresh card. \u201cGood morning Michael,\u201d it read. \u201cWe have weaved a web of Disney Magic around you today to make your day fulfil your dream.  Enjoy the day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck does that mean?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it depend on what you were dreaming about last night.\u201d Tammy replied. \u201cUm, guess you didn\u2019t actually dream of dressing up in girl\u2019s knickers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh course I Bloody didn\u2019t!\u201d you retort. You thought for a minute. \u201cI had a dream about Amy. That was all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy smirked. \u201cOh right. Hmm, I remember when you first met her you were besotted with her. Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019d do anything to get in her panties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but I meant it metaphorically, not literally!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show Tammy your new underwear collection, and decide that you\u2019ll just have a borrow something to wear from your Dad. His boxers may be a little loose around your waist, but better than trying to fit into something from your 10 year old brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on your Dad\u2019s bedroom.  \u201cOh, he\u2019s left already.\u201d Tammy says.  Fair enough. You open the door and go in, find a pair of your Dad\u2019s boxers, and put them on.  Then you return to your room, finish getting dressed, and return to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasily sorted.\u201d You tell your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. That bit about weaving a magical web around you \u2013 I\u2019d reckon there\u2019s probably more to this than we realise.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, well. You can worry about that later. Meanwhile you need to decide what to do today. You\u2019re aware that they trialling a new backstage tour at Hollywood Studios, so thought you might give that one a go. \u201cI might come too,\u201d Tammy said. \u201cI could do with some company today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop some bread in the toaster, and pour yourself a drink of orange juice. As you return the carton to the fridge you can feel something pulling tight under your clothes. With your free hand you reach under your shirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then you have a thought. \u201cUm, what did happen to you yesterday then, sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I went to the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique for a makeover.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that just for little girls?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo didn\u2019t you feel a bit out of place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.

As you wait in the queue, you remember that it\u2019s not just you affected by this, but potentially each member of your family is in a similar position with dreams becoming reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you dream about last night then?\u201d you ask Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, um\u2026\u201d she seemed to blush slightly. \u201cNothing half as bad as this! You know that they say about love at first sight? Well, that was basically it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re waiting for Mr Right to suddenly appear over a crowded dance floor and whisk you off your feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not quite like that, but I suppose in principle yes. But he\u2019s got all day, and I\u2019m not necessarily in a hurry, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the front of the queue, and are directed to your position towards the back of the train, and as the next train arrives you clamber on, and within a minute the train has departed and is making its way up the first incline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the train climbs up in the dark, it clanks and jars, and your focus shifts from your immediate situation to the ride ahead. As you get towards the top of the incline you realise that something has changed. Bugger! 2 seconds loss of concentration and the Disney magic has sneaked its way through! Grief \u2013 what now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least it's not pink! However, as you cast you eyes down further you realise that things aren\u2019t improving. Instead of your fairly baggy cotton boy\u2019s shorts you are now sporting a pair of tight denim shorts, figure hugging, and as short as your boxers would have been. Guess they\u2019d be nice on the right body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as the ride continues you consider your options, and decide that there\u2019s really no point in worrying about it any more. Best option really seems to be to ignore that fact that your clothes are gradually changing gender, and for you to carry on regardless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ride finishes and you climb out of the train, stopping to hitch down your shorts as far as you can. Tammy gives you a quizzical look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you fancy next?\u201d you ask. \u201cI\u2019m tempted by another dark ride, as the last two additions have happened in the dark. May as well get it all over with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case I guess the Haunted Mansion.\u201d Tammy responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk with your sister through Frontier Land towards the Haunted Mansion with you both dressed in a similar fashion, although to be fair everything seemed to fit better on her. In principle you only had your footwear left unaffected, although you have your concerns about getting your size 9 feet into a pair of Amy\u2019s shoes. Well so far nothing seems to be pulling impossibly tight, so fingers crossed on that one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the Haunted Mansion, and within a couple of minutes you are at the entrance doorway, and ushered inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have resigned yourself to your situation you find yourself looking forward with some anticipation to what\u2019s going to happen next, and when you move forwards from the dark elongating chamber you are almost disappointed to find everything is the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short wait you are seated on the ride, and proceed through the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you emerge at the end indeed you have encountered another change. You now have a pair of black footless leggings emerging from under your denim shorts and reaching down to your calves, and your sports socks have now disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever previously had your choice of Disney ride been dictated by the darkness of the ride, but on the basis of what was now occurring, and your increasing interest to see what would happen to your footwear, and hopefully to complete the cycle of changes, you all but drag Tammy to Peter Pan\u2019s flight, being the next closest \u2018dark\u2019 ride you can think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere the queue was starting to build, but you ignore the occasional glances from other park guests, and are soon on board your flying boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you had anticipated, as you finish the ride and climb out at the exit, your trainers have also been replaced, and your feet are now the proud owners of a pair of red leather sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that seems to be it\u201d you say to Tammy. I\u2019ve got nothing left to be re-gendered now. Looks like my dream sequence is now complete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d Tammy said. \u201cMaybe. It\u2019s still quite early in the day. Wouldn\u2019t count your chickens yet\u2026. So, what do you want to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. \u201cDunno. Thought I might go back to the suite to check over what I\u2019m wearing. It\u2019s getting a bit tight in places.\u201d Indeed, you were finding that the fact that you were now fully dressed in girl\u2019s clothes was quite exciting, and your body\u2019s natural response was increase adrenalin production, and pump blood towards your sexual organs, which meant that the bulge in your shorts was getting more noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Thought I\u2019d head over to Hollywood Studios,\u201d Tammy replied. You want to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of taking a monorail ride dressed as a girl was one step too far. \u201cNo, you go ahead. Think I\u2019ll stick around here today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you\u2019re now on your own. Not far back to Cinderella\u2019s Castle and your suite. Hum, what do you want to do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Above all, you could do with a wee. So you head back to the suite, and then into your bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from their tightness constricting everything inside, you realise why girl\u2019s shorts are no good for boys (no fly), so find it easiest to strip off the shorts, leggings and panties before doing anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK \u2013 job done. Now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now that everything you were wearing has been transformed into Amy\u2019s equivalents, you guess the dream sequence should have been concluded, and can hopefully get everything back to normal and enjoy the remainder of the day.  Well, the first thing is to get rid of the make-up, which to be honest is a bit untidy, probably due to your efforts to remove it whilst on the Space Mountain ride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip off the remaining clothes, and dive into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you emerge, you wrap a towel around yourself and head into your bedroom looking for something of your own to wear. Hopefully everything has now returned to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one you pull open the drawers in your dresser to check their contents, remembering that earlier in the morning your boxers had all disappeared, being replaced by Amy\u2019s panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour initial optimism gradually subsides as you realise that not only have your boxers not reappeared, but all of your remaining clothing have been replaced by female equivalents. You open the closet and find the same there, with a number of dresses and skirts hanging over a rack full of girl\u2019s shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you really have no choice but to stay put in the suite for the rest of the day wrapped in a towel, or accept that you will have to dress in Amy\u2019s stuff today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have another look in the closet. Hmm, you can remember Amy wearing a couple of these outfits, and how good she looked in them. Maybe you could actually have a bit of fun trying some of these things on\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to do this properly, so you start by selecting a matching bra and panties set. You avoid the plain cotton ones, and opt for a white satin set with lace trim, which you can remember being particularly smooth and sexy. You lay these on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, guess the main outfit should be next, and then work out the bits to go with it. You have another look through the drawers and in the closet, and pick out a pale blue chiffon dress. Whilst the front in quite low cut, and you realise that you don\u2019t have the figure to fill it, you really like the dress, and well, it\u2019s not as if anyone is going to see you in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what accessories? Legging and socks definitely out. Sandals or shoes? Um, what about something under the dress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you inspect what you have laid out on the bed. Yep, all looks good, and pretty much as you remember Amy had worn it. So, let\u2019s try it on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop the towel from around your waist, and glance at your naked body reflected in the mirror. Are you really serious about this? You\u2019re a sixteen year old boy, and to be honest you are going to look pretty silly dressed in Amy\u2019s chiffon dress, even if you will be the only person seeing it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whilst all of the changes that have occurred have been based on last night\u2019s dream, you certainly hadn\u2019t dreamt of wearing Amy\u2019s lip-stick, or for your backpack turning into a pink shoulder bag! So you conclude that the web of Disney magic isn\u2019t precise, but seems to follow a broad direction\u2026 the question being how far this extends. You decide to head back to the nearest dark ride and push this to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a quick rummage around and find the least feminine outfit you can from the range of Amy\u2019s clothes scattered around. From past experience you know that a bra and panties are mandatory, and add a purple Tee, shorts and sandals. You look at your reflection in the mirror. Hmm, definitely not a boy\u2019s outfit, but hopefully shouldn\u2019t attract too many looks. You grab your shoulder bag and let yourself out of the suite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want a dark ride with minimal queues and a good chance of not having to get off between rides. One springs to mind at once, so you head towards Future World, and soon reach the ramp up to the Tomorrowland Transit Authority. As you had hoped there\u2019s no queue, and the \u2018people mover\u2019 soon moves away from the station underneath the Astro Orbiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass the Indy Speedway you open your shoulder bag and pull out the compact that you\u2019d noticed earlier. Flipping this open you check your reflection in the little mirror. OK, hopefully all set to review anything that may happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you are approaching Space Mountain, and within seconds you are in the dark again. Well, at least it is a smoother ride than your last visit here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return to daylight you check your reflection in the little mirror. Ah, seems to be basic make-up and blusher. As you approach the station you indicate to the attendant your desire to stay on. Well, it\u2019s not one of the most popular rides here, so you receive the thumbs up, and you stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue with another circuit of the TTA, and repeat the process with the mirror as you emerge from Space Mountain. You see that the make up on your face is complete, including tidy pencil thin eyebrows, eye liner, and lip-stick. Your nails remain neatly painted from earlier in the morning making you the best manicured boy in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your train returns back to the station again the attendant hardly gave you a glance. Phew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that you can think that\u2019s missing from what Amy would have worn is jewellery, as she always wore earrings, and a pendant around her neck. So you reckon on another circuit before you can determine if the web of Disney magic is limited to external appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you again enter the darkness of Space Mountain you find yourself tingling with expectation, despite having a reasonable confidence what will happen. Through the darkness the tingling becomes even more intense, and you can barely contain your excitement, hardly even noticing the rumblings and screams from the rocket ships above. You emerge into daylight again, and reach up to feel you earlobes and around your neck, searching for the expected adornments. Um, there\u2019s nothing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach for the compact beside you, but don\u2019t need to see the reflection to be aware of the changes. As soon as you look down you can see that you now have breasts, and a quick scan confirms that the rest of your body also seems to have changed. Ah, well, that confirms what you had wondered \u2013 the final step was a transformation of your body from male to female.  You look in the little mirror and are quite shocked at the face peering back at you \u2013 it is Amy\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that is really amazing. Well, with Amy\u2019s body you should now fit perfectly into that chiffon dress back in your room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the little train heads back to the station, you try to inspect your new body to determine the extent of the changes. Your new breasts fill the bra to perfection, and all your clothes fit better than before, as you body has adjusted to Amy\u2019s size. Oh! How could you possibly forget? You slip your hand down the front of your shorts just to confirm, and indeed you can feel the lips of your new vagina through the material of your panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ride returns to the Astro Orbiter you climb out, and return back to ground level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, mission accomplished! You set out to try to feminise yourself so that you can try on Amy\u2019s clothes properly, and you couldn\u2019t do better than to have her body! OK, what now? You could stick to your plan and return to the suite to dress in some of Amy\u2019s more feminine clothes without looking a total dork, or there are now some new options that you can consider.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But when you see theres a meet-and-greet beneath the castle, and it's full of children and their parents, you decide it would be impossible to reach the door to the elevator to the suite. Instead you decide to walk around the castle and go inside from the Main Street side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pull the map out of your very tight shorts. Yesterday you saw on your way back from the train-station that the little road over the water was closed for renovations, and you didn't want to walk back the way you'd just come (some rule you invented to make life less boring). You try to keep out of sight as much as possible - if a few people see you it wouldn't really matter, but you decide to avoid big groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you eyes also fall on the big eye-catcher of Tomorrowland, Space Mountain. And to your surprise the boards say there is no waiting time. That would mean you just could run to the station and make a quick ride. It is mostly in the dark and the black-lights would make your clothes seem less girly; with a little luck they may even seem like normal clothes. The decision is quickly made and you walk to the entrance. And like the boards say there is indeed nobody inside the attraction (except personnel) and you can step in a rocket without waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the rocket steadies itself on the lift-hill. The rocket starts to move and the sound-effects begin. In no time the spectacular ride is over. You thought nothing could change anymore but when there is light again you see you have pink painted finger-nails, and not only the nails of your hands, but also your toes. You also feel something on your face and guess you have make-up on. Slowly the rocket rides into the station again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see there is still nobody else except the ride personnel and the few other people who are also on the ride. Everybody yells they want another ride, there is no reason to wait. And obviously the ride\u2019s controller, who is told to make every dream come true, happily complies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it is a good idea - if you another ride you have time to get rid of the make-up on your face. Before it gets dark you grab a tissue from your backpack, which you have between your legs. While the music starts and the rocket moves off again you try to remove the make-up. As the rocket climbs on the initial incline there are a few brief flashes of light, and you see red on the tissue, probably from your lips. The next time there is another bright flash you can\u2019t see the red from the lip-stick on the tissue anymore, but you continue to try to clean your face. When the rocket returns to the station again you get a surprise. Instead of the tissue you were holding, you have now a powder puff with face powder in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the other riders scream for another ride because again nobody is waiting. You don't yell with them like last time; instead you notice your bag between your legs. To your surprise it has changed into a girl's pink shoulder-bag. Inside, along with the stuff you'd brought with you is a load of make-up. You decide that it is time to leave the attraction before anything else happens. However, the dream-fulfilling operator at the control desk has already pressed the start button for the ride to get underway again, and you can feel the rocket starting to move forwards again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely nothing else can happen now, can it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, you do notice that Amy\u2019s clothes don\u2019t seem to be pulling so tight now \u2013 in fact they feel quite comfortable.  Maybe things aren\u2019t as bad as you had feared. Even the bra, which had always been a bit uncomfortable pulling across your chest, seems to be quite snug now. In fact it almost feels like the cups of the bra are actually supporting something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rocket slows on its return to the station you look down, and realise the reason the bra feels comfortable is that you now have a pair of 36C breasts filling the cups perfectly. A quick feel further down and the bulge in the front of your shorts has completely disappeared, suggesting that the transformation may have been complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is now a queue waiting for the ride, and so as the rocket stops in the station everyone on board is asked to get out. You have no option now but to pick up your pink shoulder bag, and clamber out. But what now? What state are you in?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way slowing down the long passageway to the main entrance to Space Mountain trying to assess what has changed. Well, you now have Amy\u2019s tits and by all accounts also her vagina (at least you seem to have lost your penis, and you don\u2019t really feel this is the place to drop your shorts to check!)  You notice that your arms and legs are now slimmer and hair-free, and all of Amy\u2019s clothes fit perfectly.  Logic suggests that you\u2019re now a girl, or more specifically Amy. Oh bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you emerge from the shop into the sunlight you decide to head to the restrooms to check yourself out. As you reach the entrance you start walking into the gents, but correct yourself just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you look at yourself in a mirror. Wow \u2013 you are looking at a perfect reflection of Amy. It\u2019s not as if you are broadly similar \u2013 you are Amy. You run your fingers up and down your face, not really believing that what you can feel is what you are looking at. Well, only one thing left to check, but you need to go into one of the stalls. You lock the door behind you and pull down your shorts and your panties. Well that\u2019s fairly conclusive \u2013 a tidy little pussy. Well Amy\u2019s pussy to be more precise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you are now effectively Amy to all external, and presumably internal appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that must complete the changes, as there is definitely nothing left to change now! You\u2019re not sure how this fitted in with your dream last night, but it has certainly been an interesting morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so what are you going to do now? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Too your surprise it is hair you feel, to be exact, your hair which is now shoulder length, just like Amy's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shocked about your new hair the rocket returns back to the station, where you realize that having longer hair was the least of your problems, as you now have a pair of perfect size 36C breasts filling out your bra, and are well aware of other bodily changes. This time you are smart and leave the ride quickly, so quickly you even forget your bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, wait! You forget something.\": You hear a familiar voice saying.

You can clearly remember the part where you undressed Amy, this morning you thought that you took every piece of clothing and put it on. But now you have had some time to think about it, you have the feeling that isn't what happened. You hear <i>yourself </i>saying some nice words to you and suddenly the whole dream comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">You are sitting in front of your school together with a few friends. And this was the first time you saw her. Amy reached the the doors and went inside, but first gave you a quick smile. You are not sure that smile really happened or that you just remember your first time seeing her like this. As soon she is inside you turn to your friends. \"Wow! She's hot! I would do anything to get in her panties.\": You say. Your friends laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are few months further and you have a relationship with Amy. You can remember that this is where the first problems started. \"You just don't do enough for me!\": Amy yells to you. \"But baby, I do everything for you. I want to do everything for you!\": You say trying to defend yourself. \"You just don't understand how it is to be me...\": Amy says while she starts to sob. \"Then explain, if there was an easy way to know how it feels to be you and to know what you know I would do it!\": You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where the memories stop and the dreaming starts. We are a few months further. Amy is still with you. You are both very happy. You don't know why Amy did like that but she says she took care of it. You two are in a very expensive looking restaurant. Both looking like the best you two can. You both enjoy the food and each others company <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you skip to later on the evening. You two are both laying on a bed that familiar to you, but you don't exactly know from where.. You know it is time to finally do it, something you both waited so long for. Slowly you start to undress Amy, and she starts to undress you...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you can't remember anymore. You are not sure if you two did it, or that you did wake up before it. But back in reality you notice that <i>you </i>are still holding you. Now even gently caressing your manicured hand. You two walk together onto the Main Street. \"Come, let's eat somewhere. It's nearly time for lunch.\": <i>You</i> say to yourself. You doubt how to answer. Now you remember your dream again you know what will happen. But maybe you can avoid everything if you run away. But your sister said she also tried to do that and that it just didn't work. The dream has to come true...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This way both you, and the new version of yourself should be happy.  You lead Michael out of the park and head for the bus bays looking for the service to Animal Kingdom, then you both board the waiting bus. It has crossed your mind how you could effectively be here twice. Obviously you know how you're here, but Michael clearly wasn't you, and seemed to just appear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um, how are you enjoying your stay here?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's absolutely brill. I was able to drive the steam train yesterday. Last night I dreamt of you, and today here you are! Can't ask for anything more than that!\" He learns across and gives you a big kiss, which leaves you almost breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's a bit worrying. Somehow Michael seems to think he is you, or perhaps somehow he is. That's pretty weird.<br>\r\nHowever you had decided the best, if not only course of action, was to go along with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus arrives at Animal Kingdom, and you make your way to the entrance, remembering to have your photograph taken by the cast member on the way in. You were asked to pose a couple of times, and for one shot Michael stood behind you with his arms wrapped around your waist, and you really felt comfortable with him so close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, can we go on the Kali River Rapids please?\" Michael asks. \"I really love that ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" you reply. God - you hadn't realized how polite you could be! You walk had in hand towards the Asian area of the park, and join the queue for the River Rapids ride. You are now getting a bit more comfortable being a girl, and being on the receiving end of admiring glances from the boys going past!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the ride and both clamber on board one of the circular rafts, making sure you sit side by side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

As he pulls the seat belt across your waist you become acutely aware of the implications of this ride, as your denim shorts are now getting quite damp from residual water on the seat. You then realize that things have changed since the last time you rode on the River Rapids, namely that you are now female, and whilst you may previously have been fairly unconcerned at getting drenched, now you are not quite so sure\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have time to give this issue much consideration the raft starts moving, and within a few seconds has reached the ramp carrying you up to the free flowing river. Well, you really don\u2019t have much of a choice but to enjoy the ride and worry about the consequences later. As the raft reaches the top of the ramp you find yourself facing backward, so looking back down the ramp, and unaware that a huge fountain of water has erupted immediately behind you. The first indication of something happening was the look on the faces of the couple sitting directly opposite you, and within seconds a cascade of water falls over Michael and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour silk blouse is now clinging tightly to you, with the shape of your breasts clearly showing through the material. Your shorts are now totally saturated. Well, you recall that Amy was never ashamed of her body, so you decide not to worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride continues, and with the bumping around of the raft and the looseness of the seat belt over your waist (being somewhat slimmer than you had been before), you hold on to Michael\u2019s hand for support, and fairly inevitably he is happy to hold your hand quite tightly in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting drenched a further couple of times the raft returns to the boarding circle, and you both clamber off, and drip happily back over the walkway back towards the park, still hand in hand. Somehow you are feeling more and more comfortable in your new body, and weirdly quite comfortable in what is effect your own company, walking alongside what is a version of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant another go?\u201d Michael asks. You look across to the entrance and realize that there is a very short queue waiting, so you both duck under the rope barrier and tag on the end. Within a couple of minutes you are again being ushered forwards, and inevitably have another drenching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave the ride for the second time, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a dry patch on either of you, and you are glad that it\u2019s a hot sunny day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the ride\u2019s main entrance just behind Expedition Everest, and try to decide what to do next. Michael pulls off his tee-shirt and starts wringing the water out of it. You wish you could do the same. You gaze at him, and find yourself watching him with a weird sense of fulfillment, and then you wonder why on earth you broke up with him, as you realize he is quite a catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOA! Hang on there!   What the hell are you thinking? Pull yourself together girl! I mean boy! Blimey, you\u2019re getting settled in Amy\u2019s body just a little too snugly now. You\u2019re almost starting to think you are Amy!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally pull yourself together, and try to regain a focused perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He throws his wet tee-shirt over one shoulder, grabs your hand, and you walk together towards the entrance. Somehow you are envious as you would similarly like to pull off your wet blouse, although to be honest given the opportunity that would probably be quickly followed by the rest of your clothes, as they are now clinging to your wet skin, and you\u2019d like to dry them out a bit. However, not really the type of activity a young lady should be considering in the middle of a Disney park! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the Jungle Trek area, and look at the Komodo Dragon and Tapirs before heading closer to the tigers.  It\u2019s strange, but somehow you\u2019ve never previously noticed the flower scents here, and also never previously realized what they were. You can detect jasmine, and honeysuckle, and find yourself quite smitten by the surroundings.

Fortunately it is deserted. You reckon the girl you saw leaving was heading out into the \u2018public area\u2019 for her tour of duty \u2013 and hopefully won\u2019t return for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scan around the room. It is fairly small and functionally furnished, with a handful of lockers, a table and chairs, a fridge, and coffee maker. However you notice a rack with a small selection of uniforms \u2013 presumably spares in case of accidents or damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks good.\u201d You say to Michael. \u201cYou really don\u2019t appreciate how easy it is for you. You can take your shirt off, and everything else pretty much hangs dries in situ.\u201d His loose hanging shorts are almost dry already, and you know that he is wearing boxers underneath (as you always did). You wave your hand down over your body. \u201cI\u2019m still as wet as when we left the ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn\u2019t strictly true, although you\u2019re well aware that your bra is starting to rub under your breasts and your panties are clinging damp and tight around your crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho drinks coffee when it\u2019s as hot as this?\u201d Michael asks, almost to himself. He opens the fridge looking for a cool drink, and pulls out two cans of Sprite. \u201cThat\u2019ll do nicely!\u201d He turns and throws one of the cans towards you, which you catch easily. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get changed in there\u2026\u201d he indicates the door to the rest room, \u201cand I can check out what\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou select one of the smaller outfits from the rack, and head into the rest room. Here you strip off completely, patting yourself dry with the towel hanging beside the sink, and slip on the jacket, buttoning this up. Similarly you pull on the little skirt. Whilst not ideal without your underwear, it at least feels significantly more comfortable than you had been, and your absence of panties was certainly not obvious. You look in the mirror and see that your makeup and hair have suffered as a consequence of your drenching.  You know you really should tackle it, but realize that you don\u2019t know what to do!  Could really do with some Disney magic now! You open your shoulder bag, and find a hair brush, so you start brushing in the hope that it will improve your appearance a little. Another check in your bag reveals some make-up. You take a deep breath and begin\u2026.well, not brilliant, but it doesn\u2019t seem too bad.  After a couple of minutes you realize that by not concentrating on what you\u2019re doing, the results are actually looking pretty good. Guess that\u2019s your new body\u2019s feminine side somehow kicking in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the locker room, where Michael has also changed into one of the Cast uniforms. \u201cWow, that suits you!\u201d he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right. A low cut jacket with nothing underneath. Figures you\u2019d like that!\u201d you respond. You point towards the store . \u201cAnything here of particular interest?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly you. You're the sexiest Cast member I've seem all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot what I meant!\" you can feel yourself blushing slightly. \"OK.

You stretched and were immediately aware of something pulling across your chest and shoulders. That\u2019s funny, you thought, as you can remember having crashed out on you bed naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and look down. \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d You are wearing a bra, which is causing the unusual sensation, but you also notice that despite going to bed in the buff, you are now wearing girl\u2019s panties as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and try to check everything else. Well, you are still yourself, and everything else appears normal except that you\u2019re in girl\u2019s underwear. Weird or what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately pull the bra straps off our shoulders, and with a bit of fiddling manage to undo the clasp, and it falls to the floor. You then remove the briefs too. Now, why would someone sneak into your room and dress you look that? The only suspect you have would be your sister Tamara, but why would she do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches your eye, and you pick up the panties and examine them. Well, that\u2019s peculiar. You remember Amy had a pair just like these \u2013 although pink cotton panties with a heart pattern obviously aren\u2019t rare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to have a shower, then wrap the towel around your waist, and head for the chest of drawers to choose what to wear today. Tee shirt and shorts. You open your underwear drawer to grab a fresh pair of boxers, but there are none there. However, in their place you find a selection of bras and panties! OK \u2013 who\u2019s the joker then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your bedroom door and look out. Tammy was outside having her breakfast. <br>\r\n\u201cOK, very funny.\u201d you say to her. \u201cWe can do a swap back whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamara looked rather quizzically at you. \u201cGive me a clue?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on sis, you know full well. The underwear\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clearly hasn\u2019t got a clue what you are talking about, but you can tell from the twinkle in her eye that she knows more than she\u2019s admitting to.  \u201cOK,\u201d you say to her \u201cperhaps you could let me in on the secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, don\u2019t suppose you had another card in your room this morning, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your bedroom, and Tammy follows you in. Indeed, beside your bed is a fresh card. \u201cGood morning Michael,\u201d it read. \u201cWe have weaved a little Disney Magic around you today to ensure that your day fulfils your dream.  Enjoy the day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck does that mean?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it depend on what you were dreaming about last night.\u201d Tammy replied. \u201cUm, guess you didn\u2019t actually dream of dressing up as a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh course I Bloody didn\u2019t!\u201d you retort. You thought for a minute. \u201cI had a dream about Amy. That was all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy smirked. \u201cOh right. Hmm, I remember when you first met her you were besotted with her. Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019d do anything to get in her panties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but I meant it metaphorically, not literally!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show Tammy your new underwear collection, and decide that you\u2019ll just have a borrow something to wear from your Dad. His boxers may be a little loose around your waist, but better than trying to fit into something from your 10 year old brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on your Dad\u2019s bedroom.  \u201cOh, he\u2019s left already.\u201d Tammy says.  Fair enough. You open the door and go in, find a pair of your Dad\u2019s boxers, and put them on.  Then you return to your room, finish getting dressed, and return to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasily sorted.\u201d You tell your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. That bit about weaving Disney magic around you \u2013 I\u2019d reckon there\u2019s more to this than we know.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, well. You can worry about that later. Meanwhile you need to decide what to do today. You\u2019re aware that they trialling a new backstage tour at Hollywood Studios, so thought you might give that one a go. \u201cI might come too,\u201d Tammy said. \u201cI could do with some company today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop some bread in the toaster, and pour yourself a drink of orange juice. As you return the carton to the fridge you can feel something snag on your shoulder. You reach up to rub your shoulder with your free hand, and can feel something odd under your shirt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The feeling of tightness in your crotch also suggests than something has happened down below. You undo your belt and drop your shorts, and indeed you are again wearing a pair of panties, the boxers having totally disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlimey. That was quick \u2013 didn\u2019t even notice it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssuming these are all Amy\u2019s undies,\u201d Tammy says, \u201care they all the same size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno, why?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like you\u2019re stuck wearing these today, whether you want to or not, so you may as well try to pick the one that will fit you best. Might find things get a bit tight down below if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, and your crotch is certainly looking quite constrained within the low cut briefs. \u201cYeah, OK, maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both go back to your room, and select the largest items, which you proceed to put on. This is a matching set in shocking pink satin. Clearly you didn\u2019t have boobs to fill out the cups, so the material hangs relatively loose across your chest. The panties are quite low cut, clearly designed to sit on the hips rather than around the waist, but as Amy has wider hips than yours they aren\u2019t uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you didn\u2019t mind being naked in front of your sister, by mutual agreement after too many near-misses on the bathroom run at home. \u201cVery nice dear,\u201d she says when you finish dressing. \"Just don\u2019t let too many people see \u2013 shocking pink isn\u2019t really your color!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the heck do girls have underwear this color?\u201d you ask, although you suspect you know the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, couple of reasons. First it\u2019s a really sexy color, but also so that it can be seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you could agree on both counts, as you can remember catching glimpses of Amy\u2019s colourful undies in the past, which made you want to see more and more of them, and of her\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, was that the extent of the magic today? Well, hopefully now that you are apparently adhering to the expectations you can get on with the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time this morning, you get ready to leave. Then you have a thought. \u201cUm, what did you dream about last night then, sis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you later. But I think I want to keep you nearby today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check yourself in the mirror just before you leave, primarily to ensure the shocking pink underwear isn\u2019t showing through.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
