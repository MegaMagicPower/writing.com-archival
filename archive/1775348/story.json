The power crystals are meant to make life sustainable on other planets besides earth. After the earth was created the power crystals were made by Speedy( a human that got turned into a hedgehog after a accident). Speedy's original name was Stanely or Stan. (The rest is going to be added in a seperate story) However when he created them they became unstable and scattered all over earth. Speedy found them and stored them in a secret safe underground. <br>\r\n      After many years one of his friends found the safe and opened it. They took the crystals up to the surface to study them, but something went wrong. (another story)<br>\r\nThe crystal became scattered again. Now let's speed this up a little. Okay when Speedy heard about this he went to find them again, but his brother (Speedster) found them first. Speedster's real name is Spencer, but the same thing happened to him. He tried to take them, but they teleported him to an undiscovered planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral months passed by and Speedster came back. Speedy was excited that his crystals worked and travelled to the new planet. After many years he named the new planet Metropolis, which became populated with humans from earth, but some have gotten mutated and turned into animals like Speedy. <br>\r\nNow this is where Dark comes in. He was of the offspring from on of the people who came to Metropolis. When he became older he became a Darkite, which was a organization originally formed to protect the planet, but they became corrupt. Dark was realizing what was happening to his people and tried to stop it, but he got kicked out and was on his own until he found another organization called Shadows. (they were a group made to remove the Darkites from Metropolis after they became corrupt)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He also had the ability to shoot lasers out of his eyes. Dark lives in a fortress and he beacame a Shadow because he got kicked out of the Darkite army. So Dark was in his new home and he heard that the Darkites were going to come and invade Metropolis and take the power crystals. Mavis is the Darkite commander and has a dragon named Nightmare, but we will talk about him later. So Dark was talking with his friends Scott, Miley, and Silfer.<br>\r\nScott is a black and white fox with force powers. Silfer is red,white,and sliver fire fox with the ability to throw fire. He is very experieced with his powers. He is Scott's best friend. Miley is a hedgehog with the same powers as Scott, but she is more experienced and has the ability to teleport and heal. Dark is planning how to prepare for an attack with Miley and Silfer  So without further backround information lets get started.<br>\r\nDark: So you think he is ready for fighting.<br>\r\nMiley: Yes Scott can do the job of protecting the Dark crystal quite well.<br>\r\nSilfer: He still has some minor problems, but nothing extreme. So will you let him join us?<br>\r\nDark: Yes but he must complete a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?  </span></div></div>",

It had a free shelter and strangers that were nice enough to give us food and some money. However my life changed when I was captured by Darkites. They tortured and trained us to become spies but we escaped. After our escape it wasn't long before we found this place where we made a new home. We met some tribals along the way and became part of their group.  So that's the short version.<br>\r\nHypon: Wow I would have never known.<br>\r\nKura: So do you want me to take you to Pyro?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?  </span></div></div>",
