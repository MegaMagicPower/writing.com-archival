I can't seem to remember anything but this throbbing headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around, trying to make sense of where I am, but I'm met only with blurs as my eyes adjust. Whatever it is, wherever I am, I'm lost and pretty helpless. I hope there's someone around who can help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI call out, looking around as my vision starts to improve, slowly but noticeably. My head is still throbbing as I listen for an answer, but there is none. I sigh. Looks like I'm alone, at least for now. Trying to stand, I find that my balance is about as good as my vision right now, toppling over and falling on my ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a night I must have had...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh once more, closing my eyes and just waiting for my head to stop spinning. Once this headache came down a bit, I could start worrying about where I was. For now, I just wanted a few aspirin and a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed. The thumping in my brain became a dull thud gradually, as I sat and thought, trying to piece things together one bit at a time. My name was Jake...yes, that was right. I was around 5'10\". Not the shortest guy in the world, but I certainly wasn't looking down on many people. Brown hair, obnoxiously curly. I touched my head to confirm this and nodded. Come to think of it, why am I thinking all this in the past tense. Not like any of it would have changed...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh a little at the question. Hell, with this headache, my lack of a memory, and this messy blur of my senses, I wouldn't know it if I were an inch tall. Somehow, this joke hits a little hard, and I shiver a bit. \"Let's just...set that thought aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more minutes had passed, and when I opened my eyes, I found I could practically see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when they appeared.</span></div></div>",

What a joke,\u201d I scoffed, as I flopped down on my bed with the latest swords-and-sorcery paperback in hand. The main character was a typical Mary Sue, but at least the cover art was attractive. Brushing my black hair out of my eyes, I flipped it open and began to read, but the first few pages were so boring that I tossed the book aside and rolled over onto my back. Sighing, I draped my head upside-down over the foot of the bed, looking around for something to do. My eyes pass over my cluttered bedroom, stopping at my collection of porcelain dolls lined up against the baseboard. A relic from my childhood, most people would probably think them creepy. I never have anyone over anyway, so what\u2019s the use in keeping them around? My mother always used to get them for me at garage sales and such when I was a kid, and even now she occasionally brings home a \u201cfind\u201d. She always called me her \u201clittle doll\u201d because of my pale skin and straight dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my eyes passed over the messy stacks of books everywhere, I noticed some movement out of the corner of my eye. Startled, I rolled over onto my stomach. Everything went black! Wait, that\u2019s just my bangs in my eyes. Brushing them aside, I slowly gazed around, looking for that little movement again. It\u2019s probably just my overactive imagination at work. Too much reading about giant robots and mythical creatures, I guess. Before I could turn away, a fluttering doll dress caught my attention. It\u2019s a calm night, so there shouldn\u2019t be a breeze in here. A small creature emerged from under the dress. It seemed to be looking around, confused. Hoping not to startle it, I slowly stood up from the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran through my body, and it wasn\u2019t from my bare feet against the hardwood floor. I smoothed my nightgown with my hands as I watched the tiny thing explore its surroundings. It seemed to show some intelligence, unlike the animalistic movements of a rodent. Even in the weak light cast by my nightstand lamp, I could tell it had a human-like figure. Could it be a tiny person? No way, that only happens in stories. I wonder if it saw me yet\u2026</span></div></div>",

From the look of things, I was under what looked like a big tent. A big, very dark tent. With nothing else inside, save for the two thick posts holding it up. \"I didn't join some mopey circus, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, more cautiously this time, I find that my legs are willing to support me again. \"Well, let's see where this bastard's carnival was set up...\" I could barely see a thing in the darkness, but I did notice the tent raised a little bit at one end, letting in a tiny bit of light, and that marked an easy destination. I take a step, and then another, carefully feeling out the ground before me, not wanting to trip over anything and knock myself unconscious again. Something told me I'd been asleep for long enough already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end of the tent was closer than it had seemed. Taking hold of the bottom of it, I hoisted it over my head and stepped outside, expecting the breeze of cool night air on my face and finding it room temperature at best. Odd. \"Well then, where...am...I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy words trailed off as I looked around. It was dark here, but not as bad as under the tent. I could see, but what I was seeing I couldn't believe. It looked like a bedroom. A giant bedroom! I took a few more steps away from the tent, head jutting about in every direction as I tried to make sense of this. Turning back to look at the tent, I gaped and fell backward, staring up at an enormous porcelain doll. This wasn't happening. This couldn't be happening... Turning around and looking once more at the impossibly large room, I froze. My eyes landed on an equally impossibly large girl who was staring right back at me. <i>Alright. Don't panic...calmly step back and hide under the doll's dress. Maybe she hasn't actually noticed you yet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a slow, nervous step back, not breaking eye contact. Then another. Then I freaked, and ran for cover under the doll, stumbling in the dark and falling over as I tripped on one of its feet. I laid there, practically right back where I started, hoping against hope she wasn't going to come...eat me, or grind my bones for bread, or some other cliche. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid there. And waited...</span></div></div>",

Judging from his messy brown hair and wide shoulders, it was a boy, perhaps a year or two older than me. We locked eyes for a split second before he scampered back under the dress. In his haste, he tripped and fell. I stifled a giggle, before I realized that he might be afraid of me. Of course, I would never hurt such a defenseless creature, but it might be fun to play with him a little\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down in front of the doll with my feet against the baseboard, my legs cutting off any escape route. There were still no stirrings of movement coming from under the doll, so I would have to coax him to come out. Gingerly lifting up the dress, I saw he was on his knees with his back toward me, his shapely rear in the air and his forehead touching the floor. It was as if he was hoping if he closed his eyes hard enough, this surreal situation would simply vanish into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I placed my hand near him, my fingers poking under the dress and my palm outside. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be my breakfast, then you better climb into my hand!\u201d I declared, in my most authoritative voice. I had to try not to laugh at my own poor acting skills. I waited to feel any sensation of little hands on my fingers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hiding under a toy of the giant girl while she knows where I am. This...was not my brightest plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, my body didn't want to move, it seemed. Not when I thought I heard her giggle, not when I heard her moving around outside, doing something, and not when my hiding place started to light up a little as she lifted the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI peeked at her from between my legs, seeing her fingers slip in after me. That was when I moved. I bolted, hiding behind the leg of the doll. Then I heard her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to be my breakfast, then you better climb in my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, then gulped, staring at her expectant fingers as I considered my options. If I tried to run, I was breakfast. There was no way I was getting away from her. Even hiding, all she has to do was pick up the doll and give it a once-over to see me. I let out a long, low sigh, resigning myself to my apparent fate as I stepped over to her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath and stepped onto it, sitting in the middle of her palm gently, waiting for her to do...whatever it was she intended to do to me. My fate was, quite literally, in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really hoped she wouldn't eat me...</span></div></div>",

It must be truly frightening for him, waking up shrunken in a stranger\u2019s house, with no idea what horrors could befall him. He must place a lot of trust in me, trust I would do well not to abuse. But still, it would be fun to play with him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I felt him settle down in my palm, I gently lifted him up to my face. I could feel him fidgeting a bit, probably trying to keep his balance. As he passed my chin, I slowly opened my mouth as wide as it could go. I bet he had quite of a view of my pink lips and straight white teeth. \u201cSilly, I don\u2019t eat my dolls,\u201d I said, as I closed my mouth and pulled my hand away to get a better look at him. He wore a brave face, but the slight trembles that I felt on my palm indicated that he was a bit shaken up. He seemed to stare up at me expectantly, as if he was unsure how to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople introduce each other when they meet, right? At least, that\u2019s what they do on TV. Anyway, my name is-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise from the hallway caught my attention. I only live with one other person and the creak of floorboards could only mean one thing. Glancing around the room, I tried to find a good hiding spot for him. A bare spot on a shelf otherwise filled with anime figurines looked like the best bet. I placed him down on the wooden shelf as gently as I could, placing a finger to my lips to encourage him to keep quiet. I flopped back onto my bed and flipped my book open to a random page as a sharp knock on the door reverberated through the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d I chirped happily, trying not to glance over at the tiny boy across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud creak, the door opened and my mother stepped through. Unlike me, she kept her black hair kept short and close to her neck. Even dressed in a simple robe and ready for bed, she has a preternatural beauty about her. I swear, it\u2019s almost like she uses magic to keep herself looking so young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to sleep soon?\u201d she asked, sitting down next to me on the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you have school in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mother,\u201d I answered, burying my face in my book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep in mind that we\u2019re going to start looking at colleges this weekend as well,\u201d she said, as she began to stroke my hair. \u201cIris, have you decided on a major yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, mother,\u201d I replied. My nose was up against the book\u2019s spine now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep thinking about it. I can\u2019t believe it; soon my little doll will be all grown up!\u201d She kissed me on the top of the head before we bid each other good night. Once the door was securely closed, I bounded up from the bed and rushed over towards the little guy. He looked comically out of place next to the scantily-clad warrior woman figurine next to him, but at least he was holding a spare plastic sword out in front of him to look the part. Maybe sometimes hiding in plain sight is the best option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as you heard, my name is Iris. What\u2019s yours? And how did you get here?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I ducked under the edge of the dress as it threatened to clothesline me and knock me back under the doll. The last thing I wanted to do was accidentally disobey this girl right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp I went, lifted toward her face as I took in the sight of the girl again. She was cute, I had to admit. Maybe a year or two younger than me. Pale with long dark hair. Enchanting, some might say. But some weren't in a position to be eaten by said girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I passed her chin, she opened her mouth wide and I winced back, seeing far too much of her teeth for comfort and throwing my arms up to shield myself. As if it would stop her from tossing me inside and devouring me whole. At least it blocked the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few seconds, it seemed she wasn't going to and I lowered my arms, seeing her now closed mouth as I was lifted a little further and she taunted me a little. A doll? Is that what I was to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept talking, very politely for talking to someone who might become her breakfast... But just as she was introducing herself, she seemed to hear something and started glancing around the room, settling on something and depositing me on a shelf as gently as she'd lifted me, signalling me to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure what to think at this point, but I nodded to her. God knows I didn't need to go drawing attention to myself and making trouble. I looked around the shelf, left between two anime figures in a row. To my side I saw a sword that seemed to have fallen out of one's grip. A katana. Thinking fast, I grabbed it, posing to fit in. I held the katana above me in one hand, placing the other hand on my hip in the stance a certain moss-headed swordsman had taken when he thought he'd become a statue. But I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the door came another woman. She looked like the girl I'd been dealing with but older and with shorter hair. She had an elegant beauty about her. It seemed like a family trait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the two converse, the girl, identified as Iris by her mother, occasionally glancing in my direction but clearly trying not to. I didn't move a muscle though I did listen curiously, learning a little about her. As Iris's mother left, she called her her little doll and I got the feeling I knew where all the dolls by her bed had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left, Iris came back over to me. I sighed, letting my am down but keeping my hold on the sword as she picked back up on introductions, asking me a few questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed and found my voice finally. \"My name's Jake. As for how I got here, your guess is as good as mine. I can't remember anything recent. How I got here, how I got so small...\" I really wanted to believe she was just a giant, but it just made sense that I was the one who was tiny. \"Nothing at all. I'd tell you more if I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, looking up at Iris. \"So what happens now?\"</span></div></div>",

If you\u2019re hungry, I can whip something up,\u201d I said, putting my hand out for Jake to step aboard. I noticed he climbed on with a little less trepidation this time. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, maybe you\u2019ll be dessert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a joke, of course, but I could swear I felt him shake a little. Must be my imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held him close to my stomach as I walked towards my door. I could still see him clearly, since I\u2019m flat as a washboard. The girls at school make fun of me for it, but everyone grows at a different rate, right?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slipped my feet into a pair of fuzzy pink slippers beside my bed before entering the hallway. It\u2019s an big, old, creaky house with a few unused rooms. I had to pass by my mother\u2019s bedroom before I could enter the kitchen. She\u2019ll probably think I was just getting a midnight snack or something. Probably. Nothing to do with tiny guys, certainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights flickered into life as I flicked the switch, illuminating a rather cluttered table centered in a large kitchen. I set Jake down onto the checkered tablecloth next to a stack of old books as I rummaged through the shelves, looking for something quick to eat. I found a large iron pot sitting on top of a shelf. It would be perfect for stir-frying. I peeked inside the fridge to see what kind of ingredients we had. Some leftover meat, a little bit of vegetables\u2026 should be enough for a small meal. Plus, it would be nice cooking practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will just take a sec, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter heating and oiling the pan, I added the ingredients. Turning back to Jake, I saw he was making himself comfortable on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me and mom living here now, so you won\u2019t have to worry about anyone else discovering you. Oh, there\u2019s also my cat, but he\u2019s fat and lazy, so you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about him! Whoops, food\u2019s almost ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, in the space of a few seconds, seemingly innocuous ingredients were transmogrified into a discolored lump. I think I just have bad luck when it comes to cooking. Oh well, practice makes perfect, right? I dumped it out onto a single plate. I figure we can share it, no need to dirty any more dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might look a little strange,\u201d I said, as smoke rose from the food pile. \u201cBut it\u2019s still edible!

And who knows how far back that was. \"Food sounds great, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Iris mentioned I might be desert, and a chill ran up my spine. She was joking again, right? She's...she's been joking, right? I tried not to think too hard about it as she carried me out of her bedroom. She was holding me close to her stomach, but looking up I could see straight to her face. Rather flat chest if I'm going to be blunt, but far be it from me to hold something so vain against a lady. Particularly one who may be considering me as a second course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel her body heat a bit held this close, and it was nice. Made for a pleasant trip through the creaky house. I looked around, examining it in the dark and trying to recall if I'd ever seen it before. But nothing rung a bell. It was all new to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, we arrived in the kitchen. Iris set me down on the table and set about finding something to cook. Holding a pile of ingredients, she let me know it'd be quick. \"Hey, take your time. I'm certainly not gonna rush you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially when I might be next... I pushed that thought away again, looking around. My eyes fell on the stack of old books beside me, glancing over them for any I might know. An author or two I thought I might have heard of, but nothing I'd read personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris explained her family situation. I froze when she mentioned a cat, then relaxed a little when she explained it was lazy. I'd known cats like that. I was sure I'd be fine Chekhov's gun didn't apply to reality, after all, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she exclaimed that food was done, I was a little taken aback. That was damned quick. But as she scooped it onto the plate, I began to understand. It looked like something you might see in an old movie based on a Lovecraft story. A b-movie shoggoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at it as she set it in front of me, apparently expecting me to test it. The alternative if it wasn't good certainly wasn't better for me. So I crawled onto the plate to reach it, pulling a piece off of the now smoking shoggoth and popping it into my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...not as terrible as I'd expected. It was downright edible, though the flavors had mixed in a strange way. I nodded my approval, looking up at her. \"You're not gonna win any cooking contests with it, but it's definitely not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed another piece and motioned for her to try some, taking a step back away from it just in case she got any ideas.</span></div></div>",

He seemed to like it, or at least it wasn\u2019t too disagreeable. After he took a step back, I grabbed a bite for myself. He was certainly right about the flavor being\u2026 original. As I swirled it around my mouth, I could taste the distinct flavors of undersea monster and motor oil. Well, at least it\u2019s healthy, right?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, runners-up don\u2019t belong in the fridge. Tossing the smoldering remnants in the trash, I stole a glance at the clock. I really should be going to bed soon. But hygiene is important, and I certainly can\u2019t tuck-in without washing up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for bed, and everyone knows you have to brush your teeth first!\u201d I said, letting Jake climb back into my hand and gently carried him into the bathroom. It was an ornate, brassy space, with old mirrors and ivory handles. I set him down on the cool marble countertop. Hmm, what can a tiny guy use to wash his face? Aha, a damp washcloth should do the trick! I just hope he\u2019s strong enough to lift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go! Wash your face before bed, or else you\u2019ll have dirty dreams!\u201d I said, as I wrung out the washcloth and handed it to him. While he wiped himself off, I looked at myself in the mirror. My own green eyes peeked out from under my long bangs. I really should get my beauty sleep soon. I grabbed my toothbrush and began to brush my teeth; after all, a healthy smile is important. As I was brushing, I felt something strange near my back molars. I tried to touch it with my tongue, but I couldn\u2019t feel anything. Strange. Maybe Jake can take a look? I bent down closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I think there\u2019s something stuck in my teeth,\u201d I said, opening wide. \u201cSee anything?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she was starting to look tired as she checked out the clock, then turned to me and declared it was bed time and we were brushing our teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in no position to argue, so I climbed into her presented hand and let her bring me to the bathroom with her, standing on the counter and looking around at the fancy set-up. Brass and antique mirrors everywhere you looked. This place was so fancy, it was almost like one of those crazy expensive doll houses. But I figured it might be better not to mention that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris set a damp washcloth before me explaining to wash my face. I'd never really heard this before, but I certainly wasn't going to let her think I was going to have dirty dreams. Somehow, that felt inadvisable. So I lifted a corner of the washcloth and diligently scrubbed my face with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finished, I looked up and watched you brush your teeth. That might be a little more difficult for me at this point. Pretty sure the head of a toothbrush was bigger than my own head at this point. iris looked like she was being bothered by something in her mouth, and as she turned to me, I shivered a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked me to have a look and opened wide. I got a nice deep view of her mouth, not wanting to move any closer. But it did look like there was something stuck in there. Between some of her bottom molars, sticking out the outer side of the teeth. A remnant of some past meal I couldn't quite make out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On that side,\" I pointed toward it, really hoping she could pull it out on her own. \"On the bottom outside. Maybe halfway back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost wanted to reach in and grab it before she could invite me in and try something. But it seemed pretty damned rude to climb into someone's mouth without specific invitation. And besides, she wouldn't try to trick me like this, would she? I'd seen this in a few too many cartoons to fall for it. No matter how pretty the girl trying it was...and no matter if she couldn't get it herself...and. And...god damn it, if she asked, I was gonna have to go in there. Damn you, chivalry.</span></div></div>",

Try as I might, I just couldn\u2019t dig it out. My fingers kept slipping off. His hands kept flailing as if he was trying to wave in a landing airplane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was almost close enough to gobble up. But that would certainly be rude. Perhaps he would be gallant enough to climb in and dig it out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be my brave little hero if you could venture into this dangerous cave and retrieve the treasure hidden within!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he nodded his acquiescence, Jake stripped down to his underwear. No sense getting his clothing all soaked, right? He was a little toned, more than adequate to face the task at hand. I placed my hand on the counter and let him climb aboard. He seemed to be getting used to this. I raised my hand to my face and swallowed my saliva. I should make my mouth as hospitable as possible before he sallied forth. Obviously I wasn\u2019t about to just dump him inside, so I slowly parted my lips and rolled my tongue out until the tip touched my palm. Jake flexed his muscles to psych himself up, and then tentatively reached out with a hand. His tiny little touch felt so surreal it sent shockwaves up my spine, sending my tongue into a twitching fit. It reared up like a serpent and whacked poor Jake onto his bum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, I peered down at him, hoping he wasn\u2019t hurt. Fortunately, he was slightly damp but otherwise fine. After he gave a thumbs-up, I stuck out my tongue again. This time, I braced myself and kept my tongue steady as he crawled deeper. I watched his progress in the mirror as he inched forward on his hands and knees. Once he was settled in, I slowly retracted my tongue into my mouth. I kept my lips open as wide as possible to give him enough light, so that this cavern didn\u2019t seem too eerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked out of my parted lips at his own reflection in the mirror. I could feel him shudder at bit at the sight. In fact, I could feel every breath and movement he made. He then glanced at the back of my throat, towards the dangling uvula signifying the gateway to an even deeper chasm. I tried to keep my tongue as still as possible, but it would still tremble enough to threaten to knock him off balance. Eventually, Jake made his way over to my molars, which he gingerly climbed over, swinging one leg over first and then the other. Once he was tucked in my cheek, I could no longer see him, but I could certainly feel him moving around. His feet dug into my flesh for grip as he struggled to remove the stubborn piece of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, a copious amount of saliva had built up in my mouth. It was just a natural reaction, not because I was trying to taste him\u2026. Really! I think I even felt him fall over once or twice. In any case, Jake finally dislodged the \u201ctreasure\u201d and held it over his head triumphantly. He made his way back across my tongue, slipping and sliding all the while. Finally, he made it to my front teeth, whereupon I unceremoniously spat him out into my palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations! The brave knight has returned with the treasure! Ah, but you can just toss it in the sink,\u201d I said, as Jake heaved it over the edge of my hand. It landed in the porcelain bowl and I rinsed it away. Jake looked adorable with his slimy, matted hair, and he couldn\u2019t wait to clean himself off again. But it wouldn\u2019t do to sleep in those ratty clothes anyway, so we should try to find him some pajamas. I\u2019m sure I must have something that would fit him mixed in with all the doll clothes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bit of whatever it was remained firmly stuck in between her teeth, and my options were quickly dwindling. A pit started to grow in my stomach. I knew what was coming next, and when she asked me to climb inside, I was unsurprised. However charming she was, I wasn't looking to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...suppose I can climb in there and retrieve it. I've got a weakness for beautiful damsels in distress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, but nodded anyway. I almost climbed right in as I was, then thought against it. I only had this one set of clothes. Better to keep it somewhat dry and not coated in Iris' drool for when I got out. Trying not to think too hard about it, I began to strip down, pulling off my shirt and then my jeans and revealing my body. I wasn't ripped by any means, but I was fit. And I at least thought I looked pretty good. I set the clothes in a pile, deciding to keep my boxers on. God knows, I'd be making a very different impression if I didn't. I'd rather play the saliva odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Iris presented her hand, I climbed aboard and she lifted me to her mouth. She seemed to be swallowing as much of her spit as she could to dry it out for me. I appreciated that small comfort, but my unease came back as she parted her lips, giving me a closer look inside. When she breathed out, I breathed in, taking in the fresh, minty scent and leaned forward to crawl in. I tried to set my hand on her teeth, getting tongue instead and receiving an abrupt smack in the face that knocked me over back into her palm in response, my face now thoroughly licked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked in amazement, not expecting that. I looked up at Iris, meeting her concerned gaze and offering a smile and a thumbs up to let her know I was okay. I chuckled a little, deciding to be more careful climbing around in her mouth, lest I get thrown the other way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Iris opened her mouth wider and stuck out her tongue. I was far more careful entering, testing each movement as I climbed onto it, letting her draw me inside. I turned around, looking out and seeing myself huddled inside her mouth in the mirror. I shuddered a little, frowned and turned away, trying not to think about it and focus on the matter at hand. Carefully, I inched toward the molars where the bit of food was lodged. Every now and again, Iris' tongue would jerk a little and I'd almost be thrown on my side, but each time I managed to maintain my balance and soon I made it my goal. I swung a leg over her teeth, then another, steadying myself between her gums and her cheek as I got a closer look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...a piece of a chip, maybe? It was hard to tell. But whatever it was, it had to go. I grabbed it with both hands and began to pull. It didn't want to budge. I pulled and pulled, I jiggled it, all the while losing and regaining my footing on Iris's slippery flesh. As it started to loosen, I noticed now much saliva was building up around me. I was ankle deep in the stuff, and my back and legs were thoroughly soaked. I wished Iris could swallow, but I was also terrified what might happen to me if she did, so I decided in favor of just hurrying up and giving one last, might tug on the chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift movement, it came free, I fell backward and slipped, landing face-first in a puddle of drool. I groaned, rolling over and picking myself up, now coated head to toe. I pushed my hair back out of my eyes, the spit all too happy to help hold it in place, and held the chip fragment in one hand. \"Finally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed over her teeth once more, careful to announce my climbing back onto her tongue with gentle taps before actually getting on and somewhat hastily making for the exit. It was harder now, with only one arm to support myself and being coated in slippery saliva, but I made it to her front teeth once more. Iris spat me out into her hand gently, and I showed her the food piece, grinning triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your problems are no more, milady.\" I tossed the food piece away as she said, sitting in her hand and breathing heavily. I tried to adjust my hair, but any semblance of neatness was long gone at this point. I looked at myself, the coating of drool starting to dry in the open air and making me sticky. My boxers weren't going to be dry any time soon. This was a problem. But one I could deal with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at Iris. She seemed to be considering my problem too, looking at my clothes with disapproval. I looked at them, then back at her, then remembered the myriad dolls in her room and realized what she was probably considering. I wasn't about to be picky. Anything that fit would do. I just hoped whatever she picked, it wouldn't be a dress...</span></div></div>",

I gently cupped him in my hands as I left the bathroom, holding him close to keep him warm. In one corner of my bedroom sat a large chest, like something a pirate would store his treasure inside. Setting Jake down on my bed, I kneeled down and heaved open the heavy lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a cornucopia of doll clothes. Frills and laces intertwined like the roots of some great fabric tree. Sticking my hand deep in the pile of clothes, I pulled up a bundle of dresses. Sorting through them, I tossed away a rainbow of multicolored dresses before I found a pair of pajamas sitting at the bottom of the pile. They looked a bit old-fashioned, with puffy sleeves and bulging leggings, but it was better than a dress, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks a bit silly, but it\u2019s all I have,\u201d I said, gathering up Jake in one hand and his new clothes in the other, and brought them to a large, ornate dollhouse in the far corner of my room. The roof hinged open, revealing a surprisingly detailed interior, furnished with ornate carpets, drapes, and tiny silverware. Even the bed was replete with a comforter and sheets. It looked as if an entire Victorian house had been shrunken down. It had everything but running water. I set him down in the master bedroom on the top floor. It was just large enough for Jake to climb off my fingers and onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Jake some privacy to get changed, I straightened out my sheets and fluffed the pillow. Well, time to see how he looked in his new clothes. Jake looked like an off-duty buccaneer in his starchy, bulbous outfit, but at least they fit him well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some good rest, because we have a full day of school tomorrow, and we can\u2019t be late! Good night, Jake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching him settle into his own bed, I gently closed the dollhouse lid. I let my slippers fall from my feet before climbing under the covers and shutting off the desk lamp. Many thoughts went through my head as I glanced over at the dollhouse, nearly invisible in the darkness. Finding a tiny person is a like something out of a fairytale. He\u2019ll need me to protect him from danger, and I have a new friend now, to boot. I rolled over and shut my eyes, finally letting sleep overtake me.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I used to wonder why anyone would need something like that just to store dolls, but now having seen her collection...well, it made sense. And the colorful mass of clothes she was currently sifting through only confirmed it. Dress after dress, I got a little more worried. But finally, she came to settle on something coming back to me. I hopped into her hand gracefully as she offered it, getting used to the process. I looked at the clothes. A rather poofy pair of pajamas. Not perfect, but they had pants. \"This'll do just fine. Thank you, Iris.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked on as she carried me...to a doll house. Of course. I laughed a little, somehow not having considered it before this point. But this was no simple doll house. This was the fancy sort of affair that I'd heard of getting passed down generation to generation. When she set me down in the dollhouse, fancier than most real houses I'd been in, I looked around wide-eyed for a few seconds, admiring the scenery. Top notch decoration, I had to say. I looked up to see that she was averting her eyes so I could change. I never liked to keep a lady waiting, so I quickly stripped off my clothing, leaving it in a pile by the doll bed and donning the pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey actually fit rather well, and I was happy about that. Sure, I looked like I was joining a high school production of The Pirates of Penzance. But these pajamas were surpisingly comfy. I gave Iris the go-ahead, smiling up as she looked back at me. When she spoke, I paused a second, but only a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will! You sleep well too, Iris. G'night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed into the bed of the dollhouse, finding to my surprise that despite it being made for dolls, at my size it was actually pretty comfortable. I watched Iris close the lid, then watched her climb into bed through the window, then darkness as she shut off the lamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laced my hands behind my head, staring at the dollhouse ceiling. Her words echoed in my head. We have a full day of school tomorrow. We... I hadn't thought about that. I mean, it made sense. I should be sticking to her like glue, lest her mom find me. Or her cat. And really, it'd be lonely waiting for her. The only real risk was getting discovered by someone or getting separated there. But I mean, what were the odds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, I was living the dream as far as being this tiny went. A mansion all my own, a pretty girl to look after me and protect me, and one who very probably wouldn't eat me, to boot. Things were pretty great for me, all things considered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, closing my eyes as the trials of the day took their toll and I slowly drifted off to a sleep I felt was well-deserved.</span></div></div>",

I quickly slapped it off, ceasing its cacophony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmh\u2026 Five more minutes\u2026\u201d I mumbled, rolling over. The next sound I heard was Jake\u2019s voice shouting my name. Did he somehow find his way into my bed? I didn\u2019t roll over on him, did I?! After rubbing my eyes clear, I saw that Jake was leaning over the balcony of his doll house, yelling for all he\u2019s worth. Sunlight streamed in through the window shades behind him. I must\u2019ve really overslept! Tossing off the covers, I threw a blanket over the doll house for some privacy while I got dressed. I put on the standard school uniform: a dark-blue blazer over a white undershirt and necktie, complete with a plaid skirt and black pantyhose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, but thanks for waking me up! We have a big day at school today, so let\u2019s get going,\u201d I told Jake, letting him climb off the balcony and into my hand. Placing him on my desk, I grabbed my shoulder bag and cleaned out some of the junk inside, dumping out old erasers and candy bar wrappers. Eventually enough space was cleared for Jake to climb in amongst the books and stationary, supported by a bed of tissues. Hopefully he won\u2019t be shaken around too much. Once Jake was settled in, he gave me a thumbs-up and I smiled back before gently zipping up the bag and hefting it over my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading into the kitchen, I saw my mom sitting in a bathrobe, reading the morning paper. A steaming cup of coffee sat on the table. The smell made my stomach growl, but I was running late as it is and had to time to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, honey! Do you want anything for breakfast?\u201d she asked, as I put on my leather loafers. \u201cEhh\u2026 not today, I have to leave soon,\u201d I replied, setting my bag on the table while I brushed my hair. As soon as I finished, I looked over to see my cat sniffing my bag all up! His massive black form hunched over the bag, his nose buried in a small unzipped section. Could he smell Jake somehow? \u201cBad boy, Mr. Giggles!\u201d I admonished him, before setting him back on the floor. Kissing my mother goodbye, I grabbed my lunch and ran out the door into the bright morning sunshine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight crispness in the air indicated that summer was on its way out. My house was at the top of a hill, which made walking to school much easier than walking home. The sidewalks were already filled with people, and I even saw a few fellow students. Our uniform is pretty conspicuous. Eventually, I made it to the gates of my school. The bells were already ringing, so I hurried up the stairs and under the big sign proclaiming it to be St. Mary\u2019s Girls\u2019 Academy. It\u2019s the only all-girl school around, and I heard it used to be much more famous, but it\u2019s the school my mother insisted that I attend. Whatever, a school is a school, right?! I quickly opened my locker and unzipped my shoulder bag. In the dim light, I saw Jake was unharmed and still ridiculous in his pajamas. My locker was truly a mess, with balled-up paper and old notes littering its walls. I cleaned out the contents of my soft pencil case, clipping a pen and pencil to my notebook for use in class. It would make a nice travel compartment for Jake. I set the bed of tissues inside the case and urged Jake to hop inside. Once he was secure, I zipped it up and placed it atop the books I would need for the morning. The hallways were nearly empty now. Bounding into homeroom, I took my assigned set next to the window right as roll was being called. Setting the pencil case on my lap, under the desk and out of sight of prying eyes, I unzipped it a tad, letting some light and air in. I smiled down at Jake before returning my attention to the front of the class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I readjusted myself in bed and drifted back off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up with a yawn, looking around at...an incredibly lavish bedroom. It was the doll house. I practically thought I'd dreamed last night, but no. It was clearly very real... I looked out the window and saw Iris peacefully sleeping on her bed. I smiled...wait, didn't she say she had school today? The alarm flashed back into my head. Ooooh, crap... I leapt out of bed, running to the balcony of the dollhouse and shouting. \"Iris! Hey, Iris! You have to get up! Time for school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stirred, and sat up sleepily. Success. I watched her realize what time it was and frantically leap out of bed, but then my vision was cut off by a blanket thrown hastily over the house. I was a little offended. She thought I was going to peek at her getting dressed... Or maybe she was just being sure. Either way, I shrugged and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the sheet was pulled aside and there she stood in the most school uniform school uniform I'd ever seen. Go figure. They do exist... I hopped aboard her offered hand, watching her clear out her bag. I didn't want to climb in there, but there didn't seem to be much option... So when she held it open for me, I slipped inside getting as comfortable as I could. I offered a thumbs up and a smile and she closed the bag, continuing her routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom in here, there wasn't much to watch. I was thrown around a little when she moved, but with a little adjusting I was able to prepare for the motions and ride fairly comfortably. I heard muffled conversation, and at one point I heard sniffing and saw the wall of the bag caving in next to me. Her cat? It seemed...big. I really didn't want to see it without a wall between us...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she began to run, my ride shook more. I supported myself with the walls of the bag and the things inside it, steadying and trying not to be thrown around. I just hoped her school wasn't too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd really, it wasn't. Soon, I heard plenty of girl's voices talking, though I couldn't understand them, and realized this was probably an all-girl's school. The uniform probably should have been a give-away... Still, note to self. Probably the worst place to get separated from Iris? Here. I decided to stick close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the bag was opened and Iris transferred me to a pencil case, smaller but emptied out for me and amplified with the tissue bed. It was actually pretty comfy. When she unzipped it sitting in class, I smiled up and confirmed I was okay, then let her focus on class. This was probably going to be a long day for me... I did wonder why today was apparently so special. What school event actually got students excited?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I'd just have to wait and see. I lay down in the bag, crossing my arms behind my head and alternating between looking at Iris and at the ceiling above her. It was all I really had to look at. Nice view, though...</span></div></div>",

No sooner did I open my textbook than the clicking of high heels signaled the arrival of Ms. Jones, our teacher. Her hawk-like eyes behind sharp glasses and strict demeanor kept everyone in line, not that I was ever in trouble or anything. Today\u2019s lecture was on various kinds of magic used throughout prose through the ages, from mystics to wizards. I propped my book open on my desk to an illustration of a buxom witch holding a staff. Stifling a yawn, I tried to follow along, but my eyelids soon grew heavy. Certainly I won\u2019t miss anything important if I rest my eyes for a few minutes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZzz\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice roused me from my inopportune slumber. It seemed to be calling my name. Jolting awake, I realized it was a male voice, impossible in an all-girls school. Where could it be coming from? It was as if someone was magically speaking inside my head. Before I could even turn my head to look, I recognized the voice: Jake. A small touch on my neck told me he must be resting on my shoulder. My brave little knight must\u2019ve climbed up my necktie to rouse me from my slumber again. This seems to be a repeating pattern; hopefully next time won\u2019t be with a kiss. Thankfully, no one seems to have noticed my little guest. Not wanting him to be spotted by a curious onlooker, I adjusted my hair to rest over my shoulders, hiding Jake from view. Trying to become absorbed in the lecture, I tried to keep as still as possible for the rest of the period, lest Jake get knocked off his perch and into a sea of female students. As class finally ending with a discussion of the famous wizard Merlin, I pretended to stretch my arms while I fished Jake out of his hair blanket and secreted him back in his pencil case. I gave him a quick smile before I closed it up, leaving a little bit open for air. I held him close to my chest as I gathered up my things. I was so preoccupied that I didn\u2019t even notice a fellow classmate approach me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Iris, what are you going to do for the talent show today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, the talent show was this afternoon! I have been practicing my routine for a month now. I have a thrilling magic show planned, except now fate has given me a partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have something big planned, or should I say small,\u201d I told her, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the first ten minutes or so, I was content to lay in the pencil case, looking around and just chilling. I considered taking a nap and just waiting the class out, but I'd slept like a rock last night and now I was wide awake... I sighed, standing, taking hold of the pencil case zipper and pulling myself up to look around. First thing I saw was the textbook, which was about... magic? Damn, if we'd talked about magic in my classes, I might have paid better attention... Especially with illustrations like that. But looking around, it seemed like half the girls weren't interested at all. Can't make everyone happy, I guess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drop back into the bag before someone happens to look over and see me and look up to see how Iris is doing. The look I get back isn't a look at all. Her eyes have shut, and her mouth is hanging open just a tad, a very light snoring coming from it. Oh, this is no good. If her teacher saw her sleeping, she was sure to get in trouble. I had to do something. \"Iris! Hey, Iris! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't dare yell too loudly, lest I draw the attention of nearby students, but my effort wasn't enough to wake her. I sighed, crossing my arms and considering my options, of which there seemed to be just one. Climb her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't like it. I didn't want to be out in the open where any wandering eye could spot the tiny man climbing a classmate, but I couldn't leave her to be caught. I took a deep breath and hoisted myself out of the pencil bag, walking closer to Iris. Luckily for me, her tie was hanging down as she slouched, practically laying on the desk. I took hold of the silky fabric, finding that at this size, its fibers made a decent ladder, and started to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed straight up, always looking ahead. I didn't need to see the fall if she were to jerk awake suddenly, or the myriad eyes that could turn at any moment and snatch me off the tie before I ever reached Iris. But luckily, none of that happened, and I made it to her collar with relative ease, crawling from under her chin onto her shoulder and steadying myself. I took hold of her shirt, preparing to be shaken, and called again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris! Iris, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this time, she did, slowly. My precautions where unnecessary. It took her a moment to realize where my voice was coming from, but when she did, she just smiled, thanking me with her expression and tucking her hair over me to keep me hidden. I sat there, taking in the faint smell of her shampoo and relaxing while the class went on, occasionally nudging her when she looked like she might be nodding off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class ended, I was slipped back into the pencil case, a little sad to move, but it was for the best. She zipped it most of the way, preparing to switch classes, and I overheard her talking to another student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalent show? Well, that was one way to get people excited, I guess. She had something... wait, something small? Did she mean me? Of course, I'd be happy to help. But I wondered just what she had in mind for this show... Guess there was only one way to find out. I had to wait and see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I could ask next time she set me down.</span></div></div>",

Jake could certainly hear my stomach grumbling from his spot in my lap. Hopefully he didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be searching for a tiny snack. Surreptitiously placing the pencil case inside my lunch bag, I made my way outside. It was a fine, sunny day outside, so I decided to eat outside, on the school grounds. We were allowed to eat outside, so long as we didn\u2019t wander off campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way over to my favorite spot. A small hill behind the school buildings held a solitary, big old tree that offered a bit of shade and privacy. I usually ate out here alone when the weather cooperated, since I didn\u2019t really have anyone to eat with in the cafeteria. No one wants to sit with the girl that still plays with dolls, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrimming with anticipation, I eagerly unpacked the lunch my mother made for me. Let\u2019s see\u2026 sandwich\u2026 banana\u2026 cup of baby carrots. No candy, but it looked pretty tasty for something so healthy. I tucked into the sandwich while Jake began to nibble on the carrots. I hope watching me eat didn\u2019t stir up any unpleasant memories for him. He seemed famished, too; who knows how long it was since he had a proper meal. Last night\u2019s culinary \u201cadventure\u201d probably doesn\u2019t count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing too hungry to talk, we instead listed to the singing of the birds as we ate. The sounds of laughter and conversation from the other students carried on the wind. Finally, Jake broke the silence while I peeled the banana, asking me about the talent show I mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a brilliant magic show planned! I sewed my own costume and everything. Except, I\u2019m not too good at the \u2018magic\u2019 part yet, so I\u2019ll need some help.\u201d As proof of my preparation, I pulled a tiny outfit out of my bag. It was a full three-piece suit, complete with coattails, a bowtie and top hat. It was everything a dapper little helper would need, perfectly suited to Jake\u2019s size. Hey, it helps to always be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pealing of bells indicated that lunch was nearly over. The talent show was next, although we\u2019d have a few minutes to prepare. Gathering up my things, I made sure Jake was safely inside his pencil case before walking back towards school. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the time lunch rolled around, I was woken my a low grumbling coming from just outside the bag, flinching away from it as I remembered last night and slowly realized what was going on. Iris wasn't going to eat me... at least, not yet. She seemed pretty happy with me outside of her stomach, and she had a talent show she needed me for anyway. I was safe until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited patiently while she walked to wherever she was going for lunch, popping out of the case when she let me out to see we were outside under a big tree. I took in the fresh air with a smile. A picnic sounded great right now. I watched Iris unpack her lunch. Sandwich, banana, carrots. Healthy, probably for the best, but it looked tasty nonetheless. I pulled myself out of the pencil bag, helping myself to one of the baby carrots, which at this size was a feast in its own right. I sat on her lap, on top of her skirt of course, hoping it wasn't too intrusive, munching on my carrot and trying to remember whatever I ate last, shoggoth not included... It just wasn't coming to me, so I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at her as she peeled her banana. \"So... tell me more about this talent show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did. I listened while she detailed her act, probably looking more than a little surprised when she pulled out my costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hey. That sounds pretty cool. And you're... so prepared.\" I looked at the tiny suit, frankly a little baffled that she'd thought this far through without a little man to actually fit in it. She could have used a doll, maybe? Either way, I guess my showing up was just what the magician ordered. I laughed. \"How can I say no to enthusiasm like this? I'll do whatever you need, Iris. I can be your lovely assistant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo follow it up, I stood and took a bow which would probably look a little less silly in a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we finished, bells were ringing. I hopped back into the pencil case, letting Iris clean up (I'd really just be a bother trying to help at this size) and giving her a thumbs up when she was ready to go. I wondered exactly what I'd be doing in this magic act. But whatever it was, I figured it couldn't be too difficult. I wouldn't let her down.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing my costume from my locker, I headed towards the bathroom to get changed. Thankfully, the bathroom was deserted. Hoping Jake wouldn\u2019t be too embarrassed being in a girl\u2019s bathroom, I set him down on the countertop so he could get dressed. I ducked into an empty stall so I could get into costume as well. Shedding my school uniform, I put on my hand-sewn costume. White thighhighs led into a poofy pink skirt and matching sleeveless top, the whole getup peppered with innumerable bows. I tied my long hair into matching pigtails on either side of my head. Stepping out, I saw that Jake had finished putting his costume on as well. The little suit fit him well, and he greeted me with a dramatic bow. \u201cDo you think this costume suits me?\u201d I asked him, and he seemed to like it. It\u2019s rather ornate, but a magical girl needs to stand out, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering him up in my hand, I let him ride in one of the many folds among the skirt\u2019s frills. He can surreptitiously stick his head out to watch the show, while still remaining hidden. We made our way to the auditorium, passing several students who gave us strange stares. Oh well, no one said being a magical girl was easy. The audience was already being seated, and I was a bit nervous about performing in front of so many people. It looked like it was going to be a full house. I went behind the stage to get prepared. . It was already filling up with students, milling around and setting up equipment for their unique performances. Stashing my bag with my school uniform away, I retrieved my bag o\u2019 tricks and made sure everything was still there. Let\u2019s see\u2026 magic wand\u2026 check\u2026 handkerchiefs\u2026 check\u2026 rabbit in a hat\u2026 not allowed. The house lights began to dim as the student council president stepped to the microphone and thanked everyone for coming before launching into the list of performers. I swallowed hard when she listed my name, right in the middle of the lineup. Everyone was finished preparing by now, and the first act, a comedy duo, ascended the stage and began their routine. I stood on the side of the stage near the curtain to get a good view. I looked down and smiled at Jake, seeing that he\u2019s laughing along. I hoped he was having a good time. Next was a rock band, then a piano piece, and then my name was announced. Well, this is it. \u201cReady?\u201d I whispered to Jake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I can confirm...that they're just bathrooms. Who really expects anything else? She set me down on the counter with the tiny tux and headed into a stall to change herself. I was a little concerned about someone else coming in and seeing me, but I figured that was no reason not to change. Iris would have considered that, right? I took the chance and changed into the considerably nicer duds for the performance. It fit incredibly well. Hell, it might have fit better than the suits I had at normal size. Go figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stepped out of the stall, I saw her costume. Something akin to a magical girl, or a sailor scout, with matching twin tails. A bit more magician's assistant than magician, but who was I to question her methods? I smiled and offered her my classiest bow. \"You look gorgeous. I think it suits you quite well.\" Slightly over the top? Sure. But I felt a little like James Bond in this suit, so why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed into her hand and then took my place hidden among the frills of her skirt, finding a comfortable place to ride and watch. People were giving her strange looks, but it was the sort of costume that drew attention. I seemed to go unnoticed, which was good. Soon we were backstage, watching other acts as they performed. Pretty good, all things considered. The opening comedy act was funnier than one expected at a school talent show, and the band after actually knew how to play their instruments. And more than three chords. The following piano piece was nice and settled the crowd down after the harder rock music, and then we were up. Iris called down to make sure I was ready, and unable to whisper back audibly, I gave her a nod and a thumbs up from among the ruffles.</span></div></div>",

I arranged the tricks upon the table, and soon I heard the anxious chatter among my classmates on the other side of the curtain quiet down as they were hushed by the teachers. I watched a teacher on my side as she counted down the time until the velvet would rise. With each finger she ticked off, my heartbeat increased. I hoped Jake couldn\u2019t tell how nervous I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the curtain rose and I looked across a sea of excited female faces. I recognized several of my classmates, and I hoped I could give them a show that they would talk about forever. An upbeat tempo blared from the speakers, and that was my signal to begin. For my first trick, I tried to turn a bunch of small ribbons into one big cloth, but they caught fire instead! Hmm, maybe I didn\u2019t practice enough, but the next trick is a simple one. Grabbing my wand and wizard hat, I attempted to make a rabbit emerge from the headwear. \u201cAbracadabra!\u201d And\u2026 fireworks came out. They illuminated the auditorium with their red and green glow. I began to panic as the teachers scrambled to figure out what was going on. That was not going according to plan. I needed one final trick, something that would blow them all away, otherwise I would be a laughingstock until I graduate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, I pulled my trump card out from beneath my frills. I don\u2019t think Jake was expecting this, since I didn\u2019t feel him struggle at all as I placed him onto the table. \u201cI present to you\u2026 a tiny man!\u201d The crowd of students gasped as the spotlight shined onto Jake, but it seemed like only the front row could see him well. Jake did a number of action poses as everyone gawped at him. Finally, the music cut out and the curtain lowered. I could hear the applause and cheers of my fellow students as I wiped the sweat from my brow.

I heard her call for a rabbit and them the crackling of sparks as some colorful lights flashed on the stage. I bit my lip. \"Come on, Iris... You can do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came my time to shine, though I wasn't quite expecting it. '...a tiny man!' And suddenly I was out in the open, standing on Iris's palm. A spotlight loomed over me, and I flinched away, nearly blinded by the massive lightbulb. It felt like the sun to my tiny form. But I couldn't let Iris down. I opened by posing with arms wide as any good magician's assistant would. Then I let my arms fall and shifted into more dynamic poses. I wasn't sure how much people actually see of what I was doing, but I hoped it was enough. I felt reasonably impressive, and judging from the oohs and aahs as I moved, they seemed impressed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ended by doing a cartwheel to one side of her hand, then one the other way, and then one back to the center of her palm, where I bounced on my landing and turned it into a deep bow. Then the applause exploded. I stood back up, staring out into the audience, sweat beading on my forehead as I caught my breath. Judging from the reaction, I'd done enough to bring Iris's act back from the brink. I waved at the audience appreciatively, then I turned to Iris and offered a huge grin. \"I think we did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was ecstatic. Then I thought about something. She had made me 'appear,' but if I didn't redisappear, people might start bothering Iris to see me, and I felt like that could only bring trouble for me, but also for her. I turned back and called up to her, \"Make me 'disappear!' However works. Then enjoy your applause. You earned it!\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as I found a nice dark place backstage to surreptitiously let him out, one of the girls came up from behind me and gave me a congratulatory slap on the back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a great show! I never thought you had it in you!\u201d she said happily, before going back to tuning her guitar. A chill raced down my spine as I felt a distinctly Jake-shaped lump travel down my throat. Terrified of what stomach acid could do to his poor body, I dropped my magical girl gear and quickly rushed to the bathroom... </span></div></div>",

Even if I was basically just a prop in the performance. I heard Iris begin her disappearing act and ducked down as she closed her hands around me, suddenly not sure exactly what the plan was. She could subtly slip me back in the frills of her dress, or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, her hands swung up and opened just enough to launch me straight into a dark cavern I'd been worrying about not long ago. I sat up horrified, dead center on Iris' tongue. I tried to sit as still and possible and not panic any more than I already was. She had a plan. Obviously she had a plan. As soon as she got off stage, she'd spit me right out and the crowd would be none the wiser. I just had to avoid...triggering any reflexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she started to walk, I had a hard time sitting still. I reached down, taking hold of her tongue as gently as I could to steady myself. It helped a little, but wet saliva is not known for improving one's grip. Still, not long now. Just get off stage and do what you have to do, Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I felt Iris lurch forward, and then reflexively back. A horrid chill ran down my spine as I realized what was happening. \"Not like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was rolling head over heels backward before I could even begin to steady myself. I reached for anything I could to stop my descent, but everything my fingers brushed was too smooth and moist to help. My legs went down her throat frighteningly straight, and I was dragged along her tongue and back down with them. The last thing I heard was the girl's compliment as I slid down, down into the dark, damp abyss of Iris's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...but she'd think of something, right? She'd get me out of here before...acid... became a problem... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed against the walls with everything I had, trying to slow my descent and hoped she had a plan.</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t feel Jake in my throat anymore, and I was so scared that I stopped even breathing, afraid that even the smallest extra movement could be enough to send him to his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over the sink, I stuck a finger down my throat. I wasn\u2019t quite sure if this would work, but I heard girls in my class talking about doing this after lunch as a way to keep themselves skinny. I felt my throat muscles tighten, then a lump worked its way backwards into my throat. I spat it out into my hand.

Unsurprisingly, as my eyes adjusted, I realized I was outside. By a track, it seemed like...wait, that track was massive. I rubbed my eyes, making sure they were working right, and sure enough, the track before me looked miles long. I turned around to see equally massive stands. And looking down, I saw that I was on the long silver expanse of a bench \"...what the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could process much more, a girl started walking over from the track, and slammed into the bench next to me, and set her bag on the other side of me. She almost crushed me! If she had been just a little more to the right... I shivered, not wanting to think about it. Right now, I had to get out of here. And she seemed like my best bet. No time to be scared of the giant girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" I called up to her, waving my arms. \"Hey, down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo dice. She looked tired after track practice, and she was too focused on her sports drink to even notice me. I sighed. This was no good. She probably couldn't even hear me... I looked at her, then at her bag, and I got an idea. Grabbing the side, I found that it was sturdy enough to climb. A good back-up plan, if I can't get her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she started to stand up, a little slowly, but more than quickly enough to tell me it was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, so much for a back up.\" I grabbed the bag once more, holding on for all I was worth and climbing as fast as I could as she picked it up. As she lifted it off the bench, I pulled myself over the top of it, forgetting it was probably still open. I tumbled inside into the darkness as she started to walk, carrying me off to god knows where.</span></div></div>",

I couldn't help but enjoy a little flattery here and there... but it would be nice if I could depend on one else. They were good, but I was better! Anyways, now this was all about staying in shape, which I already knew... so I tuned out for a moment. I was just wondering how I was going to enjoy my weekend... \"Alright team, have a good weekend!\" She was finishing up. \"Let's go Vipers!\" We all clapped as we stood up and went out separate ways. Some of us went to the parking lot, but those of us who actually cared about how they looked went off to the locker room.

I wasn't about to go home smelling like this! Besides, I was all sweaty! I grabbed my towel and went off into the showers. Some other girls thought the same way. I would say I was quite popular, and I got some invitations to some hangouts, but I really wanted to keep practicing. You don't just get this good overnight!

I couldn't make out what was being said, but I didn't really care. He wasn't my coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the girls shout something in unison, and some clapping, and we were off once more. Now, maybe we'd get somewhere. More walking, more being tossed around and struggling not to fall much deeper in. I managed to get hold of something fuzzy, it felt like a towel, and that made the ride easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bag stopped again and I let go, standing up, ready to get her attention when she opened the bag. I saw the zipper slide down, taking in a deep breath to call out as loudly as I could. I saw her face. \"HE-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could get more than a peep out, she grabbed the towel out from under me, knocking me over and thoroughly disorienting me. I groaned, laying on something else now, not bothering to look at what it was. Why was she even grabbing a towel...oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hit me like a brick wall, and I realized where we must be right now. Crap! I couldn't be found while she was showering. She'd think I was some sort of perv. I sighed, looking at the pile of clothes and things and saw that it gave a bit of a hill up to the zipper of the bag, which was hastily left undone. Maybe...maybe I'd just take a look around. See what's out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to myself, I stood, climbing up the pile and leaping, grabbing hold of the zipper's edge, pulling myself up. And to my disdain, I saw exactly what I was hoping to avoid. A look directly into the shower room. I closed my eyes, looking to the left before I reopened them, then the right following suit. Looks like any girl that didn't shower was gone already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was in front of me seemed to draw my vision. Almost without thinking, I turned my head. <i>Just a quick look...nothing more.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than a quick look. Once I saw, it was hard to look away from the girls rinsing themselves off after a hard day's practice. I gaped a little, flushing red as I stared, not even considering that one of them might see, or someone else might come through the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring, I didn't notice the sound of showers shutting off outside my vision, and I didn't react until I saw two of the girls turn out of the shower room, blocking my view and bringing me back to reality. Instinctively, I let go of the zipper, landing onto the pile and slipping down the side of it, part of it falling apart with me, collapsing on my legs. I paid it no mind, too worried that I might have been seen. I heard more showers</span></div></div>",

Though, I could've sworn I saw something else in there... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a look at my watch and I saw that I was running late! I had to pick up my sister from the elementary school! I quickly took out my clothes and put them on the bench beside my bag. I quickly put on my panties and my bra, and then my change of clothes. It was a plain, low cut, orange t-shirt, and tight jean shorts. Not only did they bring the boys my way, but they were comfy and easy to wear! They went really well with my long brown hair, and they made my green eyes shine! Although... I could feel an uncomfortable itch, but I couldn't tell where it was. I put my wet towel and my sweaty track uniform inside the bag. I opened my locker and I took out my gym clothes. I smelt them, and they were more than a little ripe. They definitely needed to be washed. I put them in the bag and I zipped it up. I was the last one out of the locker room, and the door locked behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was leaving leave, one of my friends came by. \"Hey, Daisy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, how's it going?\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

This would be a crucial error in the following events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw her return through the top of the bag. I didn't say anything. I couldn't let her find me while she was wearing just a towel. She didn't seem to notice me as she reached in for her clean clothes. And as she grabbed the pile, that's when I realized my mistake. Rising with them, I hung upside down from the bottom of the pile, legs tangled in something I was too preoccupied with staring at the drop below me to make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she set the clothes down, I bonked my head on the hardwood of the bench, dazing myself with a groan. But just a few moments later, I came too dangling and on the move once more. I shook my head, trying to clear it as I looked up to see what was holding me here. I froze as I looked up at a perfect view of this girl's nether region. Somehow, my foot had gotten tangled in a loose string on her panties, and she was about to put them on. Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to untangle myself desperately, but it was too late and the string seemed to have twisted itself while I hung, further trapping me. She stepped into her panties, pulling them up tight. When they came into place, I found myself hanging from the lower back side, feet poking into her butt. I cursed. How was I supposed to get out of this? If I untangled myself, I'd fall to my death. If I didn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw the jean shorts in the clothes pile. If I didn't, I was in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing I could do. As she continued to dress, I had to decide trouble was better than death. And as she turned back and forth, her panties rid up little by little, pulling my feet in a bit more each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it came to the shorts. I watched with an impending sense of doom as she lowered them, then stepped in. As they climbed her legs, I closed my eyes, waiting for the inevitable. And as they hit me, they pushed me up, flipping me 180 degrees and pressing the rest of me against her, admittedly firm, butt as they sunk into their tight shape. Great...how was I going to explain this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. This...would be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this girl packed up her things, I dreaded what would come next. And when she started to walk, I saw it was justified. Every step, her butt pressed against me from either side, and her shorts threatened to push me deeper into her, her panties the only saving grace keeping me where I was. This couldn't be comfortable for her. What was she doing up there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard her talking cheerily, probably to a teammate, but while she was happy, my situation was only getting worse. My feet were embedded pretty deeply between her cheeks now, and the rest of me was getting closer to joining them with every step she took. I really hoped she got where she was going, and quickly. I wouldn't even mind being found now. The timing for it got worse every second anyway.</span></div></div>",

When she finally stopped walking, I took a brief moment to assess the situation. I was almost completely enveloped by her butt now. A little of my back was still free, but as I heard a car door open, I knew it wouldn't stay that way for long. Why wasn't she trying to fix this!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent over, and I knew what was coming next. She came down on the seat and I was abruptly pressed a little deeper, sealing me completely into her crack, now coated on all sides by her panties. The heat of her body was starting to get to me, and when she started to grind on the seat, I cried out, being driven further each time her cheeks briefly spread, and being held there when they smooshed back together, grinding along the seat. Whatever she was thinking, this was NOT working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, she stopped. \"Finally...\" That's when I saw light flood in and her fingers briefly take hold of the fabric around me, picking at it. I was abruptly pulled free of them before they slapped right back over me, but instead of encircling me, this time they just pressed me against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl seemed exasperated, but she must have had to be somewhere. I heard the car start to rumble, her butt shaking every so slightly with the vibrations as she took up a different strategy, now grinding it up and down on the seat behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every movement, the situation was made even worse. Her panties slipped in a little more, dragging me along. They were too tight to let me slip out, but with each movement, I seemed to be pushed a little more toward the inside. This wasn't good...if she kept up, I'd be...oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I heard the car brake just as her final attempt let me slip free of her panties, swinging full-on into her crack with more force than I'd have liked. She stopped for now, and I heard very faint voices in the distance. Someone she was picking up, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know, but as the voices got closer, I heard a car door and she didn't move. I groaned. Why didn't she just reach in and fix this, damn it? It had to be irritating her, and this was a much simpler answer than this seat-dancing she'd been doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard some mumbling between her and her new passenger, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith someone else in the car, she couldn't just reach in now...I just hoped she'd get somewhere private fast and find me. I'd explain as best I could and hope she understood. I just wanted out at this point...</span></div></div>",

I dropped my bag and I ran up the stairs into my room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time to take care of this wedgie thing once and for all! I reached into the back of my pants and I pulled out my panties from my butt crack. I sighed in relief. That itch was driving me crazy! Though... what I grabbed... I don't think that was my panties... I slowly reached back there. I didn't quite know what it was that I was touching. Whatever it was, it was stuck there. I peeled off whatever it was and I slowly pulled it out. Eew... it was all sweaty! I took a look at what was in my hand. It was a tiny person... it looked like my sister's dolls. Strange.

As she sprints upstairs, the effect of her walking was amplified three-fold, each leap rolling me between her cheeks, disoriented, and each time ending up deeper and deeper, losing more and more hope. I shut my eyes, trying not to succumb to the dizziness falling over me, and finally it stopped. Then I felt my prison loosen itself, and light seemed to force itself into her crack to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I was between her fingers. She finally pulled me out. I winced, shutting my eyes again as the light hit me, now accustomed to the darkness in her pants.

She was off in her own little world. \"Okay... do you have a name, Mr. Doll-person? I'm going to introduce you to the rest of the family!\" Rose started rattling off her own stories about how each and every doll had made its way over to her room. It was a little convoluted, but it was actually pretty adorable, how she had an imagination like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, I had finally finished cooking the mac-and-cheese.

Even a little girl at this size was like being crushed beneath a mountain, and I was only saved by the plush cushioning of her buttcheek, crying out and trying to pry myself from underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently she felt me struggling or just wasn't comfortable sitting directly on top of me, because she quickly adjusted, leaning forward and freeing my front half from underneath her. My legs were still stuck, her pocket tightening to her form, but they weren't quite as crushed, and I found breathing was quite a bit easier. Come to think of it, I could move my arms. Maybe I could free myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, I heard you and Rose start to talk as you ate. I couldn't quite make it out, but I wasn't really focusing on it as I slowly pulled myself free. Suddenly Rose patted the pocket I was in, pressing me into her with each pat and pushing me back down a little bit. I wasn't sure if she knew I was escaping, but it certainly wasn't helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my progress after, I didn't get much further than where I was before she stood up and I slid deeper into the pocket once more as it loosed its grip on her. I cursed, flailing a bit to try to leap up and pull myself free as she walked away for more playtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one I heard. Rose froze. Did Daisy see me!?

I couldn't stay mad at her... but she couldn't go sneaking into my room... \"It's okay... just give it here...\" Rose looked sadly for a moment and placed you into my hand. \"Okay... Rose, this isn't a toy... it's actually a tiny human. I found him while I was at track practice and he needs a place to stay while we figure out a way to bring him back... Okay? So you can't play with him like your other dolls. You have to be extra careful with him... got it?\" Rose nodded. \"Good.

I wasn't about to hold it against her, though I might be a little more careful when she was around from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she set me in your hand, I patted her finger sympathetically.

I laid there, panting and coated in cheese. Then after a few moments, I started to laugh incredulously. All my bad luck in life so far was just made up for. Lady luck was smiling on me. I didn't even care if you saw me right away. I just laid there, laughing for a minute or two. Then I rolled on my back, staring up at nothing in particular and letting out a relaxed sigh.</span></div></div>",

Standing there naked, holding the jeans in front of me, I side-stepped to the sink, grabbing the soap and slipping inside, tossing the jeans on the counter when I was waist-deep and slipping the rest of the way in.

Do you happen to have some spare doll clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose perked up and she thought for a moment. \"Well, I'm not sure if I have any boy's clothes, so...\" Rose rummaged through a trunk and looked through several outfits. \"Hey!

Come to think of it, I didn't remember seeing many male dolls. I hoped I didn't get stuck with a dress or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you came into the bathroom again, I sighed with relief seeing a shirt and pants. One problem solved. I watched you set them on the sink then duck down, rummaging and bringing back up a washcloth. It was a little small for a washcloth, but perfect for my purposes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Daisy. You're the best.\" I said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you set it down, I lifted myself up out of the sink, giving you a few seconds to look if you felt so inclined while I wrapped it around myself. Now I could say we were even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, it was still more like a blanket than a towel, but that was fine by me. I barely had to move it as I dried myself, draping it over my shoulders like some sort of cape and facing away from you as I moved for the doll clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled on the pants, a little loose around the waist and a too long in the legs, but I managed to keep them up well enough, and let the washcloth drop off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an after thought, I grabbed it back up and rustled it over my head, drying my hair as best I could. It would be a bit of a mess without anything in it, but I'd looked worse. Dropping my makeshift towel once more, I pulled on the shirt. It was gaudy, not really my color and the equivalent of two sizes too big, but it would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set...do I look ridiculous?\" I asked, turning around and realizing I hadn't bothered to check if you'd stayed in the bathroom or left again.</span></div></div>",

I think that's where you found me... I've actually got a track meet on Tuesday, so I should be doing nothing but practicing tomorrow...\" I paused for a moment. I was still wondering what I would do with you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, when I'm not on the track, I usually just rest, and relax... I like relaxing, too. There isn't a whole lot I do, aside from hanging out with my friends. I guess I did some writing, and I cook a little, too. I guess I'm still in that awkward phase of wondering what I should do with the rest of my life...\" I sighed. \"But I guess that's enough about me... I guess I should ask if you have any ideas on how you might've shrunk, or any ideas how to get back to normal. Or did you have any other things to ask me?\"</span></div></div>",

Hanging out with friends. Also questionable when it came to my involvement. I mean, I was sure your friends were fine. But it would be an awkward introduction if nothing else. And we'd already seen it was fairly difficult for me to keep myself from being snatched, should someone feel so inclined. Again, not accusatory. Just a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And figuring out what you want in life is tough. It's not fair to expect us to know yet. I definitely feel you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the conversation shifted. How I could have shrunk. How to fix it. All questions I had absolutely no answers to. \"More questions for you...might have some later but now that I'm thinking about it, this whole shrinking thing,\" As if it were so minor as to be just 'a thing'. \"Well, if you'll permit me to ramble a bit and get a little out there, I can see two possibilities. Some weird as hell super science that targeted me for some reason or another, or magic. Admittedly less believable, but I didn't believe I could be reduced to a couple inches tall either. So I'm a little more open to the possibility.\" I shrugged. \"Or it could be aliens.\" Mostly a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for getting back to normal, barring a Willy Wonka stretching room suddenly appearing, I'd say the possibilities are the same. Science or magic.\" I scratched my head. \"Now, as for how we figure out what caused it, if it's fixable, and how to fix it, is beyond me. I wasn't exactly involved in any mad science, as cool as that would have been. And to my knowledge, I don't know anyone magic, unless I accidentally spurred a grudge against me somewhere along the line...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath and concluded with a nod. \"So, in a round-about way of getting there, I have no idea whatsoever how this happened or how to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat realization sort of hit me as I delivered it, and my smile wavered for a second, realizing I might be stuck like this forever... Awesome as you were, I'd rather be able to meet you at eye level at some point. I turned toward the TV, trying to cheer myself up a little with Star Wars and trying to come up with a way to steer the conversation back toward something more cheerful.</span></div></div>",

Had I been conscious enough to look right, I'd have noticed gravity pressing your breasts together, making them possibly more alluring than they already were.

I jerked awake, looking up to try to figure out what it had been, noticing I was decidedly more wet than I had been when I fell asleep. Body as well as face. My clothes felt a little heavier, and as another string of drool slipped down from your face and onto mine, I realized just what had caused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little gross, but I was still a little out of it and I felt more like laughing than anything. Still, I got to my feet before any more reached me, walking away from your face, lowering my own and trying to rub the drool off with the front of my equally moistened shirt. It soaked up some, but I still felt kind of sticky. Best I could do, I guess. I let my shirt go, looking up just in time to walk smack into your boob and get a face full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there like that for a moment, realizing what I'd just done and almost too frightened to step back for fear that would be what wakes you up. So I tried to collect myself, taking a breath and peeling my face away from your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlushing a dark red, I walked back over to where I was before, positioning myself below your face but away from your mouth, laying down and hoping you hadn't noticed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there, falling asleep, the thought that you might move your head onto the cushion and onto me crossed my mind, followed by the thought that I would probably stick to you if I were pressed up against you in this state, but I pushed those away.

That is, until I was scared awake by a terrifying dream that made just aware just how much bigger spiders are now.

Pulling my head, I separated it from whatever it was stuck to, turning to look at it and freezing. Was...was this...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face flushed red as I looked up and saw your neck and head, then back down in disbelief to see my body was buried in your cleavage. Suddenly I wasn't so sure I'd actually waken up. But there was no way to pinch myself, and it all felt pretty damned real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath, laid my head back, and smiled. No, this wasn't a dream. You for some reason or another had put me here.

And by noticed, I mean I was bounced right along with them. Judging from the rate of the bouncing, I'd say it was a slow jog, but my eyes told me something different. It was like being in a convertible going 80 with the top down. A bouncy convertible with very soft seats. I was moved around a little, but it seemed I was well enough lodged to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you spoke, I looked up. \"Hey, I'm riding first class. I don't mind if it takes a little while...\" Was I flirting? I was terrible at flirting. That was nonsense. \"And I don't think it'll be a problem. You look like a freshman and that's mostly what we'll be running into around the dorms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, sure it would be fine. \"...the hard part will be actually getting into my dorm.

Mutual, but neither of us were really happy about it... I tried to remember anything recent. If I'd seen her since. Nothing. Damned amnesia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed...at least I had a suspect. This trip wasn't a waste. And that's what counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad I known you thought you were being followed, I might have suggested that there was no better way to expose someone for that than making them run to keep up. And you were certainly equipped and outfitted to run.</span></div></div>",

I promise I'll go easy on you...\" I searched for about five minutes and I was starting to get pretty upset. I was <i>not</i> about to lose to a tiny guy! Suddenly, I saw a blur out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head. \"There you are... come here, mousey!\" I started fast crawling toward you. It didn't take me long to pounce on you behind the kitchen counter. \"Got ya~\" I purred as I pinned you to the ground with one finger. \"Hmm... now what should I do with you...\"</span></div></div>",

At least, not from directly on the other side of it...damn, this was not a good place to hide. One sidelong glance and I was found out. I heard Daisy pouncing this way, and looked for options. The couch. If I got under it, I'd have shadow in top of a thicker leg to hide behind. I chanced sprinting to it, throwing myself on the ground and rolling under it just in time to see you enter the room. I quickly pressed myself against the couch leg, curving around it as much as I dared to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled into the room, movements catlike. You looked dangerous, but damn if it wasn't a good view from here. That outfit was all kinds of alluring and you weren't exactly in desperate need anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook that thought from my head. You were coming this way, and snickering all the while. I curved around the leg of the couch as best I could to keep out of sight, hoping against hope and holding my breath as your hand lunged out and...grabbed behind the table leg. Damn. Good call moving, I guess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched you move away, deciding to head for the other side of the couch and move somewhere less predictable from there. After all, It was only a matter of time until you looked under it... The walk took me several minutes, but I was only disturbed by a dust bunny lurking there. Finally, I made it to the opposite leg of the couch, looking out the other side for somewhere to go. It was then that I heard you calling me to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore me, there was no more furniture for cover...but it was a short run to another doorway into what I believed was the kitchen... I looked, saw you facing the other way, and went for it. But I underestimated to distance and before I was home free, I heard you cry out and start chasing. I booked it, running faster once I got off the carpet, but before I could get very far in the kitchen, you were on top of me. Knocked over by a paw, er, hand, and pinned down under a single finger. I stared up into your face as you grinned, practically purring at me, contemplating what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, a little nervously. The look in your eye was a little beyond just you, and I might have slipped into character myself...Still, I joked a little. \"I've, uh, I've heard in some countries, cats practice catch-and-release mousing?\"</span></div></div>",

I lowered my head and licked you slowly down your front. \"Mmh... I haven't had breakfast yet... and you were pretty tasty...\" I let you add things up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked you up with both hands and opened my mouth widely in front of you.

I lost Jake for a moment, and he got dirty, so I thought I'd clean him up...\" Before Rose asked any other questions, I hastily put you in her hands. \"You wanna play with him now? Here, he's yours!\" I quickly retreated to my room and locked the door, leaving Rose staring at the hallway where the room was and at you, extremely confused. </span></div></div>",

That was when you licked me. Your tongue was warm, and understandably wet. I couldn't feel much through the doll clothes, but it was more pleasant than one would expect being licked to be. But still really weird. It took me a second to get past the strange sensation and realize just what you had in mind, my comment falling silent before I even said anything as you opened your mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D...Daisy. Come on, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to squirm free again as she pulled me toward the cavernous maw before me. She wouldn't. She wasn't seriously going to-There's that tongue again. All over my face, this time, and I felt every tiny bit of it. I tried to bend back away from your tongue, but this was its domain and nothing was free of its reach. I felt your lips close over more of me, then a soft suctiony feeling as you sucked on me. Before I knew it, everything from my waist up was being coated in saliva, the rest soon to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy, come on! That's enough! This isn't funny anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still didn't think she'd finish the deal. There was no way she'd just up and eat me... But as I felt teeth graze over my midsection, possibly unintentionally, I cried out anyway and started to struggle harder than before. She was too deep into character!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a faint voice from outside of your mouth I couldn't quite make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything froze. You stopped sucking on my, and I felt your mouth open up again. I was slowly sliding back out, and soon was deposited back in your hands with a nice coating of drool. You were trying to save face, but I couldn't quite tell from who, roughed around in your hands as you quickly tried to wipe the spit off of me, doing a reasonable job on some parts, and just rubbing other parts into the doll clothes, cementing their drenched status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I was thrust forward and fell into another set of much smaller hands, turning around to look at Rose as Daisy hastily exited the room. I slowly pieced together just what had happened. I might have laughed if I weren't dazed, coated in drool that was air-drying and sticking nicely and currently the owner of what were probably the worst cowlicks in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at Rose's face, at least as confused as my own, and gave her the best smile I could muster. A solid 6 out of 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hey, Rose.\"</span></div></div>",

No... it's still too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" I finally said. \"As much as I'd love to finish this... I'd really like to get in everything we can do at your size.\" I said with a soft smile. \"I've still got a track meet on Monday, so why don't we do everything we want to do at your current size today, and then try to change you back tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let down my hand for him to climb on so I can go into the living room. \"Of course, I've still got to be hard at work training. Why don't I do some exercises? We can find some way to fit you in.\" Of course, I had a feeling he'd be parading in my boobs the entire time. Boys.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was completely powerless to stop you. I listened to your words, shuddering at the idea of your personal needs. Thrown toward the foot of the bed, I landed headfirst stunning myself for a moment as I bounced, shocked back to consciousness by a sudden horrendous smell emanating from behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled over finding myself face to face, or toe I suppose, with your left foot. Immediately, I looked back contemplating escape when I heard your warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you wouldn't...\" But as the words came out, my confidence was very clear. You'd invented a shrinking device. Why not one that turned people into crap? We were living sci-fi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, looking at the foot in front of me. My eyes teared up a little from the smell. Taking a step forward, I hesitantly put out my hands, bringing them to rest on your big toe, feeling the sweat your boots had produced and gagging a little. Not to mention it would take a few more sets of hands just to grasp around this toe. I doubted I could get my entire arms around any one of these. Not that I'd want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, taking a deep breath and beginning to massage you nasty feet, rubbing as hard as I could. Better to risk the very low odds of over-doing it than to have you think I wasn't obeying. I didn't want to think what you'd do then. So I kept rubbing. Your toes were slick. The sweat wouldn't have been that terrible to you, but at my size, it was like your entire foot had been oiled up slick. I moved along the toe, reaching as far around the sides as I dared, occasionally falling forward and soaking my shirt in the sweat, then moving onto the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to take forever. Frustrated, I pushed hard, hand slipping on the slick surface of the toe and falling between it and your big toe. Unfortunately for me, this meant falling up to my shoulder between your toes, face pressed firmly into them taking in the scent far closer than anyone ever should. I gagged, trying to pull myself free from between the plump toes. It seemed like quicksand. Easy to slip in, impossible to pull back out. And I had no leverage on the just-slippery-enough toes to help. I was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, I tried to keep massaging with my free hand while I tried to figure out a plan.</span></div></div>",

I would have cried out, but she leaned back before I could get over the shock, smothering me with the rest of her butt. She wasn't lying when she said she could probably fit me in there now. From my a little below me knees up to about my nose was completely wedged into her crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squirmed away, suddenly realizing I couldn't breathe. Didn't make it far, but managed to pull my head out enough to take a deep breath and try to calm myself. Ten hours of this...no, that was not happening. I had to get out from under her...but I wasn't sure there was a way. I could barely move my head, let alone the rest of me under her enormous weight. At least...at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. No. Shrinking wasn't a thing. And even if I did, she'd grab me before I could get halfway across the room, supposing I could get to the floor off this chair without breaking a leg anyway. But I had to think of something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around for any slight opening or chance to escape. In front of me, the expanse of her ass, red thong just about pressing up against my face. To the left or right, it just carried on, pressing up against the back of the chair on either side of me. Down was a total no-go for obvious reasons. And as I looked up, all I saw was the bunched up miniskirt. ...that's strange, why was it moving?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I realized it. The skirt was slowly crawling back down. If I could just get my head outside of it when it reached me, I might be able to use that as leverage to start pulling myself out. It was a stretch, but it was the best plan I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I waited patiently. And when I felt the shirt touch the top of my head, I wrenched it back to free it. But just at that moment, Alice adjusted, pressing herself against the back of the chair for a moment, wedging my face back between her cheeks before she sat back forward. This time, I did cry out, but the sound was muffled by her ass. I struggled as before, but when I tried to pull my head free, I found something in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" I cried. There goes my one plan, and this is about to get much worse for me if she leans forward and lets the rest of that skirt fall back. Back to the drawing board, I guess...</span></div></div>",

Slamming back down, I could feel that Jake was enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to grind down, making sure that by the time I got up, he would be as flat as ...well, a little person being sat on by a goddess.

I went over to the refrigerator to grab a bite to eat, allowing my ass cheeks to bounce with every step, his face feeling the most of my \"assets\". Finding the sandwich I was looking for, I leaned over, crushing his puny little head, making me feel like the mistress I am.

I tried to push the thought from my head, tried to separate myself from this hell, into some imagined peace, but so much as a little twitch from her brought me back with horrendous pain. I started to shake. Every breath brought less air. I started to accept death. Then she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pressure on me lessened. I turned sideways for a moment, then back up and down. I gulped in huge breaths of air as she stopped intentionally crushing me and I was able to resteady myself. Then she started to walk, and it all got worse again. I was ground between her cheeks, forcibly rolled between them like a piece of lint with each long, drawn-out step. I didn't know where she was going, and I didn't care. But when she bent over, I did care. My head, pushed deeper into her crack, was completely smothered by the pressure, just as I had exhaled. I couldn't breathe. Whatever she was doing, it was the end of me...I tried to gasp, tried to breath. Nothing came. Everything went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up, and immediately noticed I was still in this hell that was Alice's ass.

I was getting out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled for all I was worth, trying to beat at her with minimal success, and pull away with about as much of the same. I managed to pull my mouth free somehow, and I began to shout, not sure when I would stop or what I would say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out of here, you bitch! You can't do this to me! This is inhuman! I won't be just some toy for you to stick up your fat ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just kept going, shouting as loudly as I could. I didn't even know if she could hear me, but I didn't care. Hell, it was probably better if she didn't, but I just kept going. A man could only take so much, and I'd crossed the breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her move, and I wasn't going to stop until she did something or I ran out of breath and screamed myself hoarse.</span></div></div>",

This was entertaining, until he called me fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling Jake out of my ass, I pulled him up to my face and asked \"What did you say?\" His expression clearly changed and he looked scared of his position way above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For calling my ass fat, you shall be shrunken to 4 feet.\" A fraction of a second later, he was smaller. I brought him to my bed, and layed him down, face up.</span></div></div>",

It looked like an enormous bedroom. How the hell did this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could think any more on it, she started to laugh hysterically, picking me up and gloating about catching me. She...didn't quite seem altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never dated a woman named Beth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shaking a little, although it didn't occur to me much at the time. I was pretty sure anyone would be shaking in this situation. Perfectly natural response to being squeezed in the hand of an angry woman who thinks she's your ex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to compare me to her apparent boyfriend, but I cut her off, correcting her on the facts. This was all a misunderstanding. She'd fix this and let me go...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rage in her voice said no before most of the words could form from it. She threw me on the bed. I flailed through the air, crying out as I slammed into it and bounced. Would have broken my neck if I hadn't thought to tuck my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was nuts. Absolutely nuts. And as she pulled off her boot, I nearly gagged on the stench. It might have been bad for her, but at my size, it was like a mountain of rotting corpses in the sun. And the corpses are just giant feet. But the last thing I wanted to do was piss her off any more. I'd hate to have been her Jake here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she set her foot on the bed, I walked up to it, tears welling up in my eyes from the pure stink. I tried to breathe as little as possible as I started to rub what little of it I could reach at this height, pressing with as much force as I could to make up for my size. I wasn't sure if she could even feel my tiny hands, but it was better than just flat out risking not doing it. Maybe she'd be happy with me and I could turn this around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, I kept it up. Rubbing her foot, trying to hold my breath, trying not to pass out as I inhaled more and more. I just hoped she'd appreciate the effort...</span></div></div>",

Don't mind it, my ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my tongue, knowing better than to piss you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and I do love them so much. So very very much.

I took a deep, deep breath and pressed my face between them. Naturally, you didn't spread them, making me force my way in, smearing my face with your sweat until my chin came to touch the skin between your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held my breath for as long as I could, letting it out slowly, but eventually giving in and needing to inhale. I breathed in my mouth, but I could practically taste the smell, wincing as tears welled up in my eyes.

But anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could get a word out even to agree to this, I was flying through the air, landing squarely between your breasts headfirst before I had enough time to even consider what was happening.

I wanted to shout so many things at you that would get me killed, but I held it back. Looking in the window, I recognized him. He was a pretty alright guy. We'd talked in class some, though we didn't really hang out much. Suddenly, it made a little more sense that you'd mixed us up. <i>Everyone</i> did. Hell, we'd once made a game of it to mess with a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you explained the plan, I started to get a hollow feeling in my chest. This was wrong. Even as I started to grow back to my original height, I felt miniscule. Mostly because I knew I wasn't going to go against your will now. If I didn't do this, I was probably dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the potion roughly, pocketing it and scowling. \"I'll hold you to that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched you run off and hide out of sight, taking a deep breath and knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Jake answered, clearly a little confused. \"Oh...hey, Jake. Didn't expect you. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd come over once to work on a project for a class once, so it wasn't showing up out of nowhere at least. \"Yeah, I wasn't really planning on it. I was just in the neighborhood bored. Thought I might swing by for a few minutes. Say hi.\" I tried to be as casual as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded slowly, then shrugged opening the door wider. \"Riight...well, okay. Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed him inside to the living room, clearing my throat a little and rasping my voice. \"Hey, I know I just showed up out of nowhere, and I hate to intrude, but could I bug you for a glass of water...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake chuckled a little. \"If I knew you were moving in, I'd have made room upstairs, Jake.\" He stopped in the middle of sitting down, walking into the kitchen. \"Just a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was out of sight, I grabbed the bottle in my pocket, looking at the cup already there. I swore I'd make up for this somehow and poured it in, watching it blend in flawlessly and pocketing the bottle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake came back in with a cup, handing it to me. \"So why me? I know you've got other friends around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, watching him sit and pick up his own cup, not drinking yet. I took a drink of the water, and cleared my throat. \"Much better...and I don't know. always felt like we could have been better friends, you know? Like we were practically there, we just never hung out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded, taking a long gulp of whatever it was in his cup, letting it set and nodded once more. \"Fair point, I guess...\" He licked his lips, looking at the cup. \"...must be my imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a breath, then drank a little more, hoping it would hit sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jake...if we're gonna be friends,\" Jake swigged the rest of the drink, setting the cup down and looking at me. \"Where do we...do...we...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to sway a bit, grabbing his head. \"Oh god...what's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he passed out and before my eyes I watched him shrink to the very size I was just a few minutes ago. I sighed, picking him up. \"Sorry, pal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back out, finding you there and holding him out to you, a look of disgust and shame on my face. \"Now we're square...and he never knows I did this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a request.

I spotted a nearby dresser, or chest or something like it and sprinted toward it, realizing quickly just how slow I was tumbling over and through carpet halfway to my knees. I desperately ran, but it didn't look good...</span></div></div>",

Last week, one of the seniors in the physics department here at college, being the egotistical bastard he was, let slip about some fancy project that would win them a Nobel prize. A little buttering up and a few drinks made him a lot more talkative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot of fancy science that an art major like myself neither cared for nor really understood. What really sparked my interest was the idea of \"matter displacement\". A simple change of the location measurements, and the target would resize to fit the new area. It had been a simple mistake during an early test, but it quickly developed into an intentional feature of the prototype: apples the size of tables, chairs small enough for a fly. And now, I thought as I pulled out the scrap of paper that the drunken senior scrawled some directions onto, a person tiny enough to fit in the palm of my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy target: you. Nobody I knew, no one important, just some guy who works at that store down the street from the Walmart. I didn't know you. You didn't know me, just some random guy who walked through the store. Our only encounter was when I walked in, saw you, decided you'd be a good target, and bumped into you to plant a little tracking bug on your shirt. It wasn't fancy, just enough to read coordinates so I could pull you through the system without you having to be in the room beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced at the clock. 1:45. Only 47 minutes after I'd bumped into you. No doubt you were still at work. I had to hurry, before someone came in or something went wrong on your end of this. Muttering again, I feverishly entered the coordinates for the destination, compacted to the one-inch goal I'm aiming for, then hooked up the tracker-receiver for the origin data. I crossed my fingers, hit the activation button, and turn to the second platform to watch in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing, and I faltered a little, disappointed. Then the platform hummed to life with blinking lights and the charging buzz of energy. A flash brightened the room as it received and formed the shape of a one-inch person. Eager, I crouched down over you, watching as you slowly recover from the device's effect.</span></div></div>",

I wasn't sure what hit me, but damn it felt like a semi-truck to the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed my head, trying to figure out what it was. Slowly, I remembered. I was at work at the store. Typical boring day. No one really of note was coming in. Then...a while into the shift, bam. Lights out. Nothing. And then here I was with a splitting headache and a pile of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, frustrated. But when I looked up, that frustration shot right back into me and was replaced by fear. A giant was kneeling over me, staring right at me. I shouted in alarm, trying to scoot backward.  Behind him, I saw an equally massive room. What the hell happened? How the hell did I end up in a giant's house. And most importantly... \"Who the hell are you!? What happened to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably not the most tactful introduction I've ever made, but I wasn't exactly feeling cordial. Staring up at him, I realized that no matter what I did, there was no getting away. He could outrun me with a single step if I booked it...and he could crush me flat if he felt like it. It all came down to what this...strangely slightly familiar-looking giant decided to do with me.</span></div></div>",

Oh, this was just going to be all too much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's no need for such language. Honestly, what's a little manners cost? But my name's Ethan. As for what happened?\" I gestured down to the cool metal platform you were on and around to the flashy computers and control panels in the room. \"You're the first person who's been successfully shrunk by the new teleporter the geeks here at Franklin College. Congratulations, by the way,\" I added with a slight smirk as I loomed over you. At your height, you barely came up to the top of my toes inside my sneakers. Even with all my planning and preparation, I still was surprised by how puny you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I must be like a skyscraper to you,\" I muttered, more to myself than to you. Reaching down, I lightly poked you in the stomach with a finger, as if assuring myself you were actually real and not just a figment of my imagination. \"Well, you're solid, and you're moving and breathing, so I guess I can chalk this up to a full success. Thank god for science nerds and their crazy inventions, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beeping alarm screeched from my wristwatch, shaking me from my ponderous thoughts. \"Oh, damn, classes will be letting out any minute now.

Was I really the victim of some cheesy movie device? Some now horrifically real cheesy movie device?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shrunk me!? Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was angry. Too angry to think about shaping up my attitude just because this bastard was offended. But you seemed more preoccupied with your own thoughts, probably about whatever plan you seemed to have for me, than you were in my pathetically tiny shouting. Something about being like a skyscraper... I stood up, crossing my arms and watching you nervously but trying to look somewhat threatening in my anger. It didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of it, poking me in the stomach and knocking me over. I took a swing at your finger, but you were already pulling it away and didn't seem to notice the tiny movement of my awkward, half-falling over punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a deafening beeping started to screech. I shouted, closing my eyes covering my ears, half expecting them to start bleeding through my fingers. I heard you mutter about classes as you shut off the alarm, and when I opened my eyes again, you were reaching for me. I had no time to react and in a second, I was wrapped in your fingers being lifted hundred of feet at my size to your face level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! What are you gonna do with me? Why did you do this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shouted at first, but became quieter and quieter as I stared at your enormous face directly in front of me.

That same amused grin was still on my face. I just couldn't get over how tiny and helpless and meager you were. Taking just a moment, I playfully tossed you up into the air a little and caught you in my hand a couple times. But I couldn't linger for long. As you recovered from your aerial adventure, I replied to your questions. \"Simply put, you're my new friend, little buddy. We're gonna have all kinds of fun together, you'n'me! But I gotta skedaddle before I'm caught here, so let's save the big talk for later.\" I chuckled again. \"Heh, no pun intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hand brought you close to my chest, where my free fingers pulled out the lip of the shirt pocket so I could carefully slip you in. The little pocket was the size of a room to you, and the space compacted briefly as I ever so gently patted the pocket with my hand. \"There we are. Now you just stay in there for a bit 'til I get out of here and back to Birch Building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the containment of my miniaturized man, I quickly reset all the panels to where they'd been before I came in. The soft hum of the machinery faded away as I flicked switches and pressed buttons. As I worked, I hummed a catchy little tune and thought that maybe I might have to come back here again at some point. Later, though; there's enough in my pocket to keep my free time busy for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing my cap, I scooted out the door just in time to avoid a couple teachers rounding the corner. In their argumentative conversation, they wouldn't have noticed me even if I hadn't ducked into the bathroom. Grinning at how easy this was, I took the opportunity to relieve my bladder before heading out. After that, it was smooth sailing all the way to the apartment buildings on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Jeff? Mark? You guys here?\" I called out as I closed and locked the door behind me. No response; perfect. They shared one bedroom while I had the other, which gave me just the privacy I was wanting. Quickly, I beelined towards my room and locked the door, hanging my cap on a peg on the wall. I kicked off my shoes and climbed onto the bed, leaning back against the headboard. Looking down at my chest, I gently reached in, grabbed your little figure, and set you on the sloped surface of my chest. \"Now we're home with a lot more privacy. Did you enjoy the ride, little fella?\"</span></div></div>",

Finally it stopped, and I took a deep breath, looking up as you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend? Man, if this is how you make friends... well, I see why you'd need to do it this way...\" I mumbled, worried what sort of fun you had in mind. But before I could let out any more snark I was slipping off your hand into a newly opened pocket. It was massive. The size of a room if I weren't tiny, and too steep to climb the sides of with anything resembling ease. Great. Really wish I'd done more pull-ups at the gym...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stated moving, I was tossed lightly side to side with each step, pressing on the pocket's sides to try to steady myself. The motion was making me a little sick. Really wished I could at least see where I was being taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't going to happen and my bumpy ride carried on. I laid down in the pocket and found it helped a bit. Made it more like a hammock. Easier to take the swinging. I heard you call for what could only be your roommates after the door of what I assumed was your apartment opened. Through another door, I felt you moving around, then saw your fingers reaching in the pocket for me. I didn't struggle. Wasn't much purpose in it. I wasn't exactly in some impenetrable fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was lifted out, I saw I was in what must be your room as I was set on your chest, looking up at you on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I certainly couldn't call it riding first class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJokes. I should be pissed. And I making jokes. Still, I laughed just a little, trying to remain stern as I remembered what you'd done to me. No matter how pleasant you seemed to be, this was unacceptable. And the sound of needing privacy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crossed my arms, but when I spoke, I wasn't shouting any more, more nervous and confused than angry at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ethan. We're alone. No sci-fi nerds to come bust you here. What are you planning? And why me?\" </span></div></div>",

We'll hang out, eat junk food, watch movies, fool around a bit, friend stuff... hrm, I guess you couldn't really handle a controller at that size, so two-player gaming's off the list.\" My eyes lit up a little. \"Ooh, and since I have mostly studio classes, you can come with me around campus most of the time. I might have to have Mark or Jeff keep you company every now and then, make Becca, but I'll try to be around as much as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lightly poked you in the chest again. \"Beyond fun, I don't actually have a plan really. Honestly, I didn't even think of this sort of thing until a few days ago. Some nerd blabs about a really fancy machine, and a rogue thought sparks the coolest idea I've ever had.\" My torso shook beneath you as I chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, uh, as for why you? To be honest, it was kinda random. No friends or enemies or distant family members or something like that. I've only met you once before, when I walked into that place you work at. Culder's? Golder's? Whatever it's called. I just needed someone, and you seemed pretty cool.\" I stroked my hand against my stubbled chin. \"And, well, I guess it wasn't entirely random. You looked dead-bored. Like you'd just watched a paint-drying marathon all night. I kinda figured you might like some excitement. And if this isn't exciting, I don't know what is. Plus, you don't have to work for pennies or worry about taxes or food money or any annoying things like that anymore, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing you, I rolled over towards my nightstand and set you on the wooden surface next to a few things: a partly open matchbox with some sort of soft fabric stuffed inside, an upended bottle cap, and a bell dangling on string from the table lamp. \"See? Made you a few things. A little bed you can sleep in sometimes, a dish for some food if I need to go out for just a bit, and a bell to get my attention with. I'm a bit of a light sleeper, so it should wake me up if you need something in the middle of the night.\" I shrugged. \"It's nothing fancy, but it'll do for when I'm sleeping or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways!\" I hopped up off the bed and stretched my arms. \"I could use a quick shower 'fore dinner, and you should probably take one since you just got off your, uh, last shift of work.\"I gently scooped you up in my hand, fingers cradled protectively around you as I lift you up to hold you near my chest. \"You could easily do in the sink, if I leave the drain just barely open. Or, if you don't feel like waiting until I'm done to get out of the sink, you could just shower with me?\"</span></div></div>",

It felt a little impressive. \"I mean, I heard about this thing they made, too. But I didn't think anyone would do this...or that it would actually work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were right. I was bored. So bored. That job was a ridiculously long exercise on staying awake with no stimulation whatsoever. A monkey could probably fill my position if the law allowed for it. Had to admit, 'you seemed pretty cool' was one of the better compliments I'd received lately. Wait, that was where I recognized you from! You were the guy at work I thought patted me on the back! Damn, if I had only thought to look for...some sci-fi junk I wouldn't have believed in just an hour back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was set on the nightstand, I looked at the set-up. I had to admit, it was a pretty alright deal for a guy my size. But I'd be lying if I didn't feel like a new pet being shown his cage and food bowl. Still, he went through the effort...he did seem to care at least a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was scooped up again, I listened to your offer, flushing red. You were so casual about showering together. I'd never really been into guys as far as I was concerned, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't paranoid about the sorts of shenanigans that showering with you could bring. But suppose I did opt for the sink and something went wrong. Or a roommate came busting in and found me. I imagined being pulled down the slightly-too-open drain, or being taken by a much less caring roommate for god knows what. I sat there in your palm, thinking. I could feel some of the warmth coming off your chest from where I was being held as I thought, weighing every option for a long minute or two and sighing when I came to my decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...considering everything, it might be better if I...join you.\" I practically had to push the words out, but in the end, I liked the odds of being naked off the bat and risking you than risking something going on in the sink alone or something else going wrong without you right there. \"That's my call...and my name's Jake, by the way. Never mentioned before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe introduction didn't really fit the flow of conversation, but damned if I was going to shower with someone who didn't even know my name.

I'd shake hands, but that'd be kind of hard to do now.\" Slowly, I started to walk towards the bathroom, still carefully holding you up by my chest in my hand. If you listened closely, you might have been able to hear the soft beating of my heart or the whooshing inflation and deflation of my lungs, just inches away from your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom, like the rest of the apartment, was quite nice for the generally affordable fee that the administration charged. A countertop sink took up part of one wall, while the toilet and shower stall - one of those standing ones where the glass was clear but just gave you blurry images of whoever was inside - stood on the other side of the room. There was also a little table with piles of towels and general cleaning supplies, almost crammed into the space between the counter and the wall. It's onto the counter that I carefully deposited you, the cool stone beneath you a striking counterpart from the soft warm sponginess of my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to myself again, I turned on the shower to let the water warm up a little. As the glass of the mirror and the stall began to fog up a little, I walked back over to you. Even at the incredible size difference, it was quite easy to tell how apprehensive you were. Setting aside my generally playful attitude for a moment, I crouched down to near eye-level with the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about sharin' a shower, Jake. It's just natural body stuff, and there's nothing to be ashamed of about just being naked around someone else.\"  I scratched my head slightly. That was how I thought, probably a bit influenced by the live drawing sessions in class. After a while, you'd get used to platonicly seeing strangers naked... \"Plus it's just efficient and quick. I've shared a few showers with Mark or Jeff sometimes when time's short in the morning.\" Smiling a little, I raised my hand. \"I solemnly pledge to not abuse your man-body in the steamy confines of a college shower-stall. Scout's honor.\" I decided not to say that I'd never actually been a Boy Scout. Dropping back to my usual tone, I couldn't help but add, joking, \"Abstinence till the third date and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, I stood back up my full height, towering once more above your shrunken form on the countertop. My hands grabbed at the collar of my shirt and heaved it over my head, off my torso, and onto the floor to be tidied up later. The air had developed an almost muggy heat from the shower, and I sighed in some relief as my bare skin felt open air. I was not particularly muscular, but there were hints of definition, the slight cut of muscle here and there. It's accented by the small amounts of brown chest hair, including a definitive treasure trail that led down into my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft pop as I undid the button, then a string of metallic clinks as the fly was unzipped. With a short flourish, my pants dropped down, revealing a pair of light blue boxer briefs. There's a definitive bulge in the front, though not so big as be a sign of either arousal or a big package. Like my arms, my legs carried vague hints of toning, masked beneath the light fuzz of a guy's body hair. Quickly stepping out of my pants, I tugged off my socks and tossed all of it towards the shirt to add to the pile of laundry to clean up later. Leaving only one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill humming as casually as ever, I pulled down my underwear, bending over to step out of the boxer briefs and then toss them over to the laundry. As I stood up, all was laid bare. If you were looking, you'd see that, like the rest of me, my groin was generally average. A slightly small flaccid length, circumsized, dangled over a perhaps larger than normal ballsack. The whole affair was decorated with pubic hair, though most of it was short, implying a recent trimming had taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not you'd looked, I stepped up to the counter and set my hand down for you to climb onto when you were ready. The surface was just above waist height, providing a general sense of modesty. \"Ready when you are, Jake.\"</span></div></div>",

But before I could dwell on it, we were moving again, off to the bathroom. Your rhythmic breathing was a little relaxing, but I was still tense. I wasn't looking forward to this. And as you set me on the counter, I started to get the feeling you recognized it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour explanation was a good one. It was a pretty normal thing. Athletes showered together, and if it was something you did often, what reason was there for me to worry? I felt a little better about it all even with the joking laugh on the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut regardless of what you said, it was hard to keep calm when you literally fit in the palm of someone's hand and you'd just volunteered to get naked and shower with them. And when you started to strip, I only got more nervous. I watched with a sense of amazement. At my size, I could see much greater detail, and a human body seemed a lot more...impressive at the scale of a mountain. Slight definitions were deep enough they looked like they'd be slides at the right angle and even slight hairs seemed more noticeable when they'd come up to your knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your pants came off, I realized I was staring, every bit as fascinated as I was horrified by what was to come, and when you pulled off you boxers...well, the eye has a tendency to follow motion. What was probably fairly average seemed incredibly massive when it was several times your height and as many times wide. But as I stared, and you asked if I was ready, I realized I'd been too entranced to actually strip myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at myself, suddenly all too aware my clothes seemed to have shrunk with me and sighed. I pulled off my shirt, revealing a build similar to your own on a micro scale. Rather average with the hint of muscle that once was but slowed and started to hide when I picked up that job and stopped being able to go to the gym as often. Light patches of hair peppered my chest, all trailing down toward my jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unhooked those, letting them drop around my legs and stepping out of them. Underneath were a pair of red boxers and poking out of them were two fairly hairy legs that matched the tone of the upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooking my thumbs on my boxers, I took a deep breath and pulled them off, doing my best to cover myself in the process. At normal size, if one were to happen across this sight, they'd notice I was circumcised, length a bit more than average both flaccid and otherwise, and a wider girth to match. Though it would seem far less impressive now than it once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at you, wondering how we were going to do this. \"I'm ready...\"</span></div></div>",

Like most any man, curiosity draws my eye south for the brief glimpse before you cover yourself with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs gently as before, my fingers wrap around you and bring you into my hand, where you're held in an open palm near my chest as I walk. Even though I had just done this only a matter of minutes ago, everything felt different thanks to the complete lack of any clothes at all. Instead of holding my hand right up against my chest, it hovered about an inch or so away so as not to make you feel too uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to bear with me; this is the first time I've showered with anyone on this sort of scale...\" I said as I climbed into the stall and closed the door behind me. The air inside was like a sauna, and especially muggy to you at your size. The same amount of water in the steamy air needed to give my skin a slick coat of wet mist was enough to drench your whole body; the particles in the air that cling to you were, at your inch-tall height, the size of large raindrops. Bending down, I carefully set you on the floor of the stall, sleek stainless steel that' been warmed by the shower's constant stream. You were not in the direct line of fire from the showerhead far above - as you were, it would have been like a waterfall crashing down on you - but between the rebounding spray off the floor and the moisture in the air that clings to you in larger and larger beads, there's enough water to constantly run down and off your body as if you were in a regular shower at normal height. For cleaning material, I broke off a tiny piece of soap, about the size of a half-used bar to you, and handed it down to you. \"Just toss it at the drain when you're done with it; it's not much, so there's not really a reason to hang onto it.\" Then I poured out a small puddle of body wash and another of shampoo/conditioner for you. \"That should do for you,\" I said with that same reassuring smile as before. I placed a washcloth over the drain in the event of anything moving you towards it, but, I reasoned as I stood back up, you would be fine. My feet at the moment were on either side of you, so if you were to look up, it would have been like staring up at an office building from the front door, except that the office building was accented with a dangling manhood whose winking eye would seem to return your gaze in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that you could - and would prefer to - take care of yourself for the rest, I started scrubbing myself down with the soap. As I scrubbed, I began humming, as casual about showering with you as I had been about holding you in my hands or talking to you while you sat on my chest. After each full-body scrub of soap or body wash, I stepped into the direct stream and let the force of the nozzle's spray push the foam and dirt off of me and towards the drain, where the water would seep through the fabric and the rest would stick to the fabric that would get washed in the laundry anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then, I looked down at you, checking on you. If you were looking at me, I would smile at you again, hoping that this wasn't too terribly awkward for you.</span></div></div>",

At least he was trying to be reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we entered the shower, the heat hit me like a wall. I'd been in saunas before, and it was an equivalent experience. Within a few seconds, my entire body was soaked. Breathing became a little difficult, but I adjusted quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you set me down, morbid curiosity got the best of me and I found it difficult not to take another look at what was hanging there, and what would be hanging over me the entire time we did this. But I tried to be discrete. Where I was, I wasn't being crushed by a waterfall, but there was more than enough water to do what I needed to. I took the sliver of soap graciously, watching you pour the puddles of shampoo and bodywash. This wasn't a terrible set-up. Carefully holding the soap so I didn't lose it to the slight current of water at my feet, I took a bit of shampoo and dealt with that first, scrubbing my head fairly thoroughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I started to rub myself down with the soap, being fairly thorough. Every now and again, I kept finding my eye drawn upward where I'd inevitably end up looking at your junk, mostly because of the angle I had looking, and partly because it seemed to demand attention, almost returning my stare when I occasionally glanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to focus on what I was doing, finishing with the soap and letting it go like you said and grabbing a scoop of bodywash, thoroughly rubbing myself clean with that. After that, I just sort of enjoyed the warmth of the water, letting everything rinse off and waiting until you'd finished your own business. Occasionally, splashes of water running off of you would drop near me here or there, but nothing nearly as bad as I might have expected. All in all, this wasn't as terrible as I'd built it up to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up, I looked past the obvious to see how you were coming along, making eye contact briefly and realizing what it would look like, flushing red and immediately looking back to my own level. Totally not awkward.</span></div></div>",

I was turned towards you, partly to keep an eye on you on occasion and partly to give you the chance to look if you were so inclined. As it turned out, your curiosity understandably did get the better of you more than a few times. It was only natural to be curious about what other guys were packing, and at your size, everything about me was monumental and landscape-like. Not at all shy, I let you look as you pleased as we showered, scrubbing ourselves with soap and wash and shampoo and rinsing off in the steamy moisture of the sealed space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, near the end, our eyes met, and you quickly glanced away. Even so far down on the shower floor, it was easy to see that your face had turned bright red, and you were doing your very best to look anywhere else. I couldn't help but be a little amused about your shyness, but I held back a chuckle that might otherwise have seemed derisive or tormenting. Instead, I merely finished rinsing the last of the shampoo from my hair and gave myself a quick once over to wash away remaining suds or soapy substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tap squeaked slightly as I turned it to off, and the loud hiss of the nozzle faded to an end as the water dropped, then stopped all together. As drops pooled and splashed from the hanging head, I kneeled down to gently scoop you up in a motion that was beginning to get more practiced and experienced. As before, I held you near but not against my chest, not wanting to make our shared nudity any more uncomfortable for you. Moving quickly to the sink, I grabbed a couple of tissues from the box. The first I laid out on the counter, near where you'd left your clothes, like a rug; then I set you down on it and gave you the second to dry yourself off with. It wasn't perfect, but, I reasoned to myself, it would likely be more comfortable than a towel, whose individual threads would have each felt like a thick robe rubbing against your little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as reassuringly as before, I paced back over to the shower stall and the bath mat before I dripped too much water on the floor. There I grabbed a clean towel from the rack and started to dry myself off, scrubbing vigorously to remove as much moisture as possible from my bare body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were both dry and you'd redressed for some sense of modesty, I carried you back to my room. There you were set on the bed while I grabbed some underwear and my pajamas - a pair of soft grey shorts and a simple white shirt - to put on. Coming over, I sat down on the bed next to you and carefully picked you up. As I laid back, I set you on my chest again and said, \"I'll see if I can't shrink you some clothes in a couple days so you have more than just the one outfit.\" Hopefully, that might make you feel a little more comfortable about your new lot in life. \"I'd do it tomorrow, but the lab's closed for a bit of construction and repair. So we'll do it on Saturday. I've got some clothes I can spare from my closet here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind and beneath you, my stomach grumbled. I laughed a little sheepishly and gently patted it as I looked at you. \"Sorry, haven't had anything to eat since breakfast. Didn't really have time for lunch. I bet you're probably hungry, right? What are you in the mood for? Chinese, pizza, or hot dogs?\"</span></div></div>",

I managed not to look where my eyes had been drawn several times now while it approached, and was grateful when I was quickly lifted above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSet on the sink, I took up one of the offered tissues, quickly setting about drying myself off, starting with my hair, a mess that would settle itself a bit as it dried,and working my way down. The faux-towels didn't tear and pull apart like they would at full size, though they did become useless once they got wet. I managed to finish with just one, standing on the other as I redressed, not thinking about the possible on-looker behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finished, it was back off to your room, sitting on the bed, waiting for you to get dressed. I might admit a single glance over. Purely that same curiosity that kept drawing my attention earlier. An air of nervousness about what might come in the future, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, I pushed the thought from my head as you came over, sitting on your chest as I had earlier, a bit less uncomfortable. \"I'd certainly be glad to have more clothes options soon. These are gonna smell rank in a day or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'd manage for now. We were both dudes. We could deal with a little dude smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your stomach rumbled, I lost my balance a little, almost falling back as my seat shook, but catching myself before I tumbled over. I looked up at you. \"Don't know. I'm not-\" Before I could finish, my own stomach growled. It seemed to be contagious, and I remembered I hadn't had a break at work today. Had to work through it because of the incompetent guy I was working with. \"No...no, I am hungry. But not picky. Let's say...pizza. That sounds fine. Whatever toppings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChinese seemed like a sticky mess at this size, and the work cutting a hot dog to a size I could eat and making a properly tiny bun, not to mention figuring out ketchup, seemed like too much work for a hot dog. I practically had to shoot it down on principal. Pizza could be messy. And it might also be a bit of a hassle...but it sounded fantastic right now for some reason, and that balanced it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pizza. Let's do that.\" I nodded, confirming my choice as much to myself as to you.</span></div></div>",

You seemed very grateful about the offer to go out of my way to get you more than just the clothes you were wearing. Of course, I'd still have to figure out how to wash clothes that fit someone who was smaller than a toothpick. Maybe a toothbrush and some soap in a sink. All this work and planning amazed me. As much as I'd done in advance, I still had to think on my toes with a couple of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood, for example. Like you, I realized after I spoke how much of a hassle hot dogs would have been. I was going to have to think in portions. Most days, you'd just be eating small chunks of whatever I had with me. But I'd have to try thinking outside the box. Left-overs would be helpful, as it'd be easy to heat up a little bit of food on a plate you could even sit on while you ate. Messy food would be a problem, too, at least until you got other changes of clothes. I could just imagine a soy sauce stain settling in until Sunday, growing thick and nasty and smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I got up to start the pizza, I decided to just sit there for a moment and relax. I'd had a non-stop trip of questions and actions and thoughts since I'd stepped into the science building, and now there was just a moment of peace. We just sat there, me resting back against the headboard and you seated on the slowly rising and falling field of my shirt-covered chest. I had to resist the urge to reach down and rub a finger over you like you were a little hamster or something. As little as you were, you were still a person, and I intended to respect you, as ironic as that was coming from the person who had shrunk you to an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I slowly sat up, collecting you in my hand again as I got up off the bed with a slight grunt. Then we were off to the kitchen, out of the greater privacy of the bedroom and the bathroom and into the more public area of the apartment. You're set down on the cool stone countertop, next to a plate of apples the size of boulders. From the fridge, I spoke over my shoulder. \"Well, we've got cheese and pepperoni and one meat lover's. I like pepperoni, so we'll do that one.\" Closing the door, I set the frozen, shrink-wrapped food down and turn the oven on to pre-heat. \"We've got about twenty-five, thirty minutes between the warm-up and the cooking time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nagging thought crossed my mind again. \"So, uh... I hope the shower thing wasn't too awkward. I mean, we're probably going to be doing that a lot...\" I shrugged a little. \"I dunno. I guess I just wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help make it easier.\"</span></div></div>",

Everything that now could. I was miniscule, the guy that did it admitted just shrinking me on a whim for kicks, and here I was, fresh out of a shower with him deciding on what to have for dinner. And it hadn't even been a day yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled a little, probably too quiet to notice. Did not expect to be sitting on a dude's chest when I started the day. Nor that I could be comfortable there, but here I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat up, I shook myself out of my daze, getting a look around the apartment as we moved, trying to get a feel for the layout. When you set me on the table I kept looking around, eyes falling on the apples. I was suddenly reminded of James and the Giant Peach. Apples were gonna be a little bit harder to eat now. Most things were, really... Oh well. No point dwelling on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you spoke, I looked up to listen. Pepperoni was fine. It's the essential pizza after all. Then the conversation shifted. You looked a little bothered as you asked about the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean, I'm not used to that sort of thing. With anyone, really. And other naked guys isn't something I'm exactly experienced with, let alone ones that tower over me like this...but I think it's something I can get used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded a little, as reassuringly as I could. It was true. Showering was a bit awkward...or maybe more than a bit. But if high school jocks across the world could shower with other dudes, I didn't see why I couldn't adjust to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for making it easier...well, you've been pretty damned accommodating as it is. Hard to ask much more. I have to say, you don't usually expect this kind of courtesy from a guy that shrink-kidnaps you. Or for him to be so...friendly, I guess. I should be mad at you. Should be livid. Should be yelling and screaming to change me back...but I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, smiling a little. \"It's weird.

It might not have been much for the moment, but it felt like the first step to you being more comfortable with everything. Obviously, it could be a long road ahead, but I was determined to do my best for your sake. I didn't expect you to just change, like a flip switched, but from my own experience, I knew it'd get easier with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was true. I had shrunk and kidnapped you. I did not regret that fact or its outcome... and yet... \"Well, I guess I just want to make things easy for you to adapt to. I did mean it before about wanting you as a friend. So I do what I can. To be honest, I'm kind of making most of this up as I go.\" I sighed and rubbed the stubble on my chin. \"It's tiring. But it's also pretty exciting. Having to think about things a whole different way because of my new buddy Jake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling wider, I leaned in, finger outstretched to poke you. It was a little rough, like a weak punch, but it was considerably gentler than my previous playful attempts, at least. Even now, after everything, I was still feeling that same giddy sensation of delight as I'd had way back in the science building when you were coming to on the teleporter pad. It was hard to believe that had barely been more than an hour ago. An hour, and you were starting to smile. Maybe, I thought hopefully, this wouldn't be as hard as I'd hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven chimed as it reached the pre-heat temperature. I got up from leaning against the kitchen counter to put the pizza in. As I did, the sounds of a key in a lock came down the short hall from the apartment door. I glanced over my shoulder at you as I set the time for the oven. I considered hiding you, but that was silly. You'd have to meet the roommates at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guy, bulky and huge, came lumbering in.He towered over you, obviously, but he had at least a head-height over me, too, probably something close to 6'9\" or 10\". In a simple faded blue t-shirt and cargo shorts, it wasn't hard to see that he was built like a grizzly bear, in terms of both muscle and body hair. The pale blond hair on top of his head was slowly growing out of a buzz cut, and his eyes were a dark brown bordering on nearly indistinguishable from the irises. His whole presence had a very formidable and solid air, as if brick walls might aspire to be him someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, who looked to be in his mid-twenties, tossed his bag to the couch as he looked at me. \"Good eefning, Ethan. Is Djeff still in class?\" The strong, blocky power of a Russian accent was distinct, although this one had been watered down some by time spent here in America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening, Mark. Uh... Jeff shouldn't be in class anymore, so he's either on his way here or chatting up some poor girl until she can find an escape hatch.\" We shared a chuckle; his baritone half-boom was much deeper and more pronounced than my softer inflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\" The word came out more as a command than a simple statement. He leaned forward over you, still unaware of your presence in the room. \"Any luck with your special prodject?\" His gaze flickered about, as if there were spies hiding behind the tacky kitchen wallpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, yes. If you'll look down by the apples there, that's Jake. Jake, meet Markov. We just call him Mark, or Scary Mark if he doesn't get his sleep and his study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joke passed by Markov's ears as he looked down, down, way down to you. His eyes widened, but he didn't quite jump or jolt in surprise. \"Bozhe moi...\" He leaned down, taking a seat on the stool behind him. \"Hallo. Djacob, da? I am Markov Polivanov, student of mathematics and physics.\"</span></div></div>",

But I wasn't about to argue with whatever was letting me keep my sanity in a decidedly insane situation.

Mark here was surprised, but not too confused, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe greeted me and I swallowed the lump in my throat and tried not to sound awkward. \"Hi, Mark. Yeah, name's Jacob. Jake if you like. Student of nothing now. But still, nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tempted to hold out a hand, but at this size, it was a rather pointless notion. Meeting people felt sort of awkward now. Awkward beyond the whole 'them towering hundreds of times my own height above me' part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he seemed pretty alright, though I was still a bit nervous being stared at. Now I just had to worry about the other roommate who was apparently on his way.</span></div></div>",

At nearly seven feet tall, he stood over just about everyone, albeit at a considerably smaller smaller size difference than between him and yourself. It wasn't hard to tell that you were quite nervous, and understandably so. Still, his eyes held a friendly twinkle, and his smile appeared neither forced nor false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ees good to meet hyou too, Djacob. I hope you will come to enjoy being here with Ethan and us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back around. \"We're making a frozen pizza for lunch. You want any?\" Mark considered for a moment, then answered affirmatively. As I went to get two plates and a smaller third for you, the big Russian smiled down at you again and curtly nodded before getting up. He lumbered off to the other bedroom, probably to put away his bag and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a big guy, but he's actually kind of a softie. Like a giant Russian teddy bear.\" I laughed a little at the imagery. \"He does a lot of studying and such, so you might not see too much of him out and about. Jeff's trying to push him to be more social, but it's kind of hard to order someone around when they weigh twice as much as you and can occupy a whole doorway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing around the counter, I glanced over at the TV. \"How about a movie to watch while we eat? Got the whole afternoon and evening off, so we can just lay about for now, kill some time.\" I pursed my lips, a contemplative expression cast on my face. \"Hrm... Maybe something classic or Whedon. Princess Bride's good. Or there's Serenity or the Avengers. What do you think? Or you can make a suggestion. We've got a decent selection here, so if you've got an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the oven beeped again. While you consider your options, I pulled the pizza out and used a cutter to slice it up into eight pieces. Half went on one big plate and half on the other. From one of my slices, I tore off a small end-piece with some pepperoni and set that aside on your little plate. One plate was set on the counter, from where I called Mark to let him know his lunch was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left you on the countertop for a moment as I set up a tray at the couch in the living room and set our plates down. Then I'm back in front of you. \"So... decided on a movie yet?\" I reached down to grab you, then stopped. My hand turned up and fingers spread, I place it down on the counter. If you wanted to, you could climb on instead of being grabbed into a fist.</span></div></div>",

That same weird vibe that kept me from being pissed or scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'll be an alright time, yeah.\" I answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI zoned a little as you two talked, then snapped out of it when he left and you started talking to me again. watching you pace, I thought about it. Food an a movie. If there were a lewd thought in your head like I'd originally theorized, at least you were jumping the hoops to get there. I chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess Bride. Damned good movie. And I hadn't seen it in quite a while. Anything Whedon was a perfectly fine choice to, though Serenity was a bit rushed in its pacing for my taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for deciding something else, it was the age old problem of \"You can have anything. What do you pick?\" Plenty of movies popped through my mind. The old Star Wars, some b-horror flicks, but nothing I could be certain was there and you'd like and I could call the top pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pondered all of this, you were getting the food ready. And when you asked, I had decided exactly nothing. So on a spur of the moment, I picked. \"Let's go with the Princess Bride. Been a while since I've seen it, and it never disappoints.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you set your hand down, I smiled. This was definitely a step up from being grabbed. Somewhat literally, I thought, as I stepped up onto your fingers, coming to rest in the middle of your palm, ready to go.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't a full fist, but it would be something to hold onto and help to keep you in my hand if you tumbled around. You seemed to appreciate it, which was good. I'd figured you might not like always getting grabbed and snatched up like something to just be towed around and shown off as an oddity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I carried you over to the couch, I smiled, partly to you and partly to myself. This had been harder than I thought it would be, but it seemed to be going more or less smoothly. At the very least, you were coming to terms and dealing with your new size. I was adjusting, too, learning how to be careful and gentle with everything I did, from the way I held you to how I teasingly poked you very gently to taking this whole thing in slow, careful steps rather than drop you headfirst into something entirely different than what you might be used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hand set down on the tray so you could step off next to or onto your plate, with the little chunk of pizza on it. \"Good choice. If you'd bad-mouthed Princess Bride, you'd be out of the apartment before you can say 'Inconceivable'.\" My tone was entirely joking; I had absolutely no intention to just kick you out or abandon you at your inch-tall size. Regardless of your opinion on arguably one of the greatest movies ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you settled, I put The Princess Bride into the DVD player and let it start up. The widescreen TV brightened to life as the mandatory FBI warnings passed by. It was a decently sized TV, but I imagined that to you, it might have felt like a theater screen, even from back by the couch. I skipped through the previews and menu, and the soft sounds of the retro baseball game filtered in as the movie began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scenes transitioned - the slow introduction of the book by \"S. Morgenstern\", Westley's departure and presumed death, and Buttercup's engagement to Prince Humperdinck - we ate our pizza in general silence, perforated only by a couple of laughs. 'No more rhymes, I mean it!' 'Anybody want a peanut?' ' GAHH!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Vizzini died from the iocane powder, we were done eating. I stood, my hand extended so you could climb on again. With the movie paused for a moment, I put the plates aside and slid the tray out of the way to fold up later. Then, sprawling out on the couch, I carefully set you down on my chest again and hit play to let the movie carry on.</span></div></div>",

It helped a little more than I might care to admit. When you set me down on the tray, I stepped down, trying to position myself next to the plate and finding that there was no comfortable way to  manage it and reach my food, I sucked it up and climbed onto the plate itself, sitting next to the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as big as three or four slices would have been to me at normal size and that was fine by me. I broke off a roughly slice-sized piece, looking back at you as you jokingly threatened me. \"Hey, if I bad-mouthed the Princess Bride, I'd expect to be thrown out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled a little, taking a bite of the pizza. It was a bit tall for my mouth, but I managed well enough, figuring out a good method after two or three bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the TV, whistling a little. It was like a personal movie theatre. Being so small certainly had a few perks. I watched as you set up the movie, then just watched the movie. Despite how long it had been, I remembered a fair portion of the lines, laughing along with the jokes between bites of pizza. Damned fine movie. Damned fine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere after making a mistake comparable to getting into a land war with Asia, I noticed my pizza was all but missing and popped the last piece into my mouth. Looking back, I saw you were finished too, and pausing the movie to deal with our plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed into your hand again, watching you push things aside and taking my seemingly appointed seat on your chest, leaning back somewhat and getting comfortable as you restarted the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plot carried on. Swamps filled with rodents of unusual size (which seemed even more ironic to me at this point), death machines, and everything else this fantastic movie had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somewhere around the time plans were being laid to storm the castle, I noticed my eyelids start to get heavy. But that was crazy. I never slept during movies. Or during the day, for that matter... It was inconceivable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...it had been a long day. And I'd just had quite a bit to eat. AND I was pretty tired on top of that...maybe...maybe just a few minutes. I'll just rest my eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustification made, I fell asleep on your chest, exhausted, and started to snore lightly after a few minutes, out cold.</span></div></div>",

All that mattered was a moment of two guys eating pizza and watching a classic movie. The powerful orchestrated soundtrack held aloft each moment, from Wesley's reunion with his dearly beloved to the terrors of the Fire Swamp to the comical reunion of Fezzik and Inigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the general excitement of this morning out of the way, things were settling down, and you seemed to be adjusting rather well. You'd taken to sitting on the plate rather easily, and you'd grown very used to being held and carried - especially with the newer, more voluntary version I'd started using. And you'd grown just as comfortable with being placed on my chest, the soft rise and fall a rhythmic motion beneath you and the pleasant body heat radiating up towards you. There was still a notable amount of uncertainty, hesitation, and occasional fear, but that was perfectly understandable. You were only an inch tall, after all, and it would be crazy to expect you to be totally comfortable within only a few hours of your sudden downsizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I thought as I glanced down at you during the Miracle Max scene, this was going quite nicely. Once I'd explained my good intentions - admittedly carried out with less than noble means - you came around to the concept pretty well. The shower had been a little awkward, more for you than for me, but that would slowly change over time. I could hardly begrudge you for your discomfort when I towered over you naked in a shower stall, sporting a flaccid length several times bigger than you. And you did seem like you were interested in at least trying to get used to it. Everything afterwards, up to this moment, had gone fairly well, and I couldn't help but feel a little satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during the siege on Humperdinck's castle, I noticed you'd fallen asleep. You lay there on my shirt, lightly snoring as you dozed on. Well, it has been a rather long and exciting day so far, I mused to myself. Maybe a nap's a good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered just napping here on the couch. I wouldn't need to move you, and I'm already stretched out. But Jeff could come back at any moment, and I'd prefer the both of us to be conscious the first time he sees you. So, carefully and slowly, I very delicately slip you onto my hand. My steps to my bedroom - our bedroom now, I think - are just as slow and methodical, paced to keep from waking you from your peaceful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI locked my bedroom door again and set you down for a moment, enough time to pull off my shirt and pants. The boxers I left on for now; I'd avoid my typical naked sleeping until you were a little more comfortable around me. Picking you up again, I climbed onto the bed and sprawled out on my back. Down you went onto my bare chest, where you'd be safe - I was a generally stationary sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments, I joined you in sleep, dozing off in the last days of summer's oppressive heat. My mind wandered, traipsing across dreams and imagination to distant lands. Rather unfortunately, a familiar wet dream of one of my professors resurfaced. When you awoke, it'd be on my bare chest, myself still asleep and the front of my boxers lightly tented.</span></div></div>",

It was such a deep sleep I didn't even dream. Or at least wouldn't remember if I had when I woke up. I didn't notice or react at all when I was scooped up and carried to your room. I was a fairly agreeable passenger. I didn't wake when you undressed, when you lay down, or when I was set on your now bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, when I finally woke up, I came to a few realizations. The first, we were no longer in the living room. Looking around dazedly, I realized we were back in your room. The next, there was no longer a shirt underneath me. Looking down, I found that I was now lying on your bare chest. At first, this was a little alarming, but I quickly adjusted. It was warmer, fairly soft. Not so bad, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final revelation came a little later as I sat up, decidedly staying awake at least for now. I looked forward, and found that you weren't wearing pants either. And you were clearly having a pleasant dream. I looked at the bulge in your boxers. It was like a giant tent at this size, though not one I was going to explore the inside of any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up toward your face, I saw you were still sound asleep. Hadn't even thought about explaining staring at your crotch if you'd been awake. I was glad you hadn't been awake for that. Turning back around, I laid down where I was before, staring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless you were the sort of person to roll in your sleep, which was unlikely considering I was still here and who knows when we came back to the room, or if you were the sort to let your hands wander in your sleep, say to somewhere that was begging attention right now, I didn't see any threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that they were really likely scenarios or that you were very threatening, but at this size, every threat had to be evaluated. I was learning that one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed contently, crossing my arms behind my head and letting my guard down cautiously.</span></div></div>",

A soft smile had spread across my face, though I was still sleeping quite soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, I did wake up, not too long after you'd settled back down. My body shifted a little, the plain of flesh and hair moving underneath you where you were relaxing. Half-awake, my foggy mind directed itself to the most obvious thing, and one of my hands slipped downwards. There it cupped over the bulging mass and squeezed, pulling the fabric tighter - which only served to make the skin-tight underwear define every part of the erection within, a damp spot forming at the tip of the lengthy bulge. From around and under you, a deep, grumbling moan of satisfaction echoes and thunders, my lust-filled mind distracted to anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heavy-lidded eyes fluttered down, and then I saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, it all came back to me. My hand flew off my crotch, and my face burned bright red in the first true blush I'd had. To be casually naked around someone was one thing; to start pleasuring yourself in front of them was a very different and much more personal thing. My gaze flicked around; I couldn't decide where to look, but I was having a hard time glancing at either you or the straining tent in my boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to recover from this incredibly awkward situation, I began to focus on the most ugly and unpleasant things I could imagine, my breath slowing to a calm rhythm. Grandmas in underwear. My eyes flicked down to you. Long toenails. What were you thinking, I wondered? Splinters in sensitive areas. Were you mad, or bothered, or something even worse? Miley Cyrus VMA performance. It was hard to tell what you were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" I stammered, then coughed and cleared my throat. \"I'm sorry about that. I was kind of half-awake and just... yeah...\" God, I was so embarrassed I couldn't even finish my sentence. This simple action could have wrecked all the friendliness and careful consideration and adapting I'd done up to now, and I hadn't even meant to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really, really sorry. I promise I wouldn't have done that if I'd remembered you were there...\" Not that that really said anything, but I was far too flustered to come up with anything reasonably better.</span></div></div>",

But finally, I managed to turn around, flushing red and trying not to think about what was going on behind me, looking up toward your face as you moaned, feeling it echo through your chest below me. \"Yo, Ethan! Not the time for this, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't think my miniscule voice was going to wake you up. And it really seemed like it wasn't going to. But then your eyes fell on me, clearly still half-asleep, and you seemed to realize exactly what you were doing, jerking your hand away for lack of a better term and blushing a deeper red than I think even I'd blushed today. It was weird to see you embarrassed after how confident about everything you'd been today, but this was definitely a bit different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes darted every which way, suddenly horribly interested in everything in the room that wasn't on your chest or a bit further down. Finally, you spoke up, stumbling over excuses. It was almost a little funny to watch, despite the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it's cool. I understand.\" God knows he wasn't the first guy in the world to wake up and tend to the old flagpole. And I wasn't exactly the easiest guy in the world to notice right now. \"I'm sure it wasn't on purpose or anything. Honest mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a slightly nervous smile, glad you came around when you did, but trying to be reassuring that it was alright.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today had been a hell of a day, and it wasn't exactly showing signs of slowing down just yet... Still, if I'm being honest, at this point what happened just now was just another leg on this bizarre adventure. It was taking some effort, but I could roll with it and move on. \"Apology accepted.\" I offered with a shrug and similarly slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you sat up slowly, I worked my way off the side of your chest and down onto the bed itself, using your hand for help as you held it out and making it to the mattress with only a little difficulty. I watched you stand and dress yourself for a moment before turning away, figuring that might be a little weird...yeah, after all this, that was what was weird. Clearly. I chuckled to myself as you offered a hand and I climbed aboard. When you spoke, I looked up, open for either suggestion. I'd have to meet everyone eventually anyway, but I wasn't opposed to just chilling while you got some work done. But before I voiced this opinion, a surfer-y sort of voice that decidedly couldn't be Mark called for Ethan. That must be Jeff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so. Sounds like a fun enough guy.\" I steadied myself in your hand as you walked, making sure I was good before relaxing a bit. When Markov waved, I waved back instinctively, though he seemed too focused on his work to really notice. All the same, I didn't really want to distract him if that were even possible. He didn't seem the type to take well to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we were in the kitchen, and before me stood Jeff. His image matched his voice pretty much perfectly. I'd bet on blonde, but otherwise the picture in my head was pretty spot-on. And the beer in his hand told me he was probably a bit more of a partier than Mark over there. When he waved, I waved back, offering a smile. \"Nice to meet you too... Glad to see everyone here's pretty friendly. Not that I guess I expected otherwise, but hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I was honestly really glad they apparently knew about this idea, and my... stature beforehand. Would've sucked to have to explain it to both of them. Instead, if was just 'oh, tiny dude. Cool.' and everyone was just sort of cool with it. Not that I was completely adjusted to the concept of being so small myself, but I didn't have it in me right now to sit through an explanation several more times.</span></div></div>",

We don't mind having another roommate, and it's an interesting experience, you can't deny that.\" The bottle clinked as he drummed his fingernails against it. \"'Sides, I bunked with a Texan gun nut in freshman year. Now THAT guy had a lot of crazy stories. Like this one time, he took a remote control car and a homemade flamethrower and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we agreed you weren't going to tell that story again,\" I cut in, rolling my eyes as I stood there with you in hand. I let you step off onto the counter besides us, giving you a bit more height in the conversation. \"Jeff's a physical therapy major and in early training for the armed forces, so he's often out and about or doing something with exercise or stretching.\" it was quite clear that he worked out a lot; the tight shirt he was wearing defined the bulk of his musculature, and his hairy arms and legs were thick. Though he wasn't as tall as Markov, he could have easily passed for a light bodybuilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not easy to look this good,\" Jeff jokes, playfully flexing his arm and torso muscles. \"Just wish I could get either of you two to do some workouts with me. Markov's naturally built like a bear, and you get worn out just running around for a bit. And now you bring another guy in, and I don't think this one's about to use gym equipment any time soon.\" He took another drink from his bottle and gave a rather dramatic sigh. \"What am I gonna do with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, snapping his fingers, he looked to me. \"Oh, uh, by the way, Ethan, I was gonna hit the sauna before it closes and destress. I figured you'd probably say no, but I'll ask anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Thanks, but no thanks. I've got some work to do, and I want to stick around the apartment for the most part this weekend. You know, help Jake get settled and everything.\" I smiled down at you. You were handling things pretty well, but I still wanted to be around to help with adjusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe he wants to come, then. There's not a lot people at the gym on Fridays, and the sauna's steamy enough that anyone else in there wouldn't notice him if he stayed close.\" Now he looked down at you on the counter, a friendly smile on his face. \"How about it? I bet you could do with a bit of destressing after all this weirdness, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood on the sidelines and waited for your response. Inch tall or not, you were still a person, so I left this choice to you. Did you want to hang around the apartment or get out for a bit?</span></div></div>",

I wanted to hear exactly what the insane Texan did with his r/c car and flamethrower, but I guess there might have been some legal implications to knowing. Not that I was going to be questioned about anything at this size, even if there was any way to know I knew anything about any alleged flamethrowing... I need to stop rambling thoughts like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you lowered your hand to the counter, I happily stepped off, nodding along as you told me about Jeff. Sounded like he was the closest thing to a jock your apartment had. Not that that was saying much with the ever-studious Markov, and you who seemed to have...smaller interests. I chuckled as he flexed, then as he described his predicament with you two. \"I don't know. I think I could bench a solid... ounce? Maybe two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, even that light a weight would probably still be too much for me at this size, but it sounded good and I didn't expect to be called out on it, so damn the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I heard Jeff mention a sauna, I perked up a little, though it probably not noticeable with my stature. I'd been in a sauna a few times, during my occasional weeks of \"Let's start going to the gym, it'll be great!\" Inevitably, those plans would fall apart due to workloads or time or laziness, but my favorite part when I was going was probably sitting in the sauna and just letting the heat wash over me after a couple hours of lifting things, sweating out all the stress and effort of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the choice came down to me on what to do, I looked at Jeff, then at you. \"Actually...if it's okay, I wouldn't mind hitting a sauna. It is really relaxing, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI offered a smile as I asked. I didn't want to completely blow off your wanting to help me get comfortable here, but at the same time a sauna sounded really great right now. And I could use a little something to help me relax, even as calm as things were right now.</span></div></div>",

I certainly don't mind, and if it's something you enjoy and find relaxing, all the better.\"  I scratch the back of my head and add, \"Besides, there's the whole weekend ahead yet, so we've got plenty of time for other stuff later.\" Were you paying attention, you might notice the briefest glint of nervousness flash across my expression before I look up at Jeff. \"Just remember to be careful and keep him close. You know, make sure no one sees him or anything.\" Geez, I sounded like a worried mother on the first day of school.  Not that I didn't have reason to worry, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nods and goes to rinse out his bottle. \"Yeah,yeah. I'll keep an eye out for him or whatever. Go ahead and do your homework or something.\" I nod and give you a short wave. Then I'm off, back to my room, and you're left with Jeff.He sets his empty bottle down by the sink and smiles at you. \"Alright, then.\" He reaches down and picks you up of the countertop, pinching you around the waist between two thick fingertips. His grip is a little rough, but it's only his first time handling someone so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises you to face level and smiles down at you. His tight hold loosens a little as you're suspended in the air before a billboard-sized face. Jeff, like myself, takes a moment to just feel the sensation of holding someone. Your warm little body between his fingers, so tiny and alive, feels oddly pleasant to the touch. \"Alright, Jake. I don't really have any shirt pockets, so you're gonna have to go into my shorts pocket for the trip there and back. He looks at your tiny face and waits for a sign of approval. When you give it, he lowers you down and carefully deposits you into one of his cavernous khaki pockets. There's a decent amount of light from the opening far above, and the fabric isn't too uncomfortable. There's a considerable amount of heat from his leg, just on the other side of one of the fabric walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pocket compresses sideways as Jeff lightly pats his hand over it. \"And off we go...\" As he starts to walk, his leg falls into a sort of rhythm, rocking back and forth. It's not the most perfect carrying method, but it could be far, far worse.</span></div></div>",

I start to think this might not have been the best idea, but he adjusts his grip fairly quickly and it becomes more bearable. I just have to give him some time, account for the learning curve. Handling someone my size wasn't exactly something you had instincts for after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he told me where I'd be riding, I was a little disheartened. I hadn't really thought about transportation, and I wasn't overly crazy about riding in a pants pocket. But I didn't have much say in the matter now and it was something I should probably get used to. I steeled myself and offered a nod of approval. \"Alright. Ready to go when you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jeff deposited me in his pocket. I slipped into the dark fabric cave, stopping abruptly but not painfully at the bottom and adjusting to my surroundings. It was dark, warm and enclosed. Because of just how small I was, I had plenty of room to move, but the pocket was still fairly flat between the stiff outer leg of the shorts and Jeff's own leg. Speaking of his leg, I could feel the heat wafting off of him through the thin fabric of the pocket. Add a little steam and this could be a functional sauna on its own. Okay, maybe not that bad, but make no mistake. It was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff gave the pocket a pat, pressing me into his leg with each contact, and then we were off. I never really considered how much a pocket might swing inside someone's shorts while they walked. I'd typically always worn long pants that didn't move as much. But shorts hung looser and allowed more movement. The pocket swayed forward and back, left and right, knocking me against Jeff's leg with every other step. It wasn't an unbearable rocking, but it did make getting comfortable difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, we'd be there soon, right? How far could it be?</span></div></div>",

Jeff's pace is at least consistent; the back-and-forth bumping becomes almost rhythmic, like a sit in a really, really big rocking chair. Even the simplest motions can become like amusement park rides at your new size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud woosh of a door and the familiar chill of air conditioning are the clues you'd need to figure out the walk's just about over. Jeff's voice is muffled from above, but you might just be able to hear little bits of the conversations he has with the person at the front desk, and with a coach down the hallway to the locker room. For a brief moment, it feels like the pocket is collapsing in, but it ends up just being Jeff resting a hand over you, probably checking to see if you're doing okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what feels like a year, the guy's enormous fingers slide in overhead, darkening your little space. His grip is still a bit rough, but not painfully so at least. The sudden shift to light may be harsh on your eyes at first, but soon enough you can adjust enough to see the seemingly cavernous locker room around you. Jeff's picked a spot between rows of lockers, where the last of the lingering gym rats are unlikely to find you both. Above, the giant face gives you an encouraging smile, and you're placed down on the warm, plastic-coated bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a minute or two to consider your surroundings as Jeff sorts his belongings into a free locker. It's not a particularly exciting room - a usual mixture of soft blues and light greys and whites - but the imagination can wander to the thought of dozens of giants crowded in here, each the size of a small building. Muscles bigger than your body, especially with the usual gym-going crowds of jocks and bodybuilders. The lingering odors of sweat and testosterone are heavy even now, especially to your size-refined senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shifting of fabric draws your attention back to Jeff, who had just taken off his shirt. He'd said before he liked to exercise regularly, but now it's very clear he's in great shape, with really well-built abs and strong pecs that'd put most folks to shame. The dude must be a bit vain, too; he's got no hair on his chest, the only hair is a little bit of a treasure trail, barely more than a hint of short brown hair, above his waistband. The jock sighs and stretches out, his muscle flexing in a way that would make just about anyone watching envious, or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glances down at you and looks a bit surprised. \"You're not getting ready? I don't think you'll want to take your clothes into the hotbox - it's a Finnish sauna, so it's very hot and I'm guessing you'd rather not have your pants steamed onto you.\" His smile curls on one side, a playful and harmless jest as he suggests, well...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a late summer day, shortly before 10 AM, a seemingly normal blue car drove by a seemingly normal California beach-side house and dropped off a seemingly normal package. All of it, from the Goodyear tires to the half-tattered shoes the driver wore to the cardboard build of the box, perforated by a few holes in the top, seemed perfectly normal to any passerby. In point of fact, however, none of it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not to say that the premise in and of itself was an oddity. Goodyear tires were as popular as ever in California, in the sense that air and free glasses of water at family restaurants were popular. Everybody used them, but nobody really thought too much about it. Shoes, worn by years of wear, had been popular since the invention of the shoe. After all, any working-class person might say, what's the point of a shoe if you throw it away when it gets just a little worn down? Preposterous, they'd say with a scoff as they drank their free glass of water. And boxes made of cardboard often ended up on doorsteps, left there by postal workers and delivery trucks and freight industries. Uncountable boxes had been left on uncountable doorsteps for so long that it seemed absolutely normal, even if the receiver was, in fact, not expecting to get anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe things that were not normal were the elements of this particular event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car, an old model with faded blue coat and rust slowly claiming victory, was not an average car. This particular vehicle had been used in no less than two bank heists and three hit-and-runs and had been restored and recolored several times to be generally inconspicuous. Cars, this one's driver believed, were things to be appreciated for a while, much like a free glass of water and unexpected deliveries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver himself was no less average. Like his vehicle, he had been through a lot of crime, mostly at the hands of the drug runners to which he found himself amiably connected. His appearance was generally professional: salt and pepper hair, dress pants and a white shirt, collar loosened. He carried an air of someone who had things to do and would rather not deal with anyone along the way to those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both car and driver moved on, the last abnormal element remained at the doorstep of the California beach-side house, the box that was delivered. It seemed normal: it was rectangular, brown, and it stayed motionless as it sat there, taped very lightly and poked with holes on top. What were truly abnormal were the contents: an unconscious adult man, normal in just about every aspect except for the fact that he was only two inches tall and completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the house itself, it wasn't a mansion, but it certainly wasn't a dump either. Located just by the beach, the three-story building was a combination of wood and stone design, with a back porch that extended into a little dock where a speedboat was bobbing up and down on the day's gentle rocking waves. A garage adorned the side of the house, with garage doors on both the front and back sides. The front was open, and anyone walking by would see the two trucks and the pair of jetskis inside. Parked at the front of the house was a third vehicle, a red pickup with clean chrome and a tribal tattoo design of a hawk painted across the hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inconspicuous delivery with its remarkable contents sat at the door for an hour or two before the people who lived in the house emerged. The first was a guy, looking in his late twenties, with shoulder-length blonde hair. He was dressed rather casually, in a pair of colorful striped boxers, a sleeveless white T-shirt, and yellow-tinted sunglasses. With the air of someone who had mastered a hangover, he hobbled to the mailbox, waving casually at a few of the neighbors and taking more than a moment to admire the fine curves of a passing jogger. He muttered to himself as he wandered back, giving the box only a cursory glance as he flipped through the flyers and magazines and coupons and such that came in the daily bundle and headed back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second, only minutes later, was another man, this one somewhere around the age of the first. His hair was neat black, short and with hints of spiky rebellion. He might have been younger, but the neat dress pants and shirt, diamond-patterned vest, and dark blue tie implied an air of more maturity and superiority. He shouted something incomprehensible back into the house before closing the front door. In his hurry, he didn't even notice the box; he briskly made his way to the pickup and was gone into the distance as quickly as he'd exited the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third, who stepped out to wave goodbye to the second, was a girl. If one were to guess, they might have pegged her around 24 or 25. Like the first, her hair was a vibrant blonde, but streaked with soft hints of a faded purple; her eyes were a soft green-blue that complimented the cool ensemble of her skimpy shirt and ripped denim shorts. As she bent down to look at the box curiously, a passerby might have noticed the pattern of scars on her left calf, healed over from whatever wound long ago but still distinct on her slightly tanned skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No writing or anything,\" she thoughtfully murmured to herself as she picked up the package. In her hands, it felt almost empty, but there was definitely something inside. The girl took it inside to the kitchen counter, where a pair of scissors made quick work of the tape binding. When she looked inside, she nearly jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, she peeked back in, realizing that it was not in fact a dead rat, but a living, breathing, tiny person. Cautiously, as if she expected him to leap up and bite her, she leaned closer, wondering just who this guy was and how he'd come to wind up on their doorstep smaller than a doll. He was slowly coming to, and so she watched as he awoke inside the box.</span></div></div>",

Where there should have been a seemingly normal ordinary brown ceiling, instead there was a hole, wall to wall up into god knows where. And watching me from within (or without) that hole was a giant girl. Blonde. Seemingly more curious than anything, although she looked almost scared. Like I was going to hurt her somehow. I wasn't sure how to react at first, just staring from my position laying on the floor of the room.

It wasn't every day one found a package with a two-inch-tall person inside on their front porch. As you spoke, she continued to stare, almost impossibly still like a deer in headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a blink, she snapped out of it. A thoughtful expression crossed her face as he looked around, leaning back a little to see further around the corners of the rooms around her. Some elaborate prank? An illusion cast by cameras or mirrors or something? No. No that would be just ridiculous. Then again, she thought to herself, there was a tiny man in a box on the kitchen counter. It was hard not to consider how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning her fingers through her hair, she looked back down at you. \"I, uh... I'm Lisa.\" Yes, that was it. Focus on something normal. Something that made sense. \"For how you got here...\" As she tried to think of what to say, an idle thought tickled her subconscious. Seconds later, it sprang to the surface of her mind. She jumped slightly, as if shocked by static electricity. \"Wait a sec, wait a sec. I-I remember, something like this going on. On the news, or the 'net, or...\" She drifted off again. \"Maybe the paper,\" she eventually said, more to herself than to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked out of sight, then paused, a thought crossing her mind. She returned and leaned over to peer into the box. \"I'm, uh... I'm gonna tilt the box onto its side so you can walk out, 'kay?\" Her shoulders visibly shifted, and then slowly the box started to tip over. As it turned, she kept her eyes on you all the while, a concerned expression on her face all the while. Very carefully, she let it settle, and then she was off to the other side of the kitchen, where an old pile of newspapers was stacked on a rolling end table. She muttered to herself, vague murmurs that even you would have had trouble hearing, as she flipped through the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, she victoriously yanked a sheet out and held it up to you with a smile. She was still visibly freaked out, but she was going to try and stay calm and positive if it killed her. Walking back over, she laid the paper out next to you and jabbed a finger at the walls of text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Uh, people showing up in boxes and alleys around the country only an inch or two tall. 'S'been all over the news for, like, a month, I think. Nobody's really sure what happened. Everybody's got a theory, o'course. Black ops stuff, mafia, aliens, poisons in the water. Some people were handed over to the feds, a couple were taken by people claiming to be government agents, and I think there was a story about a man who found his original family after a bunch of Missing Ads and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ran her fingers through the blonde and purple mass of her hair again. \"The people who are shrunk can't even explain what happened, since they don't remember anything. Not even before they were shrunk. Kinda like, uh, what's the term?\" She snapped her fingers as it came to her. \"Amnesia.\" She looked down at you again, her sea-green eyes intense as she looked at you. \"Do, uh, do you remember anything? A name, anything?</span></div></div>",

As she struggled to remember anything about my situation, I listened intently,. and as she tilted the box, I hurried to the edge, supporting myself to turn as the box did, now walking on what I'd considered a wall just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped out onto the table, watching Lisa hurry over to root through some papers. As she did, I got a better look at her. She seemed pretty, and from here, I could see her body matched. A nice figure, though one I tried not to stare at. No worse way to introduce yourself than staring at a girl's butt just because she'd turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited a little impatiently, and got excited when she found what she was looking for. I looked at the article in her hands as she explained what had been going on. Or at least, what people had been saying was going on. Someone or something was distributing these boxes of people, at least. I could attest to that with first-hand experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she explained the amnesia, I nodded. That would certainly explain a lot. Not terribly convenient, but it did explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do...I remember my name. It's Jake. Or I'm Jake, rather.\" I looked up at her. \"Nice to meet you, by the way, Lisa, strange as this may be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still freaking out inside, but I could at least be nice. She seemed pretty helpful so far, and I didn't feel like I was in any immediate danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other than that...not much. Woke up in that box confused and absolutely tiny with no other memories to speak of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. It was frustrating. If I could at least remember what did this, I could try to come up with some solution, or find someone who could. But as it was...I had Lisa. A nice, pretty girl, but one who knew as much as I did about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what happens now? I don't want to be a burden, but...I don't really have anywhere to go. Nor any means to. Don't think I'd make it out of your driveway if I even got outside.\"</span></div></div>",

She chewed absentmindedly on her thumb as she listened to you, most likely a nervous habit. All the symptoms were the same, so this was probably done by whoever, or whatever, had done this to the other victims. Now, as you posed it, the tricky question was what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to pace by the counter. Step, step, step, turn, step, step, step, turn... \"So, uh... I guess there's a few options. We call in the police, or the FBI or CIA or whatever, I dunno... They probably know more about what's going on than anyone else. Of course, nobody's really heard about them having any success, and you'd be in the feds' hands.\" She winced slightly at how literal that was. \"No pun intended, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could put out an ad or something. I mean, it's a one in a million shot at best, but you could get lucky.\" Again, her hand went through her hair. \"It'd have to be a bit subtle, so e don't draw attention, but it'd also have to be spread enough to get the attention of... well, whoever knew you.\" She bit her lips and muttered, more to herself than you, \"Jesus, listen to me. I've barely been up an hour and I'm talking about spy game shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned and stopped pacing, trying to think. Her idle fingers strummed against the granite counter. \"The only other option I can think of is you staying here, at least a day or two until we can get this figured out.\" The look on her face suggested that she wasn't so certain that was possible. \"You wouldn't need much space to sleep, and food's not a problem. But I guess you'd probably need one of us around for help getting around and stuff...\" Her words might have seemed like she was talking about a pet, but she was doing what she could with the situation as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, all your choice, 'course. I mean, you're still a person and all.\" She turned to look down at you, and her eyes lit up. It was as if she'd realized just how little you were wearing. That was to say, nothing at all. Her face flushing a little, she glanced around, then grabbed a soft red rag. From it, she tore a tiny piece, big enough to be a blanket at your size. The rag she set aside, and the little scrap she offered to you. \"You might want to, uh, cover up,\" she said, her eyes flickering down to motion to your bare body. \"So what's your call, Jake? The cops, the ad, or here?\"</span></div></div>",

I...I didn't like that idea. Maybe it was one too many sci-fi movies, maybe it was their history of secret science experiments, or maybe it was just the general secrecy of all those organizations. But something about it made that sound like a very bad plan. I'd more than likely end up dissected, or experimented on, or god knows what else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ad? Not a terrible idea? I couldn't really remember who it was who might be looking for me, or where they might be. Hell, I could be on the other side of the country from them now. Who knows how far these box-wielding psychos when when they delivered their packages? And she was right. We'd have to be stealthy. Missing Persons posters? Not so stealthy. We didn't have the means to get the word out and control the audience. Could end badly, and might loop back to that first option in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying here...well, Lisa certainly seemed nice enough. Accommodating, wasn't trying to do weird science to me. Roommates might be weird, but I hadn't met them, so I had no room to judge. If nothing else, it was a good place to crash while we considered the other options and tried to come up with a more solid plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering up...wait, what? I looked at her as she suggested it, then looked down, suddenly all too aware of the fact that my clothes apparently hadn't shrunk with me. I took the rag, swiftly tying it around my waist like a towel. \"Sorry about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath, trying to recover my modesty and looked at her. \"I think...it's best if I stay here. I don't trust the feds, and posters are just as likely to bring attention we don't want as they are to help. If you don't mind, I'd like to take advantage of your courtesy. I wouldn't be much of a hassle. And if you get sick of me, I guess you could always just throw me out.\" <i>Literally...</i> I laughed a little, but there was a nervous air to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She bit her thumb again and tried not to think about how you were kind of attractive. Thinking too much about such a thing was only going to make this even more awkward than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you mumbled, she took that as a sign it was okay to look your way again. The both of you were still pretty nervous and uncertain about any of this, but at least you seemed to be trusting her a little more. Noting your nervous laugh, she tried to smile a little, wanting to comfort you but not quite sure how to go about it. \"I wouldn't think of it. You seem like a pretty nice sort of guy. You're welcome to stay here until we get something figured out.\" Again, that uncertain expression. She had pretty much no idea what to do. But she'd heard your nervous laugh. As much trouble as she was having with the situation, it paled in comparison to your end of things. You were two inches tall and standing on a stranger's kitchen counter with nothing but a name and a piece of fabric for modesty. You needed help, and right now she was the only one you had that you could turn to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a guy with blonde hair, the one who had brought the mail inside earlier, came down the staircase. Thinking fast, Lisa stepped in front of you and casually leaned against the counter as if she just happened to be standing there. He swayed into the room, dressed now in a pair of ragged, ripped jeans, and a grey tank top that read \"Battle of the Boomers, 2006, Indigo Beach, Australia\" in cracked, faded maroon text. His eyes were a bit glossed over, but definitively grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', Leeser. S'goin' alright?\" The powerful Australian accent was so thick that if it had been a physical liquid, one might have mistaken it for concrete in the process of setting. As he stepped in, an equally powerful aroma of alcohol accompanied him. Yet, he seemed to contain it and redirect it casually, and it didn't really affect him beyond a mild wobble in his step and the glossy, shot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling sober, Bon? Or hitting the coffee pot for a pick-up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leeser, you can chat it up till we're both nackered, but I'm not gonna touch your nasty bean juice.\" He held up his arms and slowly enunciated each word. \"'Sides, I am... a picture... of sobriety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, because, uh, there's someone you need to meet. He's gonna be staying with us for a few days or so, just until he can figure out where he's headed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, he's off a dock without a bloody bed to kick in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I recall, so were you when you stumbled into that bar back in 2005 to complain about... what was it again? How American beers were 'full of piss and saltwater'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered that for a moment as he leaned against the fridge. \"Alright, I'll give you that one. So where's the bloke, then? Cab out front?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnn... not quite. You remember that thing in the news about people turning up only a couple inches tall? They show up in boxes on doorsteps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon's face visibly paled as he remembered the box he'd passed by outside. \"You-you don't mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stepped aside, no longer blocking you from sight on the countertop. Bon's eyes went from her to you, then back to her, then you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can just tell I'm gonna need a slab of Cooper's to make it through today...\"</span></div></div>",

How I didn't realize and try to cover myself before I wasn't sure, but I felt like a bit of an airhead of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I saw another guy walk into the room. I got a quick glance at him before Lisa threw herself in front of me, leaning back to hide my presence and suddenly filling my view with her fairly attractive rear. I say fairly attractive because anything more colorful would sound like I'm flirting and that would probably only stress her out more, but then I realize I'm rambling rationalizations for word choice in an inner monologue and just feel foolish, listening to the two talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speaks in a thick Australian accent. One I'd impersonated with friends on a number of occasions. And it sounds like he's had a bit to drink last night. Man after my own heart. God, a bottle of something would last forever at this si- This is not the time to be thinking about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa starts to explain I'll be staying with them and he questions it. They banter a bit, and then she points out the box and he seems to go quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-you don't mean...?\" I hear him say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lisa steps aside and I make eye contact with the astounded Aussie. Then he was staring at Lisa, then back at me. When he spoke, I wanted to laugh a little, but managed to hold it back, stepping forward as he steadied himself and greeted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-\" I stopped myself before I butchered the accent. Nasty habit to have, picking up accents when you hear them. Tends just to annoy the actual holders. \"Hi...Bon, was it? I'm Jake. Nice to meet you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words felt out of place still, and it was evident in my voice that I thought so. Situation straight out of a sci-fi movie and here we were exchanging pleasantries like we'd just met on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt horribly under-dressed and silly looking in my rag-skirt affair. What I wouldn't give for a respectable, but tiny, pair of pants right now.</span></div></div>",

The Aussie merely stood there with a blank expression, half-leaning on the fridge, as you introduced yourself. A half-smile was plastered across his face as he tried to keep a semblance of calm. \"Yeah... It's nice to meetcha, Jake, as it were.\" He laughed, the uncertainty and nervousness cracking through. He licked his lips, considering your words. \"A drink's probably 'bout due right now. Let's oblige. A bit o' liquid lunch'll make this easier to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to pull the fridge door open, but suddenly, Lisa's arm snapped out and pushed it closed again. There was a quiet and commanding look to her face, almost maternal and very judging. Bon recoiled slightly, mostly from surprise, then returned it with a glare of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wot? You gonna stop me from enjoyin' a tinnie what I paid for wif my own money?\" His voice was raising slowly and stepping thicker into his homeland accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down.\" Lisa was trying to remain collected, but her tone was slowly growing louder, too. \"It's not good for you to always drink away a problem because you don't want to deal with it. Dr. Tanner said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that bleedin' scrubber!\" he practically spit out. \"Why don't you just fookin' trust me, Leeser?!? I'm not an alko, and I've not gone fookin' mental!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa reeled back a step or two. The Aussie was seething angry, looking like he might lash out at any moment. Looking somewhat satisfied by his verbal victory, he grabbed two cold cans of beer from the fridge and wandered down the hall and out of sight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde stood there, half-frozen. Her gaze was fixated on the fridge, where Bon had been only a moment ago. Slowly, she let out a long, exasperated sigh, like a deflating tire. A hand ran through her hair. Then, as if waking up and remembering where she was, she looked over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh... I'm sorry about that. I shouldn't have... yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slinked over to the counter and slumped into a chair with a tired expression pasted across her face. \"I probably worry too much, but he's just-\" She caught herself. \"Sorry. Not something you want to know about, I guess. Anyways...\" She put on a smile as before, although a little more weary. \"It's no problem with me if you stay here. Bon won't mind; he's generally friendly and easygoing. Logan... well, he might complain, but he'll say yes to sheltering you a few days. I know Jenny will be okay with it, if she even gets back from out of state by the time we get this sorted out. Chris and Riley are out and about getting ready for a boat trip, but you'll probably meet them when they get back later today... Chris'll jump to say yes, and Riley would follow him off a cliff, so he's on board, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile and expression had become a little more reassured and lively. \"That's a full group of yes, then. I mean, there's still introductions, of course, but that's easy enough.\" Lisa leaned forward and down a little, her not-insignificant cleavage barely concealed by the low-cut top, to be a little closer. \"So what do you want to do? Board games? Over-the-top action flicks? Brunch?\"</span></div></div>",

He was right pissed, and she was only looking out from him, but he didn't seem to want to hear any of it. For a moment, I thought he was actually going to hit her, but he seemed to be fine with shouting, taking a few cold ones and walking off triumphant to down them somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa stood there, I frowned. And when she sighed, I felt like deflating along with the sound. She looked back at me and mumbled some sort of apology as she slid into a chair by the table, looking exhausted. I felt awful, and wanted to say something, but I couldn't quite find the right words before she went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to list her other roommates. It was a full house, it seemed. I was lucky I didn't need much room. But then again, if I were normal sized, I probably wouldn't be in this predicament. They sounded like a fairly colorful crew. I wasn't quite sure how this would go, but if nothing else, it seemed guaranteed to be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaned onto the table, I walked over to her, greeted by the view down her shirt at her ample bosom.

You were genuinely apologetic, believing that the little incident had been your fault. She smiled softly and carefully set her hand across her arm, pinky resting gently on your hand. \"You're a real gentleman, Jake. Whatever happened to you, you don't deserve it.\" Her smile warmed a little. \"But it's really not your fault. Bon's always been a bit of a drinker, but it's gotten worse lately.

Lisa really was just looking out for him, but it was hard to deal with someone dealing with a problem like that.

She couldn't do anything about the awkwardness or your size predicament, but breakfast food was something she knew very well. In a matter of seconds, she went from the fridge to the sink, the cabinets, the fridge again, and over to the window-side counter by the toaster and the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bacon's no hassle at all.\" She smiled over at you, considerably less flustered as she focused on cooking. Her hand was a blur as she stirred the egg yolk together. \"I'll just take off a little bit and heat it up for you in the microwave while the eggs are cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the scrambled eggs were well underway, the bread was in the toaster, and the bacon was in the microwave with the timer ready to go. Lisa hummed as she worked, a bit of a sway in her step. The sun from the window cast a healthy glow across her figure. Her shorts and light shirt didn't leave much to imagine and, as her shirt rode up a little, you might have noticed the edge of a tattoo on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, brunch was ready. Scrambled eggs, dry and fluffy and steam rising off them, piled on the plate, a couple slices of buttered toast, and a sweet Golden Delicious apple in chunks. Lisa set the ceramic plate on the counter and put aside little chunks of each of the foods on the rim of the plate, as well as the heated scrap of bacon. They were quite small, but they were still each about the size of a burger to you. You'd be able to reach your servings without having to be on the plate. No doubt that would have been awkward and unsettling, especially with her hand and fork scooping up food as big as you every few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dig in. It's no five star joint, but I pride myself on my food.\" She laughed a little. \"I dunno. I always wanted to be a chef, but it's just too much yelling and pressure and shortcuts. Everyone has their opinions and you get told how you should make the food.\" She stuck out her tongue before another bite of toast. \"Blegh. Luckily, everybody here's not so picky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe absentmindedly fiddled the fork around with her fingers. \"But that's probably boring for you to hear about. So, what do you want to do about today? I'm just going to take the day easy, a bit of walking and exercise, maybe do some drawing on the back deck. You could hang out with me if you want. Bon'll be dried out in a bit, so you could chill with him. Or if you had something else in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

Nice as she was, it was nice to stop and step back for a second. It was almost like watching a cooking show. Like she was on TV and not actually a giant hundreds of times my size. Though I was coming around to that easier than I would have thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard not to admire her curves as she worked. Her outfit wasn't the most concealing in the world, and the sun coming in the window cast her in a very pleasant light. Once, while she leaned over to grab something and her shirt rode up, I noticed a bit of a tattoo on her back, but couldn't quite make out what it was before she stood up, shirt hiding it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really seemed to know what she was doing, moving around the kitchen with a confidence I wouldn't have expected after our brief time this morning. She was the master of her kitchen, it seemed. And before I knew it, everything was ready and she was carrying a plate over to the table. At this size, it was like an enormous breakfast buffet with as much as I could eat and then more. But as she set aside little parts of everything for me, even that seemed like quite a bit. \"It smells fantastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the edge of the plate, I found a good position to reach everything and stay out of Lisa's way while she ate. I listened to her explain her cooking dream while I sampled everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hey. You wouldn't have to be picky to enjoy this. It's wonderful.\" I smiled up at her before taking another bite of egg, eating happily while she asked what I wanted to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Bon seemed alright, I guess. But he seems like a bit of a wild card. Between you and me, I'm not sure how I'd feel about being alone with him yet. If you don't mind, I'd much rather just hang with you for now. Like I said earlier, I'm up for whatever. I'm easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a bite, realizing what I'd just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, in a 'not sort of high maintenance' kind of way. Not...\" I trailed off, coughing and shifting the subject. \"Anyway, I couldn't help notice your tattoo for a second there. What is it, exactly?\"</span></div></div>",

Barton, work on your turning. Kerber, try to beat your record this time. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath as I propelled myself up into the air. A moment of suspension, and then gravity pulled me down into the chlorinated pool water below. Quickly I began to push myself forward, not even bothering to look at the other swimmer. \"You can't get to the finish if you're always looking at the sidelines.\" That's what Coach Carlson always said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fervor, I reached the other end and spun about with a practiced bit of grace and speed. Kick off the wall, and I was gone back to the beginning to finish the first lap. I pushed every muscle, not giving myself a moment of slack. If we were going to win this competition, everyone had to work their hardest, especially us seniors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, I was being patted on the back and told to keep up the good work. I shrugged it off as I always did and headed to the bench. There I collapsed with a plop, never even noticing the inch-tall person I had come very close to sitting my speedo-clad butt on. I reached down to my duffel bag, a strong green color with \"Stratton High Brawlers\" emblazoned in white on the side, and grabbed a fresh towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I towelled myself off, my red hair fluffing up and off my freckled face, I could hear Mark and Jake and the others making plans. Sure enough, little freshman Luke, second fastest after the star pupil Kerber, came over to ask if I'd tag along. I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't make it tonight. It's a casino night, so Dad's out and doesn't want to leave Ali by herself. She's only 11 still.\" I set the towel beside me on the bench, where it lands right on you. \"Maybe next time, 'kay? Tell Kerbs I said to eat something big and meaty. Kinda gettin' worried about him.\" My eyes flicked over to the brown-haired senior, who was skinnier than any of the other people around him, freshmen included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke nodded and went away, so I stuffed my towel into my bag and zipped it closed. Tiny passenger in tow, I   beelined for the locker room. My duffle bag with its tiny passenger ended up on a bench. I pulled out my towel and shook it out to its full spread, shaking you off and back into the duffle bag where I have a fresh change of clothes and a pair of white sneakers. Leaving the bag unzipped, I stripped off my speedo and tossed it into the bag. Then I headed over to the showers on the other side of the room, sectioned off by half walls, still oblivious of the tiny person in my duffle bag I'd just dropped my wet speedo onto.</span></div></div>",

The ground was very hard, and it was very bright out. \"Where the hell am I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up, rubbing my eyes as I tried to adjust to the lighting. \"What happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting was difficult. It felt like I'd been out for a while, and everything was a blur when I did open my eyes. I head yelling, and splashing. A pool? Some sort of swimming thing? I didn't want to worry about it, focusing on myself and regaining my own senses first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I didn't have much time. As my eyes finally adjusted, it was just in time to see a massive figure walking in front of me turn around and start to sit directly where I was. I cursed, running to the right while my brain scrambled to make sense of all this. They came down on...wherever I was, and I stared up at them. It was a guy. A giant guy! In nothing but a speedo. And he'd nearly sat on me. What the hell was going on!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frantically looked around, realizing I was in fact at a pool. Swim practice looked like. But why? And how was I so small?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove me, the giant's arm rolled past into a duffel bag behind me, pulling out a towel and dripping on me in the process. I shook my head, hair nearly soaked from just a few drops at this size, watching him towel off. \"Hey! Down here! Look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to get his attention, but no dice. It was loud in here, and now other swimmers were talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeee- wait, no!\" My attention grabbing was stopped by him suddenly dropping the towel on me. I cursed, trapped under the wet fabric, struggling to no avail. I felt helpless. Above me, there was muffled conversation. Then suddenly I was being lifted along with the towel, tumbled over and dumped presumably in the duffel bag and darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was being carried somewhere, but all I knew was it was dark, wet, and I wanted to get the hell out of this duffel bag. My wish was granted, it seemed, as the towel was lifted from the bag, but it was immediately shaken and I was propelled back down into the bag with only enough time to see I was in a locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed in a soft pile of clothes, at least. But looking up, I was met with a worse sight. A speedo being flung into the bag. I didn't have time to react. It landed right on top of me with a wet smack. It smelled like chlorine and slightly of dude, and it was heavy. I was having trouble trying to pull myself out from under it as you walked off to wherever. Probably the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled with the speedo for minutes, slowly but surely crawling out, freeing myself just in time to hear you returning for the bag. \"Hey!\" I cried out, not wanting anything else dropped on me, or carrying me away, or anything like that, hoping against hope this time you would hear. \"Hey, look in here! In your bag!\"</span></div></div>",

Everyone else was either gone or going, so I took the opportunity to wash up a little and get the smell of chlorine off my bare skin. My legs and arms were sore, aching from one of the most extensive practices I'd ever suffered. Coach was pushing us harder than he ever had, and it was starting to take its toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I cooled down with a bit of flexing as the hot water streamed down my body. Naturally, I had a swimmer's build: notable muscle definition for power and force but delicately balanced with a slim, aquadynamic figure for speed and fluidity. What little body hair I did have was trimmed to the skin, besides the small fuzzy patch around my groin. I wasn't the most well equipped around, but it was good three inches just flaccid. Looking down, I pinched the side of my stomach and frowned a little. \"Erf... gonna have to lay off pizza until after the finals, I guess. Gettin' a little extra around the middle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I had washed away the pool chemical stench, I grabbed my towel and dried off quickly. Glancing around to see that nobody had wandered in, I went over to my bag on the bench to toss in my towel and put my regular clothes on. I balled up my towel, and was about to throw it in when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look in here! In your bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was faint, but enough to get my attention in the near-silence of the locker room. My gaze went around the locker room, expecting to see someone peeking around a corner with a joking grin on their face. Nobody. I shrugged and looked down to my bag... and jumped, dropping my towel in my surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, standing atop my underwear, was you, a tiny guy. You couldn't have been more than an inch tall, and you looked absolutely puny surrounded by my clothes and trapped inside my duffle bag. I blinked a few times, not believing my eyes for the sight before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, hesitantly, I leaned forward, hand outstretched. My index finger and thumb, both four feet wide, carefully pinched around your sides like the claws of some giant monster. I slowly lifted you up out of my bag and set you down on the knee-high bench, but to you, it must have felt like some sort of rollercoaster ride from the speed and height changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though I'd just held you in my fingers, I still couldn't believe it. I stepped a little closer to the bench; my body towered over you, nude and built with sleek muscle, like some enormous titan out of Greek mythology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hi.\" That was all I could think to say to you, my thoughts trapped in a cycle of disbelief, wonder, shock, and deep pondering about the little person before me. </span></div></div>",

Luckily, you seemed to have more of a plan than I did as you reached it. I suddenly got worried, realizing how easily I could be crushed. It would only take a few fingers. But you seemed careful enough, and I didn't try to run as you picked me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was lifted, I shut my eyes, feeling like I was on the Tower of Terror at Disney, waiting for a plunge. And then it came. You didn't let go, but you did set me down, and as I touched down on the bench, I decided the whole \"Close your eyes and it'll be easier\" amusement park ride philosophy was bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up, I got a good look at you for the first time, towering over me more athletic than I'd ever looked. I wasn't fat by any means. I was a scrawny bastard. But I didn't go to the gym or work out nearly enough. I made a mental note to start if I ever got the chance. As my eyes traveled over you, they settled first on your face far above, then dropped to your waistline, face flushing red when I realized you were still completely naked, your manhood several times the size of my entire body now. Probably the most humbling realization a guy can have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shut my eyes once more, not opening them until I looked back up at your face and you made contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost chuckled. You were as stunned as I was. But you seemed nice enough. \"...Hi. So...I wasn't crawling around in your bag for no reason. You kinda...tossed me in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the best introduction. Sounded more like a pervert's cover-up than anything. I shook my head. \"I can explain...but let me restart. I'm Jake.\" I held out a tiny hand, realizing that it wasn't really feasible to shake his and set it back down. \"Nice to meet you, odd as the circumstances may be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was rambling. Had a tendency to do that when I was nervous. So I shut my mouth, waiting my turn. I looked up, waiting to see how you'd respond to all this. Was a lot to take in, I imagine. God knows I was having trouble with it.</span></div></div>",

Rather than waste time thinking about what could be, however, I decided to focus on the solid, undeniable present and just... go with the flow of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you spoke, I listened and watch. Your gestures were awkward, but not quite timid, and the way you rambled on felt rather like you were trying to keep calm and not freak out, either. It was a little comforting to know we were in the same boat mentally, at least. Still, I couldn't understand why you would either look straight at me dead-on or down to the bench, your vision decidedly not wandering. And then it struck me, obvious in retrospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't put on a shred of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my years on the team, I'd grown used to being naked around other guys, to the point where it didn't even register. Even outside the swim team, my friends had kind of gotten used to me taking everything off on a particularly hot summer day. Of course, they were all people I knew, and every one of them around my 6'3\" height. I was a complete stranger to you, and here I was baring all for you to see on a scale of hundreds of feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, sorry... I didn't, uh, didn't think about my clothes.\" Fumbling a little awkwardly, I rushed to put my underwear on and alleviate some of the embarrassment you must have been feeling. When that was done, I sat down on the bench beside you and smiled a little as I looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm Mason. Nice to meet you, all things considered.\" My mind raced, but all I could think to do was just keep talking and moving like normal. \"So... uh, let's get the obvious question of the way.

Someone who wasn't weirded out by this might be tempted to abuse the scenario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited patiently as you made yourself a bit more decent, then watched as you sat on the bench, remembering earlier when that same movement had almost been the end of me.

I can't remember a damned thing.\" I shrugged. \"Last I knew, I was waking up with a hell of a headache, hearing water splashing and people shouting.

It really wasn't your fault. None of this had been on purpose, after all. I just wished I could tell the prequel story that led up to all this and started it all.

For a moment, I hoped in vain you might have some idea what would cause this, but figured mad science or witchcraft or whatever the hell it was probably wasn't really in your field of expertise. Meaning no offense, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't really have anywhere to go, but I didn't want to outright ask for your help or somewhere to crash.

Obviously, it hadn't been intentional or directed at you, but I still felt a bit guilty about, for all intents and purposes, kidnapping you in a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now? Your words echoed in my thoughts. That was a very good question. I wasn't too sure. After all, they didn't teach you how to deal with shrunken people in your senior year. Hell, they didn't teach that anywhere, as far as I knew. Teachers wouldn't be any help. Cops? They wouldn't know any more, and their solution to most things was to lock the problem up in a cell and let someone higher up the chain deal with it later. Probably not what you'd want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stumped for an answer. Five minutes ago, my thoughts had been about going home to play Skyrim and finish a paper on the differences and similarities between Roman and Greek architecture. Now I was thinking about what I and an inch-tall guy should do about his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, I picked you up again. You flew up as I stood, and then the fingers gingerly deposited you into the palm of my hand. Underneath you, the flesh was soft and slightly relenting. It still smelled faintly of chlorine and sweat, and the heat was tolerable but powerful. My hands cupped around you as I held you up by my face, hundreds of feet off the floor from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I don't know. No one here at school would have a clue, and I don't think cops would be any better. The only one who might know anything would be the feds. And who knows what they'd do? Plus, I'm kind of worn out from everything I did today. Coach Carlson really beats us up with work for the swim meets, and teachers just love piling homework on seniors...\" As if my body were agreeing, I yawned. \"How about you come home with me tonight and we figure things out tomorrow.

But not in a way that would be particularly helpful to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a short time, it seemed you were lost in thought, then you reached down and I was flying again, bracing myself when I saw your hand coming, and managing to keep everything in my stomach where it belonged as I ascended, then was dropped gently in your other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to your explanation, considering each option even though you'd already shot them down. \"Yeah, teachers aren't likely unless there's some mad scientist working here...cops I'd rather not think about, and government suits aren't going to do anything pleasant for me. That much is certain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing home with you...that did seem like a good option. I mean, I sure as hell wasn't staying in the locker room. And it wasn't like I'd be much trouble for you. Come to think of it, I was rather tired myself despite having seemingly just woken up from some sort of daze just a short while ago. Somewhere to rest would be nice, and then plenty of time to think of our next move. It was perfect, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah, let's do that.\" I nodded. \"If you don't mind me crashing there, of course.\" I smiled up a bit, glad I'd been able to grab your attention and you hadn't been more vindictive with this easily abusable scenario.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly, my mind had been far too preoccupied with the craziness of the whole scenario to even consider abusing it. I was standing in the locker room in just a pair of underwear, talking to an inch tall guy held in the palm of my carefully cupped hands. My body, running on auto, had started to pace as I worked around the oddity of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, treating you as a person was coming first. You might have been small enough to mistake for a tiny toy, but I wasn't about to treat you like just a piece of property. The golden rule and all that, right? Besides, I was way too exhausted to get into the ethics and responsibility arguments of what to do when you find a shrunken person standing on your underwear in your duffle bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. I haven't had anyone over for a few weeks, so I could use a little company anyways.\" I winced slightly in retrospect. \"Er, I didn't... didn't mean to say \"little\" like that...\" Definitely going to have to mind what adjectives I casually toss around... \"Besides, I'm guessing you wouldn't want to spend the night here in the locker room, and there's not really anywhere else to go. So what kind of person would I be if I didn't offer?\" It's not like you'd take up much space in my room, I think, but I don't say that out loud for consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything else, the distinctive squeak of the locker room door opening made my head snap up. I'd wandered over to nearly the other side of the locker room, far from my duffle bag. My eyes glanced down at you, then wildly around. The fewer people that knew about your unfortunate height, the better. But where to hide you? Carefully carrying you, I wouldn't have made it halfway to the bag before they rounded the corner. The floor was an open field, nowhere to hide even at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushed and panicked into action, I did the only thing I could think to do to hide you from discovery. My fingers curled up into a ball around you as my hand plunged downward, passing by the expansive cliffside of my trimmed chest. My other hand stretched out my waistband quick enough to gently drop you into the front of my underwear, amidst the curly red pubic hair and hot flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hand snapped out of my underwear just in time to avoid an awkward walk-in. Collin, one of the juniors, rounded in the corner, and he smiled as he saw me. \"Hey, Mason. Just getting finished up?\" He walked past to the junior locker section and started to change out of his swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... yeah. Just showered, and I was getting ready to get dressed to go home.\" The words came out, somehow both stumbling and mechanical. I could feel you in my crotch and was trying desperately to not react in the natural way any male did when they felt sensations around their junk. God only knew how hellish this was for you, but there was no going back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't let me stop you. Just gonna wash up myself. By the way, Coach said to make sure you trim your hair. It's getting a bit scruffy.\" Collin stepped out of his green speedo. Though I'd seen him naked several times after practice, my eyes still wandered. Mostly out of comparative curiosity and interest. Drifting off for a moment, I couldn't help but get a little turned on, my loins slowly stirring. Collin had always been a looker, and though I was quite certain I was perfectly straight, well, there had been the occasional staring around at other guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snapped to and tried to think of hideous things, like a grandma doing a striptease, in order to calm myself down. Fumbling, I muttered \"Right\" or something like it and stiffly walked over to my duffle bag, trying not to jostle you around too much. Carefully, I slipped into my regular clothes and tried not to pull my pants too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Collin nodded me off and headed to the shower, I sped for the door at the quickest walk I could manage. A glance around the hallway outside assured me nobody was in sight. My hand moved at crazy speed as I reached in, fingers grasping around before finally finding you. You're grabbed and carefully pulled out to the sight of a bright red freckled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my god, I'm so, so, so sorry!\" My voice came in a whispering shout, not wanting to attract any attention. \"I just, I-I panicked and had to put you somewhere before you were seen! Trust me, if Collin got a hold of you, you'd be in for a world of humiliation. And most anyone else might pick on you a bit. And I didn't mean it in any sort of sex freaky way or something, it was just the only place I could hide you! And, uh...\" I trailed off, realizing I was wildly rambling, and looked down at you, cheeks blushed with embarrassment and eyes wide with worry and concern.</span></div></div>",

Just an expression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I was glad you were so open to letting me come with you. I'd be pretty damned screwed otherwise. Looking up from your hand, I smiled. \"I appreciate it. Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I heard it, and everything went to hell. The locker room door started to open. I looked up at you again, worriedly, but it seemed you already had a plan. You started to lower me, and I assumed I was being dropped back in your bag. But when I looked down, I realized we'd wandered away from it. And then I saw you open your waistband, eyes widening in alarm. \"Hey, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no arguing. I was deposited in your underwear. Dropping, I landed on the curly red bush, falling forward onto something decidedly more fleshy as the waistband sealed above me. I didn't even know how to react. I was just trying not to think too hard about what I was laying on...make that think too closely about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard whoever it was come in, and I could hear most of the conversation as he spoke to you. Below me, I could feel you starting to...tense up, we'll say, and I felt myself slowly moving upward as your dick fought your underwear for space. I tried as hard as I could not to add to the situation, though as it started to rise, I slid down the shaft a little unintentionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started to walk, it bounced a little with each step. I held on as tightly as I dared, not wanting to fall off, but not wanting to worsen the scenario. When you came to a stop, I heard the rustling of clothes being picked up and cursed. When you stepped into your pants, I realized what was coming, groaning. As your pants were pulled up, things were adjusted and I was pinned between you and...well, you. Not terribly tight, but enough to be uncomfortable in more than one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to walk again, and it rubbed up against me a bit at a time. With every step, I hoped for an end to this. And suddenly, your hand was above me and I was pulled free, taking a deep breath of fresh air as you started rapid-firing apologies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, I let you go on, catching m breath, and regaining my composure. You were right. There wasn't much else you could do, and I'd take your word on the other guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it's fine. You were thinking on your feet. There wasn't really much option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to sound sincere, and thought I did a pretty good job. I was more in shock than mad. That was the last thing I expected to experience today. And yet... I cleared my throat. \"That was just a little awkward, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to smile. Here I was, explaining that it was okay a dude a hundred times my size dropped me in his underwear. I thought it was reasonable to be a little awkward doing that, but I felt bad for how bad he felt about it. \"No harm done. You were just trying to look out for me. I appreciate that.\"</span></div></div>",

Hell, you were even smiling a little, if uncertainly. Still, I felt really bad about it. I hadn't time to ask, but I'd just dumped you on top of my junk and trapped you in there for a couple of minutes. As if towering naked over you earlier hadn't been enough embarrassment and awkwardness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... I had to admit that it had felt really good. Your tiny body in my most sensitive area, wriggling and squirming and grasping. The sensations of your arms, desperately clinging to my growing dick for a grip as it grew. The way you slipped and slid along the shaft as it awoke. That back-and-forth rhythm of rubbing against you as I walked. I mean, I wasn't going to do it again, especially not without permission. I was definitely straight... But it had felt really good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, my hormone-heavy thoughts carried on, I might be able to coerce a little bit more attention out of you if I was really nice. Not blackmail, just a bit of friendly play. Totally not gay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to not think of it at the moment. As much as I was riding the soft high of arousal, I had to put those sort of thoughts off for later, if ever. Right now, what mattered was getting you out of the open public and somewhere safer where prying eyes and snatching hands would not come across you at this helpless size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright then... Still sorry about it, though.\" I coughed awkwardly and glanced around. \"Let's... let's just get to my house before anything else happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fingers curved up, half-forming into a fist as I tried my best to keep you safe and hidden. Walking with my hand carefully and solidly held in front of me, I went straight outside and to my car. I tried to go slow so it wouldn't be too crazy-fast for you, but at the same time I was rushing a little because I wanted to get out of here as quick as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into my car, I blankly looked around for a moment. Here was a problem: where would you go? You couldn't go onto the other seat, as the very act of braking might send you flying forward. Maybe you could be safe in my pants pocket, but that was uncertain, and you probably wouldn't have liked being stuffed into a pocket like you were just a thing that I'd picked up and claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I hope you don't mind riding in the cup holder. There's not really anywhere else you could safely go.\" I stuffed a couple of napkins from the glove compartment in there so it wouldn't just be the semi-sticky plastic surface, then let you climb off my hand into the basin-like area. Smiling uncertainly but trying to be reassuring, I made sure you were ready before beginning to drive. It would be a short drive to my house, but everything seemed so slow as I considered how different everything had become in just the last minutes.</span></div></div>",

But for a moment, I could swear it looked like your thought process when somewhere other than embarrassment or coming to terms with it. Something focused on just one word of the later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. It was nothing. You were just a nice guy who'd helped me in a really awkward way. A way I wasn't hoping would have to be replicated any time soon, but that still helped. Still, damned if you hadn't seemed to be getting off on it at the time. But I'm sure that was coincidental. You wouldn't do that again on purpose...right? I pushed the thought from my head like the last once when you spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Sounds like a plan.\" The ride to your car was a bit bumpy, but your hand proved to be a decent form of transportation, at least for now. It was tight enough I wasn't going to slip through your fingers, but gave me enough breathing room to be comfortable as we moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the car, I was offered an unexpected seat. Truth be told, I hadn't thought about being in a car at this size. I couldn't be in a seat or something with no seatbelt, I'd go flying. Anything not surrounded by walls or something else was dangerous, really. The cupholder made sense in a way. \"No, that'll do fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed down into the cup holder, pushing down the napkin here and there while I found a comfortable position to sit in it, offering you a thumbs up when I was ready. Then I took a little time to consider my situation again, really hoping against hope that whatever had happened could be fixed somehow, at some point. I sighed, but tried not to let you see, lest you think I was moping over earlier or something.</span></div></div>",

Most of my focus was on the road and traffic; rush hour had died down, but there was still plenty of people out shopping or on their way home from work. Even then, I was thinking a little bit about what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an entirely foreign situation. What was I supposed to do about someone who could fit in the palm of my hand? Common sense and human respect made the obvious answer: get you back to normal. But how? Teachers and cops couldn't help, and I didn't know anything about this sort of thing. Maybe, I reasoned, a quick search on Google could give me an answer, or at least an idea of where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was doing my best not to think about having stuffed you into my underwear, or how absolutely enjoyable an experience that had been, but it was hard to deny or ignore my feelings and desires. I was a senior in high school, but even then I was still a horny, hormone-headed teenager. To think about the feeling of your tiny body clinging to my shaft, your little warmth against the hot flesh, the sensations of your tiny hands gripping and grabbing... I started to get a little excited again. It wouldn't be obvious to you in the cupholder, but I shifted my legs a little, a blush settling across my face as I tried my best to calm down. Now was definitely not the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we get to the house, I carefully pick you up out of the cupholder, making sure to be delicate and gentle as my fingers pinch around your little body. Cautiously holding you in my hand, I make a beeline for the door before we attract any curious person's attention. The door is quickly closed and locked, signifying the end of the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there I am, standing in the entrance of my house with my hands cupped around an inch tall stranger. A hundred thoughts and a hundred possible situations ran through my head. A few of them were perhaps NC-17, but for the moment they were subconscious, flittering through as nothing more than silly ideas. Besides, it wasn't exactly fair to decide for you what we'd be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down at you and risk a slight smile, shrugging and lifting you up and out a bit. \"So, uh, this is my home... S'not much, but it's comfy. My parents work late, and my brother's always out and about, so it's just us for at least a couple hours, so... what do you wanna do for the rest of the day? There's plenty to eat, or maybe we watch TV or something, or...\" I hesitate. \"Well, there's no way to put this delicately. You, uh, kinda stink, like old mothballs. Maybe you want to wash up?\"</span></div></div>",

Absolutely tiny, no idea how it happened, no idea how to fix it or who I could go to for help. And the only person I had to help me shoved me into his underwear within 15 minutes of meeting me. Yeah, there were circumstances around it, but that still happened. And he certainly wasn't hating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed a little, glad I was probably fairly out of sight in this cup holder. Glancing up, I saw you blushing a little and decided it was probably better not to guess what you were thinking about. I tried to put my negativity out of mind as we drove and just relax despite it all. I had a little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we reached our destination, you picked me up and inside we went. You quickly locked the door. No surprise people this time around. And just like that, there we are. No car trip to distract us. Just you and I. I try to come up with something to say, but nothing seems casual enough right now. Thankfully, you collect your thoughts faster than I do and you speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around as you presented your house. Certainly not bad. Good to know people wouldn't be around too much, I guess. Not sure I wanted to have to explain myself to other people just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished, I looked down at myself, sniffing. You were right. I stank like all hell. \"You have a point...I think that's probably priority number one. Then maybe food. After that, I'm up for whatever, I guess. Don't let me throw off your night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, not quite sure how I was going to wash myself. Probably in the sink or something. New clothes might be a problem...but I guess we'll figure it out when the time comes.</span></div></div>",

A filled bathtub would be a deep lake with no escape; a shower would be a thunderous downpour strong enough to sweep you off your feet. The only realistic option would be washing up in the sink, and that in and of itself could present quite a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny passenger in hand, I started heading towards the bathroom adjacent to my room. My house wasn't terribly large (to a normal-sized person), but it was spacious enough for my parents, my brother, and I to live comfortably. I started to think out loud, partly for the sake of conversation and partly for my own train of thought. \"Well... I showered in the lockers, so it's gonna be just you. The only safe place I can think of would be the sink, so here's my idea. I'll plug the sink up and let it fill a bit. Then I'll put a chip of soap and a little sponge to sit on in the water. You can wash up with the soap and use the sponge as a somewhat solid surface so you're not trying to float and wash off at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked and talked, you might take the moment to look around. The furniture's drab and worn-in but looks comfortable enough. We pass through a living room with a little flatscreen TV and a couple older game consoles, by the entryway to a kitchen with a small table and an off-white refridgerator decorated with photos and magnets, and go up a small staircase that seems claustrophobically tight. The hallway at the top is barely any bigger, and the doors seem almost crammed in together. I open the second on the left and make sure to lock it behind myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom is just as cramped as the previous rooms. A pedestal sink, medicine cabinet and small porcelain toilet cling to the left side, and most of the right is occupied by a bathtub shower with a craning shower head. The pale blue walls almost seem to pull in, as if the whole room is holding its breath just to fit into the building's layout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, uh...\" I carefully set you down on the cool porcelain of the sinktop. The sink itself dips into a basin that a building of your scale could fit in without reaching the top. \"There is a small problem. You're too little to get into the sink without falling or tumbling a good distance, and you couldn't climb the smooth sink wall even if it was dry.\" I shift a little, a slight blush on my freckled face. \"So I'm, uh, gonna have to help you in and out.\" As if fending off an attack, I lift my hands up and quickly add, \"I won't be hovering over the entire time, though! I'll be ordering a pizza for dinner, and then I'll just sit on the toilet and read or something. You'd just call out when you're ready to get out of the sink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scratch the back of my head as I look down at you with those deep green eyes. \"I... I know it's not the most comfortable plan, but it's really the best I can think of.\"</span></div></div>",

Not that I'd really be able to get around without your help anyway, but it still made me feel better to get a feel for it. It feels cozy. Not the biggest house I'd ever been in, but at this size, it may as well have been. Sort of place I'd have been happy hanging out at with a friend. Which... was kind of what was going on? Circumstances aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while I looked around I was listening to you talking. I was honestly glad you'd gotten showering out of the way. Not that I expected you to try something or anything, but ruling out showers and baths made me feel a little better. I wasn't looking forward to either possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached the bathroom and you started setting me down, I hopped off your hand, looking around some more, then back at you as you explained. You had a point. This sink was a one-way slide to me as it was. Once I get wet, forget about it... \"I mean... I don't like the idea of being manhandled naked, but we don't really have much of an option, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled a little, trying not to think about it too hard and take this all in stride. You meant well. And I knew you weren't trying to pull anything, despite my apparent need to reassure myself of that fact every few minutes... Chalk it up to paranoia, not distrust. \"I think it's the best plan we've got... So it works for me.\" I did my best to look reassuring. I could see in your face that you felt just as awkward about it as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped over to the side of the sink, watching you fill it and prepare everything, waiting while you did so, not wanting to be naked any longer than I had to, for both of our sakes. But when the time finally came and I couldn't put it off, I stripped, a little awkwardly, trying not to go displaying myself any more than need be. I was of a pretty average build, on the skinnier side. Not super fit, definitely less so than a guy on swim team, but in a little better than average shape. The only hair between my head and my legs was a minimal amount on my chest and a fairly typical amount somewhere I was trying to keep hidden. Were you to catch a glimpse, you'd see I was packing a bit more than average, were I not doll-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood by the side of the sink, clothes in a pile beside me, hands held over my junk and sighed a little. \"I'm, uh... I'm ready.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you joked about being manhandled without any clothes on, I sort of laughed in turn. This whole situation was so weird, and I was really not sure what to think about any of it. It was kind of awkward, but we were both handling it well and taking things in stride. Maybe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started the sink and let it run to get the hot water flowing. While that heated up, I grabbed the bar of soap and the shampoo bottle from the shower shelf. I tested the water with a finger and pulled the drain to let the sink fill up a bit. It was only a little water, maybe a couple of inches deep, but that was enough to be like a small pool to you. As you started to undress, I looked away and busied myself with breaking off a chunk of soap and setting that and a dab of shampoo in the sink at the edge of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only took a few seconds, though, and I found myself watching, mostly out of curiosity, as you took off your tiny clothes, which to my eyes looked more like little scraps of fabric with holes in them. I had to remember to try to be careful if I ever handled them; it would be all too easy to accidentally rip the only things that would comfortably fit you. As for your body... Well, you kept good care of yourself, even if you weren't a bodybuilder or a swimmer. You weren't terribly hairy, and what hair you did have was mostly modest. You had a well-shaped butt, and I would admit to looking at your crotch when the opportunity presented itself and being a little impressed. It obviously wasn't very big by normal measurements, but at your current height it was clear that you were well-equipped in that department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all of that was completely platonic, heterosexual interest. No other intentions at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words shook me from my thoughts, and I gave a sort of nervous smile as I looked down at you. \"Oh, uh, right...\" My hand reached down, and I paused only for a moment before carefully grabbing you. My fingers gently pressed against your naked body, gripping you tightly but not uncomfortably. You're slowly lowered into the basin-like sink, and I let you stand up in the shallow area before moving my hand away. The shape of the sink left a small, slightly sloped area just outside the water, and it was here that the soap and the shampoo were lying. Everything was ready for you to wash up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awkwardly hovered overhead for a moment, still unsure what to think of all this. Part of me thought that it might be best to stand by in case you needed help with something. Even at an inch tall, though, you were still a person, and you could probably take care of this yourself and would want some privacy. I cleared my throat. \"I, uh, I'm going to go get lunch started. Be back in a bit...\" I backed away out of sight and left the room, making sure to close the door with the light on. If anyone came home by surprise and I didn't hear them, it would hopefully look like the bathroom was occupied and they wouldn't go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a moment to collect myself and take a deep breath. \"Right, lunch...\" With a purpose in mind and every intent to not think about what was going on in the bathroom sink, I headed for the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

But it went over fine, so all was well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast-forward a little, and there I was standing there ready while you seemed to be thinking distantly about something. I called up and you snapped out of it, reaching for me. As your hand approached, I took a deep breath and admittedly closed my eyes until I was in your hand. Being held naked was... notably different from just being held. I could feel your skin on mine anywhere we were touching, some of which were places I was decidedly not used to feeling skin against with any frequency. But you were gently enough, and in a few seconds, I was standing in the shallower part of the sink, inspecting the water, which was pleasantly warm. I looked up at you and gave a thumbs-up, covering myself seeming like sort of a moot point after all that had happened, and my admittedly poor job doing it while I undressed. \"Thanks, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited a second while you stared, then you seemed to realize what you were doing and hurried off to start lunch, blushing all the while. When you were out of sight, I chuckled. I thought I was nervous, but you seemed just as, if not more so, than I was. And you were the athlete that probably regularly saw, or were at least regularly near, other dudes showering with frequency. Oh well. I turned toward the soap, trying to figure out exactly how to do this. Shampoo was easy enough. Dunk myself underwater until my hair was thoroughly drenched, then deal with it normally and dunk under again to rinse. Washing the rest of me would be a little trickier. I decided to do it in parts, lathering up some soap and washing my upper half, then dunking until it was rinsed off. Then I sat on the edge of the dry part of the sink, maneuvering as necessary to wash everywhere that would be underwater if I were still standing in the water. I suddenly felt for anyone back in the day who ever had to wash themselves in a pond or anything like that. They'd have to sit in mud or on a rock to do this. Unpleasant and impractical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I finished up rather quickly, content with how clean I was. You weren't back yet, and I looked at the sink, effectively a pool at this size. I didn't really want to sit around just waiting, so I decided to spend some time swimming in the deeper parts. I'd always liked swimming. I'd grown up on a river when I was younger, but I'd had less time as I'd grown, and less opportunity when we eventually moved. So this was a nice change of pace. I swam around leisurely in the sink, zoning out and in my own little world as I did so. I didn't think about how silly this might look if someone were to walk back in while I weren't paying attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lunch had been an interesting decision. What kind of foot would be good for someone who's only an inch tall? It couldn't be anything really big or really messy, which pretty much cleared most of a student's diet off the list. Chinese and Mexican left-overs for sure. You could probably gorge yourself on a single grain of rice, I thought, and chuckled slightly at the mental image. There was no way for you to really ramen, and hot dogs would be the size of buildings. Of course, I pondered, you could just grab tiny scraps of food off of what I was eating. It wasn't like I needed to cook two servings... Finally, I gave up thinking about it and just popped a frozen pizza into the oven. I was way too exhausted and weekend-ready to do any sort of heavy thinking, and it'd probably be better to talk that sort of thing out with you, anyways. But everyone loved pizza, so it was a safe bet for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough my deciding had wasted some time, it had really only been a couple minutes. There was no way you were already done, so I still had time to kill. And now I couldn't stop thinking about what might be happening in the bathroom. There was a tiny naked man in the sink, washing up in a body of water I could barely dip my hands into. Right now, you were likely scrubbing soap over your body or rinsing yourself off with splashes. Now, as before, I found myself blushing at the thought. But why? It wasn't like I hadn't seen other guys washing up in the showers, and I was pretty comfortable with that. Maybe I did a little staring, but that was always just curiosity. It was natural to mentally compare yourself to other guys, particularly in certain, ahem, departments. You were clearly well-built and well-endowed, and you had a handsome figure. I couldn't deny that; I did think you were handsome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so maybe I wasn't being entirely heterosexual about this. I would admit to letting my gaze linger in the locker room. Why not? I was on a swim team, and everyone had a sleek, muscular swimmer's build reminiscent of idealistic figures. And when you spend time in speedos or less around a bunch of guys, you might turn to thoughts about their endowments. But I'd never, ever been daring enough to do more than think about that sort of thing. How could I? What was I supposed to do, just go up to one of the guys and ask to fool around a bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you... You weren't on the swim team, and no one at the moment knew about you. Were I ever to do any sort of experimenting, this could be a key opportunity. We'd already seen each other naked, even if to some awkward extent, and you seemed to trust me well enough. And I was doing you quite a few favors, so maybe I could work on that angle. Your opinion still mattered, obviously. I was curious, not controlling, and there was no way I would break whatever trust there might be by forcing you to do something uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to get my mind off of this train of thought. Moving past the bathroom to my room, I logged onto my computer and did a Google search for \"shrinking man\". It was a long shot, but what else was there? The entries were mostly about some 1950's sci-fi movie, but there were a couple outliers: a blog that went into boring science talk about the possibilities and consequences, a brief article about shrinking economics or some dull thing like that, and a site called shrinkingman.com.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe site was flooded with Photoshop edits of people towering over cities or being towered over by others. Stories about accidents with chemicals and weird rayguns and magical powers being used to change a person's height. A name: macrophilia and microphilia. A short search later led to even more interesting, mature links. Images of naked giants with erections smiling down at tiny people with eager, sometimes malicious grins flashed across the screen. The stories were far more graphic and erotic in nature, and I found myself a little excited at all of it. I hadn't found anything that might be of help to restoring your size, but this... this might require further reflection. I quietly bookmarked a site for later and stood, realizing for the first time that I'd gotten rather worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy own erection had formed, and it took a good couple of minutes to get it to go away. I made sure I was no longer sporting a bulge before I opened the bathroom door again. I looked into the sink to see you skinny-dipping in the water, casual and clearly enjoying it. It was a litle bit silly to see, but I couldn't blame or begrudge you for taking the opportunity. You hadn't noticed me yet, so I let you swim around a bit more before I cleared my throat and nervously smiled down at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... lunch is almost done. Are you ready to come out?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While I swam, my thoughts only briefly went to you and what you were doing out there. I wondered at what you'd make for food. And then at what I could actually eat at this size... I decided not to worry about it. Whatever you picked, I was sure we'd make work. As for any research on my predicament, or the possibilities of experimentation, these were things that never entered my mind, and things that I wouldn't have to put any thought into until at least a little later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, I thought back to those pleasant summer afternoons swimming in the river when I was a kid. They were some of the nicer memories from those days. It was a simpler time, one I sometimes missed. But for now, just to swim and remember was more than enough. Now and again, I shut my eyes and let myself get lost in the sound of my splashing and the comfort this swimming brought. Were I not lost in this daydreaming and reminiscing, I might have noticed you come back into the bathroom. Might have noticed you watching me, and not been horribly mortified when I was brought back to reality by you clearing your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whipped around when I heard you, face flushing a deep scarlet as I wondered how long you'd been standing there. It was a little disconcerting to think about, but as I thought it over, it seemed like you were just trying not to bother me, and you weren't laughing at me or anything, so... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I... Just a sec.\" I quickly turned and swam for the shallow end of the sink again. Sure, you could probably pick me up while I treaded water with little trouble, but this way it was a little more on my terms, and probably a little less awkward all around. I stood in the shallows, shaking off a bit of the water. \"Alright. I'm ready. Beam me up, Mason.\" I tried my best to move back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cooperated as much as was possible while you picked me up and set me back down on the sink above. For a moment, I stood there shivering, fighting the urge to wrap my arms around myself to cover up as best I could, not caring that I'd been rather inconsistent with when I did and didn't. I wished I'd thought about what swimming around for so long would do when I got back out of the warm water. \"Any chance you've got a tiny towel laying around?\" I jokingly asked, looking up at you. \"A washcloth will do in a pinch.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I watched as you swam to the edge of the water where you could actually stand up. As you stood in the sink, you made no effort to cover yourself; at this point, I'd already seen - and handled - your naked body, and awkward shyness wouldn't do either of us any good. You seemed more embarrassed about being caught swimming around than anything else, and I tried to make my smile seem a little more reassuring and friendly. Beads of water clung to your bare skin as you stood there, waiting for the lift you'd need to get out of the large porcelain basin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might notice that my grip seemed a little more delicate than before as I carefully pinched my thumb and index finger around your waist. Even as I was lifting you, I found myself still in a state of disbelief, as if this was just some strange dream. But you felt real, you were real. I could feel the warmth of your body heat, the tiny pressure of your body's minute shifts with each little breath, the tickling of your little hands holding onto my fingers as you were carried. In turn, you could feel the heat from my fingers around your waist and the icy rush of air over your bare skin as you were lifted out of the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick ride back up to the countertop, and as I gently set you down, you could feel the cold porcelain surface underneath you and the cool, room temperature air across your bare skin. While you stood, shivering, I opened the sink and let the water drain away. Your words made me feel rather stupid for a moment. Of course you were going to need something to dry off. \"Uhh... Let me see what I can scrounge up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just the thing in mind. In my room, I opened a drawer and pulled out a bandana, one of those old-fashioned red ones with the white floral patterns. This I tore into several little rectangles; setting most of them aside for the moment, I looked observantly at the one in my hand.To me, it was a thin scrap of fabric. To you, it would be thick and soft enough to serve as a replacement towel four feet by eight feet in size. It wasn't perfect, but what other options were there, really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI handed the makeshift towel to you and waited. I considered turning away and giving you a bit of privacy, but I was still of the opinion that being shy about this sort of thing was just going to make things more blatantly awkward for both of us. And maybe I wanted to check you out a little more. I watched as you dried off and slipped back into your tiny clothes. With that out of the way, it was on to lunch. When you were ready, I picked you up again and carried you out to the kitchen, where the pizza was fully cooked and ready to cool. I slipped it off the cooking tray onto the countertop a short distance from you and grabbed a plate for when it was time to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we waited, I looked down at you, standing atop the kitchen counter and dwarfed by things like the nearby salt and pepper shakers. Grains of sugar from some previous cooking, each the size of a brick, littered the surface around you, and the pizza to your right was a plaza-like expanse of hot cheese, sauce, and dough. Of all the things that were apparent here, the most obvious was just how helpless you were. Everyday objects were like buildings and towers, and furniture had become manmade landscapes. Small pests were now dangerous predators, and larger pests would be terrifying behemoths. You could barely go anywhere, and any sort of distance would require either time or aid. You were quite literally dependent on me for everything. A less benign person might have twisted that to abuse this level of control or blackmail you into doing all sorts of things, but I wasn't about to do that. As much as the possibility of experimentation might appeal, I wanted to get full consent before doing anything of that sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same, I decided to keep my ideas to myself for the moment. Telling you about my less-than-heterosexual desires on the same day I met you would be a rather jarring start to our, well, friendship. I smiled a little at that thought. Friends with an inch-tall guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time, I quickly sliced the pizza into eighths and put a couple of the slices onto my plate. I moved the plate and you to the kitchen table and carefully set you on the rim of the plate. I sat down with a napkin and tore off a corner of the paper fabric and the very end of one of the slices. These little scraps I handed to you, each one the size of your head. With that taken care of, I started to tuck into my slices. I wasn't too worried about you being seen; if anyone came in the front door, I'd have enough time to hide you before they got to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Despite that, your hand was exceedingly warm and slightly awkward as it might have been to be wrapped in it naked, it was really a pretty comfortable place to be. And you seemed to be a little more gentle than earlier on top of that, which made it even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the sink, I was freezing once more, waiting patiently while goosebumps grew on my skin and you found and tore up a bandana for my use. When you finally handed me one of the scraps, I was impressed by its effectiveness. You wouldn't think a bandana would be super great for drying a person off, but it did the job with relative ease and it was didn't hurt to work with. In a couple minutes, I was suitably dry, stepping over to the pile of my clothes and putting them back on piece at a time. They smelled a bit like chlorine still, but there were worse smells, and I didn't really expect to come across a store specializing in clothes my size any time soon. I did my best to make my hair somewhat presentable, though at this size, if it was a bit messy I didn't think anyone was really going to be complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I got dressed, and when I was ready I called up to you and waited to be picked up and carried away once more. And then we were off to the kitchen, where I could smell pizza ready to come out of the oven. I hopped onto the counter as you let me down, marveling at the size of the debris and hand-held instruments around me. God, I could build a house out of these sugar grains... This was insane. Honestly, just when I think I'm getting used to being so small, something else reinforces just how miniscule I am and makes me feel smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind me, I hear you set down the plate, looking back and seeing the enormous pizza stretched out before me, eyes widening and a grin spreading across my face. Maybe this wasn't all so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat, waiting for the pizza to cool and looking around some more, marveling at everyday items now the size of vehicles and buildings. It really was a different perspective... I looked at you every now and again, feeling lucky despite everything that had happened. You were a good guy, or at least seemed it so far, who wasn't gonna do anything to hurt me and seemed to respect me despite my height. I could have done a lot worse. I ran into the right giant to make friends with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the pizza was ready. I watched you slice it up, then we moved to the table, where I sat next to the plate, taking a scrap of pizza as I was offered it. Even this tiny piece was still taller than my mouth, and it was a bit of a feat to eat it cleanly. I'd have to take a bit of cheese and sauce, then a bite of the crust below it to keep my progress somewhat even. It was slow going, but it was delicious. I had no idea when I'd last eaten, but it might as well have been an eternity for the sudden hunger I ate with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finished wolfing and had slowed myself down a bit, I looked up at you eating your own pizza and tried to strike up conversation. \"So what do you usually do with your free time? I don't want to throw off any plans, or stop you finishing anything you need to get done.\"</span></div></div>",

You seemed content enough with the scrap, even though you had to work a little to eat it because of your tiny size. Figuring you had things handled, I turned my attention back to my own food and tucked in. Most of the meal was silence, which was fine by me. Eventually, though, you turned towards me again and spoke up. I finished what I'd been chewing and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have one thing I need to do online. It'll take a while, though, so it'll be really late by the time I'm done with it.\" I brushed my red hair out of my face and idly tapped my fingers on the tabletop as I thought about it. \"It's a gaming livestream, too, so it'll take all my attention. I could probably turn on TV or something if you don't want to watch.\" I wasn't sure how much you liked games or let's plays, so I was fine with accommodating you if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of dinner passed by fairly quickly and without incident, and it was nearly six by the time we were done. Nobody else had come home yet, so it was just the two of us. I was a bit distracted by my own thoughts, so it wasn't until I'd finished and crumpled my napkin onto my empty plate that I actually looked at you again. And then did a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute. Are you... you look bigger now...\" I squinted down at you, taking a closer look. Somehow, you'd grown back only a little bit. You were two inches tall now, twice as big as when I'd first found you (or vice versa, to be technically correct). Neither of us had even noticed because your clothes had grown along with you. Lucky that, as I certainly didn't have spare clothes for someone the size of my pinky. I quickly cleaned up from dinner and came back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled down at you, my expression clearly hopeful. \"Okay, so it's not much, but it's something. We can try to see if it happens again. If we're lucky, this might be some sort of effect that's starting to wear off.\" I moved to pick you up, and my grip might have been a little tight until I adjusted around your bigger figure. It still felt so weird to literally hold you in the palm of my hand, but I certainly wasn't about to say that I was starting to get used to it. Instead, I just continued to smile as I raised you to face level and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meanwhile, though, what do you want to do? Watch me play games, or should I set something up for you?\"</span></div></div>",

Another dull school night in my room. My only companions were a bag of Gummy Bears and the infinitely slow passage of time that seemed to accompany the word \"work\" wherever it went. I huffed and leaned back. \"I can't take this anymore. I'll just do the rest of it in English or at lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I stretched my tired legs. It was the last year of high school, and at 18, I was ready to be done with the whole affair and off to live my life. My skin was mostly white, but there was still some brown from a distant Mexican ancestry. This also showed in my hair, a dark brown that was nearly bordering on black, straight cut and just past shoulder length. My eyes were a dark blue, and they wandered around the room as I tried to think of something to do to alleviate my boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blegh,\" I scoffed as I let myself collapse backwards onto my bed with a whoomph. Just about everyone I knew was out of town, and the few people still here were too busy with their own schoolwork to do anything these days. I couldn't paint my nails, I'd already done that. I glanced down and wiggled my toes, admiring the vibrant sapphire blue color of the nail polish. Maybe I could watch TV, catch up on some shows. Anything to take my mind off of how very bored and very alone I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw motion. Jumping to a bolt-upright position, I watched, wide eyed and completely startled, as the fabric hem of my dresser shook. If I listened closely enough, I could hear a soft sound, as if something was scurrying around underneath it. My legs snapped up onto the bed as images of disgusting, disease-riddled rats and horrible, greasy cockroaches and terrifyingly huge spiders flashed through my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came out was neither of these things. It was small, only an inch or two tall, and colorfully decorated. The oddest part was that it was taller than it was long, as if it was... standing on two legs? Looking closer, I began to notice how distinctly... human-shaped it was. In fact, my brain concluded after stumbling for a moment or two, that was exactly what it was: a man, barely the size of my pinky, standing at the foot of my dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes wide with shock, I sat there on my bed, legs tucked under me, and stared down at you...</span></div></div>",

Even when I opened my eyes, things were a blur, although with every blink things were coming back to me. How'd I get here? Where was here? And what'd I do to get this splitting headache?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up, patiently blinking until the blurs around me started to take form. I was...in a dark alleyway? Or some back lot somewhere? I set a hand on the ground to support me as I tried to stand and froze, looking down. It was hard to see, but it felt like...carpet. Really thick carpet. Like, several inches of the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed against it a few times. \"What the hell...?\" I looked up at the wall next to me, touching it. It was smooth. Not like any building I'd seen before. I touched the other one. Same deal, slightly different texture, but smooth. And when I looked up, there wasn't a single star in the sky. Hell, it looked like the sky ended half a dozen feet above me. When I looked back away from the wall, I saw light in that direction. Just a little. It looked like some sort of curtain hanging there. Maybe I was actually inside somewhere. That would explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to walk toward the curtain, careful not to trip over anything as I came out from between the two \"buildings\" and into more open ground. I could see the silhouette of a few things strewn about, but nothing concrete in the darkness. Furniture or something, probably. Soon, I reached the curtain, lifting it and seeing light flood in. The ground did look like giant carpet, but that wasn't too weird if I was inside somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing...\" I lifted the curtain more and stepped out into the light, shielding my eyes as they adjusted. When I could look around, what I saw stunned me. The ground was still carpet. But it was definitely floor. The floor of a giant bedroom, looked like. Above me, the supposed building I'd just left towered as a dresser, and in the distance I saw a desk and other furniture. Directly to the side, I saw a bed. And as I gaped, looking up and up, I froze when I came to meet the eyes of a girl staring right back down at me. Presumably the owner of this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared, too shocked to move, hoping to god she didn't think I was some sort of bug. \"...h-hello.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word stumbled out a little and I almost expected her to be unable to hear it as I waited for some response, willing myself to be ready to bolt if I needed to.</span></div></div>",

There was even a small aquarium set up in the corner. Of course, small was in comparison to a normal person. I could only imagine how absolutely monumental everything in my bedroom, from the furniture to the bean bags to the shag rug by the door, must seem to you, like a man-made landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this distance, your quiet words were barely more than a whisper, but I was so focused on you that I could just barely make it out. Moving very slowly, like someone approaching a wild animal, I slipped off the bed to kneel on the floor. I stayed there for the moment, not wanting to startle you. \"Hi there, uh... little guy...\" All things considered, I was taking this remarkably well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scooted a little closer and smiled at you. Looking at you, it was easy to notice that you were, well, good-looking. You weren't exactly a Playgirl cover-page model, but from what I could tell between the clothes and the size, you had a decent figure. I tried not to stare too much, focusing on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy were you only an inch tall? What were you doing in my room? I couldn't deny I was curious, but... well, did it really matter now? You were here, and that was what I knew. Besides, based on how confused you were, it was possible you didn't know either. Of course, if you did, that meant you'd snuck in here for some reason or another. But there was no point to questioning that right now. All I could do now was just introduce myself and go from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Wiley.\" Another scoot to bring me a bit closer; all the while I kept an eye on you, making sure I wasn't making you too nervous. After all, you could probably duck back underneath the dresser if you so wanted. \"So, what's your name, little fella?\" I leaned in, my boobs shaking a little.</span></div></div>",

A pleasant, if confused, tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned in, probably to get a closer look, and I could feel your eyes running over me. It was a little disconcerting, but at the same time a little flattering. As you looked me over, I looked back. You were attractive. Quite so, in fact. Dark hair framing a soft face with beautiful dark blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you leaned forward further, it was hard not to notice your boobs slide over the edge of the bed, bouncing a little as they were freed to hang there. You introduced yourself and I relaxed a little. You didn't seem very dangerous. I found my voice once again, speaking up so you could hear me better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake...and that's all I'm really sure of right now.\" At least I had a name.

Barring any sudden revelations, our knowledge of this started with meeting each other at our respective sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no. And I'm guessing you don't either, since you asked me.\" I shrugged a little and smiled. \"Still, it's nice to meet you, too, Jake. Circumstances notwithstanding.\" My eyes flitted over you again, unable to resist a bit more ogling. Thoughts danced through my mind. You were so small and, though I didn't think you'd agree, sort of cute like this, like an adorable little pet. Part of me wanted to grab you and cuddle with you. You were, however, still a person, even if only a very tiny one. That and the fact that we'd just met made me feel like taking it easy, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, I couldn't help but say, \"Not that I really mind the surprise. It's not everyday a good-looking guy crawls out from under my dresser.\" My face flushed bright red, and I leaned back a little, as if shocked by myself. \"I, uh... Sorry.

My face was flushed with blood, and I could feel the heat in my cheeks. I'd never been good with talking to people, let alone cute boys. And now was probably really not the best time at all. Still, though, you'd flirted right back after my initial outburst. Could it be that you were actually interested in me, too, despite the current predicament?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was I thinking? A toy-sized stranger appears from under my dresser, and my first thoughts are about flirting and ogling? What a first impresion. You probably thought I was some kind of super-sized pervert. Of course, I was dressed in some rather skimpy shorts and a midriff-bearing shirt that did little to hide my cleavage, so there was a fair amount to be seen from your end.  I scooted a little bit closer to you, which leads to a bit of bouncing. You might smell the sweet fragrances of lavender and vanilla from my body products on me from this distance, or see the soft glossy sheen on my fingernails and toenails from a recent makeover. I smiled down at you, trying to be friendly and reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... thanks, Jake.\" My blush has settled a bit, but it's still quite obvious on my mostly pale face. \"So, if you don't know and I don't know what's going on...\" I looked upwards for a moment and thought, tapping a finger against my teeth. What was the proper process for dealing with a shrunken guy? It wasn't like I could just take you down to the police and say, 'Hey, look what I found under my dresser'. Or was it like that? My brain was too befuddled to do any real thinking... or at least, any thinking beyond how handsome and cute you were. I tried again to steer my thoughts away from that and turned back down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really not sure what to do about this whole... thing...\" I made a general waving gesture with my hands. \"And it's getting pretty late, so I don't think there's anything more to be done for the night. Do you... maybe wanna sleep here and try to sort things out after I get out of school tomorrow?\" I really didn't have time to go anywhere before school started, and first period was a group project thing. No way I could miss that and still expect an A...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRambling again. Sorry... I focused back on you on the ground, waiting to hear if this plan's all good for you.</span></div></div>",

But that was all fantasy, and the one time I'd tried, I'd been so nervous that I'd stumbled over the words and gotten only a \"What?\" in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, there I was with a response like that... Maybe it was the pressure of the scenario? She was certainly beautiful, and with more than a little bit on display, a display that you certainly weren't standing against. But what if she'd thought it was stupid? A girl a thousand times your size was not someone to piss off with a dorky one-liner. But... it had worked, I think. I blushed, chuckling nervously under my breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you scooted closer, I looked up just in time to notice that bouncing as the scent of your...bodywash? perfume? whatever it was wafted to me, a gentle mix of scents I couldn't quite place but that I quite enjoyed, a blush coming over my face. I hoped I was too small for it to be noticeable, but something told me it totally was. When you smiled, I smiled back, glad to be reassured that wasn't too dumb a thing to say. You were talking, clearly still thinking things through while you chose your words. I listened along patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yeah, I think that sounds like a pretty good plan. Long as me staying here's not a bother, it works for me.\" I nodded my approval of the idea, but I did really hope I wasn't being a bother.

Well, at least we were in the same boat when it came to being in casual clothes. Granted, your shirt covered all of your torso, but it was still pretty even. I could see the blush on your little face and wondered just what was causing that. Hopefully not the sight of me in such little clothing. I supposed there was a lot of things an inch tall guy could get embarrassed about, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that any of that really mattered at the moment. Tiny or not, dressed or not, you were in need of help, and I wanted to help. It was the right thing, and it wasn't like my life was terribly exciting and busy otherwise. Plus, as had been made rather obvious by my none-too-sneaky flirting and ogling, I found myself rather interested in you and your attractive figure. You were handsome in your own sort of way, and hopefully you might find me at least a bit appealing in turn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I obviously don't have a bed your size...\" I gave a short, slightly nervous chuckle as I tried to lighten things up. \"But I think I can make up a sort of mattress-y thing for you...\" I stand up and walk over to the hutch in the corner. From your perspective on the ground, you could watch as I pulled things from drawers and messed around with something. It wasn't until I came back over and kneeled back down that you'd be able to see my idea. It was one of those little heart-shaped pillows, about as thick and large as a hand. This particular one was in a soft pink hue, and you could easily see that I'd added on a cotton ball for a pillow and a soft silk hankie as a giant sheet. The whole thing looked, to be honest, rather tacky, like the kind of thing you might see in some goofy honeymoon suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed again with that same nervous tone. \"I, uh... I know it's not exactly ideal, but it's the most comfortable little thing I have. Unless you wanted to curl up on my applicator puff and get powder all over you...\" I was clearly very unsure what to do, and when I got nervous, I started to joke around more than I probably should. \"Uh, anyways, so there's two options here. This could just go on my nightstand. The problem is that someone might come in and see you, and I think we should probably limit the number of people that know about all... this... until we can maybe find out a little more. Or, if you'd be okay with it, we could put this in the drawer and leave the drawer a little open. You'd have light and air, but it might feel a bit claustrophobic and, uh, you'd be in a drawer. But you'd be hidden from sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fidget a little, resisting the urge to tug on my shirt and pull it down. I was still a bit shy about showing so much skin around you, but you didn't seem to mind and I'd just be drawing attention to it in the process. \"Of course, the choice is yours, Jake. I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable, so you can sleep outside the dresser if you'd prefer that...\"</span></div></div>",

I'd slept on the floor more than a few times in my life before I'd shrunk. I could manage something equally bare now, if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you seemed to get an idea, proclaiming it and walking over to a hutch in the corner. I watched you go, admittedly getting a better look at your figure than I'd had when you were hanging over the edge of the bed. I hadn't realized your shorts were quite so...short. Granted, it was hard to complain. And when you bent over the hutch to root through the drawer, let's just say I admired the view. We both seemed to be getting an eyeful of each other tonight, it just seemed fair. Yeah, let's go with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you were finished messing with whatever you'd found, and you came back carrying what amounted to a tiny version of a honeymoon suite bed that at my size was honestly still the size of a king mattress at least. Despite that, you looked unsure about it. So I tried to encourage you. \"Hey, it looks great. A bed fit for a tiny emperor.\" The emperor of Vegas, perhaps. \"I'll be happy to sleep in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the question of location came up. Have to say, I wasn't particularly crazy about sleeping in a drawer. I'd much rather be closer to you and not shut up in a box I couldn't open or get out of without assistance. But I was even less crazy about someone wandering in in the middle of the night and investigating Wiley's new doll on the nightstand. So I thought over the options and decided it was for the best. \"I think... if you think it's safer, I'll go with the drawer.\" I nodded, as if to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, how bad could it be? Worst case, there were a few things in there with me. But things weren't a threat. Well, non-moving things. And they certainly didn't have prying eyes like someone wandering in would. I could think of it as an enormous room all to myself if I needed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thank you, for all of this.

I was the 8 year old little brother of one of your acquaintances. You had babysat me a few months ago for the weekend. I was a polite and quiet boy, and so not much trouble. But even back then I had somewhat creeped you out. It wasn't anything in particular, I just had an unsettling little air about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I knelt down over you, my messy brown hair fell over my face, my unnaturally bright blue eyes seeming to shine out beneath it. \"I hope you'll be more fun then the others. You're the first grownup that I've shrunk. Normally it was just my siblings or kids at school. I hope you'll be more fun.\" This was unnerving, because as far as you knew I was an only child. Your friend had never mentioned any other kids, and there was no sign of them when you stayed the weekend with me. That left a few possibilities and none of them were good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wearing a black sweater and shorts, and as I squatted over you I reached down to grab you in my giant hand. \"Now I guess I'll show you around the house, since you'll be staying here if all goes well. If not, you'll have to join my siblings.\"</span></div></div>",

I tried to steady myself, looking around for the cause. My eyes fell on an enormous young boy walking through an equally enormous door into...wait, this was all a huge room? I looked around in fear and amazement as you began to speak, listening and growing more worried by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gaze came back to you, realizing who you were. You were the kid I babysat. Not my usual gig, but when your parents came by begging with no other options, I didn't really have any choice but to accept. You'd been pleasant enough, well-behaved if a little creepy. A pretty easy weekend, all things considered. I hadn't really given you much thought since then, had even forgotten your name, but here you were towering over me and planning god knows what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...wait, siblings? You were an only child. That's what your parents had told me. A cold chill started to run through me as I considered my current stature and what you could have done to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached for me, I was too scared to move. But even if I weren't, where was I going to run? Your grip was a little tight, but not strangling and as you lifted me up and explained you were going to give me a tour, I was far more concerned with that last bit. I didn't want to ask, but not knowing what you'd done was going to be even worse. \"Where, uh, where exactly are these siblings of yours?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing you see upon opening your eyes is, in fact, nothing at all. A seemingly endless white void stretches beyond sight in every direction; no light or shadow exists, and the only hint that there is even a ground is that your feet are resting on something. Some invisible force holds you immobile, and so all you can do is look around at all the nothingness. It's a very surreal experience, both soothing and nauseating, and it gives a bit of a migraine. Though there's no true light source anywhere, the sheer white is almost painfully bright; it's certainly enough to make you squint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, your body begins to shiver and shake in a very discomforting and slightly painful manner, as if convulsing and attempting to simultaneously explode and implode. A harsh, high-pitched whine rings in your ears, and your vision blurs. You can still see enough, however, to watch as the brilliant white fades, dulling, to a muted hue of off-purple. Above you, the unpleasant color fades into a bland grey, as if obscured by smoke or some indistinguishable mass of cloud. Even as you blink the fuzziness from your sight, it becomes no more obvious whether it's one or the other. Looking down, you notice two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the ground is now clearly existent. A featureless hard surface of a creamy, off-white color, with no distinct markings or pattern lies beneath you; it's as expansive as the rest of everything else in this unnatural place and just as mysterious. It feels somewhat warm to the touch, though, as you can feel through your bare feet. That leads to the second thing you've just noticed - you don't have a single shred of clothing on, not even a pair of boxers. Your lack of clothing might not be some tragic disaster, but it certainly doesn't alleviate the sense of discomfort and insignificance that almost seems to ooze forth from your surroundings. At least, you note, you can move now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sort of train of thought abruptly ends, though, as something huge slams down before you. A few feet closer, and you wouldn't be alive to see the sight before you. It's an oddly flat mass of soft, dull purple, with five bulbous masses protruding from the front. Each mass has some sort of rounded translucent stone protruding from it, ringed in brighter tones at the edge. It all seems oddly familiar somehow; your mind snaps to realization as your eyes follow the column rising up from the back of the gigantic foot, up legs as thick as trees and over a torso bare but for a ragged back loincloth - that, you notice, doesn't do much to cover the dangling bits from your perspective. You meet the eyes, cold and unnaturally blue, and stumble back a little. Now fully aware, it's all too easy to take in the full sight of the titanic man before you; he has to be at least four times as tall as you, and he's notably male, from the body hair on his chest and arms and legs to the beard across his chin to the bulge of his crotch. His skin is an unusual shade of purple, but other than that and the impossible size, he seems quite human. You almost come up to his knees, and he seems more than a little amused by your surprise as he towers over you, taller by comparison than a two-story building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on time. I do so enjoy that expression...\"</span></div></div>",

I was in a void of whiteness with nothing to tell me I was anywhere but something below my feet I couldn't look to see. My body won't move. Or at least, something won't allow it to. As I stare into the void, at least as best as I can through my squinting eyes, my head starts to pound. Yet I stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill runs up my spine, then back down it, then up again. Then it spreads until my entire body is shivering. It gets more intense. I'm shaking, Shaking violently. It feels like I'm trying to shake both forward and back, then back and forward simultaneously. I shut my eyes and cry out as my body attempts to rip itself apart. I'm not sure if I hear the scream. My ears begin to ring and the void, even devoid of anything beyond the whiteness manages to fade into a blur, then into a strange shade of purple that makes me want to vomit. Slowly it turns to a more bland, but much more tolerable grey and each time I blink my vision begins to return. Somewhere along the line, the shaking stopped and the ringing in my ears vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor. Or...the ground? It does exist. I look down and confirm this. It's an off-white, much more pleasant than the white of the void, and it's warm. Comforting... I look down to my own feet, then up the rest of myself, eyes widening as I realize that I'm stark naked with nothing between me and this strange world I've found myself in. Instinctively, I try to cover myself with my hands and find, with some satisfaction, that I can move once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I have little time to enjoy this realization as something enormous and purple crashes down in front of me and my heart leaps into my throat. I fall back in fear, staring at the impossibly huge thing that just fell several feet in front of me and very nearly removed me from this world I'd just arrived in. My gaze rose from the thing, up the purple tower stretching out of it, my mouth gaping wide as I realize that I'm looking at a leg, and attached to it an impossibly large, purple man wearing little more than I was. My eyes continue to climb, and I pull myself back in fright as I meet this man's icy blue eyes staring right back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand back up, trying to take in the sight, try to make sense of what's happening. I barely come up to his knee. What's going on!? That's when he speaks. He...expected me? And it sounded like something like this had happened before? My mind flooded with questions. My mouth continued to gape. I stared at him for several seconds. Then the dam holding back my thoughts bursts and out they flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? Who are you? How did I get here? What are you going to do to me? Please don't kill me...\"</span></div></div>",

He doesn't really seem to care though; if anything, it only seems to amuse the unnatural titan, judging by the tilting smirk on his face. \"You're an awful curious little guy, aren't you?\" He tsks, a glamor of disappointment flitting across his features. \"I thought you'd have better manners than to be so inquisitive without even introducing yourself. And in your birthday suit, no less!\" He huffs and folds his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he explodes in a puff of... colored smoke? Mist? Some sort of gas that quickly dissipates. Before you can look around, he walks from behind you, now only a little taller than yourself. \"Not that I mind the peep show, Jake, really,\" he teases. Those icy eyes flicker and fade into a grassy green; you're held immobile again, though now your body is tingling slightly and you're forced spread eagle. The man, if he can even be called that, chuckles and looks you over. \"Actually, you're a bit of a looker. I can see why you were... picked...\" The last word, oddly emphasized, sounds more like a decision than a statement, and his voice holds a bit of a guarded tone. But then he's back to smirking, and as you're frozen, he takes the moment for a bit of personal amusement by grabbing hold of your exposed penis. Purple fingers idly fondle and grope against sensitive flesh as he looks down at it, his expression distant and thoughtful. He releases your shaft, but the unfortunate combination of the not-unpleasant tingling and all that... stimulation, leaves it less than flaccid, though not willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute,\" he says with that same damned smirk. His eyes flicker back to blue, and you find yourself free to move. \"Don't bother covering up, human. I'm more than familiar with dicks and modesty will get you nowhere. Besides, you and I will be getting more personal soon enough.\" He snaps his fingers, and a bar with a bottle of whiskey and two glasses on it pops into existence. The strange person rounds the bar as an apron with \"Kiss the Omnipotent Being\" written on it materializes over him. \"Now, let's talk, Jakey boy. You're in my realm; it's kind of hard to put it in words you'd understand, but let's just say it's a place of emotions. Who am I, you ask? Good question, simple enough. Some of you humans called me Jivolvo way back when, but you can just call me Jeevesy for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pours into both glasses and offers one to you. \"Now here's the part you're really not gonna like. I'm not gonna kill you, but that's kind of a moot point. Y'see, you already died. That's why you're here, bub.\"</span></div></div>",

Did he think this was funny? When he spoke, I tried to be quieter despite my silence, fearing I'd brought some wrath upon myself. Despite that fear, I couldn't help but notice this man was...oddly human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the moment of that realization, he turned into a cloud of smoke. Great. I gaped at where he used to be, trying to grasp what was going on when I heard his voice again. This time for behind me, less booming. I whipped around when he spoke, freezing in place before I could even reacquire my footing, my legs seeming to spread on their own. Wait...how did he know my name? What was this guy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzling over this, I watch him move as best as I can as he walks a circle around me, looking me over and stopping in front once more. The compliment didn't make me feel any better, and only brought more questions. Picked? What the hell? But even if I could have shown my discontent, it was interrupted by an abrupt hand gripping my junk. A chill runs up my spine as I'm handled, frozen lips trying to let out a gasp and limbs trying against impossible odds to step away from the uninvited groping. And when he steps back, I find to my disavail that my body approved where I didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remarks on it briefly and suddenly I'm free again, immediately taking a few steps back before settling myself and trying to cover up my blatant erection. I try to ask how he knows me and what he's talking about, but he's talking again before I can. I let my hands fall to my sides. He's got a point... but more personal? Seriously, what the hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snaps and before my eyes appears a bar, a bottle of what can only be whiskey and two glasses sitting on top of it. God, I could use a drink... My captor was now wearing an apron flaunting himself as an omnipotent being...and to be honest, that was the first thing to make this scenario make any sense all day, if just a little. Then he's talking again. Using my name again... His realm...? Jivolvo? So he was some sort of god?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea fit solidly enough, but the concept just couldn't click as real. Why would a god just be kicking around on Earth? Or...wherever the hell we were. When he offered me the glass, I stepped over and took it graciously with a mumbled \"Thank you.\" Then I took a long swig, savoring the familiar burn as it went down and hoping the other effects would hit sooner rather than later and take the edge off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when his voice turned a bit more serious. And with each word, the pit in my stomach felt heavier and heavier. I stared into my drink for a few moments after he finished speaking. \"I'm...I'm dead...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem real. My next questions came slower than my last barrage, trickling out of me as I tried to understand it all. \"But...how? When? I was perfectly healthy. I... I was living a normal life. I think... You said I was picked... Did...did someone kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on top of that, why was I here? I wasn't exactly an adherent believer in pearly gates and fiery pits, but this didn't line up with anything I knew of...which made sense, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, throwing back another swig of whiskey, the glass almost empty now, and all my questions molded into one short one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Why?\"</span></div></div>",

A faint sweet smell can be sensed in the cool wind that whispers across you, and the very air seems to bear a sort of clinging, muggy weight. Dark clouds roll through the gray sky overhead. Jivolvo regards his drink for a moment and sets it onto the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't know.\" The sentence draws out, as if he were contemplating every syllable before letting it past his lips. \"Or, to be more exact, we don't know.\" He prods at your chest with a finger, and you're nudged back to sit in a soft chair that definitely wasn't there a moment ago. The purple-skinned man sits down in a similar chair and crosses his legs. \"Usually when you pass on, you're aware of your own passing and can recall what happened. In most cases, you even appear in a clean version of whatever you were wearing at the time of death.\" He leans forward and purses his lips. \"What's interesting about you, though, is that you are, for all intents and purposes, a blank slate. You have a name and vague memories, but you have absolutely no information or special characteristics about your death or being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder rumbles in the distance, and Jivolvo's mouth shifts into a slight frown. \"Your essence, or soul if you'd prefer, was floating in the great aether, without any direction or claim upon it. Obviously, I managed to find you, but that raises two very curious questions: what happened that turned you from a living person into a blank soul, and why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands, chair vanishing out of existence, and starts to pace back and forth before you. The chef's apron, the only article he's wearing, shifts into a dark red cape that flaps in the wind. \"It could be a mere accident, a cosmic hiccup in the grand scheme of things, but I'm inclined to think otherwise. Given the right circumstances, a blank soul can be very malleable in any number of ways. There's also sheer energy to be considered, potentially as a weapon of some sort. Your condition could even be the symptom of some new force at play. Of course, speculation is just speculation without any sort of basis or information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to you, grabbing the bottle of whiskey from the bar, and reaches out to refill your glass. \"So! Here is my proposition for you, dear Jake. I'd like to help you out. I can point you to where you can learn things about your condition, and I can help with whatever might come about. If it all ends up shiny, I might even be able to send you back to your physical body and your life. A cosmic Get Out of Jail Free card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder rumbles again, louder than before, and his eyes flash to a muted jade green. \"Interested?\"</span></div></div>",

And my stomach becomes a lead weight. Suddenly I regret my last thought. And then he turns it around, seemingly blaming me as much as himself. His finger prods me in the chest and I stumble back, waiting to hit the ground but landing instead in an admittedly quite comfortable chair. But it does little to calm me, watching him sit across from me in a chair of his own, weather ominously shifting all around us, as I try to grasp exactly what he's telling me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt means nothing to me. I mean, I can put meanings to words, and figure out what's apparently happened, but at the same time, the whole happening is just so damned incomprehensible. So inconceivable. I just sort of sit and stare, baffled as he carries on, half explaining to me, but apparently half thinking out loud as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands, apron shifting into a cape as he does. I remain seated, not sure I trust myself to stand right now, and listen as his explanation becomes more and more out of my range of understanding. He's talking like there's some sort of... cosmic unrest, I guess? Like whatever happened to me is some sort of ingenious plan by someone else like him? But then why was I just floating around in a void? And didn't he say something about me being picked? None of this was adding up, and the whiskey I'd had far too quickly was starting to go to my head. There were questions that needed asking, and answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he grabs the bottle, refilling my glass and turning the conversation from cosmic whatever back toward me. As he details his offer, I'm inclined to jump up and shake his hand before he's finished talking. And I almost do exactly that, but something holds me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I interested...? Extremely... And let's be honest here. In a moment, I'm gonna stand up and shake your hand, consequences be damned.

The very air you breathe seems to possess an aphrodisiac-like effect, triggering certain reactions and stirring lower, less organized sections of the mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJivolvo contemplates your bold questions for a moment. His pale green eyes stare at you, sitting naked in the soft chair, and you can practically feel those dark pupils pierce through you. His gaze is like that of a predator, cold and calculating, and yet also holds an odd sort of sad warmth, like a protector judging what to say to the one it guards. Whether or not he's aware of how the air is starting to affect you is uncertain, but regardless he turns from you and paces slowly to the bar. The cape dissipates into mist and fades away as he leans forward over the bar and... looks down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a distinct pop, and you suddenly feel the chair shift under you, as if nudged by some invisible force. The environment around you has changed again. The ground is now some kind of smooth brown surface that drops off into a grey abyss. It's oddly patterned with darker markings that seem organic in nature, and it has an unusual glossy sheen. Your observation of the ground is disrupted as a massive shadow casts over you. You look up to see Jivolvo, towering over you at what must be a couple hundred feet or more. It might take a moment to connect the dots and realize you've been shrunken and transported onto the bar, now barely a few inches tall by comparison to the looming purple entity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now...\" comes his reply, loud and deep like the rumbling thunder that still echoes in the cloudy skies overhead. \"That is quite a question. After all, why would someone like me help someone like you?\" His fingers tap against the wood before you, drumming out a short, repeating pattern. The air is even thicker now, and it seems to almost cling to you, stirring your body's reactions and raising your temperature slowly but steadily. \"I suppose it might seem odd from your perspective. I'm so powerful and all, so what interest might I have in a single soul?\" He leans closer, and you can feel and smell his hot breath wash over you as he speaks. \"Just one, tiny soul... Unclaimed and unprotected...

First...\" He taps the counter with a single finger. \"Consider it an act of mercy. If it were me adrift in the Aether, unbound and without purpose, I would want someone to help me out and try to figure out what happened, too. Second...\" Another tap, this one closer to you. \"I am what you might call a bit nosy. Your case interests me, and I am quite curious to see how things develop and what becomes of your body and your soul. And third...\" Another tap, and his finger lands quite close to you. \"Well, that's a bit complicated. Let's just say that this whole thing might get me back on the scene of things and moving somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crack of thunder booms overhead, and dark clouds shift in the sky as his lips shift into a slight smile. \"Is that answer satisfactory, Jake?\"</span></div></div>",

Something on top of the whiskey, poking and prodding at urges that have no place in a conversation as serious as this one, yet that are now cropping up nonetheless. I try to shake it away, but the feeling persists. On top of it, it becomes very clear very quickly that I've made a poor decision asking these questions. Jivolvo's eyes are staring a thousand miles beyond me but still right at me, and the look on his face says I should have just shut up and agreed when I'd had the chance. I gulped, wanting another swig of whiskey but deciding against in my current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands up, and I watch as he paces to the bar, looking down at... what is he looking at? It's an empty bar to- Before I finish my thought, everything suddenly shifts. I clutch the chair's arms fruitlessly until it settles back into place wherever it now is. The ground is smoother now, darker. Sort of... brown. I look down, turning pale as I realize where I recognize this texture, and becoming afraid to look back up as a shadow looms over. Still, I turn my head slowly toward the sky to realize I'm what's so interesting on the bar top, the purple god towering over me like a mountain. Oh, the mistakes I've made...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice booms and I shrink (apt wording) further into the chair as he begins to explain. With each point, his finger, bigger than my entire body drops onto the bar. And with each point, it gets closer to my miniscule form and the chair it sits in. The final point brings with it a prodding far too close to me for comfort, leaving me speechless, able to keep from whimpering but just barely as thunder cracks dramatically above him to punctuate his final question. I open my mouth wordlessly a few times, then manage to find my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it's more than satisfactory. Truly... I-I'm very interested in this deal you offered... How do we start?\"</span></div></div>",

As the smoke dissipates in the air, the smell of the aphrodisiac-like effect gets even stronger, overwhelming your sense of smell. Every breath tastes warm and a little salty, and a quiet ringing echoes in your ears. Luckily, the warmth is a welcome comfort to your naked body, but that still leaves you very exposed as the chemical reactions boil over in your body like a closed pot. Jivolvo's hand brushes against your bare shoulder, and a cool electrical tingle shudders through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being grins down at you as you sit there. \"Hey, relax a little. You're in good hands here, and I don't harm guests that I bring in here. Fair warning , though, I do like to tease...\" He chuckles and leans closer to you, his face only a few inches from yours. \"I always follow through, of course. Never good to leave people hanging, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a none-too-stealthy glance down to your crotch before he stands upright and paces a couple steps away. \"Starting is simple. You just need to find out how to learn more about your death and what you need to get back home. I know a couple persons who might be able to help with that, even if they are a bit... odd. Rather unusual by your standards, I would say. Still, it's something, so you should go visit them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJivolvo shifts, his purple figure bulking up with more muscle. His beard shifts to sideburns and a small buzzcut of black hair appears on his head. A pair of dusk black boxers pop onto him as he turns towards you again, and you can see that there's a rather definite treasure trail that leads down from his pecs. \"Now then, I think it's time for a little bit of honesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As an entity, I feed off of sexual energy. Attraction, arousal, stimulation, intercourse... That sort of thing. My own state won't help me, so I have to absorb the ambient energy of others. I am a bit dry at the moment, so you'll have to make up for the \"travel fees\" of sending you places. This time, I'll let you decide just how I draw that energy out of you, Jake. You've got your hand there if you feel like a solo show, but I certainly won't mind helping out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple being shifts again, losing muscle mass and body hair. Pecs reshape into a hefty bosom as hips widen and shoulders contract. The result is a very feminine woman with long black hair and only a pair of boxers on. \"I can be like this if it helps... I understand how you young men are, always after certain... things...\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't so bright at all, the quite \"large\" room being poorly lit by a few light sources. The silence around you began to shift, the loud thumps and vibrations shook you over like continuous tremors. This only happened to feel closer as each tremor went on and on, and then stop altogether abruptly. A \"click\" was all loud and clear, followed by the creaking of wood. You couldn't see that well on who happened to walk in, thanks to the dim lighting, but the figure of this person appeared like a slim teen girl. From your point of view, she looked like a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was me, Lily Lancaster, a high school senior. For once, I'm left alone at the house, my parents decided to have their week-long honeymoon vacation...thank god I was an only child. I didn't really find anything so interesting in life, pretty much stuck in my \"fantasies\" in my free time, but I always wondered what would make everything for me interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What time are you coming over?...of course there's no one over at my house,\" I say over to my cell phone, walking into my barely lit room, kicking the door behind me closed. With me being quite occupied with the phone call, I wouldn't realize that there was at least some tiny person on my bedroom floor. Growing a little impatient that this call was taking forever, I wiggle my toes of my exposed bare feet, a slight stench lingered from the moist sweat. To you, even my pinky toe appeared just as big as you are. \"Alright, I'll see you later,\" I finally close off the call, glad that was over. Exhausted from school and today overall, I drop my backpack onto the carpet floor, just a few inches away from accidentally crushing you below. I walk over to my bed, which wasn't so far from where you were, and I sit at my bed's edge while bringing out my laptop. My bare feet's soles hovered over you so closely, that would be intimidating to have that big of feet appear like a single misstep would end you. I didn't know the slightest about you being there, and I wouldn't figure out any time soon.</span></div></div>",

Yes, these felt like giant carpet fibers. Some sort of super shag, maybe? I shook my head, peering around in the darkness and trying to get a better look at it, but there wasn't a whole lot I could really make out, my eyes still adjusting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the earth started to shake. Short, periodic shakes. Like a giant walking if that were a thing that existed. Each time it got worse. I laid down, gripping the carpet as best I could and waiting for it to end. Suddenly, in the distance, what couldn't be, but really could only be an impossibly huge door opened, and in the light coming from behind it, I saw the silhouette of... a girl? But, how was she so big? Or, how was I so small? None of this made any sense! I stared at her, squinting in the light as I wracked my brain for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't get a very good look before she kicked the door closed and the room was dark once more. Just as I was starting to see, she had to blind me with that. Great... But my sarcasm didn't last long as she started to walk again, each step shaking the floor as I watched the figure slip through the darkness with what at her size might have been called grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leapt to my feet, trying to keep balanced as the ground shook and she walked right over me, talking to someone on what I assumed was her cell phone. Her foot soared over me, several inches above, terrifying and awe-inspiring. I got a brief whiff of her sweat and decided to try to avoid any more of it as best as I could. I watched her walk, but was startled out of it when an enormous backpack dropped to the floor several inches away, nearly crushing me. My heart pounded in my chest, and I turned back to look at the girl, the owner of what I was starting to see was probably her room, as she sat on a giant bed, hanging her feet not far from me. Every part of her was massive. Her pinky toe was at least as long as I was tall. Hell, I could probably fit between her toes and she wouldn't even notice... I shivered at the strange thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, I had to focus on something else. I had to get this girl's attention before she stepped on me or something. But...how? I decided to start with the obvious. Her feet dangled too close for comfort. I supposed if I had to, I could probably climb...but I really didn't want to touch them if I didn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey, look down here! On your floor! Hey, miss! Heeeeey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shouted, waving my arms and hoping she might hear me, the growing pit in my stomach telling me it wouldn't be enough. This might be a long day...</span></div></div>",

Well, it was some time, probably an hour before my friend, Jamie, would come over. Might as well find something to do on the internet before then. Luckily, I didn't decide to plug in my headphones this time, a faint voice managed to pull me out of my internet craze. Since when was someone in this house? I was certainly the only one here...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity getting the best of me, I put aside my laptop on my bed and dart my eyes around. Just me and my room from hindsight. But then again...I did hear that distant sound coming from the floor. Feeling a bit like an idiot, I take a glimpse of the carpet floor of my room for anything. Sure, there was my backpack and the other scattered pieces of clothing on the floor...but there was some small figure on the ground. Well...the lighting in the room wasn't really helping, because I couldn't piece it together on what I was staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to my exhausted and tired mind (thanks to school), I had a single thought dominate my mind, since I couldn't decipher on what small thing was on my room floor. It had to be some weird bug. That was the only normal thing I could think of, and I wasn't going to turn on my lights as I felt entirely sure that it was a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be over with quick and easy, raising my right foot over the assumed bug.

Help me out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at me for longer than I would have liked, seeming to try to process what exactly she was looking at. I couldn't blame her. I certainly wasn't accustomed to being this small. I can't imagine why she'd just suddenly accept a tiny guy on her floor. But finally, she started moving. She was doing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...oh god. My grin dropped into an expression of horror as she moved her massive foot over me. \"No, no, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frantically turned around, sprinting and just barely making it out as the foot came crashing down where I was moments before. When it hit the ground, I was tossed into the air with the force, falling on my face before I could get very far away. I rolled over, crying out in anger. \"I'm not a bug! Turn on a light, damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I quickly righted myself and kept running, not wanting to give her another shot. I ran behind her backpack. She'd have to move it to get to me here. If she even saw me get away in this dark room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might need a new game plan...some way to get close enough that she'll see I'm not a bug. Climbing furniture? Maybe. Or maybe I could hitch a ride on some of the clothes strewn on the floor. Not ideal, but that might work. It'd certainly get me close enough...

What was I even freaking out about a bug anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I didn't decide to listen to music, something about the silence in my room was a little refreshing. At least to me, that is. My conscious in the back of my head is repeatedly telling me to clean up my damn room, but I have until a week, so it didn't matter to me now if I decided to pick up all of my scattered clothing.

Climbing up there with her wasn't the safest plan, but damned if I could come up with a better one right now. I hurried toward the sheets, glad she was distracted and keeping my mouth shut lest I test fate and face her foot again. It was a short walk, but it still took several minutes. Did she say she had a friend coming over? When was that? Time was kind of blurry in this surreal, giant world. Getting anywhere took forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried not to focus on that, taking hold of the sheets and finding I could pull myself up fairly easily, if not quickly. But a short while later, uninterrupted, I made it to the mattress, tired but close to my goal. Now I just had to make it to her laptop without getting crushed or rolled on or something on the way there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no time to waste.

Guess I imagine things a lot when I'm alone for more than a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to me, my iPhone 5 vibrated on the bed mattress, and at first I was going to ignore it. But then again, I had to check, sighing a bit as I stopped typing. My hand reaching over to my phone, and seeing that it was just a check-up text message from my parents. Well...I just sent to them a simple \"I'm good\" text message back, there really wasn't much to say than the fact that I was alone. After sending that message, I put my phone back onto the mattress, right next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the tiny guy I didn't know of yet, my phone was placed rather close to you. Then it was back on my laptop once again, distracted from anything that would happen. Time sure flies fast, but I wondered how long it takes my friend to get over to my house.

There was the girl, of course, typing away on her laptop by the looks of it, completely unaware I was here. Her phone was laying next to her on the otherwise pretty bare bed. Should be an easy walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I went, crossing the mattress. It was quicker than walking through the thick carpet or climbing the dangling sheets, but it still wasn't anywhere close to quick going. I sighed, about halfway across when I noticed the giant phone sitting next to me. If I laid down next to it, it'd still be several times my height. This was ridiculous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it started to vibrate and I fell back in shock as it shook the bed underneath me, unnoticeable to her probably. but a small earthquake to me. I saw her sigh and reach back without even looking, crawling back from it to let her enormous hand carry it away, type something and then carry it back. As she went back to her computer, I stared at the phone, wondering if I could use it somehow to get her attention. But by the time I hit the unlock button, if I could push it hard enough this small, and got to the slider, the screen'd be off again. Let alone actually typing out a message without walking on every letter in between. I was better off trying more directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I carried on. I tried to keep a fair distance from the girl, not wanting to be accidentally run over by her arm or something, and when I reached roughly her elbow, I looked up at her. I had to get into her vision. Not the peripheral, then I might just look like a bug again and she might swat without looking. There was no guarantee she'd hear my voice. So I had to be quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prepared myself, then started jogging toward the laptop. When I felt suitably close, I looked at her again and started waving my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey, down here! I'm not a bug, look!\"</span></div></div>",

It felt like ages, but finally she turned and the look of surprise told me she knew I wasn't a bug this time. I sighed with relief, waiting patiently while she figured out exactly what she was looking at, only flinching away a little when she poked at me, letting her see I wasn't a hallucination or something. Finally, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and I realized I had no idea what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi. This is gonna sound weird. But I just sort of woke up here. On your floor... Tiny... Which is to say, I'm not usually this size. I'm not really sure why I am or how I got here, but I am. And now I don't know what to do, but I figured getting someone's attention was a good first step, so...here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was a rambling mess.

I mean, I would be confused as much as this guy if I woke up in some stranger's room a few inches tall. Of course I was going to help out Jake, but then again...I wasn't so sure how. I didn't even know how he got to my room in the first place either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that explains a little bit...my name's Lily, and...sorry about what happened earlier,\" I responded, also adding in an apology for mistakening him as a bug some time ago. I would had actually killed him back there, at least now I'm aware of this. \"So, since we both kinda don't know what started this mess, you can stay with me until we figure out something...\" I was definitely okay with this...well, until my parents come home, but that's a long time from now. For a moment, even if he was at a small size and hard to see that clearly in the dark, I don't know but I feel a little attracted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I put the main matter back into my mind, enough fantasizing. As I waited for your response, the doorbell went off, reminding me of something I had forgotten since I finally discovered Jake. I definitely forgot about Jamie coming over, and I knew I couldn't let her see him at all. Being friends with her for the longest, and I know how \"extreme\" her fantasies are whenever she decides to spill it out to me. First of all, I didn't want to hide him somewhere in my room, I just couldn't stand leaving him where I wouldn't be able to help him if something happened. So, without giving Jake much input on what was going on, I quickly and gently picked him up and stuffed him into my jeans pocket. At least there, I would feel him no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on, okay? I can't let my friend see you,\" I say so at least it reassures him that I was looking out for him. Knowing that Jamie was waiting for me to open the door, I walked out of my room and headed for the front door, but not so fast so I wouldn't give him a bumpy ride.</span></div></div>",

And now that I was getting a better look at her, illuminated by the laptop screen, she was pretty, well, pretty...But now was not the time for that. I pushed those thoughts away, listening as she spoke. I was glad she was sorry, but I wasn't going to bring up the almost squashing. She hadn't know, and truth be told, I was happy enough to forget about that scrape with death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... I promise I won't be much of a hassle.\" She didn't seem particularly upset about it, but I did still feel a little bad intruding on her this way. Even if it wasn't my choice and I just sort of wound up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in the distance I heard the door bell ring. This must be Lily's friend come to hang out or whatever it was they had planned. I looked up to Lily, who seemed to be thinking over something very important. I wondered who her friend was, and if she'd be as accepting of my stature. The last thing I wanted was to be mistaken for a bug again. Lily looked like she'd come to a decision on whatever was bugging her and before I had much time to think, I was suspended in the air, lifted gently by her. and carried toward an opened pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wai-\" Before I could get two words out, I was dropped inside, slipping in, now pressed between the fabric of her jeans and her leg, a snug but not terribly uncomfortable fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn't let her see me...? Well, that didn't bode well. But maybe it was just until she explained the situation. I mean, it was crazy, but explain it, then show me and it should be easy enough to understand. We'd both taken to it fairly quickly. Still, off Lily went, presumably to the door to let her friend in. The ride was a little bumpy. Each step shifted me a little, but thanks to the tightness of her jeans, I was kept from bouncing around pretty well. I waited patiently in the warm pocket, wanting to hear this conversation and get a feel for the new girl.</span></div></div>",

With that checked, I finally unlock the door and open it wide to see a close friend of mine from school. Jamie was roughly almost the same height as me, just a bit taller. Some people like to call us opposites based on our appearances and personalities. While Jamie had her short curly auburn hair, I had my straight blonde hair that went all the way down to my elbows. Personality-wise, I was seen with a more simple and quiet attitude, and Jamie's the one that doesn't think twice of consequences before her actions with the fact that she over-exaggerates too. But hey, that didn't rule out that we were friends in the first place. Though, knowing Jamie that well, I knew she would be a little irrational if she ever finds out of my tiny passenger in my pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jamie, that took awhile for you to get here...and you've brought your dog too,\" I smiled as she walks in, holding the make-shift leash she had for her german sherpard dog. \"That's what took me so long to get here Lily! My parents told me to bring Wendy over if I were going to go out. I hope that's fine with you,\" she says with some exclamation. Once they were in, I closed the door, while remarking,\"Sure, I'm alright with that. Just hope Wendy's potty trained, or else I'm not cleaning after it.\" Jamie only laughs a bit at my subtle joke, it's like she takes everything as a joke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I noticed that the dog began to sniff my pocket, oh god, Wendy probably could smell the tiny passenger in my pocket. \"So, what have you been doing here? I mean, your parents went on vacation yesterday,\" Jamie brings this up, her curiosity has been her best quality, and it never fails her. \"Just blogging. It is a hobby after all,\" I said, that was pretty much the normal portion of what happened with me so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, while I lead Jamie to the living room of the house, Wendy began to sniff at the pocket where Jake was in, but this time really taking a whiff as if the dog knew there was a stranger in my pocket. Probably after all of that dog sniffing, Wendy began to bark loudly at my pocket, and was about to bite at my jeans and also Jake. Moments before, I tumbled backwards to avoid the agitated dog, falling over on my butt roughly. That fall was a little unexpected, but....I didn't feel Jake's tiny body in my pocket anymore. Shit! Did he fall out when I landed? Luckily Jamie wasn't looking this way, she's busy trying to calm down her dog, but I couldn't figure out where he had fallen. Great, I couldn't see him on the carpet floor anywhere near me, he probably tumbled off under the couch that was beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, sorry about that Lily. That usually doesn't happen with Wendy at all,\" Jamie put her attention back on me, and I mentally cursed. Guess I can't look for him right now, I get back on my feet after the fall. \"I'm fine, so it's okay,\" I simply say, but I worried on where he was.</span></div></div>",

I gave her a thumbs up and she turned back to, presumably, the door. I listened intently from the pocket as it opened and her friend came in...Jamie, was it? And...a dog. I hadn't considered animals at this size. The thought of being snapped up in an instant flashed through my mind, and I tried to push it away with a shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focused on their conversation. Jamie sounded nice enough, but how much could you really judge on someone's voice?I heard another noise alarmingly close to me. Beginning to be frightened, I recognized a dog's sniffing directly behind me, and it wasn't moving. This dog had my scent and it was big enough to sniff Lily's pocket. I wanted no part of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lily talked, she started moving again, taking me away momentarily before the dog caught up, sniffing more. Abruptly, it started barking, scaring the hell out of me. That was when everything went nuts. Lily fell over, either pushed by the dog or by tripping on her own. But as she fell, her pocket twisted open just right and when she hit the ground, I was launched out of it, catapulting briefly through the air and coming to a stop under the couch. When I hit the ground, I rolled a bit further, and as soon as I had my senses, ran further in where I figured the dog probably couldn't fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out, I saw Lily on the floor, Jamie's feet and what looked to be a German Shepard. Great. Just the breed I wanted in this situation. If nothing else, I was fairly certain it was too big to get under here. And thank god for that. Two seconds with those teeth and I was dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured Lily was probably looking for me, but with her friend right there, she probably couldn't look too hard without explaining. And I didn't blame her for wanting to avoid that. But I was trapped here until she could grab me or the dog went somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed there, under the couch, watching and waiting for some sort of opening to get back to her. Or hell, to Jamie. I wasn't going to be picky when the alternative was dog hunting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was so much going on in my head, I really needed to get Jake out of this situation before it becomes unnecessarily worse. Out of all the factors that would make this worse, Jamie's dog had to go outside. I couldn't imagine him being Wendy's chew toy, just had to get that factor out and done with, and it would be easy for Jamie to understand as Wendy appeared as if she were about to maul me. \"Just in case your dog has another...er, aggression moment, you can leave Wendy outside in the backyard. She might soon tear up the furniture and stuff,\" I say in suggestion, knowing what she was going to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's completely fine. Don't want ol' Lilly-Milly getting in trouble 'cus of my dog,\" Jamie grins at me, bringing up the specific nickname that she had called me before back in the 3rd grade. As much as we are friends, something about that nickname feels so weird after hearing it again at this age. \"I'm going to get the TV on, hopefully there's something good on,\" I add, just having the feeling I should say something just to keep my friend occupied on what I'm doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jamie tending to her dog and heading for the backyard, I had just about some tight time before she brings her attention back to me. I get myself down on the floor, peeking under the couch and seeing that he was hiding under there after the sudden fall. It was either wait and hide there or get mauled over by the dog. Quick, I try to reach my arm under the couch, using my hand to feel if I get a hold of him. A few more moments and I would had gotten him in my grasp, but Jamie's voice catches me off-guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, the TV remote's under the couch again. Geez, let me get it for ya. I could probably reach it,\" Jamie notices me reaching my arm under the couch, assuming that I was trying to get the TV remote. Well...I couldn't really tell how this would end up, but before I could even comment on this, Jamie gently pushes me aside and reaches her arm under the couch. Soon, she manages to get a grip over Jake, and I could tell by her confused expression upon feeling him. \"Um...\" she mumbles in confusion, pulling her arm out from under the couch and seeing Jake in-between her index finger and thumb. A feeling of complete awkwardness surrounded me, and I abruptly blurt out,\"Before you start to think anything funny Jamie, I could explain this whole thing. It's a rather long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for some moments, Jamie curiously stared at him as if she were making sure this was something she was actually seeing. Knowing her well, I have a feeling that she would react in some way strangely. Finally, she breaks the silence, happily squealing,\"Omigod!! He's so cuuuuuttttteeeeee!!\" Following her whole excitement, she held him close to her chest, acting like she were hugging him. At least her grip didn't seem that tight on him. \"C'mon now Jamie, don't over do it. You might hurt him if you're not careful,\" I sigh a bit. Well...this had gone worse, and luckily for now it seemed like Jamie didn't have any \"funny\" ideas.</span></div></div>",

But if it had seen me, before it got the chance to investigate, Lily was on top of it, getting Jamie to put her outside. I breathed a sigh of relief. That'd give her a second to get me out as well. This was perfect. I listened to their brief conversation, then saw Lily's face peering under the couch, followed by her arm reaching for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize just how deep under the couch I've gotten. She won't be able to reach me here. So I start booking it forward, not wanting to blow this timing. But just as I'm about to get to her hand, I hear Jamie's voice coming back into the room taking control of the situation. Practically in slow motion, I watch as Lily's hand is pushed aside and Jamie's replaces it, wrapping around me before I can really think to react. Her hand froze. Couldn't blame her. I definitely wasn't a remote, so I probably wasn't what she was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I'm being pulled out into the light, staring up into the face of who can only be Jamie. I had to admit, she was pretty cute too. But this wasn't the time or the place for such thoughts. I stared up and she stared back while Lily tried to explain what was going on. I wasn't sure what to do. The tension was thick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she squealed and hugged me to her chest, pressing me against her and saying something about me being cute. The pressure was a little disorienting at first, but it was much better than being between a shoe and a hard place. Kind of nice, actually. This was definitely not the worst way this could have gone. A little bit of good luck to balance out the day, I figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressed against her as I was, I couldn't really say anything or see much, but I did hear a slight sigh that I assumed was Lily. She seemed relieved. That was good. But I didn't really see what the big deal about this girl was. She seemed pretty harmless.</span></div></div>",

Well..she definitely took this situation better than how I first found Jake earlier. That I will admit. \"I know what you're trying to say...*sigh*...\" I sighed, knowing her so well. Jamie was probably thinking that she could take him home with her. Not sure what exactly why she wanted to in the first place...but her \"fantasies\" were a complete mystery to me. \"Yeah...so, what's the story here?\" Jamie scratched her head in embarrassment after asking that, then wondering what I had to explain this. I noticed that her grip on Jake loosened, signalling that she's calmed down from her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that's Jake. He just happened to wake up on my bedroom floor like that, and I found him after he managed to get my attention once he got onto my bed. So, I promised to take care of him until we hopefully get some way to get him back to normal...but I tried to keep him a secret from you when you came over,\" I explained, stuttering occasionally but at least I didn't sound so out of it. It only took a few moments for her to realize that her dog almost made a snack out of him, I could tell from her change of expression, but it suddenly changed back to her bright self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll keep this a secret for you two. Sounds good?\" Jamie smiled. She'll keep her word, I know her that well. Pretty much why we're such close friends for so long. \"So...Er, did I squeeze you too tight?

I started to wonder, but when my mind began wandering a bit...off-track, I decided to leave it be. I turned my head best as I could to look at the girls as they spoke. Lily just seemed sort of tired, like this whole discovery had been pure stress. It didn't seem so terrible, dog aside, at least as far as I could see. Did make Jamie's motives a little suspicious, but how much better did I really know Lily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. Stop think-rambling. More important things going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to Lily recount my own short story, nodding along. She just about covered it, near-stomping aside. But that wasn't too important in the long run... I felt a slight cringe from Jamie at some point, probably when she realized what her dog had almost done... But all in all, she seemed pretty agreeable. Willing to not go telling everyone about me. Which was good. I wasn't paranoid of government spooks catching word and coming to get me for tests or anything, but some people wouldn't be as kind as these two. Better to keep things on the down-low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jamie's attention was on me again and I could move again, looking up at her when she spoke. \"Nah, I'm fine. I'm a little tougher than I seem...\" That remained to be seen, but saying it made me feel a little more confident, so hey. \"Uh, nice to meet you, I guess. Jamie, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd offer a handshake or something equally awkwardly formal if I weren't currently in a hand several times my size. \"So...now that the dog scenario's good, and we're all on the same page about me...what now?\" I was asking myself as much as them. I had no idea where to begin with fixing this mess, and truthfully, I didn't even want to think about it right now. \"I mean, I don't want to throw whatever plans you guys had off track.

She is my best friend, and I know her that well, so it wasn't like she would go and backstab me by telling other people. Though...I started to feel a bit suspicious about her once her phone started to go off. Of course her ringtone was on with some pop song, but at least it wasn't as loud since that could be already loud enough for the little guy. With her free hand she went to take the phone out of her pockets and read the text, which I couldn't see from where I was, but she immediately turned off the phone and put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, uh...maybe we could watch some TV?\" she asked suddenly, and it was obvious when she was keeping something from me. If past memories recall, I do remember that she acts like this when she's done something that basically screws everything over. This was one of this times, and definitely this wasn't the time for it to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Jamie, just spit it out. What was on that text?\" I asked, and knew that whatever it was, it was going to affect their situation on keeping Jake safe until they ever find a way to bring him back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...er, well, remember how I first called you that I was coming over because I thought you were alone here...besides coming here with a dog, er...I actually invited some other people over to have a party here...and then one of my friends that's a part of the group I invited pretty much invited more people over. It's basically like having the entire neighborhood come over soon...\" Jamie explained, having planned some surprise party to happen soon, and it's not just a few friends, but probably the entirety of people in my high school. Not to mention that my parents weren't around, that's pretty much the sign that this isn't going to be a usual party too. It would had been easier with only a few other people, but this would be a challenge just to keep him hidden.

Finally she explained and I realized I had pretty good reason to be nervous. We had a hard enough time hiding me from just Jamie and her dog. The whole neighborhood in one house? This was going to be... interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Lily, but she seemed as shocked as I was. I couldn't blame her, but however we felt what was done was done, and I had a feeling this party was going on no matter what. So I tried to calm her a little. \"Hey... Maybe it won't be so bad. I mean, I'm small. I can hide pretty much wherever if I need to. This can be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed not to get eaten by the terrifying giant dog. How much worse could a horde of people be? \"I mean, I'd rather not have to sit in a drawer somewhere for hours. I'd rather stick with one of you, reckless as that may be. But I will hide if that's what it takes... I feel like I'm the one mucking up plans and making everything stressful here and I feel bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know why I was trying to take some of the heat off of Jamie. It was wildly irresponsible to host a party at someone else's house without telling that person, but she seemed to mean well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood in Jamie's hand, again looking between the two of them and waiting for a plan. \"Just tell me what you guys think is best and I'll do it.\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, it wasn't right to steal from a drunken asshole, but when you make minimum wage getting fucked in the ass in a strip club...literally, I mused...sacrifices had to be made to stay afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the bill into my purse, I stood up and locked the door. Even though I technically should be performing or giving lap dances right now, I decided to, just once, relax in here. Jack wouldn't fire me anyway. The girls say good things about me, and the men love me too much. But it left something to be desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening my stockings, (or trying to, as they seemed to fall apart if I put any amount of force on them), I slumped onto the heart shaped bed, hitting the unnaturally stiff pillow with a thud. As I hit it, I could hear an object on the opposite side of the pillow end up getting knocked into the air. Probably a used condom, I guessed. Sighing, I closed my eyes. Maybe I'd be able to get a good nap in before some other drunk guy comes in to lose their virginity...</span></div></div>",

She was so loud. Like, impossibly loud. Impressive acoustics in here, if nothing else... I rubbed my eyes as my vision started to come back to me, opening them and freezing at what I saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was impossibly loud apparently because she was impossibly large. I stared in amazement as who must have been the source of the shouting slumped against an equally impossibly huge door in the distance, pulling a bill out from between her tits and depositing it in her purse. From the looks of it, whoever she'd yelled at had had some cash after all... But right now, a drunk's money was not my prime concern. It was the provocatively dressed giant now strutting toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes shot to the ground, trying to figure out exactly what was going on. Where I was. Before me was an enormous expanse of velvety red ground, directly below me a smoother... pillow? I looked around again. It was one of those heart-shaped beds you expect in couple's sweets and cheesy hotels. But on the grandest scale possible. And this woman was heading right for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered running as she straightened her stockings, but where was I really going to go? Whether I liked it or not, she seemed like my best shot at figuring out what the hell had happened to me. I just had to hope she took kindly to me. \"Hey, mis-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, she'd slumped onto the bed, head slamming into the side of the pillow I wasn't occupying and launching me into the air with the force of it. I cried out as I spun unceremoniously through the air, landing reasonably softly on the velvety red bed itself, bouncing once, then landing flat on my back, staring up at her as she laid there, apparently oblivious to my presence. I could only hope she wasn't a quick sleeper and that my miniscule voice would reach her ears on top of that mountainous pillow. \"Hey! Hey, miss! Down here! On the bed! Look down here!\"</span></div></div>",

But...I couldn't hear anything? I could swear I heard someone talking about wanting to get on the bed with me, or...something along those lines. Hell, what was I thinking? Really? The voice was so quiet it was probably some jerkoff in the other room talking to some other chick. I don't even know why I'd reacted. But I swore I heard the voice coming from near here...must be my imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying back down on the pillow, not noticing the tiny man trying to get my attention, I again tried to get to sleep. But that voice in the other room was bothering me, for some reason. Even if it didn't concern me, I wouldn't be able to get to sleep if I had to keep listening to it. So I tried adjusting my sleeping position. I shifted around a bit. The voice seemed to only get louder as I did so. \"God, if only they'd shut up...\" I whispered to myself, not expecting anyone to hear it, and fiinally, I adjusted and lay face first in the pillow. Just like that...the faint voice stopped. I wasn't sure why it'd suddenly got so quiet, but I'd take it, and closed my eyes once more. Of course, if I payed more attention, I would've noticed the tiny man getting pinned under me, but my worries seemed to float away as I managed to finally drift to sleep, more then pleased that the noise had finally ceased...</span></div></div>",

But hey, I could deal with irritation. Irritation was attention. Out of her attempted sleep, she shot up, apparently thinking my yelling was coming from the door. I stared up at her face, continuing to yell. \"Down here! Hey! On the bed with you! Heeeey!\" She just looked confused. Like she was hearing me, but at the same time she wasn't. She must have thought I was in another room? Whatever it was, she was not looking down here no matter how much I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down again, and I grumbled, feeling defeated. I kept shouting and she kept moving around, shifting her position, clearly annoyed, but stuck thinking I was somewhere else. I had to get her attention some other way. Watching her toss and turn, I decided the only way to get her to look down here was to touch her. Actually get her to notice there was someone on the bed with her and address what it was poking her. When she finally settled into a position, I stared up at her mountainous breasts, one pressing down on the other as she lay on her side. It wasn't ideal, and she might think I was perving or something, but I wasn't gonna go out of my way to go around. Hell, by the time I reached her stomach or something, she could roll over again. And if she did that, I'd be flattened. No good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I walked up to her titanic left tit, calling up as I pressed a full hand into it, barely moving anything anyway. \"Hey! Down here! Touching you! Look down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to move again, and I looked up expectantly, only to realize she wasn't looking at me. She was rolling. Rolling onto her front. I noticed the shade growing over me, turning to run as I watched her right breast falling over me, her left rolling to cut me off. Before I could get anywhere, she was on top of me and I was, probably luckily, wedged in her cleavage as she settled in, unable to yell being smothered between her boobs, barely able to move. At least I could breath pretty easily enough... And hell, there were less pleasant places to be stuck. Still, I should try to get out of here. Getting found now would be bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started trying to edge out from my precarious position, managing an inch or so (at least, at my size) with every few pushes. It was slow-going. Now I was just hoping she didn't wake up, feel me and go digging. I really didn't want to have to explain this one. Something told me she'd be less than pleased.</span></div></div>",

Getting any more sleep at home would mean almost no time to myself, and I couldn't deal with that. Being tired was a compromise. Of course, if I wasn't so tired, I might've felt a bug trying to crawl it's way through my breasts, due to my precarious sleeping positioning, but I snored on anyway, dimly aware of how much trouble I'd been causing one guy who wanted nothing more to get my attention. I mean, most guys wanted to get my attention, but that's besides the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when the sun goes down and the late-comers start pouring in, loud music and flashing lights is usually what follows. So it's no surprise that I'm awoken by the sound of an ear-splitting hip hop song shaking the walls, the powerful bass rattling my insides a little bit. Rolling over onto my back, I almost didn't notice an object flop out of my cleavage, but, remembering the money I stashed in there before, I glanced at my scantily-clad chest to see if there were any left-overs... and was a bit shocked to see a...doll...fall out? But that's...they don't make dolls that small...and they certainly don't move like people do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the... thing, wide eyed, I waited to see what it'd do next.

At first, I was moving toward freedom bit by bit, but all too late I realized that the force of the steps I managed was actually pressing me further up between her breasts with each step forward. Unfortunately, I was too focused on the little progress I was making to notice this until my feet stopped reaching the bed, now firmly wedged with no way to free myself without outside assistance... Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited like this for a while. Time is hard to read when all you've really got is the rhythmic breathing and heartbeat of a giant woman on all sides. And between that and the warmth of her body, I felt myself getting drowsy. Soon, I was napping right along with her, a moment of peace if nothing else. But all things must come to an end. I was roughly awoken by explosive booming bass around, so loud it actually shook my captor at least slightly, and me with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly I wasn't the only one awake now. I felt her sitting up a bit, then my world turned upside down. As she turned onto her back, I popped out of her cleavage, briefly airborne before falling on top of her right breast, groaning a little as I stood and tried to pull myself together. When I finally did, and opened my eyes, I saw hers, far larger, staring back at me. And for the first time, I was certain she were actually paying attention to me. Her expression said she didn't know what she was looking at, and I knew I didn't have much time. So I started to talk, rambling as I spoke quickly and as loudly as I could, the bass still thumping through the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Hi! I know this looks bad and super weird, but please don't freak out! I'm not sure what happened, but I woke up in here this small around the time you were coming in, then I tried to get your attention, but you didn't hear me. I think you thought I was just someone carrying through the walls, but I was on the bed and when you fell asleep, I tried to get your attention, but you rolled over on me, and that's why I was where I was. I wasn't perving, I swear. I just wanted your attention because I'm lost, tiny, and I have no idea how any of this happened....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent over, taking a deep breath, hoping she'd got all that with the music pounding and would understand at least the important parts. \"So... yeah...\"</span></div></div>",

Trying to piece together what it was in my head, my first thought was that it was a bug, and I almost reflexively sent it flying towards the wall, but...bugs aren't bipedal. Usually, anyway. And they don't usually freeze up in fear at the sight of having been caught. And they don't look so...human. So imagine my surprise, when, out of the blue...I heard it begin to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quiet, gentle voice...or atleast, it was compared to the loud noises coming from the other end of the piece of plaster separating this room and the rest of the club. I wished that the walls would stop shaking for a few seconds so I could hear what it had to say. I didn't dare lean in any closer, though, so I just listened from this angle. I managed to make out a few words, and roughly guess what the words I hadn't heard were supposed to be. Making out a few sentence fragments, I understood, atleast, that 'it' woke up here, was carelessly tossed around by my movements, and ended up...getting stuck in my cleavage, apparently. If I wasn't so shaken up by all this, I'd have atleast thought it was amusing. Or lucky that I didn't carelessly crush him, aswell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut obviously this was no bug. That'd been made clear to me. But I wasn't completely sure what it was. Sure, it was human-like, but humans don't generally have to look up to make eye contact with a barbie doll. No, this thing couldn't be human. Couldn't be! But...what if it was? I couldn't deny the fact that it certainly looked human, and, leaning in closer, it resembled a guy...a naked one, too. And he wasn't bad looking. But what was I thinking! He was smaller then small! If he WAS human, the fact remains that he's terribly small, and as far as I was concerned, magic didn't exist, and science couldn't do this. But... this was all so surreal... I slowly, gently, as to convey that I meant no harm, reached out a hand towards him, with the intent of atleast confirming that I wasn't hallucinating. He seemed concerned at the sight, initially, but he allowed me to reach closer... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open, and I shot upright on the bed, sending the miniature man tumbling down, again, into a valley of cleavage. 'Jack', as he was called, entered the room, and silently closed the door behind him, either not noticing the now missing top door-hinge, or not caring. He looked straight at me, and I was frozen with fear; not necessarily by the fact that Jack was giving me the stink-eye, but because if my new 'friend' tried to climb out, or slipped out, or was even noticed...there's no telling what he'd do. If he even realized what he was in the first place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica...\" he began quietly, pacing around the base of the bed. \"Why is it that you think you can claim one of our private booths as your personal napping station? I'm not sure if you could hear it over the music, but the <i>other</i>, girls, who, I might add, do a far better job than you, are out there right now! Doing their jobs!\". I avoided eye-contact with Jack, and sighed. I wasn't afraid of him, because for some reason or another, I was a favorite among the patrons. And the other girls and I were close friends. As much as Jack hated it, I was an integral part of the club...and it killed him inside. But he wouldn't waste an opportunity to chew me out for doing something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to face the wall, and sat at the base of the bed, so I pulled my legs closer to myself as a reflex. I didn't want to be THAT close to the guy. \"Jessica...I run a respectable business around here...despite the subject matter. So I can't have you doing a poor job. It reflects poorly on the business, and myself! Why, if one of my blah blah partners <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">blah blah blah</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">blah blah</font> ...\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice gradually faded from my mind as I glanced down back at the man trapped between my breasts, which, now that I knew he was a man, I found a tad embarrassing given the circumstance. I just whispered for him to \"Hold on a few more minutes, okay?\" and adjusted my top to try and conceal him a little more, unaware of how this effected the little man, as my boss suddenly whipped his head back around in my direction. \"...did you say something, Jessica?\" he said, looking at me with an intense 'I-Know-Somethings-Up' kinda look. \"Oh, uh, it was nothing, Jack...\". He doesn't really buy it, but slowly, he looks away from me, and returns to his speech. It takes awhile, and I'm paying almost no attention to him, as I was still concerned with the...man...but finally, he, gets up, and I look back up towards him. \"Anyway, Jessica, if you took anything from that...it's that you've got to do a better job tomorrow. You can leave for tonight.\" he said, motioning towards the door. \"You've got 5 minutes to get outta here, Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he left, leaving me a few moments to wrap my heard around everything that's happened before I leave and find my way to my car...if it's still there. Slumping back down on the bed for a moment, I reach into my top to try and fish around for the little guy, hoping that he's not shaken up... and finally, he's deposited onto my hand, and stands up, greeted by the sight of my probably-too-close-for-comfort face. At this angle, though, I could clearly tell he was a human being...even if such a thing wasn't possible. But clearly, it was, as I had all the evidence to prove it sitting in my hands. There was no beating around the bush about it now. I was holding a living, breathing human being. And he hasn't been able to get a word in edgewise for ATLEAST half an hour. I felt a bit guilty...and also a bit powerful. Here he was, a normal man, completely and utterly in my control. It was a bit of a power trip, to be sure. But for now, I just needed to figure out what to do...or more importantly, what HE wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, holding my hand as still as possible, I softly began to speak. \"So... I'm still a bit... shocked to be holding you right now, but what do <i>you</i> want to do? We could go back to my place for the night and try and...discuss...this...but...I'm going to have to carry you through the club to get you out of here, if we do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited patiently for a response.</span></div></div>",

For a second, I thought she was just going to freak out and throw me and that would be that. But as her eyes pierced through me, she seemed to understand that I wasn't just some weird bug. Relief started to wash over me as I realized she was hearing me and she was leaning in for a closer look. Then she started to reach a hand out. Reflexively, I flinched back, but did my best to remain calm and let her touch me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed open, and I was falling. Before she could make contact, the floor beneath me turned a full 90 degrees and I plunged face-first back into her hungry cleavage. I shouted for just a moment before I made contact, sliding in between her breasts until I was wedged well and good. My voice was instantly muffled, so I shut up and listened. I could make out some of the conversation above, although my soft prison did as much to muffle them to me as it did me to her. From what I could understand, it was a man who'd stormed in. Jack, he was called. And Jessica, the woman who's tits I was currently swimming in, seemed to be an employee of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to listen for a minute or two before I started to feel the blood rushing to my head and I realized I had bigger problems than Jessica being scolded. I reached with both arms, looking for anything to take hold of to flip my body over as dizziness started to come over me, but all they reached was soft skin, stretching out in ever direction. I decided it would have to do, digging my fingers into whichever of her boobs was directly in front of me, and trying to twist myself around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked better than I thought. Just as I was feeling a black fuzziness start to overtake me, I got my head vaguely upright and slowly but surely the abilities to think and see started to come back. I stayed there like that until I was back to me senses. How much time had passed? It was hard to tell in that state. But through the muffling, I could tell they were still talking. And I decided I wanted a look. Taking hold once more, I started to crawl upward. It was easier to maneuver in here when Jessica wasn't laying on them and adding her full weight to the mix. It still took a couple minutes, but soon I poked my head out into the fresh air, looking up at my captor and meeting her eyes. She whispered that it wouldn't take much longer, looking distressed to see me popping up. So when Jack asked if she'd said anything, I pulled myself back under the surface of her breasts until I was sure no one could see me. For good measure, Jessica started to rearrange her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did this, I started to drop further here and there. Every time my position was loosened, I would drop an inch or so, then be caught again. By the end of this process, I was in the lower half of her cleavage, body pressing against the lower curve of her right breast. It was hot in here, but soft and honestly rather pleasant. I wasn't sure just how long I'd have to wait for Jack to shut up, but I could deal for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I did, until eventually I heard the distant sound of the door closing. Above me, something was ruffling through Jessica's boobs and soon I saw her hand burst into view, finding me and gently pulling me from my hiding place. She sets me on her open palm and I'm greeted by her enormous face directly in front of me. I'm a little taken aback, but I try to maintain my composure. For a moment, she looked like she was enjoying holding a tiny man in her hands, and I guess I couldn't blame her. It might be refreshing in her line of work. But she turned it around, speaking softly and asking what it was I wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I spoke up. \"Believe me, I'm just as shocked to be held...\" Understatement of the century. \"As for what to do,well... it doesn't seem like we really have much option. Moving through the club...well, you know this place better than I do. If you think you should hide me somewhere, I'm open to options.\" It was pretty hard to complain about my previous hiding place. \"Not that I'm trying to perv or anything, that is. I mean I'll sit in your hand or something if you'd rather not have me...you know...\" I stumble over words, trying too hard to cover intentions that weren't that. I look up at her, hoping she understands. \"I trust you to get me out of here, is what I'm saying. However that happens.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I blinked. I knew he was speaking up, but his voice was so soft and gentle...or perhaps that was just his size difference making it appear that way. Regardless, I listened...and stifled a laugh. The way he stumbled in his speech, trying to hide the fact that he probably enjoyed his other hiding spot more then he'd like to admit, was kinda funny to me. But I couldn't blame him. He probably had a lot on his mind, along with being nervous, excited, and terrified, among other things. Slurring your speech was probably not as bad as \"pissing yourself in terror\", which is absolutely what I'd be doing right now if I were him. But anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly considered putting him back into cleavage city to smuggle him out, considering how much he enjoyed it, despite trying to imply otherwise, but realized that as fun as it might have been for him, it was certainly not a safe place. Although I lacked pockets. Crap. This outfit certainly wasn't meant for carrying things, as much as I desperately needed something...to...of course! The purse! I'd all but forgotten about it, which was understandable considering all that was on my mind, but it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding my hand as still as possible, which was difficult to do as I straightened myself out and crawled off the side of the bed, I walked over to the purse sitting on the chair at the opposite end of the room. I briefly wondered what the chair was even there for. I doubt anybody coming in this room would need one, unless they felt like reading a newspaper afterwards. Shaking away that silly thought, I lifted up my purse in my free hand, and I was pretty sure he got the message, but I felt the need to explain anyway. \"This is probably the safest option.\" I said, whispering, so as to not disturb him and out of fear that Jack was waiting for me to leave and would overhear me. \"It's not the...biggest purse, but there should be an empty pocket inside for you to get in between to stay safe while I make my way to my car. Is this okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might've said something of the affirmative, but I could hardly hear it. Either way, I set the purse on the chair and crouched down, getting my hand at about level with the purse's opening. After a few moments, he made his way across my hand (which was still an undeniably strange feeling, having another person walk across me). He appeared to be unsure of how exactly to dismount and get into the purse itself, because even if he grabbed onto the lip, the drop was still a few inches deep...which would be about a 12 foot drop for him, maybe? Helping him somewhat, I tilted my hand downwards, careful not to make him lose his footing, and lowered it inside as much as it could fit, hopefully making it easier to dismount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, I could no longer feel him on my hand, so I carefully retracted it, taking extra care not to jostle the sides of it. Peering inside, I could barely make him out, as the inside of the purse was quite dim. And, I realized, full of things. A phone, keys, money...I mean, there was room, and he could make due, it just made me wish I'd organized it beforehand is all. Although no amount of foresight could've possible accounted for THIS happening... Unsure of how to proceed, I watched for a few moments as he moved around inside, trying to get adjusted, before my attention suddenly shifted to the door as a series of impatient KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKs rang out. \"It's been 6 minutes, Jessica! Get out here before I throw you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly glancing towards the purse, I realized that Jack could open the door any second. \"I'm going to have to zip this up now, but I'll try and be quick and gentle, so don't-\" \"Who're you talking to?\" said Jack, opening the door. I panicked and quickly zipped up the purse, and raised it incredibly fast into my arms, momentarily forgetting my tiny passenger. Well, I said I'd be quick, but that was very not-gentle. Regardless, I hugged the purse close to me, looking towards Jack nervously. He stood there, with a face that screamed 'I know something's up', but he said nothing. Even if he thought something weird was going on, he couldn't guess that I was chatting it up with a tiny human. That was impossible. Or...I guess not, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid into the room, and out of the way of the door, motioning towards it. \"Well? You gonna leave or what, Jessica?\" God, I hated Jack. But even if he was hassling me, he gave me a clear getaway. Sliding past him, ignoring the obvious ass-grope, I began to head towards the exit, hoping to get out of here and get home to think about things. Even if Jack wanted me to come in tomorrow, I was planning on calling in sick, even if it meant making him even more mad at me. It would be worth it, though. Maybe he'd realize how important I was if I took a day off, and start treating me better. But that's just a pipe dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I passed by the bar, and several men that wanted to take a grab at me, the exit was only a couple of feet from me when my arm was grabbed by someone as they turned me around to greet them, jostling my purse terribly. \"Jessica, you're not gonna leave without saying goodbye, are you?\" said the woman. Oh, great. It was Veronica. \"Really not in the mood right now, Ver...Jack's really pushing me tonight, so I just want to go home and...think about things.\" I said, trying to politely head toward the door all the while, but she maintained a firm grip on my arm. \"Oh come on! Aren't you gonna say goodbye to the rest of the girls?\" \"Veronica, I'd really rather not-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" she half-exclaimed half-shrieked. It was a wonder that the windows didn't shatter. \"That is such a pretty purse!\" she said, suddenly snatching it from my hands. My mind returned to the small man, probably more then a little jostled by now, who was in that purse. And Veronica was CARELESS with other peoples things. \"Hey, Veronica, you really have to give that back!\" I said, concerned about what would happen to him if I allowed her to hold onto it for much longer. \"I like the color! Purple, huh? I never really thought were a purple girl! Ooh, can I wear it? Can you take a picture of me wearing it?!\" she said, practically jumping up and down by now. \"Veronica. The purse.\" \"Oh, right. Got a little carried away there.\" she said, handing the purse to me...sideways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly grabbing and re-orienting it, I headed towards the door. \"Jessica! What is with you today?\" she yelled, as I didn't even stop to look back. \"I just have to go, alright? See you tomorrow.\" That was a lie...maybe. I hadn't worked that out yet. Heading towards my car in the lot, which was a poor old thing; I got it, used, for cheap. and it showed. At least it was pink. Although that didn't help the squeaky brakes that I was sure would fail any day now. Unlocking it, climbing inside, and locking the door behind me, I finally set the purse on the dashboard and unzipped it, simply staring at the unzipped purse from afar, too scared to look inside for fear of what the shaking had done to him. He was probably fine, I told myself; I didn't have many hard objects in there. But the possibility existed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling my nerves, I looked over and glanced inside to see how he was doing...</span></div></div>",

My job just takes so much out of me, it isn't even funny. The only thing that made this better is that I had the entire weekend off now. That would give me so much time to myself, I wouldn't even know where to start!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I guess the first thing I should do is freshen up for bed. After taking a quick shower, I walked into the bedroom. I put on my bra and panties. I didn't have any pajamas that fit me anymore, and I'm too shy to sleep... in the buff... and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis... is really embarrassing to say. I'm... really fat. Well, I guess the nice way to say it was that I was very chubby. But... I know what they're really saying. If there was any word that describe me, it would be \"round...\" My belly was the biggest part of me, and I could hold it with both hands. And almost every other part of my body would slightly jiggle when I walked. It's super embarrassing to me, so I don't normally show this much skin. Most people don't like people as fat as me. Luckily, I'm all alone in here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally hopped into bed. I love my bed, it's so soft... I must've been really tired, because it looked like there was a tiny doll on my bed. I knew that wasn't true, because I haven't played with dolls since I was a little girl. I might've been hearing things, too, but I was way too tired to care. I just let myself drift off to dreamland...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing I noticed was the floor. It was soft. Way too soft. Like I'd passed out on some sort of giant blanket. Which was nonsense, of course... Slowly, I started to open my eyes, adjusting after however long they'd been shut. Where exactly was I?  Things started to come into focus. The landscape before me became more clear as huge structures off in the distance began to take form. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant bedroom?\" I gaped, looking around again to confirm what I was seeing. I was in a giant bedroom, centered square in the middle of a colossal bed. \"How the hell...?\" That was when I noticed a sound. Or rather the end of a sound that had been there the whole time. The sound of water shutting off in a shower somewhere nearby. Whoever's room this was, I had a feeling I was going to meet them very, very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd meet her I did. A door hundreds of times my height swung open and through it stepped a titan of a girl. She was absolutely massive in every way imaginable... Her sheer scale compared to me detracted from her weight, but as I took her in, it wasn't hard to see that she was on the heavier side... And she was completely naked. I flushed, looking away as if this giantess could even be aware of my miniscule self if I watched. A few moments later, when I dared peek, I saw that she'd donned a set of underwear and was headed directly for me, one massive step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered panic mode. I didn't know who this girl was, or why I was here, and I really didn't want to explain how I'd ended up maybe an inch tall and in her bed, but right now all I wanted was to be seen and not crushed by the unknowing sleepy girl. \"Hey! Hey, down here! Look down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shouted, but she didn't seem to register the noise. She stepped around the side of the bed and hopped onto it. When she left the ground, I saw my life flash before my eyes. Luckily, she came down on the mattress several inches (or yards at my height) away. Unluckily, the bed reacted poorly, launching me into the air. I shouted in panic as I spun around, coming back down on it with an unsatisfactory fwump sort of noise knocked a good foot from where I'd been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI regained my bearings, getting shakily to my feet and shouting to the girl as she settled herself into bed. \"Hey! Hey, look at me! Don't go to sleep yet! LOOK! DOWN! HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo use. At one point, I thought I saw her eyes hover over me, sleep already lurking there as her eyelids drooped. She dismissed me like I were some misplaced doll. Her head hit the pillow and she was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed in frustration, storming up to her to get her attention more physically. She was laying on her side, and walking in a straight line I found myself not too far from her the waistband of her panties. I took a few hesitant steps away, just to be sure. That was not the way to get someone's attention. I found myself staring up at her belly. She might as well have been a flesh-colored planet settled here on the bed as far as I was concerned, and would be regardless of her weight. I got as close as I dared and as close as I needed to to reach her skin, belly hovering over me and hoped to god she didn't decide to roll on her stomach right now. I took my hand and poked her, testing the waters. No response. I barely made a dent. I huffed, and decided I'd need a more firm route. I pulled my arm back, took a deep breath, and gave her a few smacks, figuring at my tiny size it would barely hurt if at all... But hopefully it might get her attention? Startle her awake? This might be dumb....</span></div></div>",

Both my arms were free, and my soft mattress went so well with my soft belly. It was like sleeping on a cloud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slept like that for a few moments, but I felt something hitting my belly. I couldn't tell what exactly it was. I tried to ignore it at first, but after a while, it got pretty annoying. I rolled over onto my back. Ah, that felt just as good. My back needed some relaxation... With the way I was sprawled out among the bed half-naked, along with my bright orange hair draped behind my shoulders, I must've looked like a painting. Of course, I wasn't exactly a beautiful model. Still, I couldn't help but dream of someone who loved me anyways. And he was giving me a sensual tummy rub. Mmmm...</span></div></div>",

Ordinarily I'd be all for this scenario. She was pretty cute all things considered, but when she was a thousand times my size it was considerably more terrifying than enticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily (relatively speaking), her belly button landed over my head, so I had a little air and enough leeway to think and come up with a plan. I could barely move the rest of me, but luckily between the softness of the mattress, and of the girl on top of me, nothing seemed flattened. But it was starting to get hot under her and this method wouldn't get me noticed for hours, if at all. So I did all I could. I fidgeted. I fidgeted hard, which translated to effectively making a snow angel underneath her and hoping she felt me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she did I don't know, but I do know that she started rolling again. And that was good enough. She came down on me a little harder, then I felt the weight coming off of me and the cold air rushing underneath as she turned onto her back. I was practically free, save for my head which was now wedged in her belly button. With a little pull, I managed to free it, stumbling backward and finding myself standing atop this mountain of a girl, looking at her peaceful dreaming face. At least one of us was having a nice time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, and started walking toward her face. I didn't want to have to walk between her breasts or anywhere near them, lest she think I was aiming for them when she wakes up, but at this point I just wanted her to hear me and wake up. \"Hey! Heeeey! Excuse me, miss! Wake up! I need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept shouting things like this as I proceeded up her body toward her face, hoping she was settled and there wouldn't be more rolling shenanigans.</span></div></div>",

They were certainly impressive. And in other circumstances I'd be enjoying the view. But I had one thing on my mind. And that was waking this girl up and getting some help to...change back? I didn't really know. I'd figure that out when I got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I took hold of the fabric of her bra and rather swiftly pulled myself atop the right cup. At the peak I had to admit that they might be even bigger than they'd looked from below. I glanced down the valley between them briefly. I considered what would happen if I slipped on the rather smooth fabric and slipped in that direction. Just slid right between-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. Enough of that. Not the time at all. I turned my eyes back toward her face, taking in a deep breath. Then, \"HEEEEY! WAKE UP! I NEED YOUR HELP!\" I honestly didn't think that would be enough, so I started jumping up and down while I yelled, trying not to slip every time I came down. This was admittedly precarious as hell. But if I got any closer, it was traversing neck and then the danger zone that was her face. The thought of tripping and falling into her mouth, swallowed reactively as she woke up shocked came far too vividly to mind. Nope. I wanted nothing to do with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I jumped.

As i regained my bearings, I found that I was now dangling from the lip of her bra cup. She was moving now, seemingly still unaware to my presence. I was out of breath, but I still tried to call up. \"Hey! Down here! Look down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo dice. She drearily futzed with her hair and then she stood up and started walking. I cursed as I tried to pull myself up and gravity tried to pry me off of her lingerie. With ever step, her boob bounced a little and I was thrown up then back down, fingers loosening with each jiggle. With great effort, I managed to pull myself up over the lip, making contact with flesh. Another bounce and my arm slipped inside the bra cup. I was now dangling half stuck, trying to keep my arm from being dislocated by supporting myself with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached the kitchen and she finally stopped. I sighed, trying to pull my arm free. I found it was quite tightly wedged. I wasn't falling off, but I wasn't going anywhere. \"Hey! Hey, look down here! Right below your face! Come on, I need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent over to pull some things out of the fridge, and my world turned sideways. Her boob hung down more freely and I felt my arm being stretched to its limit. If I didn't get it free, it was coming out of socket. And then I was in real trouble. I pulled with all my might and managed to free it. But I had pulled too hard. I lost grip with my other hand and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed. This was it. Hard floor. Splat. Dead. But I came short. I landed on something sort of soft that made a squelch. I looked down and saw that I'd landed on the package of lunch meat she had pulled out. I sighed with relief before the package of cheese was unknowingly slapped right on top of me. I struggled, but it was much heavier than cheese should be at this scale. As she gathered the other ingredients, I was deposited on the table. I sighed. At least she would have to notice me when she pulled this cheese off me to get to the meat... Right...?</span></div></div>",

I separated the cheese and the meats before putting the cheese on one slice of the bread. I was still feeling a little out of it, but anyone could make a sandwich! I put down a couple slices of cheese before getting to the meat. Though, once I put my hand on the meat, I felt myself grabbing... something that wasn't meat. In fact, it felt... alive! I squealed loudly and I guess I dropped whatever it was onto the table. Though, I couldn't really see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the light, and I turned it on and made my way back to the table, quaking out of a little bit of fear. I wasn't a real big fan of creepy-crawlies, and especially not anywhere near my food! I couldn't find whatever it was at first, but I saw something that looked like a doll on the table. I didn't think that much at first, until the doll-thing got up, and it looked right at me... W-What is this thing?</span></div></div>",

I flailed, she screamed, and I fell onto the table, landing flat on my face and groaning as I rubbed my luckily unbroken nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay there recovering while she turned on the light and returned to the table. I made it to my feet, sore but unbroken and stood to meet her gaze for the first time. She looked...scared? And confused. A healthy combination of the two. I'd probably be just as freaked out in her place. She seemed stunned, so I took my chance to talk. \"Uh... hey. So, I can explain why I was wedged in with your food there, if you'll listen.

I couldn't find myself speaking anymore, and with another tummy rumble, I was reminded why I came out here in the first place.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As your senses filter back in, you become more and more aware of your surroundings. The first thing you notice is that it's rather hot. Not unbearably so, but certainly enough to be noticeable and unwanted. The second is that the air itself feels... well, thicker, for lack of a better word. It takes a bit more effort to breathe, and it almost feels like inhaling smoke until you take a few deep breaths and settle into a better, easier pace. The third thing you notice is the odd taste in the air. Just like smelling fresh rain or feeling an odd texture, it's hard to really describe the sensation that passes across your taste buds with each long inhale and exhale. The closest approximation you could give might be to say that the air tastes \"warm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blurs around you settle into distinct shapes, you begin to realize that the odd qualities of the air are almost certainly the least of your concerns. You're standing at the bottom of some vast chamber with steel blue walls and an odd, texture-less white ceiling. All around you, gigantic wooden structures rise above you, each one the size of a building. The more you look at them, however, the more you begin to realize that they aren't buildings at all. In fact they rather look like furniture scaled up to ridiculous sizes. There's a dresser, a skyscraper-like bookcase, a desk of some sort, and even a massive bed that's the size of a warehouse. A soft beige carpet, as soft as a shag rug, rises up around your legs like short grass, undercutting just how small you must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look down at the thick carpet, you realize that you're a little different as well. For one, you're entirely naked. At least that makes the heat a little more tolerable, if nothing else. When your neck tilts, you feel an odd tingle against your spine. It takes a bit of stretching, but you manage to reach a hand against your upper back. Your prodding fingers feel an unusual bump between your shoulder blades; there's some sort of circular shape under your skin. The last and possibly least worrisome thing you notice is that there's some kind of black shape on your left hip. It's at such an odd angle that you have trouble making it out as a sketchy 3 that looks like it was written onto you with an enormous permanent marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hearing comes back as your ears pop, and you become aware that you aren't the only living thing in this enormous chamber that must be some sort of bedroom. There's a soft rhythmic sound that's so strangely amplified that it takes you a moment to realize it's the sound of someone or something really big that's breathing. It doesn't take much logic to look towards the bed, but no amount of preparation could have braced you for the strange sight that greets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure is somewhere around a dozen times your size, at the same scale as the enormous furniture and grass-like carpet. It's clearly humanoid, but that's where most similarities end. The whole being is oddly colored. The head, turned away from you, has odd triangular ears instead of the oval-shaped human kind. The figure has the cream-colored sheets around its ankles, which allows your observant eyes to pick up a number of extra pieces of the puzzle. Like you, they're completely naked, and that allows you to make out the backside of a giant ballsack (oddly tan and dotted with brown spots) between their legs. The giant, who is almost certainly male, also has what appears to be a thick, fluffy tail that sprouts from the base of their spine and goes down to at least the halfway point of the lower leg. As the whole picture slowly snaps together, you realize that the figure isn't colored, at least not in the traditional sense. Rather, they're covered in thick fur that ranges from a very dark brown to a warm tan. It's not unlike the pattern of a German shepherd, for the most part, and the whole figure (at least, what you can see of him from the backside) looks like how you might imagine a mixture of a shepherd and a human to turn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant canine shifts slightly and groans. He's clearly asleep, which leaves you to decide your first step here. You're all alone, naked, on the floor of some strange bedroom occupied by an even stranger and equally naked half-dog titan. You could try to get his attention somehow; there's enough of the sheets off the side of the bed that you could probably climb up without too much of a hassle. Or there's some clean clothes in a basket on the floor nearby. You could just climb onto that and wait until he goes to get dressed. A third option might be to try and get out of the room. There's just enough room under the door for you to squeeze out if you decide to venture elsewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother huff from the giant snaps you back to your senses. Whatever you do, you should try to do it soon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a dark and stormy night. The smoldering volcano lit the blackness with an ominous red glow, its lava bubbling and splashing up, as if reaching up towards the lip. As the lightning flashed across the landscape, it illuminated a tall, wicked castle with a lone, high-peaked tower. A single, winding road led up to the main gate, though it was rarely used by any except the inhabitants. For this was a feared place, where none dared set foot, for fear of the nightmarish evils that lay within...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least, that's how this story might have begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of it was true, of course. There was a castle on a mountain that was rarely visited, but that was because only a handful of people in the nearest village remembered its location, and they had no interest in it. There was a volcano, but it had been dormant for a long while and wasn't likely to erupt anytime soon. It was night, but though the weather had been dreary and raining for several hours, there was no booming thunder or dramatic flashes of lightning to add to the ambiance of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarfas Icebark was not to be deterred, though. He'd already made his plans, and he would carry them through, dramatic tone or not. The Hunter's Moon was at its peak, and he could feel its power all around him as the focusing lenses around the tower chamber harnessed the lunar magic into specially selected chunks of copper ore. The moon's light shone down through the wide windows, illuminating the man's figure. His skin was quite pale and his blue veins made dramatic lines across his arms and face. His eyes were a metallic silver hue and gleamed in the flickering torch light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked the lines he had drawn on the stone floor in red clay and muttered to himself. The circle was painstakingly drawn and surrounded by odd organic spirals and shapes, which in turn were surrounded by a carefully placed circle of candles that danced with small violet flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkest corner, by the staircase that led down into the castle, a pair of eyes reflected the various light sources in two small glints. The eyes' owner watched Sarfas as he paced around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be all the preparations. The circle's set, and the focus ores are aligned.\" His eyes flicked about, only briefly pausing on the being in the corner. \"Now or never,\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped into the small triangle on the circle's edge and lifted his hands and face to the Hunter's Moon. \"I call upon Deduron, Lord of the Hunt, whose amber eye graces the land and observes the devoted! Your power and thirst for blood rises to its glorious peak now, and I plead you to lend a morsel of your magic to my summon this night!\" A wind began to pick up within the room, and Sarfas' black robe flapped about as he spoke louder. \"By the power of the moon's brilliance and the earth's blessing, I reach through the walls of dimensions, weakened on these most spiritual of nights, and bring forth a denizen of the wicked underworld to do my bidding! Azetaroth, I summon thee! Accept my offering and heed my call!\" At the last words, he drew a steel dagger and slit his palm. As blood dripped from his open hand, he placed his hand at the triangle's forward point and cried out, \"I summon thee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe candle flames roared into violet pillars of fire and cast the room into intense light. Then, as quickly as they'd risen, the flames went out, leaving the chamber a little darker. Sarfas lifted his head, expecting to look up into the face of a wicked black beast. Nothing? But the ores were gone, and the spell had clearly taken effect. Had he miscalculated, and the binding circle was incomplete? No, he reassured himself, he'd checked it multiple times to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sense of some dread, his eyes slowly lowered from even standing to stare down at the center of the circle. There, on the floor, lay a tiny figure, clothed in odd garments that Sarfas would be unable to recognize as a t-shirt and boxers. He must have been only four inches tall and seemed to be otherwise completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is this?\" Sarfas snapped, his voice rising in some anger. \"Some little beast? I called for a high demon, not a meager pest!\" He flung the dagger in his hand at the wall, where it clattered harmlessly against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to grab the odd thing and drew his hand back at the last second. Wait... Demons were known for trickery. This could all be an illusion, intended to make him lower his guard and break the circle's seal. If that were the case, he'd be releasing the demon and all its dark power. He bit his lip and looked thoughtfully at the summoned thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it began to stir, as if awakening from sleep. He watched it get up and frowned down at it. If the being tried to move out of the circle on its own, it would feel a significant amount of pain. \"You. What are you? The circle binds you to answer the summoner's queries by the laws of the contract!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What a day. In all honesty, it was all worth it... Maybe I should explain from the top? My name is Angie, 19 years old, and somehow I'm secretly known as a witch. How? I don't even know. Without too much confusing details, I found some old books in the attic of my house, and boom, I learn that I could perform all sorts of magecraft. It's like some super dark secret that runs in my family... except the only magic users happen to be females and that the trait skips each generation. So I experiment with my newly discovered magic, like teleportation, levitation, elemental manipulation, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all cool, but the real good stuff is the forbidden magic. As much as it's clearly labelled as \"forbidden\" in one of the books I found, it's pretty damn obvious that the whole magic society system that's mentioned in the book is long gone by now. It wouldn't hurt to try and use the spells, who could stop me? After a brief lookup on the forbidden spells, I find one that catches me eye. Life Essence Reduction. Well, from what it says here, it's pretty much you can make yourself feel stronger in terms of magic by stealing 'life essence' from others. How would I test it out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not like it would be an issue or anything, but maybe my big brother would be my test subject. I mean, who else would jump in? My alcoholic father and no show of a mother? Plus, I don't think no one else but myself knows about the magic stuff I know by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo not too long ago, I basically call over my brother Jake to my room, giving the usual \"I need help with something!\" excuse. As he walks in, I send a stunning charm at him, knocking him out cold and making him an easy shot for this experiment. That's when I began to use the Life Essence Reduction spell on him, reciting the correct incantations as well as making physical contact with him. It was a rush of energy surging into me, sapping majority of the power from my brother. It felt great, I could feel the mysterious aura in my body grow stronger. Of course, I didn't want to kill him, so I snapped out of the trance and let go of him, interrupting the spell. And... that's when I realized, the spell did more than just sap potential magic energy for myself. Why, he was also shrunken down to a mere inch in height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder why this was a forbidden spell, but a sly smirk grew on my face. I instantly thought of all of the things I could do now, because I was literally the bigger sister. A spell like this practically gave me two end results, in which I love already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down on the floor where my tiny brother was starting to gain consciousness, I pluck him up into the air by his shirt with my index finger and thumb, and slowly bringing him up to face level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you woke up Jake, I bet you're just scared shitless right now,\" I couldn't help myself from teasing him, especially by how he was practically powerless at this size. He can try all he want, but I'm the one in charge here. All thanks to the power of magic.</span></div></div>",

But unlike usual, her face takes up my entire vision. \"Angie, get off...\" I sleepily try to push her away, hands pressing against something but not having much effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I feel a tugging sensation on the back of my neck and I'm being hoisted somewhere like the prize in a claw machine. \"Hey! What the hell?\" I rub my eyes, then try to pull away from the collar of my shirt that's now threatening to strangle me as I hang from whatever's grasped me. I look forward and again I see my sister's enormous face, realizing now that she wasn't just close or hovering over me, she was actually enormous,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you woke up Jake,\" she began as I pulled myself away from the strangling collar of my shirt. \"I bet you're just scared shitless right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at Angie in disbelief for a number of reasons. How did she get so big? Or...how did I get so small? (Judging by the room around us it was the latter.) Why was she currently threatening to hang me with a casual pinched grasp on my shirt? And why did she seem so nonchalant about this whole situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...Angie? What the hell? What happened to me?\" I start, fluctuating somewhere between fear and anger. I try to struggle out of her grasp, but I realize that the only way I'm going anywhere is if she moves me or if I struggle out of my shirt and plummet...hundreds of feet to my death. \"You've... you've got to fix this! I don't know what happened, but you have to help me! Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a command, but I didn't feel or sound very commanding. I'd come in here... to help her with something. That's right. But when I walked in, everything just sort of went black until I woke up being lifted by my now colossal sister. This wasn't good. \"Angie, I mean it! Help me!\"</span></div></div>",

While most would probably panic to see that they've shrunken to this size, my brother's reaction was definitely one I wouldn't forget. Actually, while I didn't plan for him to shrink like this from the spell I used, this was a whole lot better than what I expected. For a moment, I did take into consideration about helping my \"little\" brother out. Well, sucks to be him then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, don't feel like it,\" I shrugged, simple as that. \"Just let me have fun with this at least, Jake. I mean, I was the one that did this to you in the first place, and I don't really feel like turning you back to normal any time soon. Soooo... sorry not sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh man, I could see the outright shock in my brother's face once I brought this newsflash to him. Might as well suck the fun out of this, because I did literally dangled my brother's life in my hands. Not even giving him a chance to talk, I stuck out my tongue and pressed his tiny form against my taste buds facefirst. Ugh, okay, so my brother didn't taste that pleasant, and it would be too quick to just swallow him up there. Oh well, I kept him pressed against my tongue until a few minutes pass, and after that I plucked him off of my tongue, dropping him onto the palm of my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that you were going to say?

My anger turned to concern. I didn't know what sort of fun she wanted to have like this, but I had the sneaking suspicion is wasn't going to be good for me. Angie immediately confirmed my suspicion. Before I could actually open my mouth to say something, she opened hers wide before me. \"Angie, no! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't stop. I shut my eyes and prepared for the worst, only opening them when I realized I wasn't sliding down her gullet to oblivion. She was pressing me square into her tongue. I struggled against the slimy beast to no avail. No matter how I pressed away from her, the slick surface and the force of her finger at my back kept me pinned. Her taste buds were the size of my head, continuously grabbing hold of it, getting a nice good taste. I could only hope that she didn't like my flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like she held me there forever. It could have been minutes, could have been hours for all I knew. When you're being drenched in your little sister's (If I could even call her that now) saliva, your perception gets a little foggy. Eventually I gave up pointlessly struggling and just sort of laid there until finally she picked me back up and hung me back in front of her face, limp and damp, and taunted me like that was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few deep breaths and composed myself as best a person can in this situation. \"Angie... I don't know how you did this, or what I did you make you want to, but please, stop. Change me back. I'll do anything!\"</span></div></div>",

Though, I was also going to make sure that he'll remember this for as long as he can. Because what would be the fun of it if he doesn't even remember a damn thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tilted my head to the side when he practically begged to be restored to normal size. One word happened to catch my attention, and a jeering smile grew on my face. Oh man, Jake should've phrased that a bit more carefully than he did there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... <i>anything</i>?\" A few chuckles couldn't be held in as I basically echoed out that one word. Before he could comprehend on what kind of hell he brought himself into, I pulled the socks off of my feet, a putrid smell of my footsweat spreading across the room. While it was all fresh air for him one second, the next second he was instantly plunged in-between my toes. I knew my feet smelled bad since I neglected to shower at times, but I could only imagine on how bad it was for someone that small as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, Jake, you've got yourself a lot of work to do...

I knew she'd sometimes go for a day or two without a shower, but I never imagined how rancid it could make her feet smell. The fetid sweat and dirt that had accumulated there forced its way into my nose. And as she pushed my face down into the skin between her toes, a drop of sweat forced its way into my mouth. I gagged and heaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she was wriggling her toes on either side of me, rubbing me into her and drenching me in her scent. I tried to struggle away, but with the sheer lack of power I seemed to have, she probably couldn't even tell. I was probably lucky for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angie... Angie, please.\" I coughed out the words when my face wasn't being forced nose-first into her sweat and skin. \"I know what I said, but have some mercy!\" Another drob of sweat rolled over me and I accidentally inhaled it, going into a coughing fit. When my breath started to return, I tried to continue. \"I'm your brother for god's sake! You can't really want this, can you? How good can wedging me in your toes really feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a sudden realization that I should again be more careful with my choice of words, but it was too late now.

There's an almost floral smell in the air that wafts over you as you wake bit by bit, and you can feel the slight taste of copper on your taste buds as you breathe in and out. None of these are particularly overpowering, though the chill is somewhat unnerving, yet the combination makes you feel somewhat off-balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this, however, pales compared to the sight that greets you when you blink your eyes open. Rather than a bed, you've woken up in a large pile of straw, though it's actually quite comfortable. The only thing on you is a pair of boxer briefs, red with white piping on them, and you feel the brushes of the straw against your bare skin as you move. You're not in a bedroom, obviously, and yet you're not in any sort of room or barn as you can define them. The walls are oddly pale and seem off somehow. You look around to the items around you: a big, foot-deep metal dish with water in it, a small trough of sorts with some wet carrots and apples inside - you feel your stomach loudly protest as you look there - and a pile of thick sticks each about two or three inches wide. Turning further, you see the last wall behind you, and a dawning realization sets in as you look on the big glass wall with thin slits reaching up from about four feet to near the ceiling. The whole composition takes shape around you, and you realize you can't classify this as any room for a reason! You're inside a giant cage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cage walls around you are a milky translucent color, faint enough to let light filter through but thick enough that you can't see more than vague blurry shapes. Out the front, though, you can see an enormous room before you. It looks like the storeroom of some kind of store, for you can see on the opposite side shelves with empty cages, gloves, and even a few folders full of papers. There's a table in the center of this room with a half-empty glass of water and another paper on it. From this angle, you can see the paper, but the words on it are strange and unfamiliar to you. You can smell a thick smoke in the air, as if someone's been puffing on a cigarette lately, and the distant sound of a soft melody playing from outside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door you can just barely see from inside your cage creaks open, and an unusual creature comes through. She looks almost human - complete, you notice, with a heavy chest - but her body is odd in several ways. For one, she's covered in a soft dusty brown fur, and her face is like some odd hybrid between a person's and a bear's. She's quite large for the room, which to you makes her a startlingly eighty or ninety feet. The behemoth bear woman wanders into the room, a weary expression her features, and looks around slowly...</span></div></div>",

Or straw. I never really knew the difference. But hey. Not too far off, I guess, for the little comfort it provides. I stand up cautiously and look around, taking in my surroundings and trying harder not to panic with each glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room I was in (And it had to be a room, I was surrounded by walls) was full of the straw I'd been laying on, though not piled up quite like my makeshift bed. The walls were white. Or, close to it. They were strikingly pale, which seemed to contrast the straw. How did you keep the walls so clean in a place I could only assume was full of animals on a regular basis... I turn my eyes to the floor. There's... a round trough? Some sort of water basin for whatever lives here, although it looks like a hamster's water bowl. And a similar structure full of what looked like some mixture of blocks of...carrot? Giant carrot? And maybe apples? It was huge, though. What ate this stuff... Whatever it was, I figured I'd rather not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned a full 180 degrees, and that's when I stopped and stared at the fourth wall. The enormous pane of glass that made it all too obvious where I was. I stared out through the enormous, slightly fogged wall onto an impossibly huge... office? Store? There was a table covered in paperwork. I ran forward, pressing myself against the glass as I stared out, trying to understand how this had happened and why I was apparently in some enormous cage fit for a human... I try to push my hand through one of the slits in the cage wall, but find it too thin to permit any more than my forearm. Just as I'm beginning to freak out, I see the door to the enormous store swing open, and in walks a woman that I can only describe as sort of humanoid...ish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's standing on two legs, and her figure is...well, let's say the two unnoticeable mounds on her chest as well as the rest of her indicate her as a buxom female. But from there everything's strange. She's covered in what looks like fur, and her face is some mixture of human and animal... a bear, if you had to guess. If the room is impossibly big, she still makes it look small. I'm not sure whether I should be terrified or in awe, and I wind up somewhere between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she's in the room and she's someone. For better or worse, I'm not passing up some sort of contact here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" I pound on the glass of my cage and shout through one of the air slits. \"Heeeey! Over here! Where am I!? How did I get here? Hey! Help me out!\"</span></div></div>",

The giant door to this giant bedroom swung open and in walked a giant who looked all too happy to see me there, awake and awaiting. He grinned as he walked up to me. I was close to the edge of the bed, I realized as with each booming step he grew closer. Finally, he stopped, legs bumping up against the bed, a notable bulge in his jeans practically looming over me. Heat wafted through the denim and the slightest smell came with it, creating an extremely uncomfortable aura that fell over me. I was speechless as I stared up at the giant who looked... almost familiar? Did I... Did I know him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke and I stared up, trying to get a good look past the jeans to your face and not sound terrified when I spoke. \"Well, hey. I'll happy to...to trade places...\" I tried to joke, but it came out with an obvious, underlying sound of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me? What are you going to do?\" I tried to maintain what little dignity I had as I challenged the giant, but even that simple question came out wavering and weak. I crossed my arms and tried to look like I wasn't scared, like he wasn't a million times my size.</span></div></div>",

But maybe, just maybe I'll take you up on your offer of trading places.  Someday.  Probably not.  But you never know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge in my pants seems to only get bigger as I finally come to grips with how well this actually worked.  I excitedly pick you up, maybe clenching my fists a little harder than I meant to as I hold you in front of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, unfortunately for you....since you're my guinea pig, you're gonna be in for a not so fun time, buddy.  Sorry.  The good news is, hopefully this should make you pliable, the bad news is, there's always a chance for failure and you just end up smooshed under some part of my body.  I've been dreaming of this day for a looooooooooong time, and have plenty of ideas to enact.  Oh, hold on a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see me close one of my eyes as I push a fart out of my ass, loud but not overly smelly.  \"Ah....that will probably be ONE of the ideas.  But let's start with the basics.\"  I let go of you and you fall on to my bed.  I sit down near the head of the bed, shifting the blankets and such around to get into a comfortable spot.  I prop my socked feet up in front of you, \"Ah, yes.  The classic.  Rub my feet, please.  If you think about not doing it, it will only get worse...\"</span></div></div>",

But last fall, at the start of my junior year, I turned my garage into a makeshift lab and started experimenting with some ideas I'd had. The results were mixed, but finally I had something concrete. So now it just needed a real test run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days ago, you answered my newspaper ad, and we set up for you coming down to be the first experiment. You either didn't remember me or were too polite to mention how I'd lost a lot of weight since being the chubby dark-skinned nerd in Earth Sciences. A short setup later, you stepped onto one of a pair of makeshift pads and gave me a somewhat nervous thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, well, here we are. It worked. Sort of. Your clothes didn't go anywhere, but you vanished and about a tenth of a percent of you reappeared, at a scale of only six inches tall, on the other pad. And I'm standing here, looking down at a tiny naked guy on my garage floor, wondering just what to do now, and if you're even okay as you come to.</span></div></div>",

Between work, college and other obligations, it's just been one thing after another. I promise I'll be responding to everyone's storylines as soon as I can, which should actually be really soon. I promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, I'm so incredibly grateful for all of your continuing interest and putting up with my erratic appearances on here. If things work out like I'd like, I should be adding with far more regularity starting very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you all so, so much. Every message I get telling me someone has added a chapter just lights up my day. Here's to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I've seen a few stories like this, and I wanted to try my hand at one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe premise is simple. Two people, that being me and whoever feels like joining in, write chapters back and forth describing our actions and interactions between characters we'll choose to portray in a scenario revolving around a tiny person, and one much larger. The only necessary link between any of these scenarios will be the size play theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, I tried this once before, but I might have been too strict on what I was willing to go along with, and it was a tremendous failure. So there are basically no rules to add or to join in this time around. I'm willing to experiment and try new things with this, branch out from my routine writings and have some new experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>That said, Rules</b></u><br>\r\n1. Content-wise, I'm allowing anything. Yes, anything. Whatever you're into, whatever you feel like doing, bring it on. Yes, that means even playing a dude is a-okay if you want to. I've been given a hard time for disallowing interaction like that in the past. No more. Whatever you write, I will play along with to the best of my ability. Half the fun is not being in control of everything here. I only ask that those participating take the role of the \"giant\", as it were. Every other element is free game.<br>\r\n2. In terms of writing, I think first-person (I did this. I said that.) would be preferable, but I'm not going to be a stickler if you want to switch it up. Your chapters are your call.<br>\r\n3. Only real rule is that I'd prefer additions be in proper English, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm certainly not going to turn someone interested away because of the way they type. Posts just have to be intelligible. <br>\r\n4. Oh, and detail is preferred. This sort of thing is no fun of detailed chapters are being answered with a sentence of \"Then I did this action. Now what do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo please, add something. Start up a story, and I'll do my very best to complement it with chapters of my own. Let's have some fun here.</td>",
