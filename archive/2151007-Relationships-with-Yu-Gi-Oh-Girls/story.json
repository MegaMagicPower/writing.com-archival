Max\u2019s highschool had let out early, freeing the the teens from the four walls. Pacing for too long hurt his feet, and decided to sit on a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax looked up at a nearby clock. 4:40pm. Max frown. He\u2019s been waiting here for a while and had been being worrying if she would show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax is 6\u20192 ft tall, with a muscular build. He has brown, cowlick hair with blue eyes. His face is serious but he has that classic sweet guy personality. While he isn\u2019t perfect, he tries to do the right thing, even if he likes to indulge his darker side. But that isn\u2019t what he is here for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax is wearing a green, plaid, shirt sleeve shirt, button up to the last two close to his neck and blue jeans for his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax, looking anxious, watch for a bus to come. A few days earlier, he had asked a girl out. She was always surrounded by a group of boys so Max never found the courage to speak to her. One day, Max hadn\u2019t seen those boys around the girl for a week. Seeing no better time to get close to her, He approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Max was fully expecting a rejection. Sure, they\u2019ve share some few moments together but they never really gotten to know each other. But Max thought she was beautiful. So when he asked her, he was surprised that she smiled and said \u201cYes, I would like to go out with you.\u201d She didn\u2019t say it right away. Understandably, she took a few moments before giving her answer. Max was definitely on cloud nine after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax continue to twiddle his thumbs. He is so nervous. But his patience was rewarded. The bus drove up and stopped in front of him. Max got up from his chair as the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl he was waiting for walked out down the steps of the bus with her long, slender legs. Her feet touched the ground and look up at the taller person in front of her. She smiled as soon as she recognized him. \u201cHey there, Max. Did I keep you waiting long?\u201d Tea asked, her short, brown hair dangle at the sides of her face.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/T4Dx29\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/T4Dx29</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax blushed. \u201cNope. Nuh-uh. I just got here. So glad we happen to arrive at the same time.\u201d Max said, playing it cool (Ha).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea smile. \u201cI guess so.\u201d She reach out her hand and grab his. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m so excited. Let\u2019s see how much we can get done in one day.\u201d Tea tug on Max\u2019s hand, who is blushing and unable to get any words, and lead him off to where they are heading for.</span></div></div>",

You grabbed the card as it flew near you, only to get knocked over as the girl slammed into you. You got a look at the card, rescue cat. It was a cute card, and had a decent ability; but its point values leave something to be desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a miracle you could see it, as the girls bust was covering most of your view. \"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!\", she said as she stood up. \"Its fine, this yours?\", you asked as you stood. \"Thank you!

Next, from my hand, I'll activate the spell card Stamping Destruction. Now since I have a dragon-type monster on my field, I'm allowed to destroy one spell or trap card on the field, then deal 500 points of damage to the person that controls it. So I think I'll destroy the face down on the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant dragon foot stomps down on Akiza's face-down. In the remains, you can see that the card you destroyed was Call of the Haunted. At one of the dragon's claws, you see a stone emerge from the ground and nail Akiza in the forehead, breaking off the right side of her mask and letting you finally look her in the eye for the first time in this duel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza: 1900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time to end this. Blue Eyes number one, attack Black Rose Dragon.\" Both of your dragons fired a blast at each other, resulting in a massive explosion. In the aftermath, only Blue Eyes remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to your Thorn of Malice, my monster isn't destroyed. Now Blue Eyes number two, attack Akiza directly with White Lightning.\" Your second dragon fires right at Akiza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast. I activate my second face-down, Defense Draw. Now all battle damage I would've taken is reduced to zero and I get to draw a card.\" Blue Eyes' attack bounces off a barrier as Akiza draws her card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame then that I still have my Azure-Eyes. Now attack with Silver Stream of Annihilation!\" With nothing left to protect her and your monster's attack points just high enough, this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzure-Eyes' attack hits Akiza dead-on, causing her to scream in agony as your powers cause real damage. Her mask is shattered completely and she is sent flying before she passes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza: 0000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to her unconscious body to see if she's alright. She seems to still be breathing so at least she's alive. Now that you can see her face without that mask, you had to admit that she looked kind of cute. And with the robe opened you can see that she also has a nice body, now only covered by a red corset and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all the pain she caused you, it wouldn't be right to just leave her here unconscious. You should take her somewhere, but where?</span></div></div>",

Ever since, you were always on your own and you see the cold stares from anyone who found out that you\u2019re a psychic.

Yeah, I figured this would be my way of saying sorry for the injuries I gave you and to say thanks for treating me and letting me stay in your bed even after what I did.

The duel, the treatment you gave her, everything.

One duel with me. You need to prove your worth if you wish to stay here. It\u2019s a strict policy we have. But, if you can show that your powers are impressive, than I\u2019ll let you remain here. Do we have a deal?\u201d Sayer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to Akiza and you can see in her eyes that she wants you to stay. So, you gave Sayer your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen do we start?\u201d You answered with a question of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Akiza changed into some fresh clean clothes and was watching the duel from above.

When he\u2019s targeted for an attack, I can special summon a dragon from my graveyard as long as it\u2019s level is 7 or higher. So now, feast your eyes on this.\u201d You said as strong winds was blowing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer was covering up his face from the winds until he sees a bright white light. What he sees next will, likely, leave him speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow yourself, Blue-Eyes White Dragon!\u201d You said as your ace dragon makes his presence known with a strong roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEWD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt....It can\u2019t be!!\u201d Sayer said not believing what he\u2019s seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it is and he\u2019s here. And another thing, thanks to Decoy Dragon\u2019s effect, Blue-Eyes becomes the new target for your snail\u2019s attack. And with that thing being weaker and all, Blue-Eyes, launch a counterattack with your White Lightning.\u201d You said as your dragon destroys Sayer\u2019s monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer: 2900<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat attack knocked him down when it hit him. You then hear Sayer chuckling as well right when he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must admit, I surely didn\u2019t see that coming. I guess I underestimated you a little bit. But you still have a long way to go, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.

Let\u2019s go.\u201d You said before you see her looking at a letter. \u201cAkiza? What\u2019s that you got there?\u201d You said as you come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an invitation. You\u2019re invited to participate in the Fortune Cup.\u201d Akiza said as she reads the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what?\u201d You said as you looked as well and see that she is right. \u201cWow! No way.\u201d You said as this is quite the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis must be very exciting news.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say. This is awesome.\u201d You said with a smile as Akiza noticed that you dropped your Blue-Eyes by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Yuten! You dropped your Blue-Eyes. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Akiza said as she bends down to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did, her arm starting to hurt for some strange reason and you grew very worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza! What is it?! Are you okay?!\u201d You said as you checked on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then noticed a red glow on her arm and it looks like a mark of a pair of claws and it got you quite suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza? What is that?\u201d You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Akiza said trying to cover it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Akiza, that doesn\u2019t look like nothing to me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Akiza said with a little of fear in her voice as you got closer to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll listen. You know that you can trust me.\u201d You said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza knows that by now. So, she decided to tell you in small words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I can tell you is that this mark is the reason my life is so miserable.\u201d Akiza said with sadness now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and all I ever wanted is to have it gone from my life. Because this thing gave me these powers when I was a little girl. Everywhere I go, I hurt other people with these stupid powers away. So, I had to push them away from me.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute. Is that why you want me to scram when we first met?\u201d You figured something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was so afraid of hurting, or worse, killing you, I just had to keep you at a very long distance. It was for your own good. I understand you don\u2019t want to be around me after hearing that. After all, I\u2019m just a mon-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza stopped talking when she felt you hugging her, much to her surprise. Your hug really feels comforting and soothing to her soul as you hold on to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not. And I know that you won\u2019t hurt or kill me, or anyone in that matter. You have a pure heart. I just know it. And remember this, no matter what, I\u2019ll always be with you.\u201d You said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza let out a few tears before calming down. You then picked her up to bring her back on her feet as she smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Yuten.\u201d Akiza said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it, Akiza. Now then, I know you don\u2019t want to talk about it, but I need to know why your mark appeared when you touched my Blue-Eyes?\u201d You asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just picked it up and I just felt a very strong surge from it.\u201d Akiza answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see now. That\u2019s quite the mystery. Does Sayer know about it?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But not much of it. Which reminds me, you never told me about how you got this dragon anyway. Nobody saw it for years.\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her that it, suddenly, appeared in your life on the same day you received your powers. When your parents threw you out, you hold on to that deck for it\u2019s the only thing you have to your name, even if you don\u2019t know where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s about it.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. And I thought it was strange for me.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d You said as you looked at the clock up ahead. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s almost time for lunch. Do you want to head back or check some other places? I don\u2019t mind.\u201d You asked.</span></div></div>",

In the meantime, the two of you made small talk. \"So Akiza, what happened between your mark and powers showing up and you joining the Arcadia Movement?\" You ask, trying to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I spent a bit of time in Duel Academy... before my powers went out of control and I was forced to run away.

How did a social outcast end up getting his own apartment and his own food and furniture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took a lot of time to learn to keep my powers under control. Even now I don't have complete mastery of them. But once I did, I made my own name in the street duel circuit, winning plenty of money to keep food on the table.

So, what do you think of this place?\u201d You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a breathtaking sight. I wished I known about this beach sooner.

It really helped me out a lot.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned to see Akiza giving out a small smile before going into a sad frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were so nice and caring to me when I didn\u2019t deserve much when we first met. I wished other people are like you. Perhaps then New Domino City would be a better place.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean. But, maybe there\u2019s still hope.\u201d You said making Akiza looking up at you. \u201cMaybe one day psychics and regular people can get along as a whole.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think so, Yuten?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt takes a little faith.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza regained her smile as you two continue to admire the sunset that you see before you while you walked. After some time on the beach, with making sand art, scaring Akiza for a prank, and laying back to breath in the ocean scent, it was time to head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Akiza changed back into your regular clothes, took the train back, and walked back inside the building after a good time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun. I had a good time.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would say the same too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelled in fright as you turned to see Sayer with a small smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. It\u2019s just you, Sayer. You scared me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies. I was about to get Akiza from her room until I saw you two coming in. Tell me, did you two enjoy your date?\u201d Sayer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a date, Sayer! We were just hanging out together.\u201d Akiza said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe as it may, I want you two to hold any plan you have for this week because you are going to be training starting tomorrow.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraining? For what?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis.\u201d Sayer said as he handed Akiza a letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out it\u2019s the same invitation to the Fortune Cup that you have and it\u2019s for Akiza to attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m participating in the Fortune Cup?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny. I have the exact same invitation from my apartment.\u201d You said showing Sayer your invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is an interesting development. Our star pupil and newest recruit attending in the tournament this year. Then it\u2019s up to you two to represent the Arcadia Movement proudly. Now, go and get some rest. I\u2019ll see you two after breakfast.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you followed Akiza back to her room until you made it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll be competitors in this tournament.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But, if it comes to me and you, let\u2019s try not to kill each other again.\u201d You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Akiza said before she jumps and hugs you. \u201cThank you for spending time with me. I really enjoyed it.\u201d Akiza said nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time, Akiza.\u201d You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when, unexpectedly, Akiza kissed you on the cheek and it got you go bonkers.

Between the two of you, it seemed like you had blown away every member of the Arcadia Movement, both figuratively and literally. Each day you would both return to your rooms with so little energy to even chat. Also, Sayer seemed hell-bent on keeping the two of you from interacting during this time. Whether this was to promote competition between you or just to make you focus, or if Sayer had some underlying goal from this, you couldn't tell and didn't have time to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the day of the Fortune Cup arrived.  You were both brought to the Kaiba dome in a convoy of trucks from the Arcadia Movement, making you look more like a tailgating party than a psychic support group. Now, for the first time since you got invited here, you were able to talk with Akiza after you both disembarked your respective trucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for this 'rival'?\" You ask her with a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always.\" With that, you both enter the stadium and the event staff lead you to a room with the other six competitors. To call this a colorful cast of characters would be an understatement. From an 8-foot-tall musclehead, to a knight, to a... child?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask any questions, the floor beneath you begins to rise up and the ceiling opens above you. You were lifted up into the center of the arena, the crowd roaring around you. The MC then begins to call out your names. Shira, Greiger, yourself, \"The Professor\", Akiza, \"Sir\" Randsborg, Luna, and Yusei Fudo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of that last one, the crowd entered an uproar, and even you knew why. He was from the Satellite Sector, and everyone from there is looked down upon by those in the city. Being a psychic and an outcast yourself, you knew the feeling at felt bad for the guy. Before the audience could start an all-out riot, the giant known as Greiger grabbed the Mc's mike and gave a rousing speech to shut them up. It's good to know that at least people outside the city have some respect for their fellow man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some final words from director Goodwin, the tournament began. Akiza was up against that phony knight in the second match, while you get this professor guy right after. You were all sent into a waiting room while they prepared the first duel. You took a seat at a table across from Akiza while Luna dueled off against Greiger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you nervous after seeing that crowd?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little. We both know that they aren't going to accept us once they see the truth. This was a mistake.\" She admits <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay. The world needs to see that we exist before they can begin to come around. Just keep calm and don't kill anyone and we'll be fine.\" You joke, making her chuckle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Akiza?\" An attendant asks as he walks up. \"You're up. Please come with me.\" Akiza stands up and begins to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\" You shout after her. Well, now you were all alone with nobody to talk to. Scanning the room, you see that Yusei guy watching the screen in preparation for the next match with Greiger joining him. Maybe this could be the chance to introduce yourself and express your sympathies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe you should track down Sayer and ask what your next move should be here to try and improve the movement's image. What do you do? </span></div></div>",

Right before it could start, you decided to make conversation with Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYusei?\u201d You said to get his attention. \u201cI know that you\u2019re from the Satellite Sector and I know that people from there are mistreated by people here in the city. Sorry for having to go through that.\u201d You said with sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks man. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m used to it.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really? Are you really used to that kind of pain?\u201d You asked that seemed to caught Yusei\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you ask? Are you from Satellite too?\u201d Greiger wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. But I am an outcast to a lot of people of this city. So I know what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d You said to Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Yusei wondered and you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the duel has begun and that ridiculously high and mighty \u201cSir\u201d Randsborg got the upper hand so far until Akiza makes a quick comeback. Especially, when she summoned the Black Rose Dragon. But when it showed up, you see Yusei grabbing his arm in pain. Before you could ask if he\u2019s okay, you see a glow on his arm and it looks a mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat mark. It\u2019s almost like the one Akiza has. Why does he have one?\u201d You wondered in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went on and the duel came to an end with Akiza pulling off the victory, you then told Yusei that you\u2019ll see him later before you left. You stopped to see Akiza coming in and you went to congratulate her on her win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice one, Akiza.\u201d You complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Yuten. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great in your duel too.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, I should get going.

Now take this creep out and end this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a reaffirming nod before turning back to her duel. \"Let's keep going then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all Luna had that guy on the ropes. Unfortunately, she had to cut the duel short in a draw before some stone dragon skeleton crushed the Professor. You feel yourself fade away again like you felt coming here. Soon, your vision goes to white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it returns, you see that Yusei was carrying Luna off the arena, while the Professor just stood there, almost comatose. You dust yourself off and make your own way out of the ring. As you leave, you hear the announcer inform the crowd that both duelists have lost and neither will get to advance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, unknown to you, Sayer watched on from the shadows. \"Interesting.\" He says before slinking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go now?</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s when you see another dragon and it\u2019s one that you know best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlue-Eyes?\u201d You said to the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned to see a huge amount of purple flames and they were destroying the dragons, including, to your horror, Blue-Eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBLUE-EYES!!

Because I\u2019m not afraid to make some sacrifices. Speaking of sacrifices, I think I\u2019ll give up another 1000 life points to make room for Kaibaman\u2019s ability.

Wait a minute, Greiger mentioned something about that in his speech. What exactly is this thing anyhow?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ancient force of unimaginable power that once existed 5,000 years ago. Now, Goodwin is planning to use that force to bring the world to its knees.\u201d Sayer continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike world domination? But what about Akiza? What does this have to do with her?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat mark on her arm which you likely saw is the mark of the Crimson Dragon, this making her what Goodwin call a signer.\u201d Sayer stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigner? That was what that woman you kept seeing in your dreams said. So Akiza\u2019s a signer? Then Yusei, Luna, and Jack must be one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, that\u2019s where we come in.

Now, how about you go and freshen up. Breakfast will be ready soon.\u201d Sayer said before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and left to take a shower. It was good that Sayer finally come clean. But there was something suspicious about his story. If the Crimson Dragon was going to be used as a means of dominating power, that why would it showed you the vision yesterday? Not to mention that the signers like Akiza was supposed to be somewhat protectors like that woman said. All of this has left you with one solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s not telling the whole truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then got freshened up and went to</span></div></div>",

The moments were decent and the actors are doing quite well doing their roles. All you could do is watch while Akiza\u2019s sitting next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is actually a nice film.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to watch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. In fact, I think I know that one actress from another movie I saw as a little kid.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed a little as you reminded yourself of your younger years before you got your powers. You wished that you\u2019re still with your parents right now. But, on the bright side, if it wasn\u2019t for those powers, you wouldn\u2019t have met the beautiful rose known as Akiza. So, it\u2019s like a blessing in disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe film went on to the part where the couple went in for a kiss and it made your face go red for it gives you a thought of the girl sitting next to you. You can feel your heart getting warmed up as the film was just about ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was beautiful.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sure was.\u201d You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Just not as beautiful as you are.</i>\u201d You said in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d Akiza said as she gets up to take the movie out, only to find one of her cards dropped on the floor. \u201cOh nuts. I dropped a card. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Akiza said as she bends down to get her card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bends down, you blushed super red as you see Akiza\u2019s butt just a few feet away from your face. You kept telling the little voice in your head that you\u2019re not going to jump on Akiza like a pervy freak-show. You then relax yourself as Akiza stands back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go. So, ready for another movie?\u201d Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d You said.</span></div></div>",

The only real highlight was during a slasher film where Akiza got scared enough to clutch into your arm. When that happened, you had to fight to make it seem like you didn't notice that her breasts were pushing against your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suprised you that Sayer had no need for either of you all day. You guessed it was because he was focusing on putting psychics in a positive light. Without his interruption, the two of them only stopped for meals, otherwise you spent the whole day in Akiza's room watching movies. Finally, the last movie Akiza chose was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun.\" You say as you stretch and check the time. It was almost midnight. \"Well, it's getting late. I think I'll head back to my room then. Goodnight Akiza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a pat on the shoulder as you start to leave, only for her to hug you from behind. \"Goodnight.\" She releases you and begins to put the movies away while you close the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in your room, you change into your nightwear and climb into bed. You were torn between whether or not you were hoping for another one of those dreams to happen tonight. You didn't dwell on it too much, however, as you soon found yourself out cold. Meanwhile, unknown to you, your Blue-Eyes began to glow, and across the sea, over the Satellite, the glyph of a giant hung in the sky.</span></div></div>",

Come on.\u201d You said as you got up and you and Akiza went to the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you two got there, you looked up and were shocked to see a glyph of a giant looming in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s huge.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second. Judging from the direction we\u2019re looking at, it looks like it\u2019s coming from the Satellite.\u201d You figured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I was right, it must be Yusei.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you know?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t really explain it well, but our marks seems to be linking us together. So I can sense when he\u2019s in danger. He must be dueling over there\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably against whoever put up the light show over there.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another glance at your glowing Blue-Eyes until you felt the same surge going through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuten? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to her surprise, your eyes began to glow blue and you began to see things. You looked over and you can see Yusei dueling against whoever he\u2019s facing off against in the same ginormous flaming giant you saw just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see the duel. But why am I seeing this? And who\u2019s Yusei dueling?\u201d You thought in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground then began to shake like an earthquake and you looked up and see glowing orbs going into what appears to be a a giant beating heart. When it was done, you looked on in horror as you see what could be the biggest monster you have ever seen. It was in the form of a giant with blue linings on it and it was causing damage with it\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat.....the absolute hell.......is that?!\u201d You wondered in awe of this behemoth before you hear the other duelist talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu! Pound this pathetic signer into the darkness!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, that thing was going after Yusei. He tried everything he could to stop it, but he couldn\u2019t as that giant was close to crushing him. Before it could even touch him, you see Yusei\u2019s runner giving out and he was tumbling back words hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYUSEI!!\u201d You cries out seeing him fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything else could happen, you can feel yourself coming back to Akiza as you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuten? Are you okay?\u201d Akiza asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so. But, I saw the duel and I think Yusei\u2019s hurt pretty bad.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got that feeling too.\u201d Akiza said as her mark and the glow on Blue-Eyes disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duel maybe over, for what it seems, but you have a feeling that the worse is yet to come as you went back to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Now tell me where is my brother?\u201d Misty demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour brother?\u201d You and Akiza said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and I want you to tell me now, Black Rose.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know him. Why do you think I do?\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough lies. I want answers and I want them now, Ms. Akiza. Your group the Arcadia Movement stole him from me. So, answer me this one last time. Where is my brother?\u201d Misty asked starting to become more demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Misty. We\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re deal here is, but I think this is a complete misunderstanding for we don\u2019t know anything about this missing brother of yours.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Well then, if you won\u2019t give me the answers willingly, then I\u2019ll just have to duel them out of you.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Akiza said standing her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d You asked Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious that she won\u2019t leave until she gets what she wants.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour witch of a girlfriend is right, my friend. And, to tell you the truth, I was hoping it would come to this. This duel would be the perfect test of the new abilities I\u2019ve been offered. Do not let my perfect face fool you for I am a Dark Signer that is ready to send you to the Netherworld!\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Dark Signer?!\u201d You and Akiza gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was telling the truth as you see a purple mark of a lizard on her arm and she was going through some sort of transformation. While Akiza\u2019s mark and your dragon was reacting to this, you see her now wearing a different dress only with black robes with green lines on it. You also see her have markings underneath her eyes and those same eyes are as black as the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what a Dark Signer looks like.\u201d You thought in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrepare yourself, Black Rose, for my deck will force the truth right out of you.\u201d Misty said with a little anger as another earthquake happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it stopped, you wondered on what you should do about this.</span></div></div>",

So this is the legendary Blue-Eyes White Dragon that you used at the tournament. I feel honored to face such a tremendous beast.\u201d Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s too bad that he doesn\u2019t feel the same way. But he\u2019s the least of your problems. Because I now activate Monster Reborn. This allows me to bring back one monster from either graveyard to my side of the field. So tell me, if you think one Blue-Eyes is impressive, then how about two?\u201d You said as you now have a second Blue-Eyes joining you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo Blue-Eyes huh? Not bad.\u201d Carly said smirking at your dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and this will bring you down a peg or two. Blue-Eyes number one, direct attack with White Lightning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I play the trap Magic Cylinder! With this, you\u2019re about to be hit by your own monster\u2019s attack as you take damage equal to its attack points.\u201d Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d You gasped as your dragons blast hit you right back and you were knocked down on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? That felt real. Are you a psychic duelist too?\u201d You wondered as you get back up on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. That was from the very shadows itself and by the time this is over, you\u2019ll be begging for mercy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your dreams, Dark Signer. Don\u2019t forget, I still have one more Blue-Eyes to hit you with. Go and finished what your twin started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack did hit Carly and she was sent back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly: 1000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more turn. That\u2019s all I need and we can be one step closer to stopping this madness. I just need to make it to my next turn. I\u2019m done. Make your move, Carly.\u201d</span></div></div>",

For now, you wondered on who this woman really is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks, anyway, uhhh, what\u2019s your name exactly?\u201d You want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am titled as the Maiden with Eyes of Blue. But you may call me Kisara.\u201d Kisara introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara, huh? Well, I want to know why you keep coming into my vision.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all started years ago. You see, Blue-Eyes, as you call him, once allied with the dragons and the Crimson Dragon to fight against the Army of Shadows 5000 years ago for they once tried to destroy both the human and spirit worlds. When they were defeated, the dragon was afraid that they will one day return. So he was chosen to watch over the human and spirit realms in secret by turning himself into stone waiting for his champion.\u201d Kisara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that involves me how?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the prophecy said that, in the next 5000 years, that very champion will be born to be his chosen one. That is you, Yuten. He has chosen you and we offered you the power by giving you that deck.\u201d Kisara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe deck? The deck?! Wait a second! That day when I got the deck when I was 7! That was you?!\u201d You said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Not only did we sense the strong will within you, but the pure light inside you as well. Even though you became a psychic, you\u2019d never succumbed to hatred or revenge. That\u2019s why he has selected you.\u201d Kisara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I never knew.\u201d You said as you realized something else. \u201cAkiza! She was in the building! Is she okay?!\u201d You said in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can see for yourself.\u201d Kisara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe new powers you have acquired. You can use them to find your friends by sensing their signer energies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to use them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you have to do and is mediate and concentrate on your spiritual energy. It will help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to follow Kisara\u2019s lead as you sit down, breathe easily, and closed your eyes to concentrate on your powers. You looked around and you managed to find her. You\u2019re glad that she\u2019s okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, physically okay. You can\u2019t say the same about her emotional state. You see her dueling Yusei at the hospital and you hear her saying that she has no one left with you and Sayer gone. It sounds like she\u2019s going on an emotional rampage right now and that\u2019s bad news to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d You gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Kisara wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza\u2019s going ballistic against Yusei. I need to get back!\u201d Only problem is that you don\u2019t know how. \u201cUmm, how do I get back to New Domino City?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame way you got here.\u201d Kisara answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at your dragon, who is willing to take you home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, pal. Let\u2019s get going.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust remember, this is just the beginning of what the dark signers will do to our worlds. The future is in your hands. Farewell and good luck.\u201d Kisara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Kisara. See you later.\u201d You said goodbye to Kisara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on, Akiza.

Should you ever need my knowledge, simply focus your powers once again.\" You hear her voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't have time to dwell on that, Akiza needed help. Putting the two cards in your deck, you rush into the room. You see Akiza's powers are going wild, but she's not angry, she looks sad and confused.

Please, just end this.\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Akiza, but I'm only doing this because you asked me to. The curse of the Black Rose ends here.

It was a turbo duel Jack and I had at an empty arena. When our dragons attacked each other, something appeared.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just something. It was the Crimson Dragon.\u201d Jack continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. It has chosen to instill it\u2019s power in each of you, influencing your lives until you all came together at this time at this place.\u201d Goodwin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah woah! Time out. Influencing our lives? Are you saying that it was manipulating everything we\u2019ve been doing up until now?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody tells me what to do. This is my life, okay? I\u2019m the one in the driver seat, pal!\u201d Jack protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you think this is all a coincidence? Leaving the Satellite? Finding Yusei and meeting the others? In your hearts, you each know that you\u2019re destined for something bigger than a normal life. That is the dragon spirit guiding you.\u201d Goodwin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why all of us? Sure, I know we\u2019re good with a deck.\u201d Yusei wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis goes far beyond your skills as a duelist. The Crimson Dragon sensed the strength in your hearts and has chosen the four of you to take on the Army of Shadows. This has always been your destiny.\u201d Goodwin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that Akiza was doubt about the role she now knows she\u2019s apart of. She doesn\u2019t know that she can help save everyone after everything she\u2019s done and what they put her through. But Goodwin told her that it was the very power and the legend of the black rose that brought you and everyone else together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then explained that she has been to the spirit world like you can and met Ancient Fairy Dragon. She said that spirit world was in trouble and need her help. Goodwin then said that you all have gifts and you all on the same side, the side of the Crimson Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd all this time, I just want it gone.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodwin. Just one question. You said that we needed five signers, right? But we only have the four of us right now. So when will the last singer be revealed?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise the fifth signer is ready to join our fight. For safety reasons, I\u2019m forced to keep thier identity a secret. But know that when you face true danger, they will appear along with the full power of the Crimson Dragon.\u201d Goodwin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on here. If that\u2019s true, then why do we need Yuten with us? Like you said, he\u2019s not a signer.\u201d Jack wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then explained to everyone what Kisara told you, that your Blue-Eyes was summoned by the praises of the spirit world so it could help join in the fight against the Army of Shadows. When they were defeated, your dragon knows that they will return one day. So it imprisoned itself in a stone tablet here on Earth where it would watch over the human realm until it\u2019s chosen one will arise, which they now know is you when you got the deck 10 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your story, Goodwin give you all a history lesson by telling you that the Crimson Dragon locked the Army of Shadows underground, carving them into what you know today as the Nazca Lines. One day, something called the Ener-D reactor blew up unleashing tons of negative energy that helped cracked their prison. That same negative energy was infecting people so the dark signers can use them as shadow drones. They want to sent them to the Netherworld so that you can\u2019t summon the Crimson Dragon before the Army of Shadows arises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei then explained that they were using something called a Dark Synchro summon, where instead of adding levels together, these dark tuners subtract them from the non-tuners as negative energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodwin then told you that the Dark Signers get their power from the bad emotions from people so that they can use them to power themselves up. He then said that if you fail to stop them, the world will be in complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then shows you the Earthbound Immortals that they use, including the one that beat you, as they contain the very power of this shadow army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see? This is more than beating an enemy. It\u2019s a rescue operation to help those who are now under the influence of darkness. You\u2019ll have to commit yourselves, body and soul, as a signer.\u201d Goodwin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza was thinking about this hard and come to conclusion that she can help them, even if they ruined her life. After all, she owes it to you and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodwin, there\u2019s something you should know about the dark signer I dueled.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Yusei?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time we met. He was infected like you said, but he had these old memories of Jack and I. In fact, he was once our friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat duelist was your friend?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. His name is Kalin. We used to be a four man squad known as The Enforcers back at the Satellite. We helped people by making Satellite a safe place to be.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then why is he a Dark Signer?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s....it\u2019s a long complicated story.\u201d Yusei hesitated a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering him, but you choose not to press it on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodwin then said that you might not be able to beat these guys. It sounds like you all already lost the war before it even got started. He the said there\u2019s still hope, but it\u2019s going to be difficult because you all nearly lost your matches with them. You should know since you almost got sent to the Netherworld by Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow do you understand? You all must face this threat together. But, even if we do manage to succeed, I can\u2019t promise you that we\u2019ll be standing here again. I hope you can all look into your hearts and make the decision that our world needs. But be quick. I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d Goodwin said before he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you remain in Goodwin\u2019s mansion thinking about what to do now.

Because we can\u2019t save the world from the apocalypse without you, man.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same goes for the both of you.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then came in and it looks like the group is all here. You now have the feeling that things may turn out okay after all. Still, it\u2019s going to be a dangerous task to do. But you now know that you won\u2019t be alone in this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, you and Akiza are standing next to each other staring at the sunset in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really pay much attention to sunsets and now this could be the last one we see.\u201d Akiza said looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could be. But all of us are now one team and together we\u2019re going to kick the darkness back to whatever hole they came from.\u201d You said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost feel bad for those dark signers. They won\u2019t know what\u2019s coming.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that again. Listen, I want to say thank you.\u201d You said to Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor slapping me back to my senses. I let the fear of letting all of us down cloud my sense of purpose. This will be a scary battle that we\u2019ll be facing, but I now know that if we\u2019re going to beat these guys, we can\u2019t let fear get the best of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad I was able to help and don\u2019t make me have to use it again. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything else, you see Mina come rushing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMina? What\u2019s up?\u201d You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome quickly! It\u2019s an emergency!\u201d Mina said with panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed to what looks like a central room and you looked on at the monitors to see Satellite covering in a black barrier. You have a feeling that the dark signers are behind that and you know what you need to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, guys. I\u2019m through standing around here. It\u2019s time we take the fight to them.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor once, I agree with Yuten.\u201d Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a helicopter ready.\u201d Mina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was close to nighttime and you all are now standing with Goodwin on a helipad waiting for your ride to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s stay on task. You need to get to the original Ener-D reactor in the Satellite.\u201d Goodwin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mentioned that in your story before. What exactly is this thing?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the source of the negative energy that cause this dark smoke to appear. And, in a twist of fate, it was built by Yusei\u2019s father.\u201d Goodwin said shocking all of you, minus Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d You said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like our Yusei?\u201d Akiza aske.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and this is his opportunity to heal the mistakes of the past. And now, you all have an opportunity to make things right again. You must beat the dark signers and find the reactor. Then, if you\u2019re able, activate in reverse. Hopefully, this will create a surge of positive energy and imprison the shadow army again.\u201d Goodwin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou the see the helicopter coming in and you see the pilot of the copter is run by a sector security officer name Trudge. You all got on and you looked at Akiza\u2019s eyes to ask her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast chance, Akiza. You sure you\u2019re up to do this?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. I\u2019m ready and I know that you are too.\u201d Akiza replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s fly.\u201d You said before taking off.</span></div></div>",

Where did he come from?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To understand that, you should understand another monster in your deck, the White Stone of Legend. In the waiting before meeting you, the three Blue-Eyes put their power into forming a special egg. This egg grew more powerful than they had expected. Then, one of the dragons merged the egg's power with it's own, creating the beast you know as Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon. Soon, Azure-Eyes became a beast separate from the dragon that created it. It too learned of legend that it's companions were a part of and agreed to help. With their new ally by their side, the now four dragons awaited their newest master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's incredible.\" You say. Just then, you feel a force pushing into your arm. \"I think that's my friends trying to get me up. I have to go know, but I'll be back someday Kisara.\" You close your eyes and begin to unfocus your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck Yuten.\" You hear before you return to your physical body.</span></div></div>",

You see that you\u2019re in front of a house in the middle of a forest and you see a couple of children coming out along with a woman in a red dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Jack bowing down in front of the woman doing something that made you chuckle your butt off and Jack was giving you a look that says \u201claugh and I\u2019ll kill you\u201d, which made you whistle in an innocent fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, ma\u2019am. Nice place you have here.\u201d You said nicely to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.

She said that when the fog appeared, it was covering the downtown area of Satellite. When it cleared up, everyone in it was gone. You can bet your bottom dollar that the dark signers are responsible for that. You then hear Yusei saying that he\u2019s no longer afraid of facing this Kalin person one more time if it means saving the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Yuten? You\u2019re clearly not a signer. Are you sure that you want to go through with this ordeal?\u201d Martha asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m positive. I\u2019m kinda like the back up of this group. So, believe it or not, I\u2019m in this to the end.\u201d You said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, before you head off, you must eat. You can\u2019t go saving the world on an empty stomach.\u201d Martha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to wait outside for a bit while dinner was getting ready. You then see a couple of roses in a garden. Perhaps you can get some for Akiza when this is all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking to get a girl something I see.\u201d You heard someone said that scared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see that it\u2019s Martha with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. You scared me, Martha. No. I\u2019m just, uh, enjoying the nature here. Yeah. That\u2019s it.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that Akiza girl, don\u2019t you?\u201d Martha wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no. Uh, maybe.\u201d You said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYusei mentioned something about you and her when he was last here. And I must say, she\u2019s very lucky to have someone like you in her life.\u201d Martha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But, I wasn\u2019t able to save a person she called a father figure. So, what if I\u2019m not strong enough? What if I can\u2019t protect her like I promised?\u201d You wondered with doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Yuten. When a person finds someone that\u2019s precious to their hearts and is worth protecting, they become stronger. You just need to believe that in yourself.\u201d Martha said with wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m certain of it.\u201d Martha replies before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought hard and realized that she\u2019s right. You have to stay strong within yourself if you want to help save the world and protect Akiza because there is no doubt now that you indeed love her.</span></div></div>",

Down there!\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut where\u2019s Taka?\u201d Martha wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s up on the...\u201d You were interrupted when and earthquake happened. \u201cNow what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to see the same giant heart in the air sucking up streams of negative energy. This could only mean one thing, Roman is about to summon his Earthbound Immortal. You also see that John and Mitch are about to be sucked up by the heart. This is bad! You have no time to go down there and save them. All you can do is hope for a miracle to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who here ordered a miracle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all looked up to see none other than Jack Atlas coming in for the save. He used he Signer powers to create a barrier to keep the boy\u2019s spirits safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did it!\u201d Martha said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank God. Now let\u2019s go find and save that Taka kid.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three climbed the stairs until you reached the roof. You looked to find Taka right by the edge of the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s alright!\u201d Akiza said seeing Taka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness. Now all we have to...\u201d Martha was going to say before you interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncoming!\u201d You cries out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn attack that belonged to a ginormous spider with red lines on it was blocked by Yusei, only for the attack to come hitting the building that you\u2019re in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is going down!\u201d Akiza yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me!

It\u2019s like the Black Rose is trying to make a comeback or something.\u201d Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over and see that Leo was right. Akiza seems to be in a trance for her eyes seems dull that goes with the evil look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza, what happened to you?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked and was surprised to see someone you know from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that....Sayer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprise considering that the last time you saw him, he was fall down into that mist with you when the Arcadia Movement got destroyed. You don\u2019t know how he\u2019s here now, but you have a pretty good idea on why he\u2019s here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMina, stay here and watch the kids.\u201d You said as you run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Mina asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo settle a score.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to the building to where Sayer is and you bust down the door to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuten. Long time no see.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you here? I saw you fall into the mist when we fell.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had my ways.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to Akiza?\u201d You asked frowning at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple really. When she first came to the Arcadia Movement, I had to use my powers on her to keep her powers in check fearing that it would destroy her. But now, thanks to a special sentence I told her, her powers have finally awaken to its fullest potential.\u201d Sayer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy. I want to get revenge on the dark signers for destroying the Arcadia Movement and Akiza is going to make that revenge possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not that person anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s who I say she is and I say that she\u2019s a one woman army who will obey my every order until my war with the dark signers is over. As a matter of fact, I could say the same for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I seen the potential that you possessed as well when we first dueled and the power you\u2019ve shown afterwards. Also, during the tournament, I\u2019ve noticed that you have another gift. While you were resting after your injuries, I looked into it and see that you also have the power to travel to this spirit world. A psychic duelist with the ability to travel such a place, that\u2019s a one of a kind find. So, I figured that with the two of you under my command, I would be unstoppable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave us out of this, Sayer. We\u2019re through being your pawns!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you say through? You\u2019re through when I say you are and I\u2019m never letting you two go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if I have anything to say about that.\u201d You said as you activate your duel disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really want to duel me?\u201d Sayer asked activating his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.

Akiza!\u201d You called out to her, but she doesn\u2019t appeared to be responding to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then ran towards her and grabbed to shake her, hoping it would wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza!

I maybe down, but I\u2019m not out just yet. In fact, Ground Capture also lets me draw a new card.\u201d Akiza said as she draws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and draw, Akiza. With only 200 life points left, it won\u2019t make a difference. In fact, I\u2019m so sure of it, I think I\u2019ll end with a face down.\u201d The possessed Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s my turn now.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d You called out as you stepped in. \u201cI\u2019m joining in on this duel.\u201d You said standing next to Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure, Yuten?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did say that I won\u2019t let you face her alone this time and I mean it.\u201d You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wished to share her fate, Yuten, then I\u2019m more than happy to oblige.\u201d The possessed Misty said evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry as you want to, but you\u2019ll only fail.

If you don\u2019t believe me, then let us prove it right now.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Akiza\u2019s mark was glowing more than it should be, only for it to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Akiza gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that\u2019s happening, you eyes were glowing blue again.

As the King of the Netherworld got closer, you, Akiza, and Luna used your dragons to slow down him and the minions he summoned. Soon, it was down to Yusei with only one life point left. But then, a miracle happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodwin lost his signer mark, with his head of the dragon going to Yusei, and Yusei's tail mark being passed on to Crow.

With no more reports of vanishing people, public support towards your group began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Akiza, your new girlfriend.

Please, let me cum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, my favorite pet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue on licking her folds while you stocked two fingers inside her that made her want more.

If you can\u2019t handle it, give me the word and I\u2019ll stop immediately.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed your shaft right into her anus and Akiza was feeling</span></div></div>",

I've arranged my own <i>surprise</i> for you for our anniversary.\" She responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head back, where Sion freaks out at the sight of the new runner, going on about how much work he's been saved and how amazing it is. You two ignore him for the most part as you head back to your room. Before you enter, though, Akiza stops you. \"Not yet. You stay out here until I call for you. Trust me, you're going to love this.\" She says with a seductive grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves you waiting out in the hallway while you wait.

Now then, let's get on to the main event, shall we?\" She says as she slides her underwear to the side.

I can handle a baby.\" With that, ceremony went out the window as Misty impaled herself on your cock. \"Uuughn.\" She moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then begins gyrating her hips in ways you never even expected and her breasts shook like they were at a rave. You couldn't tell if it was from the foreplay earlier or if she was just that good, but you were already feeling close. Not wanting to leave her unsatisfied, you try using your powers in a new way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused as well as you could to try and find her clitorus.

You both blew your respective orgasms into a mess inside her and on your lower body. She soon collapses on top of you, her breasts squishing against your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.. was... amazing.\" She says, giving you a quick kiss on the lips. </span></div></div>",

You knew that voice, there was no arguing with her when she put on that voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's go.\" You tell her in conceit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain once we're on our runners.\" You tell her. You both go down and you tell the lady at the front that you'll both be gone for a little while and you give her a number for where you'll be staying. With that, you both mount your respective runners and ride off with Akiza following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you gonna tell me what the plan is now?\" She calls up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Mina's intel is right, my big bro is selling himself out as some big-shot bodyguard to the people of the Tops. He seems to work with personal contracts, meaning he's hired by individual citizens rather than a company. But, we just so happen to know a couple of Tops residents that would be willing to help and that he wouldn't turn down the chance to protect.\" You shout back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe catches on to what your planning and you continue on to your destination in relative silence. You show the gate guard your information and that you do, in fact, know people that lived here, and he let's you both in.</span></div></div>",

How come?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, one night, I snuck back into the building a few days before it collapsed and stole a bunch of a small books that looks like a list of missing people. I searched high and low for any info I can find about these people and that\u2019s where I found it.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound what?\u201d Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe place where they\u2019re holding all of the missing and failed psychic duelists.

While that was going on, you bring the kids to some vans where they\u2019ll have a safe ride home while anyone that was working down there as a guard was arrested. Also, you and the others were standing outside with Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done, guys. You just solved one of New Domino City\u2019s biggest mysteries.\u201d Mina complimented you three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat mostly goes to Ren here.

It\u2019s a list of the locations of the other facilities like this one!\u201d Mina said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat means you\u2019re a giant step closer from shutting this case close.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have this ready tomorrow. Ready for a ride home?\u201d Mina offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all nodded and you made it to the Arcadia Movement. Ren decided to stay for the night and you agreed. Morning came and you, Akiza, and Ren are standing out at the front with Toby as a limo came by. When it opened, you three see Misty walking out of the limo and was so emotional to see her little brother in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToby.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty!\u201d Toby said as he ran up to hug his sister, who is emotionally crying right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve miss you so much.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Toby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty then turned her attention to the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. You saved my brother. I\u2019m forever thankful.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad we can help. Oh yeah. This is my brother, Ren. He\u2019s the one that found the place Toby was held in.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure to meet you.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too. Thank you so much.\u201d Misty said as she goes to him and hugs him, which has him stunned while you smiled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see her giving out her card that has her number to Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink of this as a thank you present. Call me if you want to hangout sometime.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure.\u201d Ren said while blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think we should get home now. Mom and dad will be surprised to see you.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d Toby said as he and Misty drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You got the number from the supermodel. Someone is getting lucky already.\u201d You teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut up.\u201d Ren said still blushing while you and Akiza chuckled at him. \u201cYou know, after seeing that, I think I need to do some reuniting too.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d You wondered as Ren nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three made it to the house your parents are living in and Ren took a deep breath before knocking on the door. You parents answered and were stunned with joy to see him as they hugged him. You smiled on with Akiza as this maybe the most happiest moment you have ever seen in your life. After the moment passed, you walked up over to Ren to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen, my offer to stay at the movement is still there for you. We have plenty of room.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Yuten. But, I think I\u2019m going to stay with Mom and Dad for a while.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019re more than welcome to stay there if you want to.\u201d Your mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. After all, we have years of catching up to work on.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s always open if you\u2019re into it.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Ren said.</span></div></div>",

Have you ever turbo dueled before?\u201d You asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did a couple of years ago, but my runner kinda got destroyed. Don\u2019t ask how. Why do you ask me if I did?\u201d Ren wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you know, the WRGP is coming and I\u2019m wondering if you would like to join me and Akiza in the tournament as our third member.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Ren asked as you and Akiza nodded. \u201cThen I don\u2019t see why not.

Give it a couple of days and we\u2019ll have it ready for you.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m in.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. We\u2019re on the same team now.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right and we\u2019re going straight to the top.\u201d You said as you three fist bumped each other. \u201cWell, it\u2019s getting late. We\u2019re going home now.\u201d You said as you and Akiza were about to leave before you realize something. \u201cOh yeah. One more thing. Can\u2019t wait to see you and Misty on a date.\u201d You teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that! I-I\u2019m not sure if I can do that.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I never been on a date before and I have no clue on what to do when it comes to women.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, all I can tell you is that, if you like this woman, then go get her when the time is right.

The ones we have now will go towards training new members like I originally intended. Speaking of which, remind me to tell Sion that I'm increasing his budget for Ren's runner. That way he can make it more powerful and maybe add some decals.\" You explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted.

But I want to have some control first like you have when I was your little fun bunny.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. That was something I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget.\u201d You said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was thinking that I should return the favor as I\u2019ll be your sexy mistress and you\u2019ll be my favorite little slave.\u201d Akiza said walking closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fair. Although, I must warn you that I\u2019m really not much of a submissive type.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. But don\u2019t worry, I can help you with that. And, if you be a good servant, I\u2019ll let you give me that spanking as a reward.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me, Aki...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEp ep ep!

I\u2019ll take this punishment of yours.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Here it comes.\u201d You said as you bring your hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then bring your hand down hard on Akiza\u2019s butt and you hear a good smacking sound as well as her moaning. You kept on spanking her over and over again as you see her ass turning pink with your hand prints while she moans away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you enduring this, little Akiza? I might go and spank it harder.\u201d You wondered as you look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am, Master. I know that I\u2019ve been a very very bad girl. Go ahead and spank me as much as you can.\u201d Akiza said keeping it going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you asked.\u201d You said as you give her harder spankings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear moans getting louder and see her bottom getting a bit red now. This whole Master/Mistesss thing was really something else. Who would\u2019ve guessed? After about a while, you stopped and see you <i>handy</i> work as your prints are in those plump cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you learned your lesson?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have, Master.\u201d Akiza said as you see the look of both pain and pleasure on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you suffered enough.

My butt is starting to feel so much better.\u201d Akiza said while laying on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to lick and kiss both of Akiza\u2019s butt cheeks until you two withdraw it right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you think, Yuten?\u201d Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was...actually amazing. I mean, who would\u2019ve guessed that being a servant can get you so turned on?\u201d You wondered with a small smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed that little fantasy, Yuten. I think we should try that again sometime soon.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I actually agree. But, for now, let\u2019s get some sleep. We\u2019ve got a busy day ahead of us.\u201d You said as you lay down on the bed while Akiza takes off her boots and puts the dominatrix outfit in her drawer as well as your runner attire on the chair before returning back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe sure do. However, I think my poor cute bottom is a little sore for me to lay on it tonight. I\u2019m going to need you as my pillow.\u201d Akiza said as she lays on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d You as you see Akiza close to your face as you two give each other a nice long romantic kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, Master.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, Mistress.\u201d You said back before you fall asleep while Akiza wraps the blanket around you two before doing the same.</span></div></div>",

You see, for a long time, society has been afraid of the psychic population. Therefore, they\u2019ve become isolated and it caused a crack in the trust between us.

Maybe if they do get together, we should try arranging for a double date.\u201d Akiza said as she got into bed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually a great idea. But let\u2019s have those two have their fun first.\u201d You said as you rest your head on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Akiza said as she got on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gives you a nice long tongue kiss for some quick excitement before she goes to rest her head on the pillow. You then go on to move your head on her breasts before drifting off to sleep while Akiza wraps her hands around your head to keep you on her breasts before going to sleep too.</span></div></div>",

You didn't have to give me shelter in your home, but you did. You didn't have to tend to my injuries, but you did. You could've done terrible things to me while I was unconscious, but you didn't. You didn't have to give up your bed to me to sleep on the couch, but you did. I guess that night, it all came together while I was asleep, along with you being a fellow psychic that understood me. I just knew that you would be the one. That's why I was so eager to make breakfast the next morning, to show you what I can do as a woman.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.

Well, I've told you mine, now it's your turn. When exactly did you decide that you were in love with me?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd say the day after we first met. When I saw you happy and laughing at breakfast. When you got all excited when I passed Sayer's test.  Not to mention the great show I got during our beach trip.\" You say, getting an elbow in your arm for that last part. \"You were true perfection. I didn't think that you felt the same way up until you said so during the battle with Misty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did, and I still do, more than ever, in fact.\" She says.

You felt like she already had the time of her life as you let her take her nap. You rest your head on her breasts and just let her embrace come to you as you start to relax yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were, you start to think about what your mother said yesterday. Maybe marrying Akiza would be an amazing idea. You love the girl to death, for crying out loud. Still, you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re up to such a commitment. You decided to wait on your decision until after the WRGP is over with. Until then, you just be happy with what you got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about two to three hours later, it was almost night time as you and Akiza woke up to see each other\u2019s faces that has lovely smiles on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, sleeping beauty. Feeling better?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am. That was really amazing. I hope I didn\u2019t screamed too loud.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you, certainly, almost bust an eardrum. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d You joked that got you a smack on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny. Anyway, I think I\u2019m going to take a quick shower. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d Akiza said as she got up, grabbed her fresh clean underwear, and went into the bathroom, not before she does one more thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to the bathroom and see that she just threw something at your face. You looked to see what it is and it turns out it\u2019s the panties that she just came in earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope they smell nice.\u201d Akiza said in a naughty tone before she went to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took one sniff of her panties and the scent had you feel aroused inside. You swear that she\u2019s such a naughty dirty girl. But, that\u2019s one of the things you love her about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got you a serious erection as you continue to take in the amazing scent of your girlfriend from her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid they smell like you wanted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to see Akiza and, to your amazement, she\u2019s</span></div></div>",

Even after the year you two have spent seeing each other near naked and your recent... escapades lately, you've never gotten the chance to see her full naked body from top to bottom like this. Usually thrre was some form of clothing or blanket covering her, or you were too close to take in the full sight at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean rose scented, then no. These smell even sweeter.\" You tell her with a cheeky grin. She crawls into bed next to you and starts to get close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear. Now strip down and turn the other way. Tonight is cuddles only, and I don't want you trying anything funny.\" She orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply do as she says and slide off your boxers before you turn away from her. She seizes the opportunity to grab you from behind and wrap herself as close as possible to you, her breasts pushing into your back. \"Thank you. Now turn the t.v. on. It's movie night.\" You conply once again and flick on the remote to the first movie you have saved.</span></div></div>",

You and Akiza said goodnight to each other before heading off to dream land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and you took your shower before joining Akiza for breakfast. After breakfast was done, you decided on what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s a lovely day outside for a stroll. Want to join?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t. Some of the female students we have here need my assistance and I can\u2019t let them down.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice. I\u2019ll be sure to get something for you on the way back.\u201d You said as you got dressed before kissing Akiza and you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now having a nice ride along the city underneath the nice sunlight. While you were riding, you had your mind wondering on future possibilities for you. Winning the WRGP and, maybe, marrying Akiza before starting a family with her. It would be great to do. You decided to hold each of those ideas one at a time for a while because you don\u2019t want to rush into things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted when you see another turbo duelist coming from behind you and you got a strange vibe about this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo around, you jackass!\u201d You cried out to him as you signaled him to go around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you see a bunch more turbo duelists coming in as a road block. You stopped and you got out of the runner to see what\u2019s their deal here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this, boys?\u201d You wondered as you show no sign of backing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d A biker said as he ran on after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dodged him before you give him a quick and strong punch to his gut, causing him to fall down in pain. Two more guys had their turn to attack you as you dodged them as well before you bashed their heads into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s good. We may have some fun here. Get him, boys!\u201d The leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on to fight these guys and manages to fight off each and every one of them. You see that they looked down for the count as you regain your breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad enough, boys?\u201d You asked before something else happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAHHHHHH!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got shocked from behind before you collapsed and got knocked out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In your conscious)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling a bit groggy after getting shocked before you see that you were in New Domino City, but rather, it looks like some kind of temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Am I in the spirit world?</i>\u201d You wondered in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around this strange place before you see someone you know very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara! Hey! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d You called out before she just vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting weird, even for you. You then see a card that\u2019s face down on a stone tablet. You have this feeling that you should pick it up, which you did before the card was glowing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back into consciousness)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up slowly as you feel your hands are pretty tied up right now.

It sure looks delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you enjoy it.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I will.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your first bite out of it and you were really in awe of how tasty it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I think my tastebuds are dancing with happiness. This is awesome.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust for that.\u201d You reached in for your wallet and pulled out some money before shoving it into Akiza\u2019s cleavage. \u201cThat\u2019s your reward.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Master.\u201d Akiza said smiling at your generosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. In fact, here. Come eat with me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure, Master?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to eat something what you worked hard for. Besides, I bet you must be a little hungry too.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza nodded and joins you. You take your fork of food before you go feed it to Akiza. She finds this cute that you\u2019re feeding her, even though she\u2019s supposed to be the maid. That goes to show what a pure hearted man you really are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of eating, there was one piece left and you decided to do something very interesting. You take the piece and you and Akiza are it together before you start making out with each other. You moved the table aside before kissing her so much with every ounce of love inside of you before looking at her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza, you may dressed like a maid, but you\u2019re always a queen to me.\u201d You sweet talked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster.\u201d Akiza said as, once again, your words has her heart moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her one more long kiss before you looked at her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything else, Master?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just one last thing I have in mind.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to....</span></div></div>",

Heading down to the cafeteria, you tell them your plan and that they are going to need a massive amount of food for the day in question. You also wanted the fanciest tablecloths they could find. After a couple minutes of them staring at you like you had two heads, they snap out of it and comfirm your request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith food out of the way, now you need guests. Yours and Akiza's parents were no-brainers, as well as Ren and Misty, but you can invite them on your birthday and Akiza while she's getting her uniform from her parent's house. The staff and students would be easy to get. You decide that you might as well invite the signers and Leo as well, along with Mina and Trudge. It only made sense for them to see how far you've come in such short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you needed some press. Carly was an easy one, especially if Jack was gonna be there. You decide to also invite some of the hecklers from the other day, show them how \"dangerous\" you actually were. That should do. You go to Michelle and tell her to invite everyone except your parents and Akiza's. She agreed and got to work sending them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, for the big question.

That\u2019s when the wind start to pick up in a violent way as he starts turning. You see his eyes glowing purple and his hair going black to having two purple stripes on it as you brace yourself. With one strong roar, Ren was now at his transformation and you looked on in awe to see him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen? Are you okay?\u201d You asked your now turned brother and the only response was this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201dRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>That roar was intense! So this is his rage state.</i>\u201d You thought in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Ren summoning a monster, which is Beelze, and he goes in to attack you as you stepped out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! I didn\u2019t think this would be THIS tough.\u201d You said softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeelze strikes again as you summoned Kisara to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a little help, Kisara?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Kisara said as she activated a barrier using her ability to make sure you\u2019re safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Lady Kisara.\u201d You said with formality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Ren and Beelze looking mad as he goes for another strike. That\u2019s when you sprung out three Blue-Eyes to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep Beelze down, boys. I\u2019m going for Ren. Kisara, stay beside me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your dragons go after his, you charged towards him before you see him going to attack you himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you sprung Shadow Spell on him. You tugged on to the chains just to keep him in place<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen! You can calm down now. Don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when, to your shock, Ren broke free with ease. Kisara helped picked you up and you go in to help Ren change back.</span></div></div>",

Are you sure that's a good idea?\" Ren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure. You don't have to give me an answer right now, just please say something before the end of the night.\" You tell him. With that, your food arrived and you began to dig in.</span></div></div>",

Thank you for your help.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d She said before you went back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up and see that you\u2019re back inside your room before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed like a little girl and landed on your head hard after falling off the bed. You looked to see that it was Akiza that did that as she was laughing her butt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Akiza? Were you trying to give me a heart attack?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I just got back here a few minutes ago and I saw you resting like you were in the spirit world again. I thought it would be funny if I give you a good scare.\u201d Akiza explained still laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you for that.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you will. Anyway, were you seriously in the spirit world?\u201d Akiza wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I asked Kisara about these visions I\u2019ve been having, but I only managed to get little information so far.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. Mom and Dad wants me to give you this as a birthday gift.\u201d Akiza said handing you a gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was nice of them. Thanks.\u201d You said as you opened the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice birthday card that has a little bit of cash inside. They didn\u2019t had to do that. But it was sweet of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what now?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still nice out. How about we take nice walk together?\u201d Akiza suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Akiza walked together as you two talked with each other a little before you made it to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so I told him that he can go...WOAH!\u201d You said as you slipped on something that made go flying down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuten!\u201d Akiza yelled as she slipped too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing that the stairs wasn\u2019t far down because the fall only hurt a little. Still, someone is gonna get in trouble for this. You then see Akiza falling down too and landed on you. Akiza moaned as she rubs on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of idiot forgets to put up a wet floor sign? Some people. Huh, Yuten?\u201d Akiza said as she can\u2019t seemed to find you. \u201cYuten? Where\u2019d you go?\u201d Akiza wondered as she looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then felt you tapping on her shoulder before pointing down. She looks to see that she\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

These pulsars can make sure that the damage any psychic duelist will inflict will become less effective.

There\u2019s a lot I want to speak my mind to him as well.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat goes double for me too.\u201d Ren said stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks guys. Let\u2019s go.\u201d You said before getting changed to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all arrived at the prison and sees Trudge standing by waiting for you when you told them that you were coming. He then lead you all to the meeting room where he\u2019s waiting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait right here. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d You said before going inside with Trudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see next is Sayer sitting at a table while being handcuffed to it. You have a lot of pent up frustration that you need to let out as you sit down opposite of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFancy seeing you again, Yuten.\u201d Sayer said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say the same for you, Sayer.\u201d You said looking at him dead in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that just hurts my feelings.\u201d Sayer teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you know what those are, considering you want to destroy the lives of non-psychics in cold blood.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that they deserved it.\u201d Sayer said to piss you off more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you, Sayer.\u201d You cussed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! Someone has a foul mouth today.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith good reason. I trusted you in the beginning and you tried to use me, Akiza, and everyone in the movement as your toy soldiers. In fact, you tried to use my brother, Ren, as a fucking W.M.D!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen\u2019s your brother?! That\u2019s a surprise there.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t act so shocked, Sayer. But hey, now that I\u2019m in charge, things are looking up for the better, better than you could ever think of.\u201d You said to Sayer\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard. But seriously, do you really think your methods will actually bring everyone together? Be honest with yourself.\u201d Sayer wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least my methods are better than yours are, Mr. I\u2019m Going To Destroy Many Lives!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was doing what\u2019s best for us psychics.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy declaring fucking war on the world?! You could\u2019ve turned New Domino into an ocean of blood. Would you really sleep on that?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, like I asked, would your methods bring peace? Seriously, can you handle the hate should your ideals failed you? Hmm?\u201d Sayer wondered as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll just wait and see.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t even want to entertain him with this conversation any longer as you get up and was about to leave before you remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I go, there\u2019s someone else that wants to say hello to you.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be popular today.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wish.\u201d You said before signaling Trudge to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened, the one that entered was...</span></div></div>",

How nice to see you agai... *smack!\" He started before Akiza struck him across the face. Neither you nor Trudge even moved to try and restrain her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you talk to me so casually after all you did? You lied to me, used me. You abused my trust and tried to turn me into a weapon in your war. I thought that I had finally found someone I can consider a father and a place I could call home after what happened with my parents. Instead I find out that the man that brought me in only saw me as a scared little girl to use as he saw fit, and my home to be a place of torture and secrets.\" She rants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Akiza, what would you rather have had me done? Be like Yuten and convince myself that even half of what I said was possible? That our kind could ever be seen as normal within Domino? Only children and fools could think like that without laughing at themselves.\" He replies. \"Or what, maybe I could keep the world away from us and we would all live isolated from the rest of the world? Tell me, why should I live in hiding when I have the power and they don't? Not to mention that they would never have just left us alone anyway. The people of the city won't be satisfied until we are all wiped out, no matter how they may act at Yuten's little speeches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true. Yuten's gotten us so far this past year. Farther then you've gotten ever since I've known you. Thanks to him, I've reunited with my parents and Yuten with his. How dare you criticize him when he's been more of a leader than you've ever been?\" She asks with tears starting to flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there it is. That scared, naive little girl I met in that alleyway all those years ago. Your parents are still afraid of you, and they always will be. Because they fear that which is different from them. Just watch, the second your powers act up again, they'll run for the hills just like they did after they tossed you away.\" He spits out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Akiza considered believing him, but she remembered plenty that evidenced the opposite. \"Not a chance. My father weathered my powers at their worst after the old movement was destroyed just to get close to me. They offered me and Yuten a home while we rebuilt the movement. They wouldn't turn their backs on me now. Especially after I've learned to control my powers.\" She gloats with Sayer looking surprised. \"That's right. No hairband, no pulsars, I can control my power all on my own. Ren's done it too. And both of us have Yuten to thank for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer begins to slowly clap. \"Not bad Yuten. If that's true, then I'll at least conceed to you getting one victory. I was never able to get them to control their powers without outside tools. Not that it'll change anything, of course.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'll prove to you that peace is possible. And I'll show you. Trudge!\" You yell, getting his attention. \"When the tournament comes, I want the live feed prodcasted to his cell so he can see the progress that can be made with actual effort.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, okay.\" He responds. \"I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Akiza, let's go. I think we've both said what we need to.\" With a nod from her, you both begin to leave the interrogation room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

But you don\u2019t seemed to have control over your temper as well.

You know what, Sayer? You\u2019re just smoke and mirrors.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You just create illusions that are false promises from you and the reality is that you care about your own sick ambition. What do you have to say about that, bitch?\u201d Ren said with no regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing at all. By the way, I heard on the news saying you were with that Misty model.

Well, I was kinda hoping not to bring her into it.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe became part of a group that tried to destroy the world.

You were worried about if Sayer bringing up Misty as a Dark Signer might've made him pissed at the both of you for not telling him sooner. At the very least, you can take solace in knowing that his rage powers must really be supressed if they didn't trigger during that whole outburst. You made it back and Ren went right for his room, with you and Akiza right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren? You alright bro?\" You ask as you enter his room behind him, Akiza closing the door for privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\" Is all he says as he sits on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long what?\" You ask, already suspecting his next question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long into my relationship with Misty were you gonna wait to drop that bit about her, huh? Tomorrow night? After the tournament? Our wedding day? Or maybe you would just take it to your graves.\" He rants as he stares murder at you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren, it isn't like that. We didn't keep it from you to hurt you. We just never had an appropriate time to bring it up.\" Akiza says as she dares to get closer and put a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her touch, he seemed to mellow a tad. \"Well then I guess there's no time like now to air it out, huh? Tell me everything, and don't skimp on details. Misty, the Dark Signers, everything. Then I'll pass my judgment.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it all started when Misty's brother tried to join the movement years ago...\" You start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Toby kid we saved from that old Arcadia Movement blacksite, right?\" He interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him. He tried to join, only to fail Sayer's little 'entrance test' and disappeared.\" You continue, your blood boiling a bit at the reminder of what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before he disappeared though, he told Misty about the movement and how fascinated he was watching one of my duels.\" Akiza picks up. \"Then, after he vanished, Sayer used his influence in Security to make a cover-up about how he was a casualty in a duel where my powers went wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The combination of his fanboying over Akiza and the alleged circumstances of his death, made Misty point the blame of her brother going missing squarely at Akiza.\" You start again. \"Not knowing that Sayer was the one truly responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, one day, Misty got into a horrible car accident. She almost died, but as she was being rolled into the hospital on death's door, the shadows approached her.\" Akiza adds, remembering seeing these events unfold during her duel with Misty in Satellite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shadows pick their Dark Signers by finding people with some sort of beef against one of the current Signers, so with Misty's rage towards Akiza, she was chosen.\" You state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Signer'? You're gonna have to fill me in on that real quick.\" Ren says with a hint of confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, they are five people chosen to help summon the Crimson Dragon, an ancient force of good used to battle the Army of Darkness every five thousand years. They are defined by having a mark on their arm and one of the five legendary dragons.\" You sum up with Akiza rolling down her glove to show her mark and pulling out her Black Rose Dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty had no stake in wanting to destroy the world. All she wanted was a second chance at life to learn the truth about what happened to her brother. Unfortunately, she couldn't cherry-pick. She bacame one of them and tried to destroy the world come judgment day.\" You begin to wrap up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We dueled her in Satellite. During which, she found out the truth from Sayer's own lips.\" Akiza continues. \"That was when she came to her senses. Unfortunately, she was too far into the hands of darkness. We defeated her with that dragon I used against you the other day. Then, with the defeat of the Dark Signers, all those under their influence returned to normal, Misty included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the whole truth Ren. It's all out in the open now.

It\u2019s Yuten.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yuten! How are you?</i>\u201d Misty asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so good. Listen, I know we have this dinner tomorrow and all, but can you stop by here sometime in the morning?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yeah. I definitely can. Why? What\u2019s going on? Is everything alright?</i>\u201d Misty wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s Ren. He knows.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>He knows what?</i>\u201d Misty asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink.\u201d You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oh no! How?</i>\u201d Misty asked realizing what you mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking Sayer. He was arrested and we visited him in prison. He spilled the beans and now Ren\u2019s completely pissed off.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>No! No! Is Ren with you now? Can I talk to him?</i>\u201d Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s really not in the mood. But, he\u2019ll likely cool down tomorrow. Can you stop by and talk to him face to face?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Of course. I\u2019ll be there.</i>\u201d Misty answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. See you tomorrow.\u201d You said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then go over to the bed where Akiza is laying next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll help?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf anyone can get through to him now, it\u2019s her. Let\u2019s put our fate in her.\u201d You said before going to sleep with Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and you got the phone call from Michelle that Misty will be here shortly. You all have breakfast and Misty had just arrived downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Misty asked as you and Akiza walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe should be in his room. Come on. We\u2019ll take you there.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the girls walked over to Ren\u2019s room and you knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen? You okay buddy? I just came by to see how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you opened to door and you see Ren</span></div></div>",

You're glad he didn't leave, but now came the hard part. \"Ren, there's someone here to see you.\" You say softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ren.\" Misty says as she walks to the front of the group. At the sound of her voice, Ren immediately sat up, surprised at her arrival, but his mood didn't improve much. \"Yuten told me what happened, I hope we can still talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't believe none of you could trust me to tell me something that big. I trusted all of you.\" Ren says addressing you all. \"Especially you Misty. I love you. Why couldn't you at least tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen blushed at having said those words and Misty joined him at his confession. \"I love you too Ren. That's why I wanted to wait until I was confident you would understand before I told you. I didn't want you to assume the worst if you heard about my past before getting to know me. I'm sorry.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen's expression lightened to a smile once more. \"No, I'm sorry. Here I am blowing up at you for not telling me your dark secret when I kept one of my own.\" He starts in a somber tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Misty asks as the two begin to hold each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long before we met and even before I left the old movement, I've had a bit of an... explosive temper. With my powers, if I got too mad, then I risk entering this state where my powers go wild and blindly destroyed everything.\" He admits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible.\" Misty gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, since I met Yuten, he's helped train me to better control my powers, even sharing his own to temper mine. So I used to have a dark, destructive secret that's now gone, just like you. But here I am judging you for doing the same.\" He says with a small chuckle. \"Heh, guess I'm just a big 'ol hypocrite, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty put a hand on his cheek. \"Nonsense. It just means we have even more in common.\" She says while Ren puts a hand on her own cheek. \"Ren...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty...\" He says back. The two lean in and their lips meet. It looked like something right out of one of Akiza's romance movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" Akiza coos as you both watch on. At the reminder of the fact that they have spectators, they both blush beat red and break away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo... I guess that means we're an official couple?\" Ren asks while rubbing his arm nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" Misty responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess dinner tonight will be an official double date?\" You ask as you approach the two. \"That is, if we're cool now?\" You ask with an outstretched hand to your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he take it?</span></div></div>",

Akiza seemed deep in thought about something but wouldn't say what. Finally, it got to be around dinner time. You got in your best suit and Akiza in a tight red strapless dress, making you fight to keep your eyes on where you were heading instead of on her, and you both went down to Ren's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the door before entering. \"You kids decent in here?\" You joke, getting you another shot in the ribs from Akiza. Ren and Misty rounded the corner, with Ren in a suit similar to your own and Misty in a black dress you recognize from one of her magazine photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all ready to go.\" Misty says. \"My driver is waiting for us out front. Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you all downstairs, where sure enough, her limo driver from you birthday dinner was sitting right there. He opens the door and lets all of you into the back before getting in and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant, you all walked in after Misty told her driver to go relax for an hour or two. Misty's celebrity status earned you a table with no wait time, despite the place being packed. You and Ren took your seats at a booth. However, before the girls could join you, Misty grabs Akiza's shoulders and keeps her standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I borrow her for a minute Yuten?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just make sure you bring her back as you found her.\" You joke. Akiza looked confused at Misty's request, but didn't question it as the model pulled her away to the bathroom. \"So what do you think she's asking Akiza in there?\" You ask Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. After you guys left, we didn't do too much besides talk and... kiss a little.\" He says with a blush. \"I can't think of any problem that came up that Misty would need Akiza's help with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two of them took their time in the bathroom, you took the opportunity to go more in-depth in your explanation of things like the signers and the Crimson Dragon, as well as what happened in Satellite that fateful day, seeing as how those parts mostly got skimmed over last night. Finally, your ladies returned from their bathroom trip with grins on their faces, really making you wonder just what they discussed in there. As the waiter arrived to get your food and drink orders, you began to wonder something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy wasn't there a bigger deal being made of this? It's not like you craved media attention, but you figured that between three known members of a WRGP team and a world-class model, you expected your table to be swarmed the second you were seated. Your only guess is that this place wouldn't have it's reputation if it didn't have top notch security to keep the paparazzi out and the people inside weren't kept to a behavior standard. That's the only possible conclusion you could come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your food arrived. While the four of you ate, you noticed that Akiza and Misty kept giving each other looks, all ending in Misty blushing. You weren't sure if Ren noticed, but you could tell that it had something to do with their little chat earlier. Soon, all the food was gone with the check on the way, as you all opted to skip on dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That food was great.\" You say with a stretch as you leave the restaurant and Misty calls her driver. \"Of course it would cost me an arm and a leg if I ever wanted to eat here again.\" You say, causing your party to all laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you wait for the driver to return, you see Akiza walk up to Misty and nudge her arm before motioning to Ren. You weren't sure if she thought she was subtle or not, but you played along like you didn't notice. \"Sooo, I was thinking, why should this little date of ours end at the check? How about we all head back to Ren's room at your headquarters and hang out there?\" Misty suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a great idea. I can even run up to our room and grab some movies for us to watch. That is, if you boys are interested?\" Akiza says with feigned surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm cool with it. What about you little bro?\" Ren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?</span></div></div>",

Akiza pretty much shot your suggestion of another three-way out of the water yesterday, so I have no idea what they're up to.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think they're filming some kind of lesbian porno as a gift to us?\" He wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be. I certainly wouldn't mind adding that to her movie collection.\" You joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return with the items Akiza requested for you. You knock on the door to let them know you were back. \"Come iiin.\" You hear Akiza sing-song. You both walk in through the living room and into the bedroom where you left the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Ren nearly passed out would be an understatement. You had to drop what you were holding to keep him up as he looked onto the bed and saw both your girlfriends sitting there stripped down to their underwear. \"Wh-wh-wh-what is this?\" He stammers out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty asked me for advice on a gift for Ren to make up for not telling him about her time as a Dark Signer. So I suggested this little idea after I remembered his request yesterday.\" Akiza replied with Misty growing more and more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said there was no way Ren was getting a three-way with you. What happened to that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still stand by that stance. But I never said any objections to a four-way. I figured as long as Ren stays in Misty and you stay in me, then we shouldn't have any issues and you get to stare at us both naked.\" Akiza justifies. \"Besides, you got to get into bed with Misty as part of a gift from me. I can at least return the favor to her to a degree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst all this, you look back to Ren. He looks completely dazed, yet at the same time, he looked ready to rocket out of that suit like an old cartoon to get on that bed. The question was, were you so eager for this?</span></div></div>",

I can't go staring at other girls. At least, not without her approval.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no point in arguing further, you concede and let him join Akiza in the kitchen. But not before a final look warning him if he tried any funny business with her. With him gone, you and Misty continue getting dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping me with this Yuten.\" She says. \"Akiza certainly was right when she said this was a good gift for him, and I don't think she would've stayed on board if you said no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I just hope you and Ren don't mind that your first time together was an orgy instead of one on one.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all. I don't mind, and I'm sure Ren will never complain about tonight.\" She replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast!\" You hear Ren and Akiza call. You quickly head in to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a rather uneventful meal, Ren and Misty said their goodbyes before heading off to work, while you got Akiza back in her dress before walking back to your room. But, Akiza seems a bit... off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" You ask her, getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?! Nothing. It's fine. Just a weird dream, is all.\" She answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given our history with weird dreams, maybe you should talk about it. It could be more important than we know.\" You remind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay. Well, I started out watching Yusei's Stardust Dragon fight some sort of monster I've never seen before. It looked kinda like a man made of metal with a blade coming out of his wrist, all shiny white.\" She starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With an infinity symbol for a chest?\" You interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the Meklord Emperor Yusei faced when he dueled Ghost. The very same one I saw in my dream.\" You tell her. \"Keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the monster... absorbed Yusei's dragon. Black Rose Dragon tried to help it, only to get captured as well. Then, a strange tablet appeared.\" She continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a giant blank card made of stone?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. That's it exactly.\" She answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like my own dream. Looks like whatever's going on, you'll be helping me stop it.\" You tell her with confidence, making her giggle. As you reach your room...</span></div></div>",

As you rub, you take a bit of solace in knowing that she hasn't had you do anything too humiliating apart from making you her mule carrying her back here. You can hear her moan while she eats, but whether it was from your actions or her love of the food you were unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered all the right spots to hit on her foot from the last time you gave her one of these.

As you rode, you got more and more worried about what that one goon said. How did Ren know these creeps? Did he use to run with them while he was alone? Did he make them his enemies with some sort of vigilante shtick? What was the story? On look back at Misty told you that she was going through the same thoughts, and just after you all thought they were open about their pasts now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack, what's the plan when we get there?\" You call up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you three, nor do I care. What I do know is that when we get there, I'm gonna go confront this Syd and broadcast our location to Trudge and the others. Once security swarms the place, it won't matter what else happens.\" He says coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet nobody say Jack isn't determined when he sets his mind to something. Too bad that comes at the cost of the most narrow tunnel vision imaginable. \"Alright then. If you think you can handle them yourself, we're going to try and find Ren.\" You tell him. He says nothing, only giving a thumbs-up in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach the destination of the transmitter, a huge cargo ship. With no guards, you were all free to ride on board, with Jack going left, and you three going right. You wish him the best, given that unless he wins, you were all gonna be stuck in enemy territory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing riding around on two duel runners as the opposite of stealthy, you decide to hide them away to grab later once you found him. Walking through the ship, you found a window overlooking a large room. You found a hole in one of the panes and crowd around it, hoping to listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a good call Gussy. Heh, besides, I can't imagine this crummy city's got that many duel runners left for us to take.\" You hear a bald man in the middle of the room say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not much of a betting boy, but I'm gonna take a shot and say that's the Syd we're looking for.\" You whisper to the girls, with both of them nodding in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, we even got a bonus.

A couple of years around the time you had my boys arrested thanks to you.\u201d Syd said getting close to Ren\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had that coming a long time ago, Syd.\u201d Ren said showing no fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? After I brought you into our group so you can make money to survive and that was how repaid us? You know that I really hate rats. You know what I do to them?\u201d Syd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Ren spits in his face to show him that he doesn\u2019t care in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a good answer for you?\u201d Ren asked bravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still got that spunk, freak. Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s still like it was back then. Show him, boys.\u201d Syd ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t!\u201d You cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked to see you and the girls behind. Ren was surprised and happy to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro, sorry we\u2019re late.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuten.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?! How did you find this place?\u201d The man named Gus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lead us straight here.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched himself until he found the transmitter in his collar, much to his shock when he realized how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you be so stupid, Gus?!\u201d Syd asked with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, boss.\u201d Gus apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave this loser to us. Let\u2019s get him, boys.\u201d One of the boys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyd was going to shoot you until his weapon was smashed by a runner you know very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack Atlas?!\u201d Syd gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and only.\u201d Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to take the long road.\u201d Jack said before turning to Syd. \u201cThe game is up, Syd. I\u2019ve contacted security and given them this location. They\u2019ll be here any minute now with bells on.\u201d Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s it then. I give up. Consider this my red hand waving a white flag.\u201d Syd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re at it, you\u2019re going to let Ren go as well.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll let him go. However, proposition. How\u2019s about one of you have a duel with me before our guests arrived?\u201d Syd suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re challenging one of us to a duel?\u201d Jack wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. But not an ordinary duel. When you\u2019re in Syd\u2019s house, you gotta play by Syd\u2019s rules. And don\u2019t think about leaving just yet. You don\u2019t want to miss the show.\u201d Syd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed to let Jack duel him as you sit at the sidelines for now. Syd explained that the more life points you lose, the closer you are to those trash compactors. Lose the duel and you\u2019re smashed garbage. It\u2019s low and sick, even for Syd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duel went on and Syd was gaining quite the upper hand as Jack was getting closer to the compactor. He also told you that the hideout was actually a boat. So how will security will come and get you all in the middle of the sea? This is troubling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack managed to find a way to get himself back on top when he summoned Chaos King Archfiend and destroyed Syd\u2019s Combat Wheel and the tokens to win the game. Jack then tossed him to the ground before could get squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe won. Now let us all go.\u201d You said as Syd got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs if. Get them!\u201d Syd said as his gang went after you all. Ren was still tied up before Syd was standing over him. \u201cAs for you, we still have a score to settle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see Misty running towards them to save Ren herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet him go right now!\u201d Misty screamed as she grabbed Syd by his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stay out of it, broad.\u201d Syd said before he did the unthinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backhanded Misty across her face and you and the others were shocked to see that happening as she hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBroads like her need to learn their place.\u201d Syd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSyd, you disgusting monster!\u201d Jack said with anger for what Syd just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were angry as well before you see Ren looking at Misty in shock. Syd laid a mark on her cheek when he did that and he looks completely furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where were we?\u201d Syd wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy.....you!\u201d Ren growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to see Ren breaking the bounds off of him as he was standing up while shaking with anger. Syd hurt Misty! He hurt his Misty!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSyd...you bastard!\u201d Ren said as he was glowing purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oh no!</i>\u201d You gasped in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>HOW DARE YOU!!!!!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the energy had exploded as Syd was blown back. Everyone else was in awe as Yusei, Crow, Carly, and Security came in after finding you all. They were surprised to see the exploding energy that was unleashed by Ren\u2019s rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Yusei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! That\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d Crow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what!\u201d Akiza said pointing to where Misty was laying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen continued to scream with rage before he summoned Beelze forward. Most of Syd\u2019s crew got scared as they all want to bail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a total monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you all get back here!\u201d Syd said before Ren attacked him with his dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit him and Syd was out cold. That took care of him, but he\u2019s not powering down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen, you can stop now! It\u2019s done!\u201d You cried out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen wasn\u2019t listening as he goes to attack you next. You quickly got Negate Attack out save yourself as your enraged brother continues the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?! We\u2019re on his side!\u201d Jack wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t control himself in this state. We need to calm him down now!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not making it easy!\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then summoned your three Blue-Eyes to attack Beelze like last time, only they didn\u2019t have much luck as the demonic dragon blew your dragons away with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis energy must be stronger than it was last time. Great.\u201d You said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me try.\u201d Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. You\u2019re not a psychic!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho needs psychic abilities when you have the Crimson Dragon on your side? Go, Red Dragon Archfiend!\u201d Jack said as he summoned his ace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dragon went after Ren\u2019s and clawed on it, but Beelze was left unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even a scratch!\u201d Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeelze then blasted Red Dragon Archfiend away along with Jack as Ren seems to be getting angrier and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not going well. We\u2019re just going to tick him off with each attack.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something or else we\u2019re going to be blasted to Kingdom Come.\u201d You said as you bring out your spiritual energy to help fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Akiza was in awe to see Ren with so much power. It\u2019s just unheard of in a single psychic duelist as she hears Misty groaning while Carly comes to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkiza? Carly?\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good. You\u2019re alright.\u201d Carly said as she and Akiza helped Misty up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDizzy. What happened?\u201d Misty wondered before turning to see you and the other boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shocked her is that she\u2019s seeing Ren going on a complete rampage, even attacking you and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that....Ren?\u201d Misty wondered in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza explained the whole thing and Misty feels her heart breaking seeing the love of her life destroying everything in a blind fit of monstrous rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the guys are not doing so well as Ren was pushing you back like it\u2019s nothing. There must be a way to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when....</span></div></div>",

There was a whole different aura in it. She saw the dark energy that was flowing now, but she saw something at it's core. A light, and a strong one at that.

She remembered when this similar situation happened back in Satellite when you and Akiza dueled her. Perhaps with your power in there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly pulled Ren face-first into a passionate kiss. As she did, they both reacted to it.

You and Akiza didn't even bother with any flirty talk or even breakfast as you both threw on your clothes and rushed down to Ren's room. Very gently, you open the door to see if they were awake.

I feel a lot more calm from last night.\" Ren replies before his expression turned dour . \"I guess I have some explaining to do about my time with Syd, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. I think we got the general jist of it from what we heard last night. You needed to survive on the streets, and Syd gave you the chance to. You probably did bad things and hurt good people, but in time your conscience overpowered you and had you turn in some of his gang. That about sum it up?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. But how can you be so cool with it? Like you said, I hurt a lot of innocent people. You can really just forgive that?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren, did you already forget that they forgave me after I was a Dark Signer, a group that threatened to destroy the world and everyone on it?\" Misty reminds him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and my past isn't too different with how I was used by Sayer and hurt people with my powers.\" Akiza adds in. \"But Yuten, Yusei and the others forgave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen grows a smile back on his face. \"I guess you're both right. Thanks.\" He says before getting out of bed and beginning to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going bro?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to watch the twins again. At least, I would, if they weren't going straight from school to this new rich kid's house today. So I'm stuck watching their house until they get back.\" He replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Ren? You're complaining about having to watch over a penthouse suite, complete with an Olympic-size pool, a jacuzzi, and a t.v. bigger than your room, all without any responsibility?\" You question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" He admits. \"I suppose I could watch Toby again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Toby is going off to visit mom and dad for the week, so no worries about him.\" Misty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I'm free.\" He jokes before heading for the door. \"Seeya, I'm off to go housesit.\" With that, he shuts the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should go too. My manager is probably popping vessels in her forehead trying to get a hold of me after I ran out of my shoot last night to look for Ren.\" Misty says as she stands up. \"Thank you both again for helping find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Jack, he did most of the detective work, we just followed him.\" You remind her. \"And after that, you had the tough job of snapping him out of his anger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to thank Jack later. As for saving him, you were the one that protected me as I ran for him.\" She says in a matter-of-fact voice.

Don't all cards have a duel spirit, and by extension all spirits live here?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's normally the case. Even the Earthbound Immortals were linked to this world while they were unsealed. So it's confusing me why there's nothing about these things.\" She answers. \"Not even a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can help with that?\" You hear a male voice say. You both turn to see an old man with silver hair and a goatee in the doorway to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-father?! What are you doing in here?\" Kisara asks in a bit of a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my house, isn't it? I should be free to come and go from my own library as I please, shouldn't I?\" He replies with a bit of a smirk. \"Besides, after hearing the place be practically ransacked, I then hear my baby girl talking to someone, so my curiosity was peaked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kisara, I thought you said this was your house?\" You ask as you begin to question your safety here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said this was my <i>home</i>, yes. I did flee here during the Army of Shadows' attack, and returned after their defeat. But legally this is my parents' house.\" She admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the old man walks up to you and looks you in the eye. \"So I guess you are the ones the dragons chose as their new master? You must be very powerful indeed. I am Otes, head of the Blue-Eyed clan and overseer of the dragons while they waited for their new guardian.\" He says before reaching out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuten.\" Is all you can say as you meet his grip. You internally sigh in relief as it seems he's not going to brutalize you for entering his home without permission to talk with his daughter. \"Wait, if you are the master, and the one in charge of the dragons, why was Kisara the one that had to contact me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs at your question. \"I'm afraid that by then, it was already too late for me. Myself, as well as my wife and sons were captured by the minus curse placed on this land by Zeman the Ape King. Only Kisara got away, so it fell to her to get into contact with you.\" He explains. \"Come, let me introduce you to my family. Then we can discuss your visions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins to walk out of the room, motioning for you both to follow. He leads you into the back yard, where you see another silver-haired man, this one considerably younger than Otes with muscles almost rivaling Greiger and in plated armor, practicing with a sword bigger than you. \"Meet my oldest son, Tema.\" Otes says while gesturing for him to come over. \"Tema, meet Yuten, the new champion of the dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, this man who looks a least a decade your senior, got on his knee and bowed to you. \"It is an honor to meet the new champion. Know that should you ever need my blade, It is yours to use.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be nervous. He's always been a formal one.\" Otes explains. \"Tema, where are your mother and brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practicing their magic in the mausoleum.\" He says, pointing to a structure behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my son. Now come with us, I wish you to be present for this as well.\" Otes tells him. Tema arose and followed his father with you and Kisara behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the building to see that it's almost one for one like your Mausoleum of White card. sitting near the end of it, before the statue of a Blue-Eyes, you see two people kneeling in front of each other. The first was yet another silver-haired male, this one even younger than Tema and even looked close to your age. The other was a rather... endowed blue-haired woman in a flowing silk dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuten, meet my youngest son Hamod, and my wife Nama.\" Otes says, snapping them out of their assumed meditation as they rose to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, who is this my husband?\" Nama asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Yuten, the new champion of the dragons and the one that helped save us from the Army of Shadows.\" He answers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you both.\" You say with a bow, hoping not to get on anyone's bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is ours. We must thank your part in saving both our worlds.\" Nama says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\" Hamod says with a short bow. \"I trust that my little sister has been giving you strong guidance while we were otherwise occupied? Then again, we most likely wouldn't be talking if she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kisara blushed and looked like she was about to go off on him, you stopped her with a hand. \"Kisara's been doing a great job so far. But right now there's some problem that no book in your library can answer. Your father thought he could help, but that in no way undercuts what she's done so far.\" You defend, making her smile at your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Otes cuts in. \"Yuten here has been having visions that I might be able to help make sense of. Nama, get the stone for me, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bow from his wife, Otes leads you and his children up in front of the statue where they were just meditating. Nama quickly returns with a stone that looks similar to your own White Stone of Legend, but not quite. She sets it between you and Otes before she and her children kneeled down behind you, while Otes does the same in front of you, turning to face you and the stone. Taking the hint, you kneel down with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then Yuten, tell us about this vision of yours, and perhaps our combined power will give you clarity.\" He says. You explain your dream to him down to the smallest detail. You even include what you learned from Yusei's duel with Ghost, even the name of Meklord Emperor Wisel. After you finish your story, Otes begins to stare into the stone, before saying...</span></div></div>",

You feel what they feel as if you were one of them.\" Otes explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so it's not just the power of the dragons, but you five as well?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven.\" Hamod corrected. \"You forget about the White Stone of Legend, as well as the one we hold here, the White Stone of the Ancients.\" He says, pointing at the stone in the center of you all. \"While the Stone of Legend was born of the dragons uniting their powers, the Stone of Ancients has existed as long as our clan has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" You reply. \"I must also know, what about my brother, Ren? He also has strange powers. Beyond his psychic abilities. What happened to him?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the champion of dual souls.\" Otes replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What does that mean?\" You question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you, Ren was also chosen by a dragon. His soul was to be bound with that of the Red-Eyes Black Dragon, much like yours is with your Blue-Eyes. However, something happened.\" He begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean father?\" Tema asks. \"I thought that once a monster's soul is bound to a human's, the link is permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is true. Ren's soul was indeed linked to Red-Eyes. However, another force came to link itself to him. A much darker, more destructive force. One that is chaos incarnate, and seeks only power. Another dragon bound itself to his soul.\" Otes responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beelze.\" You say under your breath. It was making sense now, every time he went rage, that dragon was always front and center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. It corrupted him, and split his soul between itself and Red-Eyes. In the end, the Diabolic Dragon finds itself overwhelming it's foe more often than not. While your power helped Red-Eyes supress it temporarily, it did not take long to return, and stronger than ever. I'm sure you have seen this struggle between them?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" You say as you remember Ren's eyes going from purple to red while on the ship before he passed out. \"Then we need to get Beelze away from him before it happens again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's not possible. That dragon is now as much a part of him as he is. To try and separate the two would be like removing his soul.\" He says with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou share his sentiment. \"So he's doomed to forever be at Beelze's mercy?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. Right now, that rage comes from the conflict between the two halves of his soul.\" Otes explains. \"Should he find a way to bring harmony between the two dragons, so too should the chaos in his powers come to an end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should he do that father?\" Kisara asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Ren can find that answer. But I do know this. As I peered into the stone, I foresaw parts of the inevitable battle with these Meklords. Ren must find a way to bring balance between the two to aid in your destiny.\" He answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that sounded like the best answer you were gonna get. \"Thank you, all of you. I hope to see you all again someday. Hopefully under more cheerful circumstances.\" You tell them as you prepare to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

First, here.\u201d Otes said as he gives you some cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and see that they\u2019re the cards that have the entire family on it, including the stone of ancients. You see them each of them with the Eyes of Blue on them with different titles. Otes as the Master, Hamod as the Sage, Tema was the Protector, and Nama as the Priestess.

Thanks, Tema.\u201d You said with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are most welcome.\u201d Tema said as he back up to allow Hamod to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are scrolls with with ancient history of our world that should help you if you need them.\u201d Hamod said as he gives you two scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.

All they found out was that these Meklord Emperors seem to be born of negative energy like the zero reverse incident, but not from that exact event.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?\" She questions. \"Wait, they?

It's about Ren.\" You start, sombering the mood a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently the reason behind Ren's rage is that Beelze of his. It's fighting with his Red-Eyes for dominance of his soul, and winning. And the only way to stop it is for him to somehow find a way to get them to stop fighting and get along.\" You explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds tough.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably will be. The worst part is that we can't even help him. Ren has to figure out how to calm them himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... well, I guess we'll just have to figure that out in time. Come on, let's head back to our room. You can tell me more about Kisara's family as we walk.\" She says while pulling you out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What time is it, anyway?\" You ask as you leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About lunch time. Why, you hungry?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.

So, I\u2019ll find the answer eventually and hopefully they\u2019ll stop going at each other\u2019s throats before the tournament.\u201d Ren said with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to hear you say that.\u201d You said smiling while patting on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it. Oh yeah. There\u2019s another thing I want to ask you.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of this?\u201d Ren asked as he pulls out a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised because it\u2019s the exact same blank card you and Akiza have in your possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found it on the couch while I was watching over the kid\u2019s place. I thought I would ask you about this before this whole incident happened.\u201d Ren explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold that thought real quick. Akiza! Come over here!\u201d You called out to your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza came and you all have the three blank cards out in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we each have one.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it all mean?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I do know is that we\u2019re meant to have these cards. We just don\u2019t know what will happen or what to do with them.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do then?\u201d Akiza wondered.</span></div></div>",

Mastering Accel Synchro Summoning could gives us a fighting chance if we face these Meklord guys again.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what these cards are for. Guys, I think we need to think outside the box, or the synchro box in this case.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so bro?\u201d Ren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, before you go, there\u2019s something else you want to know.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Yusei?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember the robot with that Meklord Emperor? I have a feeling who was using it.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do? Who?\u201d Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIliaster.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIliaster? What\u2019s that?\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAin\u2019t it that secret organization that Rex Goodwin was in charge of?\u201d Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe very same.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was no more when Goodwin vanished from the face of the earth.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently not. During my battle with Roman, he mentioned meeting someone from Iliaster at the Nasca Lines. That meeting what made him betrayed my father.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo wait, you mean to tell us that this group used Roman and Goodwin for their own benefits?\u201d You figured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right for they\u2019re the reason that the Zero Reverse incident happened.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shocked you all. So it was this organization\u2019s fault that the Dark Signer battle happened. If this group was using the Goodwin brothers as their pawns, then they must be stronger than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for telling us, Yusei. We really appreciate it.\u201d You said patting on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Yusei said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we better get home. Come on, guys.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two go on ahead. I\u2019ll take the kids back home. I\u2019ll even buy food and we\u2019ll get it right this time.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Best babysitter ever!\u201d Leo said with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two earned it after what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you three were walking to your runners, you see Ren in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay bro?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. After hearing Yusei\u2019s story, I\u2019m starting to believe that this group could be responsible for Misty becoming a Dark Signer as well if they made Roman and Goodwin unleash this negative energy.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not mad about it, are you?\u201d Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am. But only a little. It\u2019s Misty I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk to her about it when you get the chance.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.

Your speed output should be at least double what it once was.\" He says with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, but I don't just want more speed. I want control. How's our handling look?\" You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if my projections are correct, you should be able to make 88 degree turns without any drift or speed decrease.\" He answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal with handling, bro? Shouldn't we be focusing on being the fastest on the track?\" Ren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone can go super fast, Ren. But this is equal parts speed and driving, so if we can go just as fast on a turn as we do on a straight, then that consistency will get us the win. Besides, Yusei and his crew are trying to be the fastest for that accel synchro stuff, so we need to find our own style.\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking.\" Akiza adds. \"Plus, it would help if we had an easier time avoiding attacks like the Meklord Emperors'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair points.\" Ren conceeds. \"Okay then, let's ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ride out of the garage and find an unused track to practice on. \"Okay, so who's first?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the first drive.\" Akiza volunteers as she revs her engine. \"Wish me luck.\" She says as she tears off at speeds you never saw with your old runners.

Let\u2019s go.\u201d You said as you and Akiza went into the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your tickets and got your popcorn and drinks before taking your seats. The movie began and you see a young man going around a village looking like an outcast for he has the spirit of a powerful dragon being deep within his soul. You can relate to him because of your psychic powers. In the next few scenes, the man found himself in love with a princess, except he\u2019s bound to be married to a prince who is shallow and arrogant. You can tell that the princess doesn\u2019t want it by the look in her eyes as the prince was being a jerk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man and the princess finally met. It got off on the wrong foot at first, but they start to like each other and they would see each other whenever they can. However, a dark wizard who is obsessed with revenge wants the dragon spirit the resides within the man and has hired the prince to do it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king would soon find about the princess\u2019s relationship with the man and the prince manipulate him to have the man thrown out, only to stop and see if he\u2019s even worthy period. The trials was a success and the prince was not happy. He then captured the princess and was taken to the wizard before the man went after them. The man defeated the prince and it was only him and the dark wizard. He was in trouble and he can see the princess scared for your life before he yelled into the air and gets the dragon spirit\u2019s power to come out. He was able to defeat the wizard and the princess was saved before the man\u2019s sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Akiza cry and you a little tearing up.

Think wisely about that call, Yuten.\" She sing-songs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that pretty much made your choice for you. If you didn't race, then you would be both taking away her happiness and your shot of ever seeing what she bought.

I'm sorry okay. I wasn't thinking. Can we come in bro?\" Ren asks while trying to wrench his ear from Misty's grip. You can't help but chuckle a bit at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, come on in, both of you.\" You say as you lead them inside. They both took seats at the kitchen table while you put on a pot of coffee. \"So what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to see how you both were doing. I felt kinda bad just up and leaving everyone, but I was hired to keep those kids safe, you know?\" Ren says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand Ren. Duty called and all that.\" You say before turning to Misty. \"So, official sponsor, huh? How'd that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I figured that since I have a history of selling things with my image alone, then maybe associating myself with your team will help boost public reception of you guys.\" She answers. \"As for joining you in the pit, I figured it can help show my support in a more physical way, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. More like you just want to get close to Ren while we duel.\" Akiza jokes, making Misty blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are we gonna have to wear your face on our uniforms or something?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. However, I do have tailor teams available that can help create patches for your team logo and the armband baton you'll be passing off during your matches.\" She answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that reminds me, mister team leader. When does this thing start off, anyway?\" Ren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first off, the preliminary blocks are to be announced three days from now, with the first matches being three days after that.\" You tell him. \"Second, I don't remember ever calling myself the leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. You're already leading this movement, so you have experience. You brought us together, so you have respect. And, you know all three of our decks well enough to organize us. I'd say you're over qualified to be team leader.\" He retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a point.\" Akiza says, backing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we'll figure that out later. For now, Ren, didn't you say you wanted to train on getting that problem of yours fixed?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. I'll see you all later then. I'm off to go figure some things out.\" Ren says before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Last night gave me some things I need to consider, so I need some time alone to think.\" You tell the girls as you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that leaves you and me for a girls day out.\" Misty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great. There's actually something I would like to talk with you about, if you don't mind.\" Akiza says as you head for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later.\" You say before shutting the door behind you.

I'm sure Kisara already told you how the White Stone of Legend came to be, yes?\" He answers with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. The three dragons poured their power into creating an egg that grew with them.\" You repeat what you were told. \"Then they combined with the egg to form Azure-Eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. However, they are not the only evolutions of the dragons. Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon came from the beasts merging together. Alternative White Dragon came from a horrible experiment to recreate the Dragons' power, but upon his freedom, the dragons used their own power to cleanse him into one of their own. Dragon Spirit of White was the result of the banished impurities still wishing to join the others, and Spirit Dragon came when I first joined with the beast.\" He explains. \"My only guess is that this man you speak of knows of this and foresees the next evolution of the dragons, whatever it may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how to awaken this evolution?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid not. In the past, only the dragons themselves knew when one was coming about. However, they aren't exactly the most verbal of monsters.\" He half-jokes. \"I fear that the only way for you to unlock the next evolution is to bond your soul with them so deeply that you can understand them. See what their will is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\" You question as you get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... do not know.\" He answers, shamefully. \"Our past two champions found a way, but we were unable to learn their secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tell me who they were? Maybe I could figure out how they did it.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. The first champion came with the very birth of the beasts themselves. An Egyptian priest who first unleashed the beast's power at it's fullest. The other, his ancestor and reincarnation. A man I feel you are quite familiar with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you understand his meaning. Even as a child you knew about the great Seto Kaiba, everyone did. \"Does... does that mean that I'm...\" You start to ask, unable to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head. \"No. Your heart and soul are not theirs. Their soul was however, reincarnated into one of your cards. No points for guessing which one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out your deck and search through. Finally you pull out your Kaibaman card and show it to him. \"You mean...?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. That card was birthed from his own soul after he passed.\" He answers as you slide the card back into your deck. \"You are a blank slate to the dragons, yet they still sensed greatness in you. I do not know how the past two evolved the dragons, but you must find your own way. I'm sorry, but that's all I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Even that little bit has helped me learn a lot.

You feel as if this blank card is a key factor into you getting into the next stage. If that\u2019s the case, then maybe if you do get that power, this card would reveal itself.

I might not have known her for long, but I can already see it in both your eyes. What are you waiting for?

Normally you wouldn't see much wrong with a guy just trying to get a cab, but there's two very wrong things with this picture. First, if memory served, Lazar was head of the Public Security Bureau, so why was he taking an ordinary cab as opposed to a more secure form of transport? Second, you remember he was Goodwin's right-hand man while he was in power. That alone is enough to throw up red flags about this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably just your gut, but you had a feeling that he was up to something. If for nothing else than to stop the nagging alarms in your head, you decide to follow him. You followed the cab and you were doing your best not to get too close to him. No need for him to look out a window and get suspicious, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally see him coming to a stop and get out of the car. You take the opportunity to turn back onto the road where he stopped to see an abandoned factory. Something was very wrong about this place, but you didn't know what. All you did know was that something was interfering with your powers, preventing you from sensing Lazar any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out front, only to see Yusei and some other guy pull up in their own runners. \"Yusei?

We\u2019re not planning on dying today.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen, with tears still in his eyes, now knows you want him to believe in you.

We\u2019re goners then, right?\u201d Lazar wondered feeling doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong. I know what I\u2019m doing and I mean it.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is can you do it fast enough?</span></div></div>",

Like always, the taste of the rose nectar is as delicious as ever. Guess she just needs to feel your love for her in order to forget about the fear she experienced over last night. You\u2019re more than happy to give it to her as she was close to her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Yuten! Give it to me! Give me all of the love you have for me! Help me forget about my pain of me losing you! Oh! I\u2019m cumming!\u201d Akiza moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter which, she did cake and her orgasm splashed into your mouth before you swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that was done,...</span></div></div>",

I guess I was so freaked out when you told me about the explosion, my imagination wandered farther than I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, they tend to do that sometimes.\" You reaffirm as you crawl out from under the blanket. \"Just means I need to keep on my toes a little more so that outcome doesn't happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me Yuten. Despite today being evidence to the contrary, I don't want to lock you in here for the rest of our lives in some vain attempt to keep you safe. Just promise me that you'll stay safe. I don't think my heart can take another hit like it did when I found out you got kidnapped or when you told me how close you were to being blown up in a factory. Can you promise me that?\" She asks as you sit up next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.Between you, my reunion with my folks, the discovery that I have a brother, who also has a girlfriend I'm friends with, the movement now in full swing, and, of course, you, I have too much to live for to go ahead and die now.\" You tell her. \"I don't plan on going anywhere anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it.\" She says.</span></div></div>",

First, I\u2019m going to activate Hand Destruction. This makes us discard two cards from our hands and then we each draw two cards.\u201d Ren explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me.\u201d You said as you two discarded your two cards before drawing two more from your decks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext up, I\u2019m going to use Monster Reborn to resurrect my Red-Eyes Black Dragon.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREBD: 2400 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there it is. You\u2019ve got your Red-Eyes in play. But he\u2019s outmatched and outnumbered by my three Blue-Eyes.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps. But, you said you got cards you want to test. Well, after taming Red-Eyes, so do I. But first, I\u2019ll normal summon The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTDHSF: 1000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never seen that monster before. What does it do?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple really. He can act as any fusion material monster as I want. Also, I can sacrifice him and another monster my field to fusion summon a dark attribute fusion monster.\u201d Ren explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that would make........ a contact fusion!?\u201d You gasped in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBingo. I\u2019ll sacrifice my Dark Hexed Sealed Fusion and my Red-Eyes Black Dragon to merge them into this. Archfiend Black Skull Dragon!\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nABSD: 3200 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredible!\u201d You said in awe of Ren\u2019s new monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better believe it, little bro. Just wait until he attacks. In fact, don\u2019t wait. Archfiend Black Skull Dragon, take out one of his Blue-Eyes!\u201d Ren commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI play my trap!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so! You see, when Archfiend Black Skull Dragon attacks, you can\u2019t activate any cards or effects until the end of the damage step.\u201d Ren explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy!\u201d You said as one of your Blue-Eyes is destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 3800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all. After the battle phase when he attacks, I can get my Red-Eyes from my graveyard and you take damage equal to its attack points.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me!\u201d You said as his dragon burns away at your life points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter which, Red-Eyes is shuffled back into my deck. I then set two cards face down and that\u2019s all for now.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Amazing! That was his first turn and he already knocked down over half my life points. I guess taming Red-Eyes really did give him a big boost in his deck. Now I shudder to think what would happen if he gets Beelze under control. Guess we\u2019ll find out eventually.</i>\u201d You thought as you make your move.</span></div></div>",

My Archfiend will just knock it down again to win me the duel.\" He gloats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it all wrong. I'm not doing this to summon Blue-Eyes White Dragon. I'm doing it to summon the other monster you made me discard, Dragon Spirit of White.\" You say as your new beast appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDSW: 2500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with his special ability, I'm allowed to banish one spell or trap card on the field, and I choose the face-down on the left.\" You call as his card poofs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? He still isn't strong enough to break down my Archfiend.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be, but my turn isn't over yet. I play the second effect of my White Stone of the Ancients, allowing me to add one Blue-Eyes monster from my graveyard to my hand as long as I banish the Stone, and I choose my Blue-Eyes. Now it's time for my Dragon Spirit's other effect.

So tell me, how does this save you from me blasting away another dragon and hitting you with another 2400 next turn?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't. But the card I'm about to play is going to destroy your Archfiend, so I couldn't resurrect my Dragon this turn if I played it first. Now it's time for the spell Burst Stream of Destruction. Now as long as my Blue-Eyes don't attack this turn, I can destroy all monsters on your field, or in this case, your Archfiend. Go my dragons, destroy his monster with Burst Stream of Destruction.\" You order as your monsters fire on his. \"I'll end my turn with that. Like you said, I'm ready for the tournament.

Unfortunately, during each of my end phases, Berserk Dragon looses five hundred attack points.\u201d Ren explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you make your move, there\u2019s something I want to ask you, something that\u2019s been boggling in my mind.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get by when you were alone? I told you that I had to work with Syd to survive, but how did you managed to keep yourself on your feet?\u201d Ren wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy. I duel my way up. I won a bunch of duels so I can get money to pay for mortgage and food while I had my own apartment. After the Dark Signer thing was done with, I had help rebuilding the Arcadia Movement and I became the new boss. That\u2019s about it.\u201d You told your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really had some adventure, man. Now, let\u2019s see if those past duels will pay off here.\u201d Ren said.</span></div></div>",

Ren has enough control of Red-Eyes and Beelze to summon these much stronger forms. He's also about to get a valuable lesson to not get too cocky with his discards. But most importantly, you began to learn how to listen to the will of your dragons. All three of these are going to be valuable for the tournament to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, you still had a duel to win. \"I'll summon Kaiser Sea Horse in defense mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKSH: 1650 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then, I'll place one card face down and end my turn.

Sorry to bother you, but I just want to say thank for giving us a place to call home and good luck in the tournament.\u201d The boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem and thank you.

Back then, all I was doing was trying to win and represent a movement, not people. I never had kids run up and say they were believing in me to win, how they were inspired by me and counting on me to win.

Life will go on.\" You assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you and Ren? You're both counting on me as a teammate to cross the finish line with you, but I might just slow you both down in the process. Then you'll lose your dream.\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren isn't gonna mind. He wants to win, yes, but it isn't like he's going to hate you if we don't. As for my dream, win or lose, we show the people that our powers can be controlled. All a win does is give us a more favorable outlook, okay? My dream will live on.\" You comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" She sniffles as the tears fade and her smile returns, and with it, her confidence. She then looks you in the eye. \"Not like it matters anyway. Because we're going to smoke the competition, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You assure as you release her and resume walking.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Akiza slowly rises as she rubs the sleep out of her eye. \"Excited for today?\" She asks, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. Our first duel might not be today, but this is technically the very first day of the competition. It all starts today.\" You say full of glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, keep in mind that the postings aren't going to be in another hour or so, so we have time to eat.\" She says as she gets up and throws on some clothes. \"I'll get something cooked up. Then we can head down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a knock is heard at your door. \"What, is he already set to go?\" You ask as you go to answer it. Sure enough, Ren stood in your doorway with Misty at his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro. We thought you'd be up by now, so Misty figured we could spend breakfast with you. That cool?\" Ren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Come on in you two.\" You say as you lead them in. \"Akiza, two more plates worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard.\" She calls back as you and Misty took your seats. \"If I had some help, this would go faster.\" At that, Ren went into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on. I know a thing or two about cooking.\" He says. Soon, the two emerge with a small buffet's worth of food. Once everything was set and everyone seated, you all began to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, today's the day we finally learn who we're up against in our first duel. Who else is as excited as me?\" Ren asks while cutting into his eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask Mr. Springboard here. The second he woke up he leapt out of bed like the room was on fire.\" Akiza joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? This competition is going to be big for all of us. Is it so wrong that I'm pumped up for it?\" You ask to the laughter of your peers. \"By the way bro, we have something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" He asks while you get up to go grab Tetsuo's star and pass it to him. \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids worked together to make one for each of us three.\" You explain. \"They're to motivate us during the tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang. Those little kids really do have faith in us, huh? Guess that just means we have even more reason to win, don't we?\" He says with even more confidence in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You say before turning to Misty. \"You said you have tailors on standby ready to make any outfits we desire and our relay armbands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. They are all just a phone call away.\" She answers. \"Why, do you want a new outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Tell your designers that this is what I want as the logo on our armbands.\" You say, holding up your own star. \"Star and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" She replies. Soon, all the food is eaten and you, Ren and Misty are cleaning the dishes while Akiza changes into her riding outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go.\" You say as you lead your group downstairs to the garage. There, Sion is waiting for you all with your runners prepped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good, you're all here.\" He says. \"Your runners are all at peak performance, sir. I hope to see you all return after discovering who you duel first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You ask like he said something offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" He questions, worried about what he might've said wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you hope to see 'you all' return. Implying that we were ever going to be going down there without our mechanic to see the competition with us.\" You say in a lighter tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?! Really?! I'm honored, sir, truly I am. Just let me go warm up my car and...\" He starts before Misty stops him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. You'll be riding with me in my car.\" She tells him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you ma'am.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The announcement went on for a little while, explaining to the uninformed about things like how Speed World has now become Speed World 2 and all the effects that came with it. Thankfully you already learned about that back in basic. He also explained that each duelist was given four thousand life points each, totaling twelve thousand for a full team of three. Lastly, any exchange will need to be fast. If a duelist completes a lap while the other team is in the pit, the team in the pit loses a speed counter, and loses the duel entirely if this happens when the pit team has no counters left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the name of the game is going to be repairs and switches.\" Sion says as you all return to your vehicles. \"I guess that means I'll need to be at my A-game then, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What confuses me is why not just draw up a singular bracket for the whole thing?\" Misty asks. \"It's not like there's an eneven number of teams or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have two theories on that.\" You say. \"Either the new directors want to extend the tournament for the excitement of it, or they want to make sure a great team isn't automatically booted just because of one bad hand. This way, you can still lose one match and still make it into the bracket as long as you're the top of your block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand now.\" She answers. \"So what about our opponents? This... Team Cameo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of them.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sir, I did some digging on them when we saw that they were our first match.\" Sion speaks up. \"Apparently two of them are best friends from an out-of-the-way place called Crash Town, now Satisfaction Town after a recent change in management. However, the third duelist is a complete mystery. It's like she just... showed up and joined these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe it.\" You heard from behind you. You all spin around to see two people approach you. The first was a man with what looks to be an attempt at a blonde pompadour in a red and white jacket, and the other was a girl with blue hair swirled at the top in a white coat and yellow undershirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\" You ask as they stop in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry, where are my manners?\" The blonde says with a forgetful look on his face. \"The name's Toru, and me and my team are gonna ride this tournament to the finals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Misaki.\" The bluette says with a stern look on her face. \"I'm here to keep Toru out of trouble.\" Her words make Toru trip over himself a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on Misaki. Don't embarrass me in front of our first opponents.\" He whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, opponents? Does that mean you guys are Team Cameo?\" Akiza asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'r..... wait what?\" Toru starts to ask before stopping to pull out his schedule. \"Aw man. I thought we were going with one of the cool names I spent all night thinking up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were outvoted. This was what we went with.\" Misaki responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Toru says before turning back to you. \"So yeah, we're Team Cameo, but we're still gonna win this.\" He says with renewed confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm Yuten, that's my girlfriend, Akiza. My brother, Ren. His girlfriend, Misty, and our mechanic Sion.\" You name off. \"We're team Arcadia. We look forward to our first match together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...\" Ren chimes in. \"Where's your third? He not good enough to come mingle with the common folk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. He's probably back at our garage right now. We figured we'd come get a look while he checks out our bikes, you know?\" Toru says. \"But don't worry, you'll meet him come our match, and then you'll wish you hadn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go.\" Misaki says as she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't be rude Misaki.\" Toru says before begining to follow her. \"Sorry about her. She's not the conversation type. See you guys, can't wait to race. Misaki wait up!\" He says as he runs after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange bunch.\" Ren says to unanimous agreement from your crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm sure they've got the skill to back it up, so we need to be at our A game.\" You say.</span></div></div>",

How are you, my boy?\u201d Akiza\u2019s mother, Setsuko, asked nicely too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mrs. Izin... Uh!

But you have to promise not to tell Akiza.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents where skeptical as you all sit in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. The thing is.....\u201d You breathe easy before you let it out. \u201cI\u2019m planning on asking for your daughter to marry me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents were surprised before Setsuko made her way to you and hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are? That is so wonderful! Our rose is going to be a wife soon!\u201d Setsuko said with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is wonderful news. When you\u2019ll propose?\u201d Hideo wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight after we win the tournament. I want it to make it something special.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just remember that you have our blessing and I know you\u2019ll love each other forever.\u201d Hideo said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then soon, we\u2019ll be standing here as grandparents.\u201d Setsuko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne step at a time. But, I thank you for your blessing.\u201d You said.</span></div></div>",

I draw two cards but then must discard one.\u201d Fake You explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it wouldn\u2019t kill to try something original.\u201d You said in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right. That\u2019s why I have this. First, since I sent the White Stone of Legend to my graveyard, I get to add one Blue-Eyes from my deck to my hand. Now, for the card that\u2019ll be your demise. I play the speed spell, Speed Ritual.\u201d Fake You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that!?\u201d You shouted in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. You see, since I have three or more speed counters, this speed spell let\u2019s me ritual summon one monster as long as I send monsters from my hand and/or field to my graveyard equal to the level of the monster I\u2019m going to summon. So, I\u2019ll send my Blue-Eyes from my hand to the graveyard. Witness this unstoppable dragon descending from pure light to brutal darkness. I Ritual Summon!

A dark Blue-Eyes!?\u201d You looked on in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd get a load of what it can do! Chaos MAX, attack that dragon with Chaos Stream of Destruction!\u201d Fake You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Not if my Mirror Force has anything to say about that!\u201d You said as you played your trap, only for Chaos MAX Dragon to break through. \u201cWhat!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to disappoint you, but Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon can\u2019t be targeted or destroyed by any of your card effects. Which means, he\u2019s done.\u201d Fake You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 2400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext, I play the trap, Call of the Haunted to bring my Blue-Eyes back.\u201d Fake You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEWD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, end him.

As you were falling, you looked up to see the fake you on the track just smiling down on you evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see? All of your peaceful dreams and ideals are nothing but childish beliefs. The only true reality of your life is the darkness and hate you have within you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d Fake you said as he shows you that his eyes are somewhat demonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just looked at them in fear as you disappeared in the water, not knowing that you left your star and the copy of Blue-Eyes and Kisara behind on the shore.</span></div></div>",

You try to move, but your limbs are bound by some sort of vines or tentacles leading to several masses. \"Where am I?\" You ask to seemingly no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question. One that I'd like the answer to as well.\" You hear an all-too-familiar cockney voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? Is that you? What's going on?\" You ask as some of the blobs scatter to reveal Jack suspended in a similar state to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know why you're here. But for me, there was this guy that's impersonating me. He got me arrested last night for crimes he committed in my name. I got free and challenged him, but I lost. I spiraled off the highway and into the sea. Next thing I knew, I was here.\" He explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here. My clone might not have been committing crimes as me, at least not yet anyway, but he challenged me. It was like looking into a mirror. He had my runner, my cards, even his own Blue-Eyes. Then, like you, I came crashing into the sea once I lost.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods in agreement. \"My guy somehow had Red Dragon Archfiend in his deck. My guess is that both our clones are linked somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything else, a tear opened in the void, showing a second Jack. But this one... his eyes looked not unlike your clones when you fell into the water. \"It's you!\" Jack yells. \"Let me go! Who are you? What do you think you're doing pretending to be me?\" He shouts at the copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it, do you old chap? I am you. A better you.\" The fake spits back before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO!!\" Jack yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you were both forced to watch as Jack's copy flees from Sector Security, only for a dragon's claw to crash down in front of Security. A claw you only wish you didn't recognize. Your copy soon comes up from behind the officers, giving that same smug grin he gave you and his Blue-Eyes behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it isn't my old pal Jack Atlas. Seems you are having a bit of trouble with the law. Mind if I help out?\" Your copy asks his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. The champ doesn't need help. But... you're more than welcome to if makes you feel better.\" Jack's clone answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I will. Blue-Eyes, get these pests out of my way!\" Your clone says as his dragon fires a shot that wipes out all but one officer before pulling in front of him. You are then forced to watch in horror as your doubles continue to smear your good names in front of the survivor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings only got worse, though, as you see four new runners come up from behind them, and you unfortunately recognize each one. Yusei, Crow, Ren and... Akiza. Of all the people to see this without context, why her? To your surprise, though, all four of them came already convinced that those two were fakes. \"I don't know who these two are, but that is not Jack Atlas.\" Crow says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that certainly isn't Yuten.\" Akiza adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, my little rose? Of course its me. I've just dumped that foolish ideal of peace for a brand new approach.\" Your clone lies through his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's exactly why you're not him. The real Yuten would never abandon his dream. He would sooner die than act like...like... like Sayer!\" She retorts. \"And I don't know what you did with the real Yuten, but I plan to smear you across the highway until you talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it.\" You clone says as he and Fake Jack back up, with Jack pulling in front of Crow and you with Ren. Then, with a flare of their engines, they blind the two, causing them to spin out and crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crow NO!\" Jack yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren!\" Is all you can say. They seemed alright, if not a bit banged up. They then go and pull the same trick with Yusei and Akiza. \"No, not her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOBODY HURTS HER AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!!!!\" With pure rage, both you and Jack shatter your restraints, only to find yourselves now strapped to some weird computer chairs in a cave. \"Jack, look.\" You say, pointing to a nearby wall. \"Our runners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both suit up and ride. Jack lead the charge as his runner breaks through a set of metal doors at the entrance to the cave as you both rush to your friends' aid. \"So Yuten.\" Jack speaks up on the ride. \"Two of them, two of us. How do you want to play this?\"</span></div></div>",

Why wouldn\u2019t you just give in to your hate and give these people what they had coming?\u201d Fake You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I believe in the good of mankind no matter what they\u2019ve done to me.

Now to summon the monster that beaten you last time. I play the Speed Ritual speed spell. Since I have three or more speed counters, I can send the Blue-Eyes from my hand to my graveyard to summon forth my ultimate beast. I Ritual Summon! Come to me, Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon!\u201d The dragon that defeated you last time rises to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBECMD: 4000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Blue-Eyes ritual monster!?\u201d Jack said as he and everyone else eye on the ritual summoned dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that beat me up real good in our last duel.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he\u2019ll do it again! Chaos MAX Dragon, attack that Maiden with Eyes of Blue with Chaos Stream of Destruction.\u201d Fake You commanded as his ace goes to blast away at Kisara. \u201cOh yes. I forgot to tell you that, if he attacks a monster in defense mode, he inflicts piercing damage. In fact, the piercing is so mighty and powerful, he can double the damage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouble!?!?\u201d You said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!

How could you increased your life points so high when they should\u2019ve gone to zero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, it was all thanks to the trap card that my brother gave me. Rainbow Life!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my bro.\u201d Ren said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith this trap card, all I have to do is discard one card from my hand to my graveyard. That way, any damage I would\u2019ve taken for the rest of the turn, I gained it instead.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you! Fine! I end my turn.\u201d Fake You said with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. Since the monster I send away was the White Stone of Ancients, I get to summon a Blue-Eyes from my deck.

But so what? In their current state, they\u2019re just weak little lizards who lost what means to be an unstoppable force, just like you.\u201d Fake You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t get it, do you? You only see Blue-Eyes a an instrument for revenge while I see it as a part of me. While my friends, my family, and the love of my life represents my heart, he represents my very soul. When I was young and alone, it was this very dragon that protected me. He helped through some hardships and I wouldn\u2019t trade him with anything in the world.

Now I can merge together a few monsters to form a fusion monster. So let's see, Two Blue-Eyes on the field plus one in the hand equals...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon?!?!\" He says in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Come on out pal. It's your time to shine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEUD: 4500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. No matter. Even if he's stronger than my MAX Dragon, I can still survive this turn.\" He assures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. I still have one face-down left. Go Dragon's Bursting Spirit! Now, by removing from play one dragon-type monster in my graveyard, I can increase the attack of a dragon on my field by four hundred points times the level of the banished monster, as long as the powered-up dragon is banished during the end phase. But there isn't going to be an end phase. I remove my Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon to increase my Ultimate Dragon's attack by thirty-six hundred points.\" You announce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh No!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEUD: 4500-8100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Now, Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, attack with Neutron Burst!\" Your monster charges an attack with all three mouths firing all three at once at his Chaos MAX Dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFake You: 0000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as your clone spirals out of control and wrecks. In the last seconds before the crash, though, you see more parts than flesh. \"Another duel bot?\" You question as you see his cards begin to dissipate into energy. What was going on here? </span></div></div>",

In fact, that was the biggest thing keeping me from understanding them. I tried to restrict them and hold them back, push them deep down like a repressed memory. Then our duel taught me something. When I embraced Red-Eyes and his power as a part of me, I gained more access to his power. So, the same went for Beelze. He was a lot more vicious about it, but with some help from Red-Eyes I was able to embrace him as well.

Taking a seat at your desk, you put your face in your hands as you begin to wonder yourself how things would've gone if you had gone down that path. Would you have joined Sayer's plan? Would you have aided the Signers? Would you have even met Akiza?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all of these horrific scenarios play out in your head, you notice a light out of the corner of your eye. Your deck... it was glowing! Picking up the top card, you see none other than your Blue-Eyes looking back at you. Seeing this as a sign, you set the card in front of you on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? What would've happened if I went down that path?\" You ask it. To your surprise, your dragon appears in front of you, only much more... transparent than before. \"Woah.\" Is all you can say at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dragon lowers it's head down to stare you in the eye. It was as if he was staring into your very soul. Maybe this was your chance to talk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can you understand me?\" You ask. He nods in response. \"Can talk like you guys did during my duel with Ren?\" He shakes his head. \"Why not? Are you guys disappointed in me or something now that you know what's been in my heart?\" He shakes again, making you confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting a claw, he brings it up to you and taps your chest, causing it to glow along with his torso in a similar place. \"Oh, that's right. You guys have been with me since I was a kid, so you were there when I was like that. But then, why stay?\" No response, but the lights from your chests grow brighter. \"You mean, even back then you could sense the good in me? And you stuck around to help me reach that good if I strayed from it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt nods again. \"Th-thank you boy. You have no idea what that means to me to know that.\" With a roar and a pleased grin on his face, your dragon disappears, leaving you alone to wipe away tears you didn't even notice. You then noticed that you've been sulking in here for at least an hour now. You collect your card off the desk and look at it. <i>Keep looking out for me buddy.</i> You think before putting it back in your deck and prepare to head back, only taking a quick pause to unlock the drawer where you kept Akiza's ring. <i>Soon.</i> You tell yourself before relocking the door and leaving</span></div></div>",

You can search for him there.\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Yuya. Come on, Shawn.\u201d Serena said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on. You two are going to duel him or something?\u201d Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s business, actually. But, it\u2019s somewhere along those lines.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s this tournament called the Arc Leauge Championship coming up and rumors said that Reiji might be entering it. So, if you enter, you could get a chance to face him.\u201d Yuya suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat does sound like an idea, Shawn.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, if you two are going to be entering, how about a little practice?\u201d Yuya challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna duel, Yuya? Okay. That\u2019s fine.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShawn. What are you doing? We don\u2019t have time for this. We\u2019ve got the info. So, let\u2019s go.\u201d Serena whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a minute, Serena. This guy is using a new kind of summoning method of some sort and he looks pretty strong. Who knows? We could use the extra help.\u201d You whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*sigh*. Alright. Maybe one duel could give us a warm up.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d You said before turning to Yuya. \u201cAlright, Yuya. We\u2019ll duel you.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet. So, which one of you am I facing?\u201d Yuya wondered.</span></div></div>",

I mean, this seems a little fast\", you said nervously. \"Then how about a trade? You strip down to just your boxers, and I'll take off my bra. What do you say?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a red face, you don't make eye contact as you remove your clothes. As soon as you're in your boxers, Serena began to unhook her bra. When she took it off, her fairly impressive breast were set free. Then you join her under the blanket, and wrap your arms around her. You don't fall asleep yet, you just nuzzle each other for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take this anymore!\", Serena screamed as she slid her panties off and tossed them away. \"Shawn I love you.

I\u2019ll gladly make love with you. But, before we get started, I wanted to give you something.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Serena wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached over to your jacket and pulled out a box from the pocket. You gave it to Serena and she opened it. Serena gasped as it was a necklace with a golden cat on it. You told her that it\u2019s also a locket. So, she opened it and it reads \u201cTo My Sweet Lunalight\u201d. It was the best thing she\u2019s ever gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got this for a good deal.

You're giving much appreciated attention to kitties special friend, Nya!\", Serena said as she kissed you. She grabbed your member, and pumped it while you rubbed her clit. Serena moaned and gasped, as you grunted.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Serena slapped your hand away; and shifted til her crotch and butt were hovering above you. \"Nya, now we do 6-9; kitty give you blowjob while you eat out her special friend!\", Serena said as she set her crotch on your mouth.<br>\r\nAs you both moan in the bliss of the moment, your hips start to buck while Serena's buttcheeks bounced up and down on your face. After you both orgasmed, Serena repositioned herself; so now she sat facing you, with her legs spread wide open. \"Now you stick it in kitties friend, Nya!\", Serena said. \"I don't know Serena. We don't have protection\", you said. \"Kitty ponder this while we do anal\", Serena said thoughtfully. You rub your member on her soft cheeks, while you massage her clit which makes her moan. Finally hard again, you spread her a little bit; before shoving your member in.<br>\r\n\"Nya, kitty likes it doggy style!\", Serena laughed as you humped her hard. Eventually you came into her ass, and as you lay there; Serena crawled up on you. \"Shawn, I don't care if we don't have protection.

Back home, I was told that Ruri was taken by the enemy. Me and my friends went looking for her. That\u2019s when I saw Yuto challenging this guy here. And then he just bailed on out of there back to his little colleagues.\u201d Shun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Why were you there to begin with and why did you attacked Yuto?\u201d You asked Yugo next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw someone taking Rin away too. I searched all over the place in that little dimension of yours and found your buddy. I would\u2019ve beaten him if you hadn\u2019t shown up.\u201d Yugo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought Yuto has Rin?\u201d Serena guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. That guy had the exact same face as the one who kidnapped Rin.\u201d Yugo finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! Yuto isn\u2019t like that! He would never kidnap anyone.\u201d Shun countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen. Perhaps, this whole thing is a misunderstanding. Maybe he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time and mistook Yuto for someone else.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe could be right, Shun.\u201d Reiji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Well, how should I know that you don't have something to do with Ruri\u2019s kidnapping too?\u201d Shun said to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me, pal.\u201d You warned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else what, Pawn of Fusion?\u201d Shun dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou over go to kick Shun\u2019s ass, but Reiji stopped you in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough! You both know that there\u2019s only one way to settle this.\u201d Reiji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA duel? I\u2019m in.\u201d Yugo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You\u2019re hurt right now. How about we let you duel instead, Shawn?\u201d Reiji suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. That sounds fair.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Shun left to the duel area while Serena talks to Reiji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we should bring Yuya and Yuzu too? They\u2019re witnesses to the duel between Yugo and Yuto. Maybe, they might help.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m way ahead of you. They should be here momentarily.\u201d Reiji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being said, you and Shun set your duel disks on and begin to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn: 4000<br>\r\nShun: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho goes first?</span></div></div>",

Also, she wears a pair of black combat boots with green accents on them. She even has a pair of sunglasses that are grey on the bottom. But, you can see a tint of pink on the top if you look closely. She took the bow off of her hair that allowed her hair to fall completely before she tied the ribbon on her right arm just over her elbow. Lastly, you see her putting on a green and white sports cap on her head. You changed too into a black shirt that says \u201cduel strong\u201d, blue jeans, a pair of black boots and a red hoodie jacket along with a pair of sunglasses of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good with those clothes on, Serena?\u201d You complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame to you, Shawn. I mean, you\u2019re such a stud in that.\u201d Serena said as she looks at you from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Alright, let\u2019s get going. We don\u2019t want to be late\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Serena go around into the arena and get yourselves ready for your matches. You looked to see a boy in a LDS uniform with an arrogant look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Fancy meeting you here, Shawn.\u201d The boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh. Yeah. And you are?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Sawatari. He came to see your duel yesterday and, well, he was trying to woo me a little.\u201d Serena said not comfortable with Sawatari here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d You wondered as you want to knock this guy\u2019s lights out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, Darling. You\u2019re just saying that because you\u2019re just shy. I don\u2019t blame you. The girls do get trembling with joy when they see me.\u201d Sawatari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not one of them. You see, I\u2019ve already have someone.\u201d Serena said while holding on to your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please. Once you see my performance, you\u2019ll be glad that you got rid of this chump.\u201d Sawatari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you push me, jackass.\u201d You growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t take the truth? Well, both love and the truth hurts a lot. Soon, she\u2019ll question herself on why she\u2019s going out with a nobody when she can date a somebody.\u201d Sawatari said trying to woo Serena again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little!!\u201d You yelled as you ran up and start strangling Sawatari by his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena removed you from him and Sawatari choked up some air back into his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou barbarian beast! I\u2019ll see you on the battlefield.\u201d Sawatari said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calmed down and you went with Serena to see who you guys will be dueling.

Well, let\u2019s go shower.\u201d You said before you and Serena go into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou washed her good as you kissed her lips a lot. That\u2019s when you found a brown furry thing and you thought it was a luffa. You used it to scrub on Serena\u2019s back, front, and then between her buttcheeks. That\u2019s when she felt something strange about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird. It feels alive.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You asked before you see a pair of purple eyes and three claws on it\u2019s hands and feet. \u201cKuriboh?! What are you doing in here?!\u201d You yelled in shock and Kuriboh just cooed at you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww. We\u2019re sorry. We thought you were a luffa. Can you forgive us?\u201d Serena said as Kuriboh just snuggled on her face that proves that he does forgive you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, once we\u2019re done, will clean you up.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you and Serena got cleaned, you washed up Kuriboh too, got dressed, and you, Serena, and Kuriboh go down to the dining room for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Who knew Micheal was a good cook? After you finished eating, you decided to talk to your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom? Dad? Can I ask you two something?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. What is it, sweetie?\u201d Kisara asked you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, during my second round match against this big bully, he said words directly into my heart and I got angry. After that, when I came to, he was laying on the ground unconscious. What was that all about?\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you unleashed the dark half of your powers. When you unleashed your anger, the darkness within a duel spirit is released. In your case, you would bring out the magic of the shadow games.\u201d Kaibaman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow games?\u201d Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying way of dueling that once existed 5000 years ago. When you lose a shadow game, your soul is sent to the dimension of eternal darkness. The Shadow Realm.\u201d Kisara finished explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat scared everyone here, minus your parents, Micheal, and Josi. You just looked at yourself and you never thought you would bring out something so evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d You said as you got up to go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go talk to him.\u201d Kaibaman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019ll go talk to him. Uh. With your permission.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Kaibaman agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena got up to find you outside and she did. You feel sad and she goes up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShawn? Are you okay?\u201d Serena asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerena. I-I don\u2019t think you want to see me anymore.\u201d You said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! What are you talking about?!\u201d Serena asked in shock of your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard what my parents just told us. I can create dark magic that can make turning people into cards seemed merciful. One snap of rage and their souls could be gone.\u201d You said as tears starting coming down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t you, Shawn! Don\u2019t go blaming yourself!\u201d Serena said to reason with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, it\u2019s true! You saw what I did back at the tournament! I\u2019m worse than those punks from Fusion! Maybe, worse than The Professer! It\u2019s best that-!\u201d You stopped when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned when Serena slapped you across your face. You see the tears coming down on her face too for she can\u2019t bear to see you suffer like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me here, mister! Don\u2019t you ever, and I mean ever, think that you\u2019re worse than The Professor or anyone from Fusion who thinks like him! You were angry because that bully pushed you too far! I would feel the same way too! Yeah! It was scary to watch! I\u2019ll admit! But, that wasn\u2019t you at all! So, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m just gonna leave you like that! You were the one who opened my eyes to the truth and I couldn\u2019t be anymore happy to be here with you! So, good or evil, I\u2019ll be by your side one hundred percent. I promise. I love you so much.\u201d Serena said as she hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing those words, you felt happy again and you hugged her back. You told her thank you and you kissed her on her lips. That\u2019s when you see your friends out there with smiles on their faces as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerena\u2019s right. We all know that it wasn\u2019t your fault. So, don\u2019t go beating yourself over all of this.\u201d Gong said and the kids agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree. Trust us when we say that your heart is as pure as anything.\u201d Josi said as Micheal nodded with agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Shawn. You\u2019re no monster or anything like that. You\u2019re one of the greatest friends we can ever know. If anything, that makes you one of us.\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were touched by the words and you see your parents smiling at you as well. You smiled too and you felt like you\u2019re at home with these people here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, guys.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet, Shawn.\u201d Yuya said as he patted you on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with that done, it\u2019s time to deport.\u201d Micheal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portal to Standard opened and you all are about to leave before Kisara and Kaibaman came over to say goodbye to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust remember that you have our cards. So, we\u2019re always by your side.\u201d Kaibaman said as he hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Dad. I know.\u201d You said as you hugged him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerena. You have made our son very happy. We\u2019re very proud to have you in the family.\u201d Kisara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll make sure that he\u2019s all good.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I know he\u2019ll do the same with you. Also, don\u2019t start having a baby without telling us first.\u201d Kisara teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOM!\u201d You said in embarrassment while the others laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way through the portal after waving goodbye to your parents. Now that you\u2019re back, what\u2019s next?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d Serena said not wanting to leave her boyfriend\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUs too. Reiji would want an explanation.\u201d Micheal said and Josi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you four go to the LEO tower to see Reiji. You arrived at the front desk and told the receptionist that you want to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir. Shawn and Serena are here with some guests. They said that they wanted to see you.\u201d The receptionist said on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them in.\u201d Reiji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the others make your way to Reiji\u2019s office and you knocked on the door before entering.

This is Micheal and Josi. They were sent here by my father to test my abilities.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father?\u201d Reiji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all sit down and told Reiji that you\u2019re, actually, half duel spirit that comes from the world of duel monster spirits. You told him that your parents are Kaibaman and the Maiden with Eyes of Blue, Kisara. You also explained to him that his father, Leo Akaba, went into the spirit world to kidnap you for his own purposes. After hearing that, Reiji felt enraged to hear that his father went lower than ever. But, cooled down once you told them that Micheal and Josi has info about Academia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got word that they\u2019ll be invading here today. So, while Shawn and Serena compete in the Battle Royal, we\u2019ll help you prepare for their attack.\u201d Micheal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Shawn. Serena. Good luck and keep your eyes open.\u201d Reiji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d You said before you and Serena left for the battle royal.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m taking control of this duel starting now!\u201d Yuya said as his two magicians are in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the world is this?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m about to use a cool new summoning called Pendulum Summoning. With this, I can summon monsters at the same time as long as their levels are in between the scales of these two monsters. Meaning, I can summon monsters levels 2 to 7 at the same time. Swing forth Pendulum! Carve the Arc of Victory! My monsters are ready to swing into action! Drum away, Performapal Drummerilla! Turn up the heat, Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerformapal Drummerilla: 1600 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon: 2500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a Pendulum Summon. Interesting. However, I don\u2019t see how they\u2019re going to help you. Considering that neither of your monsters have enough attack points to take on my Cyber Twin Dragon.\u201d You reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe this will help change your mind. Odd-Eyes! Attack his Cyber Twin Dragon with Spiral Flame Strike!\u201d Yuya commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this kid think he\u2019s doing? His dragon weaker than Shawn\u2019s. Unless.\u201d Serena thought in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI activate Performapal Drummerilla\u2019s ability. This will give my Odd-Eyes an extra 600 attack points until the end of the Battle Phase.\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon: 3100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man!\u201d You gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all. Whenever Odd-Eyes attacks a level 5 or higher monster, the battle damage is doubled. Reaction Force!\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? I play the action spell, Miracle! My monster is safe from your attack and I take half the damage.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if my Stargazer Magician has anything to say about it. With his pendulum ability, he can stop any spell from being played when a pendulum monster attacks.\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD\u2019oh!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn: 3400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd with that gone, take your turn to attack, Drummerilla.\u201d Yuya commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn: 1800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShawn! Are you okay?\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good. Thanks.\u201d You said while getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI end my turn. I know you can step up, Shawn. So, don\u2019t give in now!\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it. Here goes! First, I\u2019ll play Pot of Greed to draw two cards! Next, since you control a monster and I don\u2019t, I can special summon Cyber Dragon to the field.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Dragon: 2100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext, I\u2019ll normal summon Cyber Dragon Zwei to the field as well.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Dragon Zwei: 1500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by revealing a spell card from my hand, I can treat him as just Cyber Dragon. And the one I will show is Cybernetic Fusion Support, which I will play now by paying half of my life points. This card helps me, when I activate this; another polymerization. Now, by banishing my monsters from anywhere other than my deck, I can create a Machine-type fusion monster. So, I\u2019ll banish and fuse Cyber Dragon Zwei and two Cyber Dragons together.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn: 900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother fusion summon?\u201d Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy combining these three mechanical creatures together, they\u2019ll create a three-headed weapon of mass destruction! Fusion summon! Level 10! Cyber End Dragon!\u201d You chanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber End Dragon: 4000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? 4000 attack points?\u201d Yuya gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re in for a world of hurt, Yuya.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s get started. Attack his Drummerilla now!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya: 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a big hit.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll play Pot of Acquisitiveness! I shuffle my three banished monsters back into my deck and draw a new card. That\u2019ll do it for now.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Time to make a comeback!\u201d Yuya said as he draws.</span></div></div>",

The goal of this project, was to create half-machine duelists to aid in the war. The subjects would be given cybernetics in the arms and legs, and have cybernetics placed in their torso and head. \"Unfortunately sir, only RX-11 survived the cybernetic surgery\", the doctor said. He pointed towards the one living subject, who was currently dueling a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subject had cybernetics on his lower arms and legs, and his torso had cybernetics as well. He had a robotic red left-eye, where a metal casing was around it. His blue eye was emotionless. He had cybernetics in his brain as well, giving him knowledge on all known summoning methods; as well as martial arts skills. His cybernetic limbs made him superhuman. For the current test, He had tubes and wires sticking out of his robotic limbs; and a helmet on his head, also with wires and a visor. He knew of this, but had to focus on honing his duel skills. The subject had his human mind locked away with a special program, as to keep his skills sharp as possible. The teacher drew his card, and used it to summon Chaos ancient gear golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Your pov)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nError, no countermeasures available for opposing card at this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarget attacking, probability of defeat; 100%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRX-11: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a failure, time for punishment\", the teacher said. He pressed a button, that sent electricity through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain! Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it was over, you put your deck back into the duffel bag of decks given to you by the Academia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doctor came in with the professor, all the hoses and wires went limp; simply dangling off you now. You lifted the bag, when a strange desire for freedom entered your robotic mind. You threw off the test disk and ran, hearing as security was called to catch you.you reached a storage room, and grabbed a disk with the dimension function; as well as a couple extra decks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Standard)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyu was walking home, when suddenly a light blinded her; before she saw a boy her age, who looked like he was from a science-fiction movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\", she asked. \"RX-11, a duel-cyborg\", you answered. \"Duel-cyborg?\", she asked. \"Allow to to demonstrate\", you tell her as you pull out your disk and a deck from the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Elsewhere)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, that's him! He's the source of the dimensional energy! We have men in the area, orders sir?\", Nakajima asked. \"Once the duel ends, capture him however you can\", Reiji Akaba said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll begin\", you said. \"With the field spell..\"</span></div></div>",
