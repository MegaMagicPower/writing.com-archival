I'm uh - uh - I'm participating in it. My penpal, Gwendolina Gnome, is one of the organisers. She said she's got special permission for a human to participate this year. They're - they're making - a - a - special stage for me and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You - YOU - YOU Neelandra Blockbuster, my best friend, age sixteen, are PARTICIPATING in the festival of the GNOME SONG and you didn't TELL me about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't. She had to get the permission and everything, and it had to be a secret till then. The Gnome Government is very strict about these things. I just got the call that it's all okay ten minutes ago, and I leave in half an hour. Listen, Sheela, I was going to call and tell you as soon as I'd finished packing, I promise. You just happened to come over before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay. This is sooooooo exciting. MY best friend is participating in the GNOME SONG festival! What are you going to sing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwendolina's told me not to prepare anything. It seems gnomes never practise singing beforehand. They just get together the day of the concert, and the band passes thought waves to the singer, and the singer sings. I'm nervous, I've never sung live on stage before unless I know the song forward, backward and sideways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do okay. Sheesh. This is soooooo ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ... exciting. It's not. It's nerve-wracking, from where I'm standing.\"</span></div></div>",

Especially when you know they send out hunting parties, rid themselves of traitors, and burn anyone who wanders near the village if they have no reason to come here in the first place. But today was the day you sneak out of the village and leave, you were planning on either going and blending in with the elves, visiting the humans or going to a mixed race town, it would be hard to blend in with the shorter races or the orcs.<br>\r\n   So far you knew that the hunting parties came back when they have been gone for 5 hours, they were the town's best defense, not only defense obviously but as a race with a huge target on its back we were feared and rightly so.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Currently I was waiting, waiting for the hunting party to pass me by, 'So I can head to the settlement, they had a huge security and although they would let me in, most likely they would follow me until I break the law.' Being fine with that I finally smirk to myself, the time draws cloaser and here comes the hunting party. But one of them stopped by the tree I was on, I slip behind it, I was always the best hider after all and the drow looked back. The one who looked back was a drow who always seemed to ignore me but it was very obvious, I am sure everyone knew he judged me the most, you could see it in his face after all.<br>\r\n   Leaping off the tree I looked at the sun and saw it was early morning, just making sure this would work, I would arrive sometime early afternoon. I reach down and grab a special herb growing and using a knife I brought I cut it open. You are probably now wondering what I brought, I brought bread, a small knife for necessity, a pouch filled with special magic, and a book filled with various spells, a bow would be nice but I was trying to bring less things, I don't want to seem hostile at all. Then I use the plant and fold it's leaves over before washing it in water, then I grind it with a normal stone and it turns into a creamy color, I gather a quantity as large as I can before covering all my skin with it using a magic to manipulate it to cover my skin with the least amount, the only way for it to come off is if I release my magic, or if someone hits me with lightning magic. Although it was easy to hide if I am using my magic since it is on my skin I could blend it like someone would blend their magic presence.<br>\r\n   I forgot, I am Faireal but my age is that of an 8 year old, the earlier I leave, the easier it will be for the other villages to accept me and not try to cause me trouble. I use my excess speed to dash forward as I sense for anything within a radius of 1(you can decide mile or kilometer). I soon come across a cart being attacked by some weird bird like monster, but the cart was being protected by mercenaries of some kind, I think some people called them adventurers or explorers or something? It looks like they can't defeat it very well and its call soon makes room for its family to come, three kids and a bigger bird arrive, they were having trouble on the mom, how can they beat a family of that monster? I run forward pulling out the book I brought and flipping through the pages, I forgot how to perform the grounding spell because I didn't need to. I find it thanks to the person who organized this book and use the mana flow to complete the sequence before I cause all of the birds to hit the ground rendering their wings useless by spell, they had trouble moving around, its not like I added gravity, no I connected them to the ground, it was a spell created to increase the effect of a wall built to keep people out.<br>\r\n   I begin to keep heading for the village but the cart driver yells for me to wait as the mercenaries finish the bird monsters. Though I probably shouldn't call them mercenaries, \"Thank you little miss but is it okay for a little one like you to wander around here even if you are strong? I see you heading to the same place as us so do you want to come?\" The man says as I put away my book and stare at him woth doubt and confusion. I nod and he continues, \"Great, now before we head off are you an adventurer?\" I shake my head no, it was kind of that way because I was from Dal Armos Valley from the west but I try not to tell them that. At one point they ask if I have money for the tax to get in but when I shake my head no they look at each other and each hand me a small coin, I don't know the currency so I just accepted it and went along woth them. Later on we reached the town and made a smooth transition inside the town, it was crowded, this was the so-called \"melting pot\" of the races except drows who're known as evil.<br>\r\n   I see other races like <b>Beastfolk</b>:beastfolk are a peaceful race, they will only be hostile if you pose a threat to their people like the humans did hundreds of years ago but they sorta made amens since then. They have great physical strength and magic, their abilities are great but you won't see them making the greatest weapons or inventing anything beyond common day stuff. The reason I am made fun of back at my old home <b>Fairies</b>: fairies are invisible and undetectable unless you are a good-hearted human, an elf, a drow, or a beastfolk, but most drows ignore them. They can't really lie and are very kind, the reason Drows ignore them is because they can't really help with physical labor and Drow has excellance in magic, Fairies also are more trouble to catch then to do anything with so they are just there. There are many races but I will just leave them for when they might become an important role I heard that an orc runs this town but I don't know more than that. I ask the cart driver what he thinks and he says that although it is sort of dangerous job, I would be able to be an adventurer because of my strength. I nod because he is older and the mercenaries allow me to follow them to the adventurer place whatnot, upon entering I see many people like the adventurers, the adventurers almost all in armor or at least equipped with something good. I go up to what looks like reception and ask for an adventurer card.<br>\r\n   They agree and show a blank card, I do as they instruct and place my hand on it and it fills out stuff like my name and age, then they ask me to use my blood to find out my optimal class, I do so and they mark things down before they give the card back to me. Then they call people down to me and I see a group of adventurers, a male and female human who were holding hands like they were friends, the female was some sort of mage and the guy was holding a really big shield which is why they stood out so much, he had a really big sword at his waist and he looked left-handed like I was. There was a male elf who seemed to be covered in many weapons all small or thin so he was probably quick fighter, he probably had magic too. There was a fairy flying in the middle of the group above their heads and the fairy was green with green clothing to match the glow. Seemed to wield a bow and wand so she was probably really skilled. Finally there was two female beastfolk, they looked similiar as one was a cat beastfolk and the other some sort of dog, probably a husky by the looks of it. The cat had two very thin swords, a staff for physical abilities but it had magical augmentation to be used for magic too, and she had a whip. The wolf-looking beastfolk also had twin swords but also had a big heavy sword, twin daggers, and gloves and the daggers had augmentation as well. This was a really skilled team, probably overly so.<br>\r\n   \"We have brought you a team to work with since you are so young, we don't want you to die off at such a young age so we have prepared this team for you and we hope you adjust to them well, these two\"she points to the human couple the male first, \"is Drew and Lila, the elf here is ghetsk, and the fairy is drola(yes, fairy named after drow and drow named after fairy, perfect idea) the beastfolk are cait(cat beastfolk) and wendy(wolf beastfolk), this here is Faireal and she is joining your group for now, take good care of her,\" I don't know why but she turned her head away from me and handed them a small letter when talking. She then turns to me and pats my head treating me like a child but I was fine with it because she mean't well and not many people would want to do that anyway. Then the team takes me to the a house they bought, it was like their base of operations and I had never seen these before so my mind was blown.<br>\r\n   \"You will stay here while you are on this team and I hope you enjoy it Faireal.\" Lila says to me, I nod happily and walk around in curiosity. What I didn't know was they knew I was a drow and they had a really high skilled team watch me to make sure I didn't do any evil deeds, the letter said so, they read it and burned it. My new life was only beginning</span></div></div>",

I shut it out of my mind as I was kind of confused about it and Lila separates from her boyfriend to help me with these things while Drew searches around for something else probably a gift for Lila. <br>\r\n   \"So do you want to have a mock battle so I can find your fighting preference?\" I try to shake my head no but Lila is already dragging me to a wide open space despite what I would say and she moves to the other side, \"I'll let you make the first move then.\" I look down before looking back up to fight, fighting is not my favorite thing to do but that is alright then, I run forward and cast three magic at the same time, another reason people payed no attention to me was because I was a prodigy very skilled and they wanted to make me grow faster, they even named me after fairies. I first use a speed enhancement, then I cast a dizzy status-causing technique which has no effect but before the dizzy takes effect I cast the third, lightning-attributed dome to trap the opponent by wrapping around them.<br>\r\n   The dizzy spell fails because of a forcefield and the lightning just surrounds the dome stopping before Lila looks surprised in more ways then one. Then she releases the dome and jumps over the lightning binds before castinga powerful water cannon spell causing a huge torrent of seemingly endless water to course through the air to me, \"You have to fight your opponent not distract them, and defend to even if you are good at your magic you need certain magic for it to work!\" I shake at that and fall over in fear as I look above me and where I once stood water gushes through, if I got hit the force enough could more than easily kill me. I roll over and cast the lightning bind twice but before I make the spell move I cast a lightning bolt and throw it forward, its power was not that powerful but it causes damage over time by continuosly overcharging it.<br>\r\n   She smiles and the forcefield she recreates is destroyed by the lightning bolt and then I throw both of the two spells I held back and it wraps around her but before it restricted her she throws her staff to me and the staff is wrapped with my own lightning!!! I get hit on the side of the face and roll along the ground a few times. When I get up my right cheek is uncovered from the special cream and I look scared, Lila looks at me sad, I sneak my right hand into my pouch and cover it in cream, \"Are you a drow?\" She whispers to me looking shocked but the entire team is bad liars they knew I was a drow.<br>\r\n   \"Nonono, this is dirt...\"I rub my face with the cream and use magic to electrocute my right hand which cleaned it to make it look like dirt, to make my own skin look like dirt, I was truly sad and Lila probably could see the sadness in my eyes. I then clap my hands together completely hiding my skin and use Earth magic to make it look like dirt fell from my hand.<br>\r\n   She sighs and smiles, \"Phew, I was worried for a second there, now lets get you a weapon you look like you could be great with weapons if you tried it but you probably have no weapons so it might be hard, there is no worries on that matter.\" Then she sees me raise my hand politely but I look awkward like I have never been polite before.<br>\r\n   \"What if I try all the weapons, I could tell you if a weapon doesn't suit me if the situation occurs.\" Lila was surprised and smiles because I was talking more, she was able to discover how bad of a liar I was and she liked my suggestion, luckily the shop clerk saw it was for me and decided to give me a beginners discount. We ended up discarding the basic sword design because it had no special traits like many other weapons and we discarded the axe because I kept launching the end when swinging because I would either drop it because the odd heavy end weakening the grip of the blade itself. But we kept the thin sword and big sword designs, we also agreed that a small hatchet would be worth keeping too because it was more usable. Lila proposed that I could be a more all around adventurer but over all I had trouble using my strength in a full attack, I would always miss, hold back, or divert the damge so I could never fully inflict a full attack on anything, not even a punching bag or target. Lila smiles to this and when Drew returns she mouths words to him out of my view so I couldn't tell what she was saying(mouthing).<br>\r\n   After Drew runs ahead Lila faces me, \"Now lets go surprise them!\" We walk towards the base slowly and it seems like it is calmer and more serene than before, and it looked much more pretty. Drola welcomed me in and everyone was smiling except Drola and Ghetsk, Ghetsk could probably tell I was a drow because he is an elf and all of that but why was Drola so serious looking, she was probably one of the most serious out of them all.<br>\r\n   \"So how did it turn out?\"Drola asks her seriousand strict voice showing.<br>\r\n   \"This new member is very strong, she even has talent with many of the weapons, most of the weapons, nearly all!\" I smile lightly and I don't see Lila make a triple wink. Ghetsk looks surprised but it was probably from the triple wink that I didn't see, I assumed it was actually from my talent so I make a light bow to show respect since he is an elf and a senior one at that, at least compared to me he seems like it.<br>\r\n   Drola the fairy makes a tensed up sigh and smiles slightly but the strict atmosphere didn't go away, \"Ok, then we will try a mission, I think it would be better if we did it at night-\"everyone begins to groan but the fairy releases a shockwave which knocks everyone to the ground she targeted except me, Ghetsk, and Drew because we didn't groan, and drew was tough enough for it with his high defense. \"I hope you can assist us in this mission too little miss Faireal.\" She makes a smile and it was obvious she was talking to a kid before her face goes plain and she flies back on up in the air.<br>\r\n(What Faireal doesn't know is that Lila judged her as trustworthy enough and that everyone knows Lila is special in that she is very skilled at reading emotions but they will act somewhat the same until later when they know more of Faireal and they become really close, this is how the story of an outcast becomes more than just a hero. How someone who can't fit in, finds a way to fit everywhere bringing entire races together and starting new adventuers.)<br>\r\n   A single male drow was searching around and did not find that little outcast drow, the drow only remembers the name was fairy or for real or something. It didn't matter as he remembered her face, he flashbacks to the time when leader told him to go train her, she was strong and she was continuosly challenged over and over so she could be raised up to crush the other races, she was born and tested on and she was compatible, she is the most compatible in centuries for the execution of others and to create extinction throughout the continent, no the world! She was a weapon in it of itself and she could wipe out the planet if she was trained well enough, she could do it whenever she wanted and no other drow could train her except him. The flashback ends and he smiles, he would be the one to wield the most powerful weapon in the world and he could raise it like he wants all because he became strong, he took a journey from the weakest to the strongest and now he can control something more powerful then the world, his life was hard but it was all worth it, the drow \"soul\" raised by the monsters of the West would conquer the world. Now all he had was the scent of her mana, he had a special ability to trace mana as long as they use it, although he would travel less than half the speed so it would take 4 or 5 days he would retrieve the girl whether he wanted to or not, he gets on a horse and sets off as soon as he stocks up, he had no time to waste.</span></div></div>",
