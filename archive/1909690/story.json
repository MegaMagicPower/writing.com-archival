I had a normal job with a normal life, no real enemies but no real friends either, I was just a man in the background. That was, at least until I woke up one morning to find myself in what could have only been described as hell. The sky was dark with threatening clouds and the numerous streaks of lightning was all that lit the world around me. What I was able to see were rows upon rows, stacks upon stacks of humans in strange containers, all hooked up to tubes and wires. That was when I realized I was one of them, hooked up the same way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to scream but something was in my mouth, pushed deep into my throat. I reached up to pull it out but gave another silent scream as I saw that my hand was covered in metal pieces that covered all of my joints like a strange form of armor. <i>\"What happened to me!?\"</i> panicked, I thought. <i>\"Where the hell am I!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something out of a science fiction nightmare rose into my field of vision. It was round with several metal arms with pincer like hands reaching up from under it with what looked like a jet pack on its opposite end. <b>\"Fear not, subject 217.\"</b> in a robotic voice, the machine said. <b>\"What you are experiencing is real but you are in no danger at this time.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, one of the robot pincers reached out and pulled the long tube out of my throat and mouth, causing me to cough. It then pulled me forward and removed a number of wires and tubes out of my back before lifting me out of the strange liquid filled container. The outside air was cold and I was naked, shivering from it and from utter terror. I looked down at myself and found that I had been somehow modified with robotic implants, making me much like a real cyborg. The machine turned its red glowing eyes, all ten of them, onto me. <i>\"Subject 217, if you resist, you will drop twenty two hundred feet to your death.\"</i> with an uncaring tone, the machine said. <i>\"It is recommended that you cooperate.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and gulped, seeing how truly high I was then turned back to the machine. \"Who are you?\" fearfully noticing my new robotic voice, I asked. \"What do you want with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may refer to us as master.\" without hesitation, the machine said. \"We want you to destroy the mutant infestation within the Matrix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The matrix?\" confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you have called reality.\" moving away from the towering stacks of humans, the machine replied. \"Your reprogramming sequence will begin shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reprogramming?\" gulping, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*This must not come to pass.*</i> came a new voice in my head. <i>*You must resist and escape.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was really confused and on the verge of losing it completely. <i>\"How am I supposed to escape when I'm being held twenty two hundred feet above a hellish world!?\"</i> panicked, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Look down.*</i> came the response. <i>*When I say 'now' swing up and kick the collector module, hard.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and saw a strange ship flying under us, coming close to being almost directly under my feet. Although I was terrified, anything was better than being taken somewhere to have my brain fried and scrambled by some bucket of bolts. <i>*NOW!!*</i> came the mysterious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swung my feet up and kicked the collection module as hard as I could. The robot arms released me and I landed onto the ship just as it passed right below me. \"Okay, now what!?!\" shaken, I asked out loud.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had brown hair and electric blue eyes. This was the first time I got a look at the room I was in. It seemed to be the cargo lounge for the ship. There were two other people on the ship. One was a red headed woman with blue eyes, the other was a girl with long brown hair and blond highlights. Neither of them were armed, but as I looked at them, some writing came across my vision, too fast for me to read it. Nothing came up when I looked at the guy with the gun. \"But what is it? Where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Stephen Jones,\" I said, steadily, not wanting to startle anyone into shooting me \"Until earlier today, I was just an accountant, nothing special.\"<br>\r\n\"Nobody that could be missed,\" said the red head, her voice pitying \"You've been used your whole life for this very purpose, to be turned into what you are now, a weapon for the machines, you've been set up for this from the start Stephen Jones.\"<br>\r\nThe red head's voice sounded almost pitying. \"Put your gun down, Nathan, if he had wanted to kill you, he would have done it by now.\" <br>\r\nThe man, Nathan, didn't seem happy about it, but he lowered his gun. <br>\r\n\"One wrong move, Jones,\" he said \"And you're dead.\" <br>\r\nI nodded \"Can anyone tell me what the hell is going on?\" <br>\r\n\"Ah wish we could,\" said the brown haired girl \"But we're as stumped as you are.\"<br>\r\nAs I looked at her, the writing came up next to her again <br>\r\nName: Marie<br>\r\nMutant Name: Rogue<br>\r\nMutant Power: Absorption of life force through skin to skin contact.

A tall male, possibly of Chinese descent, is standing in the doorway. <br>\r\n\"Ghost,\" he said \"I come from Captain Nyobi, its time to go.\" <br>\r\nYou nodded, and left with him. You had just made it out of the room and down the corridor, when someone knocked on your door. You turned to look.

The wires were coming free. The water drained as you fell through a tube downwards into darkness. When you came to again, you were lying on a bed in a room by yourself. <br>\r\nYou heard a hissing sound and the door to your room opened. Ghost was standing in the doorway. <br>\r\n\"Nyobi wants to see you,\" he said, motioning for you to follow him. You stood up, and immediately your legs buckled and you fell to the ground. Ghost caught you before you landed. <br>\r\n\"Careful,\" he said \"You'll find a lot of things difficult for a few weeks, your still adjusting to being in the real world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned on Ghost as he led you to a strange room. Nyobi turned from one of the controls in the room and smiled at you. It was the smile that told you that she wasn't sure what to tell you. <br>\r\n\"You look well,\" said Nyobi \"I'll just get straight to the point, the Matrix we found you in isn't the same one we came from.\"<br>\r\n\"You told me in that Matrix that there was only one,\" you said <br>\r\n\"So we thought, apparently, there are overlaps with the two programs,\" said Nyobi \"We would never have found the second one if it wasn't for you.\" <br>\r\n\"You haven't really told me what this Matrix is yet,\" you said \"All you said was it was some sort of computer program, but how can that be, it felt so real?\"<br>\r\n\"The mind makes it real, it would be easier to show you,\" said Nyobi \"Ghost, plug him in.\" <br>\r\nGhost led you to a chair, sat you down and shoved something into a hole at the back of your neck. You had found several of these when you had woken up. <br>\r\nYou found yourself standing in a street with Nyobi. You felt the air on your face, heard the sound of cars going past and saw what you believed to be your world. But now you knew the truth. This was a computer program. <br>\r\n\"But this isn't the Matrix you found me in?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"This isn't even the Matrix,\" said Nyobi \"This is one of our programs.\" <br>\r\n\"What do you know about the Matrix you found me in?\" you asked <br>\r\n\"Not much,\" replied Nyobi \"All we know that it's sort of an experimental area, the machines wanted to find out how to get more power from you.\" <br>\r\n\"From me?\" you asked \"How would they get power from me?\" <br>\r\n\"That's why the Matrix was created,\" said Nyobi \"To get power from human beings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyobi clicked her fingers, and the scene around you changed. You were standing about 500 ft above the ground. Around you were thousands of pods, each one containing a human being. <br>\r\n\"Because we know so little about this second Matrix, we want to go in and take a look, but we need your help,\" said Nyobi \"Your brain holds the key to the second Matrix frequency, we used a second program to find it in your head while i was talking to you, don't worry, it's completely harmless to you.\" <br>\r\n\"That's an invasion of privacy,\" you say, feeling hurt \"You tricked me, you wouldn't have been able to run that program without my cooperation, you could have just asked me, you know, I would have helped you willingly.\" <br>\r\n\"As convincing as that sounds, I couldn't take that risk,  i don't completely trust you yet, you are an anomaly that came from an anomaly, I don't know how you crossed over from your Matrix to ours, but it makes you special, I would like your assistance if you would give it when we go in, first, we need to train you, you'll need this training to survive in either Matrix.\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

A red haired girl with piercing blue eyes nodded and went into the next room. <br>\r\n\"I think i've figured out where the Matrix overlaps,\" said Ghost \"They all seem to be centered around a single person plugged into the second Matrix.\" He held up a piece of paper that showed a brown haired girl in a red costume. <br>\r\n\"Wanda Maximoff, also known as the Scarlet Witch, she has the power to manipulate reality to an unspecified extent, I think that her manipulation of reality may have caused the Matrixes to overlap,\" Ghost explained \"I think you should go in, with us as backup, to get her out.\" <br>\r\n\"Why do I need to go?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"You know your world better than we do,\" said Nyobi \"We probably can't get in without your help.\" <br>\r\n\"We'll have to get you trained, then,\" said Jane from next to you. You jumped, you hadn't heard her come back in. You turned and accepted the cup from her. Looking at the strange, yellow liquid, you raised your eyebrows questioningly at her. <br>\r\n\"It's part of our field kit,\" said Jane \"It doesn't taste very nice, but it'll keep you sustained for the day.\" <br>\r\nYou sipped the drink experimentally. A foul taste came onto your tongue. You tried not to gag, and swallowed the liquid. Despite the foul tasting liquid, you immediately felt much stronger than you had before drinking it. <br>\r\n You turned to Jane and said \"Thank you\" <br>\r\nIt was at this time that you had a proper look at Jane. She was a very attractive girl. Average sized breasts and but, quite long legs, and a beautiful smile. Her long red hair and blue eyes completed the look. You handed her the cup and smiled at her. She smiled back. </span></div></div>",

The ship faded from sight as another room took it's place. It looked like a Japanese dojo, windows around the room letting in light. <br>\r\n\"Let's see if that training paid off,\" said Jane, taking a battle stance. You took your own battle stance, and got ready for a fight. She moved so fast, you didn't even catch her movement, but in a second of the start of the fight, you were on the ground. Jane's fist was coming down on your face. You rolled out of the way, bringing your legs round to try to trip her up. She jumped into the air, to avoid it, but by then, you had stood up. Jane put her hand up, signalling you to stop. <br>\r\n\"How did I beat you?\" she asked you \"I am far smaller, and weaker than you are.\"<br>\r\n\"You're too fast,\" you say, panting from the intense fight. <br>\r\n\"Do you think that my being faster, or stronger has any bearing on me in this place?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that you can manipulate the program?\" you ask, guessing. Jane smiled<br>\r\n\"You catch on real fast,\" she said, impressed \"The Matrix has all the basic rules of the real world, things like gravity, air and light, but these rules are like a computer program, some of them can be bent, while others can be broken.\" <br>\r\n\"How do I bend the rules?\" you asked<br>\r\nJane smiled. \"Focus,\" </span></div></div>",

You followed Jane. <br>\r\nYou climbed the ladder to the top of the ship. Nyobi and Ghost were already there, staring at what remained of what looked like a large, metallic jellyfish.

On the other side of the first man was a man wearing a red suit with a hemispherical helmet. <br>\r\nYou heard a series of clicks as the humans behind you leveled their guns at the man. <br>\r\n\"Who are you, how did you get here, and why did you draw us into this trap?\" said Nyobi, barely containing her anger and frustration at being led right into a trap. <br>\r\n\"Come now,\" said the man in the suit of armor \"Surely you humans can be civilized.\" Nyobi cocked her gun. The man sighed. \"Very well, Quicksilver?\"<br>\r\nThe blue costumed man moved so fast none of them saw it, but by the time he was back at the suit guy's side, he had disarmed every single one of Nyobi's crew. <br>\r\n\"Now, perhaps we can strike a deal, If I answer one of your questions, you shall answer one of mine,\" said the suit man. <br>\r\n\"It's not as if we have much choice,\" said Nyobi, resigning herself to the inevitable \"Who are you?\" <br>\r\n\"I am Magneto, Master of Magnetism, leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants,\" said the man in the suit of armor \"This is my son, Quicksilver, and my lieutenant, Mystique.\" The guy in the blue costume stepped forward. The other man's features blurred, and he changed, becoming a blue girl with red hair and yellow eyes. <br>\r\n\"Now, may I inquire who you are?\" said Magneto, politely. <br>\r\n\"Captain Nyobi,\" said Nyobi \"I'm the captain of this ship, this is Ghost, my second in command, Jane, and our newest recruit (your name)\" <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Magneto \"Now that wasn't so hard, ask your next question.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you from the other Matrix?\" asked Nyobi<br>\r\n\"If you mean the world we were sealed in for so long, then yes, we are from the other Matrix,\" said Magneto \"What is this?\" Magneto indicated the destroyed Sentinel on the ground. <br>\r\n\"We call them Sentinels,\" said Ghost, you noticed that the Brotherhood, as Magneto referred to them, tensed up at the name \"They were created for a single purpose, to search and destroy all of the free humans, but they haven't found us yet.\" <br>\r\n\"The irony or this situation is not lost on me,\" said Magneto, and when the humans looked confused, he expanded \"There were similar machines created within our own Matrix, created to destroy mutants.\"<br>\r\n\"We have freed the minds of many humans that were plugged into the other Matrix,\" said Nyobi \"Will you give us your aid to free the people connected to your Matrix?\"  </span></div></div>",

Yes, a splinter group of machines has formed, creating the mutant Matrix in order to draw from their own pool of power. They've created a new breed of Sentinels, far more powerful than the last. They're attacking everyone without distinction: mutants, humans, machines, everyone. Nothing can stand in their way. Except you.\" <br>\r\n\"What can I do that the combined forces of humans, mutants and machines can't do better?\" you asked <br>\r\n\"Give them something to believe in,\" said Destiny \"Very recently, a catastrophe known in this Matrix as M-Day stripped most mutants of their powers. Many of the remaining X-Men believe that there is a person called the Mutant Messiah, who will come from the future to save them. They are wrong. The Mutant Messiah is not in the future, she is in the real world. If you find her, and bring her back, the X-Men will rally behind her. Neo has some sway over the losing machine faction, he will bring their representative to the negotiation table. The Mutant Messiah will be the representative for the mutants, and Neo will represent the humans. As someone who has connections to both worlds and the machines, you will act as a neutral party.\"  </span></div></div>",

The result of this experimentation resulted in mutant powers. The experimental division was cornered off when the mutant powers went out of control and the Matrix shut down. You are either a mutant waking up after the Matrix shut down, or one of the human resistance who discovers the experimental division. Because of the experimentation, mutants have their powers inside the Matrix. In the real world, their powers may change slightly. e.g, Rogue might absorb powers by touch in the Matrix, but in the real world, she just copies powers by proximity to other mutants. It is also possible that the mutants powers won't work in the real world at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo swearing<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\nNo vivid description of blood and gore</td>",
