Or I was suppose to start middle school next school year.  That is what I thought when 5th grade ended June 14th.  6th grade was suppose to start August 22nd, a Monday, the week before Labor Day.  I was expecting to have a great summer goofing off with my friends and family.  What else could a kid do but to goof off.  But, now, I'm not technically a kid anymore and is expected to 'act like what I look like'  by the time summer is over, by everyone, including my parents and siblings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat am I suppose to do now?  with how I have changed.  People just think it is normal on how I changed but I still think it is weird.   </span></div></div>",

After a couple of drinks she thought Shawndy would also lighten up, but instead her emotions started to pour out, just like vodka from the bottle. Tears flowing as she drowned her sorrows into the words of the music.<br>\r\n \"Shawndy, common and dance. You can't be sad for getting rid of such a horrible person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm not, but I can't seem to stop crying. I thought this would be a good time and it's turning out to be horrible. I don't think mixing booze with emotions are a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to talk over the music without yelling didn't stop the two young men from ease dropping even if it were the odd word here and there. The blonde guy rose up to the occasion and thought this would be a great time to dig his heals into a dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but I couldn't help but over hear your sad story. Your beautiful. Who ever this guy was let him stay there, you young lady need to rise above it. Come on let's dance and then I would love to buy you a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawndy looked at Jennifer with a questionable gawk. She wiped her tears and without realizing grabbed the guy's hand allowing him to lead her to the dance floor.<br>\r\nJennifer swept her hand forward telling her silently to go for it. She sat back down and ordered herself another drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put that on my bill please. This one is on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked up and met the most gorgeous blue eyes she had ever seen. She was shocked and not in a bad way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to join us at our table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" What else could she say when her body was being lured by such a handsome creature.</span></div></div>",
