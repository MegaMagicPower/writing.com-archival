When you get downstairs she hands you a plate of Eggs and Bacon. \"I gotta go to work today a little early will you be okay by yourself?\" She says while drinking her morning coffee. \"Ya I'll be fine, What time will you be back?\" you ask. \"Oh I should be back around 8-9, depends on if Darlene shows up or not, well I love you and behave!\" she begins to walk out the door but quickly turns around. \"Oh hey! I just bought that lamp over there on shelf, could you shine it for me? The man at the shop said it was an antique lamp from persia or something...\" She asks quickly while walking backwards goin toward the door. \"Ya, Whatever...\" you reply Grunting cause you just woke up. Your mom walks out the door blowing you a kiss. You stand up and walk toward the shelf holding the lamp. \"Might as well get it done now rather then later eh?\" you say to yourself. You begin to rub the lamp with you sleeve when you look in the spout a huge gust of dust shoots at your face and into your eyes. You drop the lamp and rub your eyes in pain, When you open them you see the most beautiful woman you've ever seen. \"My names Merissa and I am a Genie, You got 3 wishes so make'em count, Oh and I don't bring people back from the dead nor do I kill people\". You just stand ther jaw dropped at amazement of the woman in front of you. \"Well, you gonna make a wish or what? You only got your lifetime!\"</span></div></div>",

They killed everyone around me, my mother, my father, the neighbor children all of the towns adults and most of the children.  They took eight of us myself, my little two year old sister Drehna, and six other girls from the village the oldest was the village drunks daughter, loosely speaking of course, she was 12 there was one younger than Drehna and everyone else fit some where between.  Anyway they bound us and blind folded us and threw us over their shoulders.  They didn't let us free until we got there.  They fed us themselves, they guided us to take care of our needs, but other wise carried us except when they slept.  They smelled terrible.  3494 years later I still remember their smell and the look of them.  The look of those men, you're young so I do not hate you, but if you looked like them not even the power that binds me could keep me from killing you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then we arrived in a city some where surrounded by sand on three sides and water on the fourth.  We were carried through loud streets with strange sounds and brought to the house.  They left us there, we weren't bound, we could hardly move from not moving for months.  Then there was an old man, he's hazy in my mind, I'm not even sure man is the right term for it.  He tried to be very kind to us, was actually.  He let us rest, and bathe, and eat to our hearts content.  We ran about on the beach much of the days and soaked in seeing.  We loved seeing again after months of being blind.  But there were things that were wrong.  Mainly with Drehna and the other young ones.  Drehna was having trouble learning to walk because of the journey and some of the other girls around her age were having trouble learning to talk.  He said he had the solution, he did in fact.  He took us into the house and into a cavern in the back.  He guided us through long passage ways, not all at once one at a time as the need arose, and brought us to this deep cavern with a sudden cliff and beyond it something,\" she pauses here and gets a special look in her eye, a really wonderful look, \"beautiful.\"  I can hardly describe it, but it instilled in us healing, we understood hows and whats and a lot of whys, even a handful of whens.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Every night beginning with the first after looking into It, we began to feel week though, our heads would be racked with pain like fire and electricity and drowning and stabbing, but He was prepared he had vessels for us 8 of them, lamps like the one you found me in.  Every night we transformed ourselves into a form that could be in the lamp and every morning we left it and ran about in the world learning about the wonders we could perform.

She giggles as her eyes reach a point where they are level with your own and her hand is now just a hair smaller than your own.  Then you're looking at her nose and her great full lips as they brush past your view she kisses your forehead and you turn your eyes up to her face.  A hand comes down up to bring your head back forward then pushes it into her growing breasts which are now level to your head and about its size.  \"If we shall be together 13000 years you should know I have needs that have never been met except, well when you're alone as long as I was you get to know things It doesn't say about you.\"  As she says this her breasts pass from view, but her night gown has risen much higher than it used to and is beginning to tear from her immense size.

Your grip loosens though and her stomach rises above you as a tear stretches across the cloth covering her abdomen.  You place a hand on either hip and one of her hands, now much larger than your own, reaches down and pushes you into her pussy, but a moment to late as it rises over your head, higher and higher.  Her powerful thighs stretch around you and then her knees pass above you.

You try three more times each time yelling a little louder to no avail, until finally on the 6th yell as you stand before the wall of her massive littlest toe at least hundreds of feet larger than you she jumps a little realizing her mistake.  You keep yelling as the toes get bigger and bigger and then as the curve of her toes seems as far away as high above as the sun, thunder echoes \"oh, that might do.\"  Finally as she stands a massive testament to her power with you dwarfed by her cells she stops as she hears you yell.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too big?\"</span></div></div>",

I'm so sorry.

Well...what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...for starters, you can give me back my clothes\", Merissa said.<br>\r\n\"Why? I kinda like you like this\", Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Master Jake...please!\" Merissa whimpered.<br>\r\n\"And that's not helping...Alright, alright...let's see here\", you mutter to yourself, \"I wish you were wearing a shrunken bra\".<br>\r\nMerissa snapped her fingers and her bra lifted into the air, proceeded to shrink to her size, and flew straight towards her at incredible speed. Slowing before it reached her, Merissa grabbed it and quickly put it on, Jake smirking as he saw her naked chest as she put the top on.<br>\r\nBlushing furiosly, but continuing to hide her crotch, Merissa said, \"Okay, and now Master Jake?\"<br>\r\nJake pondered for a bit, \"You know...I'm still pretty mad about you shrinking me down without telling me. So, I'm gonna do something that'll make me feel better\".<br>\r\n\"Moreso than shrinking me as well, Master Jake?\" Merissa said, her voice trembling.<br>\r\n\"Exactly\", Jake said, \"So...instead of your genie pants and underwear, I wish for you to wear...</span></div></div>",

It's kind of exciting!\" Merissa bit her lip at the new found excitement she has been faced with, not even herself knowing where this came from, \"You can just feel the adventure!\" Merissa grabbed Jake's right hand forcing it to her right breast. Shocked by the gesture, but gladly accepting the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his left hand to her left breast, wanting to enjoy both equally. They were as big as a dream, and soft as a pillow.

To which Merissa looked at him quizzically, not even sure if such a thing would work herself, but unable to prevent herself from granting her Master's wish with a snap of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge magical, but futuristic looking ray gun popped up out of thin air. Jake and Merissa stared up at the massive machine, noticing two huge buttons on it's side, \"Shrink\" and \"Grow\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was satisfied that the raygun was just what he wished for, but then glared at his genie for making it far too big for either of them to use. Merissa noticed his glare, and giggled ashamedly. Jake thought for a moment that she still had a defiant streak to her, but was willing to let it slide if this worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still up to your old tricks, are you?\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Master.

Jake promptly walked over to the reduced re-size ray and picked it up. He looked it over again, glad to see that the controls appeared to be simple. When all of a sudden, Merissa ran over to and hugged him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Master? Did I do good?\" Merissa asked, sounding desperate for his approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Jake said.

He turned around and saw the it was only Merissa who had been effected by the re-size ray, not him! Jake gasped as he watched his genie grow back into a relative giantess before him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...\" Merissa gasped meekly. Her submissive shock was ironic to hear as her body grew to comparatively massive size. In seconds Merissa went from Jake's size all the way back to a height that made her appear normal sized to the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she stopped growing at a normal height, Merissa immediately looked back down to her miniscule Master. She gasped as she saw how small he once again looked to her, she liked how cute her mini Master looked and wanted to pick him up right away, but she thought better of it, knowing it would likely only anger Jake. Instead, she decided to drop to her hands and knees in a pleading motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Master! I don't know what happened!\" She apologized profusely, bowing to her tiny Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Jake shouted in frustration. He was not sure if he should trust the genie's words. For all he knew, Merissa had planned this from the start. \"But why didn't it work on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I don't know!\" Merissa whispered to the shrunken man. She paused, \"Wait! Maybe it's because the Re-size Ray was made from genie magic? So it's basically the same as using a wish on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Jake was upset by this logic, but couldn't figure out why it wouldn't be working on him otherwise. \"Well, crap. Looks like this is useless...\" Jake tossed the Re-size Ray away. He then looked up at his giantess genie and shouted, \"Well! Looks like you're going back down to size, Merissa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa gasped at this. She knew Jake still had the power to control her own size, and she wanted to please him, even if that meant shrinking at his whims. But she had to admit she liked being the bigger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" She pleaded. Jake hesitated, but folded his arms and gave her some time to speak. She stood up to her full size, towering over her mini Master. Even from far above him, Merissa knew he didn't like her actions, and spoke quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, please let me keep my current size! Think about it...\" She suggested, snapping her fingers and making Jake instantly appear in her hand. He was shocked by her use of her powers, but settled into her hand. \"Having me be your giantess slave would be much better than me being smaller, don't you think? I can carry you like this and help out around the house! Uhm, at least until we figure out a way to restore your size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done?\" He asked rhetorically, but Merissa nodded anyway. \"You make an interesting case, Merissa, so...\"</span></div></div>",

It felt amazing, and you could feel yourself heating up. Apparently your new body was also very sensitive. You attempted to say something to get her to stop, but couldn't. It must have been more than just a physical change. After another few minutes, Merissa pulls her hands back. \"We're going to have some fun tonight...\" She whispers in your ear before stepping backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to grant her another three wishes before you could undo this?

I would have just left it on and dealt with it until you made those three wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at Merissa out of the side of your eyes. \"I can't live like this.\" you explain simply before flicking the ring toward the genie. The ring made it halfway between the two of you before the golden band stopped. \"Annnnnnnnd....\" Merissa began. The ring suddenly rocketed back toward you, shifting in size and shape before striking your neck. Your head whipped back as you were knocked off your feet from the force of it. \"........trapped.\" Merissa finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Genie crossed the room, taking a knee beside you. \"We had a deal.\" She started, offering you a hand. You accept, Merissa helping you up. The golden band that had been on your finger was now around your throat. \"You tried to go back on it, and now you've gone head and broken it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If i broke it than why is this thing on my neck!?\" You shout, pulling at the golden choker. \"Simple.\" Merissa responded, placing her hands on her hips. \"you backed out of the deal, and now you have to pay the penalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" You speak, crossing your arms before your chest in resignation. \"Just make a wish so I can get on the road to undoing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish? Oh, you don't have powers anymore.\" Merissa explained. \"See, you broke the deal. Now you're mine, and I don't have to give you infinite wishes. So, former master, What's your second wish?

Let me run up to my room and fetch a magazine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the genie in your living room to run upstairs to your bedroom. When you enter, you're surprised to see Merissa sitting on your bed waiting for you, then remember that she's a genie and can probably do that sort of thing. You wonder why she didn't just teleport you up here with you, then think you'd probably have to wish for her to do that and you'd rather not have to choose a stipulation just for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have to dig very far in your stack of car magazines since the one you're looking for is right at the top. You grab it and take it to Merissa. You point to the cherry red Camaro on the cover, adorned with a busty brunette model wearing a red visor, red bikini top, cut-off jeans over a red thong whose straps are sticking out the top, and red high heels. Admittedly, you bought the magazine for the model as much as you did the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the kind of car I want,\" you tell Merissa. \"My dream car. This is what I'm wishing for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, Master,\" she nods. \"Let's go outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour excitement swells with each step as you walk down the stairs and out the front door as Merissa follows you. This is it! You're finally getting your perfect Camaro!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the both of you are at the driveway, Merissa steps forwards and snaps her fingers. You marvel as the car of your dreams pops into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God! It's really here! My dream car!\" you exclaim as you run around it, admiring the paint job and all the exterior details, opening the doors and checking out the interior, popping under the hood to see the powerful engine beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful! Thank you, Merissa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't thank me yet, Master,\" she says, almost tauntingly. \"There's still the matter of my stipulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to her and see that she's summoned her purse. She reaches within and draws out two coins. The purse disappears and she walks over to you, one of the coins in each hand. She holds the coins in her palm, and you see that one is decorated with a figure that seems to be changing size. The other looks has a female symbol on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin,\" she says, lifting up her hand with the size-changing figure coin, \"represents the following stipulation: however full the fuel tank is is directly proportional to your size when you exit the vehicle. If the tank is completely full, you'll be at full size. If it's half full, you'll be half size when you step out. I'll cap the smallest size you can possibly be as a result at 1 inch so you don't have to worry about what would happen if its empty. I'll also note that it has a full tank now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I would have to try to keep it topped off, I guess,\" you say. \"Okay. What's the alternative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin,\" she says as she lifts up her palm with the coin with the female symbol, \"represents the following stipulation: because I think the model on that magazine did such an excellent job posing with that car, I've come to think that she and that car are inseparable. By choosing this stipulation, I will turn you into a copy of that model. You'll have your face, though more feminine, and her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be at full size all the time, at least,\" you think. \"Will people recognize me as being me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Merissa answers. \"We'll just find out won't we? And if they don't, you can always wish for it to be the case!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Merissa cackles, you weigh your options and decide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could always wish it back, but that carried extra stipulations...so you'd take the risk with the other coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go with the first coin.\" you finally say, and Merissa feigns a frown. \"Aw... I was warming up to the idea of seeing you splayed out across the hood, like the magazine...but very well.\" With that, the coin with the female symbol vanishes, and with her thumb, she flicks the other coin into the air, as it begins to glow brilliantly in the sunlight, an effect you suspect Merissa did on purpose for theatrical purposes. Finally, it hits the ground, and with a loud, metallic TINK, it vanishes, leaving only what looks like glitter in its place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you realize that you feel exactly the same. \"That's it?\" you comment, looking over yourself for any changes. \"I don't FEEL any different...\" \"Like I said, Master.\" she begins, walking over towards your brand new car, \"...your size is now tied to the fuel tank. While you're outside of the car, anyway. And since it's full, you won't feel any different.\" With that, she opens the passenger car door, and slides in. \"Aren't we going to go for a drive in your new car, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to be asked again, and before you know it you're barrelling down the road, enjoying the sound and feeling of your brand new car. \"I'm impressed, master! Where did you learn to drive like this?\" Merissa asks...or rather, yells, in order to be heard over the roaring wind. Doing the same, you scream back \"I didn't! I don't have a license!\", as you continued to drive with reckless abandon. Not that that bothered you. You could do whatever you wanted...pretty much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your luck doesn't last long, and soon you have a cop on your tail, horns blaring. \"Shit...I must've gone over the speed limit...\" you mutter to yourself, glancing down at the speedometer, and realized that the little arrow thingy was currently hovering at the wide red area. Not good. Pulling to the side of the road, you shift the car into park, and sigh, slumping back into your chair. \"I'm totally going to jail for this...\" \"You <i>could</i> go to Jail for this... or you could make a wish and get out of it.\" Merissa said with a smile, holding two currently blank gold coins between her fingertips. You could wish your way out of this, couldn't you? Of course, that came with the stipulations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over towards the police car, you half expect a balding, middle-aged man to appear, but you're pleasantly surprised to see a cute blonde woman emerge, wearing a rather tight-fitting police uniform that shows her off nicely. \"She is pretty, isn't she, master?\" Merissa comments, watching the woman strut over towards you. \"If you want her, you could always make a <i>wiiiiish~</i>\"...</span></div></div>",

You'll become a girl, a female version of yourself. However, Officer Rebecca Benson will become Officer Robert Benson, a male version of herself. He'll still be pretty attractive and attracted to women.

'He's' just wanting to ask you about 'his' car club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's the other stipulation?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa holds up her right palm, which contains a coin that depicts the size changing figure once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I'm going to shrink even more when I leave the car?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this change won't be for you, Master,\" Merissa corrects you. \"You actually have a girlfriend, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, her name is Jackie,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where does she work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she was telling me she just got a part time job as a server at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of horror forms upon your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A server at Alberto's,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Merissa explains, \"this coin represents the following stipulation: she's going to see you and while you know that your dinner date won't be going anywhere romantic, she's not going to see it that way, no matter what you tell her. She'll be upset and will confront you. And each time you... or Rebecca... insist that there's nothing going on between the two of you, she's going to grow six inches in height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, not really wanting to face down an angry giantess girlfriend.

You press your number one contact and wait for her to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lover!\" Jackie says on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jackie,\" you say. \"Watcha doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting ready for work,\" she replies. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought you might be,\" you say. \"I just wanted to tell you that you might see me there today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" she says. \"Well, you know, I think I may not be allowed to be your server since they want us to avoid doing that with friends and family here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable,\" you say. \"The reason I'm letting you know about this is I was kind of invited there by a woman and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman?\" she says. \"Is it a date or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, it's not that. It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you hear Jackie exclaim on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Whoa?'\" you say. \"Is something wrong, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just felt weird for a second,\" she says. \"Anyway, you know, if you're on a date with someone, you don't have to lie about it. Like, we did agree this in an open relationship we're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you say. \"But like I said, it's not really a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know ahhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, feeling a little weird again, there,\" she replies. \"Anyway, I know you haven't really pursued anyone else besides me since we started dating, and to be honest, I haven't really had any other partners recently, but the terms of our agreement still stand. It's totally fine with me if you're on a date with someone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured that was still the case, but really, this is not a date we'll be on. We're just going to talk about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Jackie shouts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I don't know what's going on with me,\" Jackie says with a voice you notice seems to be a bit deeper. \"Anyway, what are you two going to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's,\" you say, before stopping yourself. \"You know, actually, I'll show you when I get there! It'll be a surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well,\" Jackie says, \"I am glad you told me about this date you're having before I saw you and whoever this other person is at the restaurant because I might have been upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't want you to get hurt or anything, even though, you know, it's really not a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, lover.I guess I'll ACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I think I'm going to try to lie down for a moment before I head in,\" Jackie says. \"I think I might be hallucinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow,\" you say. \"If you need anything, let me know. I'll be right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. See you later, babe. Love ya,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, too, Jackie. Be careful,\" you say to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this phone really this small?\" you think you hear Jackie mutter before she hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put your phone away, a huge grin stretches across your face as you turn to look at Merissa. You see her crossing her arms and legs and fuming at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this didn't go as you planned!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Merissa says. \"You'll pay on the next one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that's possibly a ways off,\" you say. \"My tank is still about 20% full and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Officer Rebecca Benson,\" Merissa interrupts, \"concerned about you and your car, has called in the highway patrol to monitor this road for drunk and otherwise reckless drivers. They are pulling over and checking everyone's license.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make that happen?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" she says as she removes an earpiece. \"This thing picks up police scanners. Anyway, the officers who've responded to the call are all men. I doubt you'd like to impress them the same way you wanted to try and impress Rebecca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could wish for you to teleport us home and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master,\" Merissa says, \"what good is this vehicle to you if you're not really allowed to drive it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Merissa, I wish I was a qualified and licensed driver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa snaps her fingers and a license appears, floating in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say as you grab the license and look it over. Everything about it looks legit, including the awful picture of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Merissa begins, but is interrupted by the sound of a beeping coming from your pants. You reach into your pocket and pull out your phone to check the text you just received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"called in to work. not going in. lying down right now. come by to show me ur surprise b4 ur date because I have a BIG one for you! <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and text back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok. not a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm choosing to think this could all be worth it,\" you tell Merissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin,\" Merissa says as she opens her left palm to reveal another coin with a size-changing figure, \"represents the following condition; this vehicle becomes 50% less fuel efficient. You know what that means, I assume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm at risk of becoming smaller faster AND I'll have to buy twice as much gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin,\" Merissa says as she opens up her right palm and reveals a coin bearing another size-changing figure, \"represents the following condition; Did I say Jackie would 'grow' each time you told her that you and Rebecca weren't on a date? I'm sorry. What I meant to say was that she would SHRINK each time you told her you weren't on a date with Rebecca!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if you chose this coin, Master,\" Merissa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might actually be cool with that, but I'd rather know she's safe,\" you say. \"At least she's lying down at home right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then this other coin here,\" Merissa says as she opens her other left palm to reveal another size-changing coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, a THIRD coin?\" you say. \"Wait, where on Earth did your third hand come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm magic!\" Merissa says with a sneer. \"And I have a Basic Membership or higher so I can add a third option without wasting time with a single coin that represents multiple choices that you'd have to keep cycling through if you chose it! Doesn't that sound annoying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost me after you said that you're magic,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Merissa says as her extra hand holds up the coin she's talking about. \"I'm just throwing in an extra choice because I want you to squirm right now. This coin represents the following stipulation: I'll undo the stipulation I had on your size-to-fuel-tank ratio, but the shrinking effect that you've been delaying by remaining inside the vehicle will take effect immediately. And just because you were being a smug asshole just now, I'll throw in a bonus; you'll receive a 50% greater shrinking effect than you would if you stepped outside right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your fuel gauge again do a quick calculation in your head. \"That means I'd shrink to 30% of my height,\" you say. \"I'd end up being... yikes, a little over 4 feet and 2 inches!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look on the plus side,\" Merissa says. \"Maybe your girlfriend won't notice since she's probably preoccupied with her own changes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to gulp. You and Jackie have shared size-changing fantasies with each other, but usually, only one of you is under some kind of effect. The other two choices would give you a chance to top off your tank before you visited Jackie so at least you could be at a normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you hold on to your hopes that this could all be worth it.</span></div></div>",

Curious, you reach into your pocket and pull out your phone to re-examine the text Jackie sent you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"called in to work. not going in. lying down right now. come by to show me ur surprise b4 ur date. it might be BIGGER than u think! <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel relieved that Jackie at least seems to not be scared about whatever her current stature is, but Merissa's words still sting. You at least ought to hurry over to see Jackie. You start your car and carefully begin to drive down the highway, using the new defensive driving skills that came with your wish that made you a qualified driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to town, you get stopped at a roadblock by officers from the highway patrol, as Merissa said might happen to you. You show them your license and they wave you on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Merissa,\" you say to the genie as she reappears in your passenger seat after you leave the roadblock, grateful that she warned you of what was to come. She nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to drive through town, as it seems like every red light is starting to conspire against you. You look at our fuel gauge as you get closer to Jackie's and see that your tank is now about 40% empty. Your now less reckless driving may have improved your fuel efficiency but having to idle at all these red lights hasn't helped. You do the math and figure that if you step outside your car now, you'll end up being somewhere over 3 and a half feet tall! You know there's a gas station up ahead that you can stop at to fill up your tank before you get to Jackie's. Then again, she might appreciate having you show up in a similar predicament to hers.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide it's probably better to be full size when you see Jackie, or at least as close to it as possible. You pull into the gas station's lot and drive over to the pumps, which are thankfully all available. You'd rather not have someone else see you while you're trying to fiddle with the pumps at your reduced size. Thankfully, this is a \"Pay After You Pump\" station, so you don't have to worry about how you cash or debit card would be sized when you're trying to pay for this. They are kind of slow to pump, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, if you need help with the pumps, I'll be happy to do it for you,\" Merissa offers as you come to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Merissa?\" you say as you turn towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Master!\" she says, adding with a laugh, \"Just wish for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage, Merissa, thanks,\" you say as you unbuckle your seat belt and open the door. You step out and brace yourself for the impending change, not sure how it's going to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach as you start to feel lightheaded. You look around as your surroundings seem to be growing larger all around you. Eventually, everything looks like they're almost, but not quite, twice as tall as you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa suddenly pops into your driver's seat, looks down at you, and asks, \"Are you surrrrre you don't need my help, my little Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it, Merissa,\" you say as you look around. \"I can still reach the nozzle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa's was hot before but she looks even hotter from this angle, you think to yourself as you grab the nozzle. Though you can reach it, it's a bit unwieldy given the current size of your hands. Had you gotten any smaller, you would have had to make a wish for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the pump started and open up the fuel tank. Though you just got this car, you're intimately familiar with it due to your obsessive study of it in your magazine, so you were able to pull it up so that the hatch was on the proper side of the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should have picked to be that model earlier instead, you think to yourself as you use both your little hands to squeeze the nozzle and start pumping gas. You didn't quite realize just how inconvenient the stipulation you chose could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gas starts to inject itself into your vehicle, you realize you're starting to creep back up to your original size, slowly but surely. It occurs to you as you notice your growth that the other stipulation might have had it's own problems as well. Would people have recognized you? Would you have been able to handle the extra attention you were sure to have gotten? Do you really want someone like Mr. Holtz, your perverted slob of a neighbor, staring at you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the four and a half foot mark, you hear a vehicle pull up on the other side of the pumps. You hear someone step out, but you don't give it any mind as you're lost in your train of thought. You release one of your hands as you no longer need both of them to keep the nozzle squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you figure that any stipulation Merissa offers is designed to inconvenience you, even those that seemingly don't affect you. Making Jackie shrink instead of yourself might put the burden on her for the moment, but Merissa probably knows you wouldn't want to keep her that small forever. You'd have to make a wish to undo it, and that'll mean taking on another stipulation. Even if you're not the one paying now, you'll be paying later, possibly with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around and realize that you're back to about 5 feet tall now. You breathe a sigh of relief, though you know it's just fleeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you hear a familiar voice from behind you shout. \"Is that your car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, you turn and see that it's Alyssa, another one of your friends! You look and see that it was her car that pulled up behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Alyssa!\" you say as you step up onto the raised platform the pumps are on to try and keep her from noticing the size difference. She's normally just 2 inches shorter than you but at the moment, you're giving up about 7 or 8 inches to her! \"Yeah, I just got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Well, when were you going to tell me about it?\" she asks as she walks around the platform to you. \"I gave you the first ride in my car when I got it, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" you say, thinking back to that first day in her yellow Mustang. \"Sorry, I had some things come up shortly after I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you totally owe me a ride in it!\" Alyssa says as she looks at you with her pretty green eyes. \"Especially after all the ones I've given you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at your car and figure the tank's about full. You step off the platform and realize you're about the same size as you were normally compared to Alyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely right, Alyssa,\" you say as you remove the nozzle from your tank. \"I have a few things I have to take care of this evening, but after all that, I'll be happy to take you for a drive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I can't wait!\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adds...</span></div></div>",

That doesn't sound as bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're taking the third coin, Master?\" Merissa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" you say with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Master,\" Merissa says as she makes the other two coins vanish from her original two hands. With her extra hand, she holds the coin between her fingers and flings it like a flying disc it at your fuel gauge. When it connects, you see a brief flash of light before it ricochets off of the gauge and flies towards your chest. When it strikes your torso, you see another brief flash of light as it bounces off and disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you get a sinking sensation in your gut and start to feel light-headed as it seems like everything around you is starting to grow: the driver's seat you're situated in, the steering wheel and console in front of you, and Merissa in the passenger's seat! Thankfully, your clothes are shrinking along with you (though not your wallet as it seems to be staying the same size as the pocket it's in continues to accommodate it), and after a few seconds, your body settles and the shrinking stops. You feel a little bit lighter now, but otherwise the same: you've kept your proportions. You look back over to Merissa, who now looks like she's just shy of 7'10\" in relation to you and your altered perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done, Master. You can now legally operate this vehicle,\" she says as she eyes your tinier body over. \"Now I suppose the question is can you physically operate it?\" she asks with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha ha, Merissa,\" you say as you adjust your seat forward and up and manipulate the steering wheel. You start to worry if the answer to the question Merissa asked is no as you fiddle with the levers, but you're able to somehow get things situated so you can see the road and operate the pedals, which is a relief as you'd rather not wish for more help right now. You make a few more adjustments to the mirrors and you're ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing you have that license, Master,\" Merissa says. \"You'll have to prove to people that you're not a child trying to operate this vehicle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever,\" you say as you look at the laughing genie once more as you turn the ignition. It's clear to you that she's enjoying your predicament after you smugly thought you put one over on her. You think you should probably be more careful in the future, both with your wishes and with revealing your hands at her stipulations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you can't help but think that her wicked laugh is actually pretty sexy, and she looks even sexier from your new vantage point. You then remember that your girlfriend, Jackie, is even bigger at the moment! You're now eager to see how she looks to you now! You carefully put your car into drive and pull out into the highway, driving at a much more reasonable and legal pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reach a roadblock set up by the highway patrol, as Merissa warned you. Though Merissa joked about it earlier, the police do indeed have trouble believing you're not a child but your new license proves otherwise. It seems your new height is shown on the card. They apologize for their mistake and send you on your way, and you ride back into town towards Jackie's house. Moments later, you pull up into Jackie's driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me if you need me, my tiny little Master!\" Merissa laughs as she snaps her fingers and vanishes from her seat in a puff of smoke. You hope you won't need her, of course, as you know things would get more complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of your new car for the first time since being shrunk and marvel at how much the familiar features of Jackie's yard seem much bigger to you. You also start to wonder how much larger the normally 5'2\" Jackie is now with the previous stipulation you took. As you walk towards her front door, you think back to your phone call and remember that you told her that you weren't going to be on a date with Officer Rebecca... four times, you think? And then you sent her a text saying the same. You're not sure how much she grew with each of your five denials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach her door and knock.</span></div></div>",

They certainly seem to sound heavier than Jackie's usual steps. The doorknob turns and you crane your neck up to take in what's bound to be uncovered by the opening door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door pulls open and reveals Jackie, wearing the white blouse and black pencil skirt that the servers at Alberto's wear. But you're seeing even more of Jackie than you ever have before, as she's having to poke her head through the door because it looks like she's taller than the frame! Based on your familiarity with these surroundings, you figure that she's really about 7'8\" right now, but in your shrunken state, she might as well be eleven feet tall! Strangely enough, it looks like she's looking not right at you, but right above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what your surprise is,\" she begins to say with a slightly deeper, sultry voice, \"but I don't think it's as big as...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie pauses as a confused look forms on her face. She briefly glances to her sides and then looks down, making eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" she says. \"Looks like you got the opposite of whatever I got! I expected you to be at least eye level with my boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, my face is down here!\" you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that is a big surprise on your part!\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is really only part of my surprise, I guess,\" you admit as you point to your new vehicle. \"Have a look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's that Camaro you always wanted!\" she says. \"Is it yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" you say. \"Come on, check it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but forgive me if I'm slow,\" she says. \"Whenever all this growth started, I wasn't wearing any shoes so I'm stepping out into the yard barefooted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you say as you step aside as the giant Jackie slides out of her doorway and onto her porch and begins to walk carefully towards your new vehicle. You follow behind as you observe that though she is being cautious with her steps, she is making quick progress as her longer legs make for longer strides. Naturally, your gaze becomes drawn to Jackie's amazing posterior. Jackie was always proud of her huge, sexy butt, and now it's even more huge! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Jackie says as she approaches the car and looks it over. \"Looks like it would be a tight fit for me to get in there right now, though,\" she adds with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe if we adjust the seats,\" you say as you walk up beside her. \"I was somehow able to drive it over here after adjusting mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hmmmm,\" Jackie says as she continues looking at the car before turning back to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you come across a genie or something?\" Jackie asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say, astounded that she'd ask that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, you have this car that's exactly like the on on that magazine you keep showing me, even though you currently don't have a job, and your mom is unable to help you buy one, and you didn't even have a driver's license last time I checked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have one now!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you do! And on top of that, there's all this,\" she says as she places the palms of her hands just above your head and lifts them up to guide them around her body up to her face to emphasize her new, larger frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not to mention, this thing you've got going on,\" she adds as she brings her right hand down to your head and sets her palm on top of it before playfully mussing your hair with a gentle rub, obviously pointing out your decreased stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this ranges from highly unlikely to flat out impossible,\" she reasons as she places her hands on her hips and looks down at you, adding with a smirk, \"and it's also all stuff that I happen to know you'd like to see happen. So I don't think it's all coincidence. And this doesn't even include that surprise date you told me you have tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a date!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said earlier, babe, I don't mind if AHHHHHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie closes her eyes tight and winces as you see her start to expand, gradually inflating outward as she gains about six inches in height. You know that would put her at around 8'2\", but in your shrunken state, she seems to be three inches away from being twelve feet tall; she's almost twice as big as you! The growth stops and Jackie opens her eyes, looks around, and looks back down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time you've told me that your date isn't really a date, I grow!\" she says. \"I mean, I'm not complaining, but I wish you'd just tell me what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's fairly observant, which really shouldn't be a surprise to you. You both have the same fetishes and have shared the kinds of stories where these things happen with each other. She's not being hostile but you do think she'll get upset if you keep your recent boon a secret from her. And you don't want a woman almost double your size upset with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Jackie,\" you admit. \"I did find a genie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and you were just going to show me this car!\" she says. \"I want to see this genie for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can be arranged,\" you hear Merissa's voice call out from behind you. You turn and see a very tall flume of red smoke swirling behind you, disappearing and revealing the genie, who is now standing at the same height as Jackie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you, my dear,\" Merissa says as she walks over to Jackie and shakes her hand. \"I am Merissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jackie,\" your girlfriend says. \"Wow, you're gorgeous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my dear. I could say the same for you as well,\" the genie responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Jackie says before turning back to you. \"Hey, is she your date for tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's not my date,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you do have a date, then?\" Jackie says as she crosses her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't have a date tonight!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie doesn't even say anything. She just smirks and waits, not flinching when the growth kicks in again. Another six inches is added to her height, bringing her up to 8'8\" and making her appear 12 and a half feet tall to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So about that pattern I noticed earlier,\" Jackie says. \"Mind explaining what's going on? Did you wish for me to grow whenever you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" you say. \"Merissa offered me three wishes after I found her, but I made my first wish for infinite wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jackie says. \"You know that's a risky wish! That could have really backfired on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, it kinda did,\" you say. \"Merissa granted it, but I had to choose a price to pay, and I chose a bag of coins. Every time I make a wish, Merissa will grant it, but she'll then produce coins that represent stipulations she adds to the wish, usually to my detriment. I have to then choose the one that gets applied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I see,\" Jackie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, my first wish was for this car,\" you say, \"and after Merissa conjured it, she gave me the choice of either have my size correlate to how full the gas tank was or becoming the magazine model who posed with this car in my magazine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that explains why you're so small. Isn't it risky to drive while shrinking, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't have shrunk while in the car,\" you explain. \"At least, not originally, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Once I got my car, I drove around pretty recklessly without a license and got pulled over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By a beautiful lady officer!\" Merissa adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Jackie says while you glare at Merissa. \"Did you wish for a date with her? Is she your date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh, I wished she had just pulled me over to ask me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it,\" Jackie says. \"I mean, I'm fine with it, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's a lesbian!\" you say. \"The wish made her pull me over to ask me to dinner to talk about joining her car club. Merissa's right, she was beautiful, but I wasn't going to make her have sex with me or anything with a wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just wanted an opportunity to charm her!\" Merissa added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Merissa,\" you say between your clenched teeth. \"If I still wanted to actually woo the officer, I could have chosen Merissa's other stipulation and had the officer and me gender-swapped. Which would have been awkward, but I chose the other one: you wouldn't believe we weren't dating and you'd grow every time I said we weren't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you must have been the jealous type,\" Merissa says. \"I didn't count on your relationship being what it is. This world has changed very much since I was first confined in my bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not that much,\" Jackie says. \"What we have going on is pretty uncommon today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it really was a romantic date, you know I'd tell you, Jackie!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't believe... wait...\" Jackie says as she pauses for a moment before another growth spurt kicks in, bringing her up to 9'2\" and making her seem to be over 13 feet tall to you! \"Anyway, I still don't believe you but that seems to be part of Merissa's stipulation so whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could wish that away, I guess,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then it'd complicate things another way,\" Jackie says as she kneels down to look you directly in the eyes. \"You can postpone that if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but not forever,\" Jackie says. \"I called in to work today because of this but I would eventually like to go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie adds...</span></div></div>",

If you were to go with the size-changing coin, it's possible that you could get yourself into a situation where you can't fill up your car's tank and become stuck at a small size. You could wish for Merissa to do that for you, but then that would be tacking on another stipulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if you go with the female-symbol coin, you won't have to worry about being smaller and getting stuck. To top it off, you'll actually get a chance to get a feel for that magazine model's body (in a different way than you pictured but hey, whatever works.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I agree with you, Merissa, that model and this car go together,\" you say. \"I choose the female coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I was hoping you'd pick this one, Master!\" Merissa says with a smile on her face as she holds the coin up. \"Maybe you can pose for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything, Merissa tosses the size-changing coin away behind her back, where it disappears before it even reaches the ground. She then places the female con between her thumb and fingers, raises her arm up and then flicks it toward your head like a shuriken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" is all you can get out before the coin impacts with your cranium. You roll your eyes up and see that it's embedded in your forehead, protruding out in line with your nose! Merissa laughs heartily as you reach up to grab it, only for you to see the coin start to glow brightly as you touch, quickly becoming more intense and blinding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring your hands to you eyes to rub them, only to notice that they feel softer. You also feel that your body has changed, most notably that there's some weight on your chest and you feel just an inch or two shorter. You open your eyes and look up to see the coin is gone, and then you look down to see that you now have some sizable breasts contained by a red bikini top. You look yourself over further and see that your body is pretty much a spitting image for that model's; denim daisy dukes, red heels and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, this is unbelievable!\" you say, gasping upon hearing the sexy, feminine voice coming from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Unbelievable?\" Merissa says as you walk over to the car's side mirror. \"Did I or did I not just conjure a car out of thin air for you, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but actually seeing it happen is something else!\" you say as you get a good look in the mirror. You see that, as Merissa said, you have your face, but it looks more feminine  and is framed by wavy, shoulder-length brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, Master,\" Merissa says as she appears in the mirror behind you. \"I forget most people never encounter genies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wonder if people who know me will still know me,\" you muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Master, I think you're about to find out,\" Merissa says as she snaps her fingers and disappears from view.

Did you just get it done recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually just got the car itself today!\" you say, which is true. \"I had brought it over to show my friend and surprise him but apparently he's not home right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he'd love it,\" she says. \"I remember him flipping out after I gave him a model car kit a few years ago.

My current car is just a functional one and it's mostly a source of headaches for me right now. If you don't mind, I'd like to ride along with you in your new car to the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you say. \"I kind of feel like I should wait on my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, do you know when he'll be back?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I actually don't,\" which is true. You're pretty sure you'll wish yourself back to being a guy eventually, but you'd rather not add any stipulations to deal with before you've even had a chance to enjoy your first wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? He can wait!\" you say to your neighbor. \"I'll be happy to give you a ride, Barbara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Barbara says as her face starts to beam. \"Okay, let me run back over to my house to unlock my door. You can go ahead and pull your car into my driveway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" you say as Barbara jogs over to her property. Excitedly, you open up your car door and hop into the driver's seat to start the ignition, and fasten your seat belt. Carefully, you back out of your driveway, making sure to use your mirrors and look behind you to make sure you're not going to hit anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd,\" you say to yourself as you start to drive towards Barbara's driveway. \"I feel like I would have been more reckless there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you would have,\" you hear Merissa's voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" you say as you glance over to the passenger's seat and see a shrunken Merissa standing there and looking back up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you more than just that model's looks,\" she says as you look back at the road. \"I also gave you some of her skill-sets. I figured she was probably a more experienced driver than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right,\" you say as you start to pull into your neighbor's driveway. \"I didn't even know how to drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? These stipulations I give you may not end up being so bad, Master!\" Merissa says. \"You're a licensed driver now! The documentation is in your purse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Purse?\" you say as you hear her tiny little fingers snap. You look back over as you bring the car to a stop and see that there's now a red purse in the passenger's seat. You also see tiny little Merissa starting to climb inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, 'Purse!' Enjoy your date, Master!\" Merissa shouts back as she tucks herself into your new purse and it closes itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say as you unfasten your seat belt. \"Wait, what did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purse's flap opens up and Merissa pokes her head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you want me to call you 'Mistress' instead?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to call me that right now, that's fine,\" you respond, \"but what I meant was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy?\" you hear Barbara shout from her porch. \"Is everything okay?\" Startled, you grab your newly created purse and open up the door to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's fine!\" you say as you close your door. \"Sorry, I just got a weird message that caught me off guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay! Well, come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk onto her porch and into her living room, and Barbara closes the door behind you. You've been in her living room a few times before with your mother years ago after she just moved in and it looks about the same. Some furniture is moved around, there's a new TV, but otherwise, there's nothing that really stands out. You walk past her end table and notice that next to the telephone, there's a note with a law firm's phone number written on it, along with a doodle of a stick-figure with crudely-drawn hair and breasts bringing her foot down on a much smaller stick-figure. You've never asked Ms. Nichols about her ex-husband, but you get the feeling she's not happy at all with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bedroom is up this way, Lucy,\" Barbara says as she leads you up the stairs. She turns at the top and walks into a room that looks like it has a very soft bed with pink satin sheets. You follow her as she walks over to the room's closet and opens it up, revealing an assortment of dresses, shoes and other garments. She slides some hangers aside and reveals an ample t-shirt collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" Barbara says as she reaches in and pulls out a white t-shirt with the faded emblem of a car show that took place sometime in the early part of the previous decade. \"It might be slightly tight on you, but I think it'll work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say as you sit your purse on her bed and start to pull the shirt over your head. As you bring it down over your curves, you realize that Barbara was right; it's pretty snug but not so much that it's uncomfortable. You also realize there's a makeshift cut coming from the collar of the shirt down to your bust, revealing your incredible cleavage. You look in Barbara's mirror and make adjustments to straighten out the shirt, then start making a few poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, has anyone ever told you that you look like you could be a model?\" Barbara asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yeah, I get that a lot,\" you laugh, knowing the origin of your current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but this is actually coming from a former model,\" she says. \"I actually got that shirt you're wearing from an event I worked at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you say as you look down at the logo, seeing the dates of the show along with a line drawing of an older Camaro. You did know that she did some modeling before she moved in next door to you; she also looked like she could still do it if she wanted to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're interested, I still have a few contacts in the industry,\" Barbara says. \"You might get some work in local commercials, and then who knows? Maybe you'll end up on a magazine cover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, I'll think about it,\" you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a quick shower before we take off so I can wash this jogging funk off of me,\" Barbara laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fine,\" you say as you collect your purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go downstairs and make yourself comfortable while you wait,\" Barbara says as grabs a bathrobe, then walks you over to her bedroom door and points down the hallway \"Or, considering your vehicular preference, you might want to check out my model car collection. If you go down that way, it's in the room at the very end. My doll collection is in there, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say as you step outside. The blonde and still incredibly-fit-and-attractive former model walks out behind you and closes her door, then walks across the hall to her bathroom and locks that door behind her.</span></div></div>",

You didn't mean to make a wish! You reach for your purse and open it to find Merissa grinning eagerly and holding some coins up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you have stipulations prepared now?\" you ask. \"You haven't even granted the wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is a special case, Mistress,\" Merissa responds. \"These stipulations will be determining how I grant your wish. I mean, what's the fun of just letting you go in there and watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even really want to make this wish, though!\" you say. \"I was just saying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you didn't want it, you wouldn't have said it,\" Merissa scolds, wagging a tiny finger at you. \"You could have just went downstairs or to see her collection instead, like she suggested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Might as well go through with it then. What are the stipulations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked, Mistress,\" Merissa says as she holds up the coin in her left hand. \"I know you can't make it out but this coin depicts two figures swapping souls, and it represents the following stipulation: to fulfill this wish, I'll be placing your soul in Barbara's body, and her soul in your current body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, won't she flip out?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't be aware. She'll just think she's a girl named Lisa, killing time while a friend she just made is getting ready. On the other hand, you'll have complete control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not bad looking at all, right now,\" you say, \"but it might be fun to experience what it's like as another woman, especially in the shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa grins as you see her roll another coin out from behind the coin she's describing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, two coins for one stipulation?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make these things as complex as I need to, Mistress. Now, this coin depicts a clock, and that's important because I'm placing you on a timer. You might be willing to wait for Barbara, but if you take this stipulation, it'll be her waiting on you. If you can finish Barbara's shower, dry off and put on her bathrobe in ten minutes, you'll both swap back to your original bodies with no incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And what if I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if ten minutes pass and you're still not done, Barbara will become aware that she's in your body and guess that you're in hers, which, as you might imagine, would be a shocking experience for her. And to make it more interesting, I won't let you wish to change back, or even to become anyone else, for, ummm, I'll say three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days!? Well, I mean if that happens, I could just tell her about you, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do tell her about me in that time frame,\" Merissa says, somehow producing a third coin from behind the two she's shown you, \"then this coin that depicts a contract stipulates that as she'll technically be you for that time period, she'll get to make wishes, too. And you, not her, will be responsible for any stipulations for wishes that she makes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that sounds like quite a bit,\" you say, \"but I think i could take less than ten minutes. What about the other coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin,\" Merissa says, holding up the one in her right hand, \"depicts the size-changing figure, like the other one I showed you from your first wish. If you choose this, I'll reduce you to two inches tall and then teleport you to the interior of her bathtub while she's showering. You can watch her all you like from there, and if you're lucky, she might not even see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or step on me,\" you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if she does, you can't die or get seriously hurt as a result of the wishes I grant,\" Merissa laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief,\" you say. \"Still, if she did spot me, I think she'd have more than a few questions about what a tiny woman was doing in her shower with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of whether she see you or not, Mistress, when she's finished bathing, you'll return to normal size and appear on her couch downstairs, ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems like a less messy outcome,\" you say, \"but the first option leaves me with less of a chance of being caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you need to choose quickly, Mistress!\" Merissa says as you hear water starting to run from Barbara's bathroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll take the first one and become Barbara!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then, Mistress!\" Merissa says as she hurls her tiny coins right into your eyeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" you say, covering your closed eyes with your palms. You start rubbing them to try to relieve the stinging they caused. As that sensation starts to fade, you start to feel an entirely different sensation: that of warm water sprinkling against your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and realize that you must now be in the sexy, naked body of the woman next door, who you've always had a crush on! You quickly slide the shower curtain aside and poke your head out to look in a mirror. Sure enough, it's Barbara's face staring back at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" you say with Barbara's voice as you slide the curtain back and resume your neighbor's shower. The water bounces off of the shower cap keeping Barbara's blonde hair dry as you start to examine her body. You know she's older but you can tell she's taken very good care of herself. She's nicely toned and her skin is quite soft, and her breasts are quite large and pert. You cup them for a moment, giggling at how they feel in your hands. You start to tweak her large nipples with her delicate fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get used to this,\" you say softly as Barbara's nipples respond to your touch.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, however, you cease your fondling as you have a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I might have to if I don't hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou estimate you've been in her body for about a minute, leaving you with more than enough time. You look around and see a bottle of body wash and a loofah sponge. You grab and open up the bottle and squeeze the contents onto the sponge, then set the bottle down and begin to rub the sponge against Barbara's body to work up a lather. You make slow, deliberate, and sensuous motions with the sponge, trying to enjoy your brief time as Barbara as much as possible. You especially concentrate on her bosom, as well as her long legs and perfectly round ass. Once you've sudsed up her body enough, you start to hang the loofah back where you found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really rinse that thing out, Mistress!\" you hear a voice call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you turn around and see a tiny, bikini-clad Merissa sitting in an equally tiny chaise lounge in the corner of the tub looking up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, Merissa?\" you say as you take her advice and squeeze out the sponge while you hold it under the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just thought that the second stipulation I offered you sounded fun, so I decided to do it myself!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be keeping an eye on Barbara?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was!\" Merissa laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean Barbara in my body, not me in Barbara's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine!\" Merissa says. \"It's funny, she's actually admiring the work put into her toy collection. You know, the one she put together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she does think she's me,\" you say as you step back into the water to rinse off. \"I probably would have checked out the collection, too, if I hadn't accidentally made this wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at it this way, Mistress\" Merissa says. \"You got to admire another body of her work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" you laugh as you turn to rinse of Barbara's back. \"Maybe I should take up jogging. So anyway, how much time have I spent in here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting close to six minutes,\" Merissa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all?\" you say as you turn around to rinse off your front one more time. \"Well, I'm almost done here. I think you were actually pretty generous with the time you gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all I'd like to be generous with, Mistress,\" you hear Merissa say from behind you, only this time, it sounded closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" you say as you look back, only to see Merissa standing behind you full size and completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa?\" you say as you turn to face the genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked the show you were putting on for me, Mistress,\" Merissa coos. \"I'd like to become part of the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Merissa, this is Barbara,\" you say as you look up to the woman who is four inches taller than you are currently..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Barbara is in another room and she thinks she's you,\" she says as she starts to glide her finger across Barbara's chest. She then begins to poke to emphasize, \"You're in here, Mistress, and you know you're you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the stipulation,\" you say. \"I just have four minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only require two, Mistress,\" Merissa promises. \"You'll have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purse Barbara's lips and give it a second of thought. How often do you really expect to be in the body of a hot woman who you've always admired and make out with another hot woman? Actually, you think that it might actually happen quite a bit given that you now have a genie, so there's no rush. Then again, maybe you should start getting used to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you tell Merissa?</span></div></div>",

After finding one in a cabinet under the sink, you grab it and begin patting yourself dry while watching in the mirror. You take some time with it, still enjoying the feeling of being in Barbara's body. You glance down and see that a tiny little Merissa has set up her tiny little chaise lounge next to the sink, apparently still enjoying watching you in Barbara's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're completely dried off, you hand Barbara's towel on her towel rack and remove her shower cap, letting her blonde hair fall down all around you. You look in the mirror once more, turning your head to watch Barbara's hair wave around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's that!\" you say, as you cup Barbara's breasts one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not forgetting anything, are you, Mistress?\" Merissa calls up from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, the bathrobe!\" you say as you look around the room, locating the garment hanging on a hook on the bathroom door. You walk over to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long did I take?\" you ask as you take the robe off the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little over eight minutes!\" Merissa shouts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say as you begin putting Barbara's arms through the sleeves. \"If I had taken you up on your two minute offer, it would have been close! I might not have made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I would have made it worth it, Mistress!\" Merissa says as you close Barbara's robe around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" you say as you close Barbara's robe around her and start to tighten the belt. \"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tie the belt around Barbara's waist, and suddenly, you see a blinding flash of light. The light fades and you find yourself in another room, looking at an assortment of fashion dolls displayed immaculately. You turn around and see several model cars given the same care, along with a table of crafting supplies in the center of the room. You look down and see that you're back in your body... well, Lucy's body, which is basically your body altered to match that of a model in a car magazine. You hear a door open in the hallway behind you and turn to see Barbara stepping out in her bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lucy!\" she calls out. \"Just give me a moment to get dressed and I'll be ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" you call back as she walks into her bedroom, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to watch that, too, Mistress?\" you hear Merissa ask. You look around and see a twelve-inch tall Merissa standing among the fashion dolls in Barbara's collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I'm not going to wish for it,\" you laugh as you walk over to the genie. \"I'd rather not take chances with your stipulations like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, but what good is having infinite wishes if you're not going to make them, Mistress?\" Merissa teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not saying I won't make any,\" you say. \"Just that I'd like to enjoy the wishes I do make before I start complicating them with more wishes and stipulations. It's why I haven't wished to go back to my old self yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought that was because you were enjoying being a woman, Mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, it's not bad,\" you say as you look your sexy self over, \"but I wasn't even 'Lucy' for ten minutes before I agreed to be put in Barbara's body! Had I dillydallied, I might have ended up delaying my car ride further!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily!\" Merissa says. \"You could have made some more wishes to get to the point where you could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'd rather save my wishes for something I want, not for something to get me out of trouble that will just get me into different trouble,\" you say as you hear a door open in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, I'm ready to go!\" Barbara calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk away from the doll-sized djinn and back into the hallway, where you see Barbara closing her bedroom door. As you approach her, you see that she's taken a cue from your current attire, wearing a blue two-piece bathing suit under a white tank-top and denim short, with blue heeled shoes. She's also holding a tote bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have some sunblock and some towels for us,\" Barbara says as she holds up her tote bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great!\" you say. \"I, uhhhh, forgot mine when I left the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought you might have if you went out without a shirt,\" Barbara laughs. \"Well, c'mon, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Barbara down her stairs, giddy with anticipation. You have your dream car and two hot female models are about to be riding in it. Well, you're technically one of the female models right now, but that just makes things seem more exciting!</span></div></div>",

She leans forward and plants a kiss on your lips, and then another kiss, and another. You start returning the pecks and eventually, the two of you are in a full lip lock as the hot water continues to rain on your bodies from the shower head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you've never done this as a woman, you're more than happy to let Merissa take the initiative. After all, she's probably learned a thing or two in all her years of immortality. You have to admit, it's a very intriguing feeling having both of your pairs of large breasts rubbing against each other as you kiss, one that's making you feel a little warm between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Merissa's hands start to glide down your back, slowly and surely caressing your curves. Eventually, she reaches your cute, firm ass and presses up on it, seemingly pulling you in closer to her intoxicating kisses. It's a move you're actually familiar with; you do that to your girlfriend, Jackie, all the time, since she's five feet tall and you were normally six feet tall. She probably appreciated the little boost; you certainly do. This gives you an idea; why not borrow one of Jackie's moves? It feels like Merissa can pull it off, since she feels as if she must have as much physical power as she does magical power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Merissa's hands still on your rear, you both break up the kisses and open your eyes at each other, giving each other warm smiles. You then look at Merissa with hungry eyes and make a quick hop, wrapping Barbara's long legs around the genie's waist. Merissa seemed caught off guard by your leap but didn't budge an inch, something you can't say you've done with Jackie every single time. She holds you off the ground in her arms, lifting you up just enough so that you're actually looking down on her a little. With your hands on her shoulders, you both smile at each other again before you lean in and begin another round of kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kiss, you become incredibly grateful that you found this sexy, mystical woman. You start to think of all the ways she could make your love life more interesting via wishes. Of course, there'd be stipulations, but those might just make things even more intriguing. Speaking of which, you realize you need to wind this down and get Barbara dry. You pull away from Merissa and look at her with Barbara's face positively beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Merissa,\" you say as you start to slide out of the genie's grasp. \"I'm happy I made that wish. Those were easily among the most interesting eight minutes of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine minutes and twenty seconds, actually,\" Merissa says as you bend over to turn off the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess I lost track of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reaction causes Barbara's eyes to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRAP!\" you say as you push the shower curtain aside and hop out onto the bathroom mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, I thought you said you just needed two minutes!\" you call back as you start rummaging through Barbara's bathroom to find out where she keeps her towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two minutes WAS all I needed, Mistress!\" Merissa calls out from the tub as she snaps her fingers. \"It looks like you needed more, though!\" You look back over to your genie and see that she's completely dry, dressed in her genie outfit and out of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, could you at least dry me off?\" you call back. Please!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mistress, but the stipulation states that YOU must dry Barbara's body, not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start mentally kicking yourself as you finally locate a towel from one of Barbara's cabinet. You want to blame Merissa for tricking you into your little shower session, but you remember that she had actually stopped kissing you before you leaped into her arms to keep it going. You begin to pat yourself dry with the towel as fast as you can, likely being careful with your borrowed skin as you're still operating with Lucy the model's skill-set. You're just glad Barbara was wearing a shower cap; if you had to dry her hair, too, you'd have no chance! After furiously patting yourself down, you hang the towel on a rack and take one less look at Barbara's body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's that,\" you say, as you look in Barbara's mirror for one last time and remove her shower cap, letting her blonde hair cascade down around her nude body. \"Wait, I need her bathrobe! Where is it!?\" You look around and see that it's hanging on a hook on the bathroom door. You quickly dash to the door and remove it from the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna make it!

You open the door and see her walking out of her collection room's doorway, looking frightened and holding one of her model cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're me!?\" she says. \"I'm you!? Am I? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you tell Barbara that you're Lucy, it'll be what she probably expects. You can't tell her why this happened or that genie magic was involved so you'll have to feign ignorance. It's possible she might be okay with pretending to be you and helping you pretend to be her, but she may also want to investigate things and make things more complicated. Your mother will also likely be looking for you (her son) when you don't show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could, instead, tell Barbara that you're actually the boy next door, and you're not sure why she's in the body of Lucy. This feels like more of a truth, which you feel compelled to admit due to guilt over causing this situation. You're not sure how Barbara will react to the neighbor boy being in the picture, and she could also be concerned about where \"Lucy\" ended up. Especially if your mother (who wouldn't know Lucy) comes looking for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could, instead, tell her the whole truth (or most of it, anyway): you're the boy next door and you made a wish or two from a genie, including an errant one that caused your bodies to swap. Of course, as Merissa stipulated, if you tell Barbara about her, Barbara will be allowed to make wishes for the next three days as well, with you responsible for the stipulations!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you say to the confused Barbara in your Lucy body?</span></div></div>",

She steps forward towards you, but as she does, you see a pink light flash in her eyes for a split second. She stops walking and the fear expressed on her face fades, replaced with a look of general confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, why'd I walk in here?\" she asks as she looks down at the model Ferrari that she's holding. \"And why'd I bring this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to test the waters, you ask, \"'Lucy,' are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think so,\" Barbara says, which seems to assure you that Merissa did her part in that your neighbor responded to the name, \"Lucy.\" \"I guess I just had a brain fart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, forgetting something after you walk into a door is a common occurrence,\" you say. \"Maybe you'll remember what it was if you go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she says. \"I suppose I should go put this back up, at least. Your collection is awesome, Barbara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you, Lucy,\" you respond, happy that she also seems to think you're... well, her. \"Let me go get dressed while you're doing that and then we can take off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sure thing!\" the actual Barbara says as she turns back towards the collection room. As she steps in, you head for her bedroom and close the door behind you. You walk to the closet to find something to wear, but when you open the closet door, you find Merissa inside, holding some clothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took the liberty of picking out some clothes for you to wear, Mistress 'Barbara,'\" the genie says as she hands you the articles she's selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks,\" you say as you take the articles and carry them over to Barbara's dresser. You set them down and see that Merissa has chosen a blue bikini, white tank top and cut-off denim shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was actually a pretty clever wish you just made,\" Merissa says as you take off Barbara's robe, letting it fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you say as you pose Barbara's amazing naked body in the mirror, still amazed that it's currently yours. \"I mean, if Barbara's not aware of what's going on, getting through the next three days will be easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it?\" the genie says. You look back and see that she's walking towards you while reaching into her coin purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, probably not,\" you huff as you grab the blue bikini bottom and start hurrying to get dressed before you have to make a choice. Once the bottom is tied on, you grab the top and look in the mirror, where you see the genie reflected in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm obligated to grant your every wish,\" she says as you tie the bikini straps together in front of you, \"I am going to make sure it's no picnic for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'No picnic?'\" you say as turn the bikini around, fit Barbara's breasts into the cups and pat them into place. \"Because this morning, I had no idea to put one of these on. Wouldn't you have wanted me to struggle with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, are you sure you want to give me ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me what the damage is,\" you groan as you slide into Barbara's tank top. Once it's on, you look back and see that Merissa has produced two coins, one in each hand. The token in her left hand depicts the size changing figure that you've seen already, while the one in her right depicts a contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you choose this stipulation, Mistress,\" Merissa says as directs your attention to the size changing coin, \"then in addition to being unable to wish to switch bodies back with Barbara in three days, but you'll be spending those next three days at 1:6 scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'1:6 scale?'\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to be Barbara for the next few days, you should be familiar with that term as it relates to one of her hobbies,\" the genie says. \"That's the scale of the fashion dolls in her collection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god, I'd be Barbie-sized!\" you realize. \"What's the other stipulation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems to me that forcing Barbara to commit to her role as Lucy is unfair unless you're willing to do the same,\" Merissa says as she holds up the contract coin. \"If you choose this stipulation, then instead of being able to switch back to your original bodies in three days, you'll be unable to switch back at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. All you wanted was a new car. That was it. And now you're potentially going to wind up leaving your old life behind to assume the life of your sexy next door neighbor. That or just be her for the next three days while being the size of a doll. The size-changing coin stipulation seems trickier but at least you know it will come to an end eventually. The contract coin has a terrifying permanence to it, but at least you'll be full-sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also remember Merissa stating earlier that you could wish away a stipulation if you find you don't like it, though you're not sure what she might offer as a replacement. But you have to choose now, and so you choose...</span></div></div>",

'Lucy' didn't really exist, she didn't have a life of her own to go back to. IF Barbara decided to accept that she needed to impersonate 'you', you'd have a hard time coming up with an explanation for where Lucy lived, what her life was like. Things would be a lot easier if Barbara was simply...incapacitated until things turned back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara, in your old 'Lucy' body, looked at you expectantly, fear clear in her eyes. You bit your (<i>her</i>) lip and looked away from her. \"Lucy!\" she says. \"Y-You're in my body, right? I'm not crazy? What's going on?!\" You felt bad, but if your wish worked the way you expected it to, this experience would be over before she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">I wish for her to become a fashion doll.</font>\" you mutter. Barbara looked at you with your own eyes confusedly, having clearly caught some of what you said. \"What'd you say? Lucy, please tell me what's-\" <i><b>FOOM.</b></i> An explosion of smoke overtook your old body, completely engulfing Barbara. You heard the sound of a model car hitting the ground, and when the smoke dissipates, you don't see Barbara at all, at least not immediately. Your own bikini lay haphazardly on the floor, and so did a car from her collection, a wheel having popped off. Kneeling down, you lift up your bikini bottom to find...a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just a doll, though; it looked exactly like your 'Lucy' body, down to the minor details on the face. The only thing missing was any sort of clothing, as you stared at your old, miniaturized, plastic nude body. It was devoid of any sort of genitals, replaced with smooth surfaces, but it was still an interesting perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress!\" you hear Merissa yell from...somewhere, her voice a bit lighter than normal. Standing up with Doll and Car in tow, you look around Barbara's hallway, expecting to find Merissa waiting for you, but you don't see anything. \"Yoo-hoo! Down here!\" she calls, and with a roll of your eyes, you look to the ground, expecting to find a smaller Merissa laying at your feet. She's not there either. \"Merissa?\" you ask, \"Where are you?\" \"In the car!\" she yells. You blink, making sure you heard her right, and raise the model car to eye level. Sure enough, there she is, small and sitting in the drivers seat. She even has her belt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, mistress, turning your kind neighbor, who became trapped in your old body because of <i>you</i>, into a <i>doll</i>? That's devious.\" Merissa says. You can't help but feel a bit guilty, at that. \"It's not my job to judge, however. I'm just here to grant wishes. And speaking of that,\" she says, snapping her fingers. Two coins land on the hood of the model car, with pictures you're not able to make out. \"It's time to talk about stipulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Right. Stipulations. You feel a bit nervous as you waited for her to describe them to you. You haven't made a made a <i>bad </i>wish until now...but you did. <i>And </i>you were trying to skirt responsibility for your previous stipulation. You only hoped that Merissa wasn't the punishing type. Though with all the situations she tries to put you in, you were pretty sure she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first coin represents the following stipulation: Barbara will remain a motionless doll, unable to do anything on her own. In 3 days she will turn back into 'Lucy', just in time for you and her to switch back to your normal bodies.\" '<i>That doesn't sound so bad,</i>' you think to yourself. \"However!\" Merissa continues, and you can't believe you even considered things being simple. \"Barbara will be aware of what's going on while she's a doll the whole time, being able to see, hear, touch and smell from the perspective of the doll! If she is <i>unhappy</i> with you upon returning to normal, she will magically become convinced that you were responsible for her change, and be granted one wish to use against you! No stipulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great.\" you mutter to yourself. \"I can't imagine a world where she <i>won't </i>be unhappy with me, knowing that I turned her into a doll...\" \"Oh, she won't know unless you tell her.\" Merissa says. \"She isn't even aware of anything right now. Only when you choose this stipulation will she 'wake up'.\" Hm. That didn't sound as bad. \"So I could convince her that I didn't know what happened, and try and treat her right for 3 days?\" you ask. \"Yes! However, you can imagine 72 hours is a long time to be stuck as a doll. Unless you treat her right, and I mean <i>right</i>, after the shock of being herself again goes away, she'll be in a sour mood. And then <i>bam</i>, she gets a wish...that can only be used<i> against you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that stipulation is a pain. But it couldn't be that hard to keep Barbara happy, right? Just treat her nicely for a few days... And who's to say you couldn't make more wishes during that timeframe to make things easier, to keep her happy? \"Oh, and no wishing she's eternally happy or okay with being a doll or anything like that.\" Merissa adds. <i>Ah, shit</i>. So you'd have to keep Barbara happy manually, by...what? Staying with her at all times? Talking to her? What's the appropriate way to cheer up someone trapped in a doll, where they don't see a future in which they aren't trapped in a doll...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Honk.' 'Honk.'</i> Snapping out of your thoughts, you notice Merissa hitting the tiny horn on her car to get your attention. \"Focus, mistress. I haven't even mentioned the second stipulation yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but let out a long sigh, and Merissa seemed to <i>relish </i>the feeling of despair radiating off you. You didn't think she was cold hearted, just mischievous, in ways that made your life harder. \"Well, what is it?\" you finally ask. \"I'm glad you asked, Mistress.\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <i>second </i>coin represents the following stipulation: Barbara will <i>remain </i>unaware the entire time she's a doll. For a full 3 days, she will essentially be 'frozen' if you will, her last thought still the sight of you in her body. At the end of the 3 day period, you two will swap bodies, and she will 'unfreeze', with no memory of being a doll, and resuming her life as herself, in whatever location you happen to be in as her at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded great! To her, it will be as if nothing had happened at all, aside from the few seconds she was in your body. However, you knew better than to accept this at face value; the downsides were just coming up now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>However</i>,\" Merissa says, right on time. \"It is true that you will swap back to your own bodies...but I never said that you would stop being a doll.\" Your eyes widen at this, and Merissa just smiles. \"I am not a cruel genie, Mistress. Unlike Barbara, you will have full body movement, <i>but </i>you will remain plastic, unable to speak, and most importantly, unable to make wishes. This is where Barbara comes in. When she see's you as a doll, she will believe, against all logic, that you were somehow magically <i>trapped </i>in a doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...will be trapped in a doll, though?\" you say confusedly. \"Yes, but when you're not used to having wish-making genies around, it's easy to come to <i>different </i>conclusions.\" Merissa says. \"Regardless, she will <i>know </i>you're trapped in a doll, <i>but</i>...with you so vulnerable, there's no telling what she might do. So, in a twist of fate, you will be at the <i>mercy </i>of Barbara for... 4 days, at which point you'll turn back to normal! You better hope she's not one to take advantage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>4</i> days?!\" you complain. \"Why <i>4</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, please, it's only fair! This way, Barbara doesn't get to make a wish, and you have plenty of time to prepare! And don't act like spending time up close with Barbara is a bad thing...you <i>like </i>her! You wished yourself to be in her body!\" You huff angrily and look away, but you realize she's right. Being doll sized near Barbara sounded...like fun. Having her take care of you...let you close to her... But, wow, not only did you have to spend 3 days as Barbara, but you would have to spend an extra 5 days at the mercy of Barbara! What a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what did Merissa mean by that other line, \"Better hope she's not one to take advantage.\" <i>Was she</i>? What would Barbara even do to you? Force you to take pictures with you and her model car collection? Play dress-up with you? ...other things? At least Barbara didn't get a wish to use against you if you chose the second stipulation stipulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis simple wish was proving to be a serious time-sink. Unless, of course, you accepted the first stipulation, and took care of a motionless doll for 3 days, you'd have to spend 3 days as Barbara anyway, and then spend another 4 as a doll. A whole week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was spinning at this point, the consequences of your wish rearing their ugly head. \"Why'd you have to complicate things so much, Merissa?!\" you ask, jerking the toy car around to make a point. Unfazed, she answers. \"You tried to wish your way out of dealing with a stipulation, and your wish wasn't very nice. These things happen! Just pick one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you do, picking...</span></div></div>",

Plus, you did imagine her as a giantess when you were younger and carrying a crush for her; it's very intriguing to have that fantasy realized now somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Mistress,\" Merissa says as she crushes the three coins in her left hand into dust that trickles out of her tiny hand. She then flips the coin in her right hand up high up into the air. Your eyes manage to follow the tiny object as it arcs upward and over your head where it promptly starts to descend. You watch as it falls toward your forehead, only to be completely caught off guard when it connects like a hammer, knocking you down onto your shapely behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww!\" you say as you close your eyes and rub the stricken area with both your hands. As you massage your wound, you start to notice the air feels a little bit humid and moist, and it feels like you're sitting on porcelain instead of carpeted floor. You open your eyes and realize that you're now two inches tall and standing in the corner of Barbara's bathtub, just behind a bottle of shampoo! You look up and see your giant blonde neighbor standing in her shower with a shower cap on, facing her shower head and giving you a view of her sexy ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my,\" you whisper to yourself in a voice you notice is somewhat squeakier. You rise to your feet and notice that you're not wearing your heels. You look down and see why you felt exposed: your shorts and the shirt Barbara gave you have disappeared as well, leaving you in just your red bikini and thong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess a bathing suit is all I need here,\" you again whisper to yourself. You haven't even had a chance to check yourself out since making your initial wish, and you have to admit that you're enjoying being a sexy woman, if just for the moment. It's also pretty thrilling being tiny. Still, there's a bigger issue at hand at the moment and you turn your gaze back to Barbara, who is starting to turn around and face towards your side of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick gulp, you crouch behind the shampoo bottle and peek from behind it. You see that Barbara is now allowing the shower to wet her backside, meaning you now have a view of her incredible front side! Her wet skin glistens as you marvel at her glorious womanhood before shifting your vision to Barbara's large, perfect breasts. The giantess stretches her arms upward and bends her elbows behind her head, which causes her boobs to stick out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say quietly, definitely turned on by what you're seeing. You're starting to feel a little warm in your crotch when you suddenly notice that Barbara is turning her head to look in your direction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" Barbara says as she starts to bend over and reach toward you. You immediately tense up and duck behind the shampoo bottle and close your eyes, hoping that you don't get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait, that's up here!\" you hear Barbara say. Realizing nothing has been grabbed, you poke your head out and see that Barbara is turned around and reaching for a bottle of body wash sitting on an elevated shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief as you watch Barbara apply the body wash to a loofah sponge. That was definitely a close call, and it's making you rethink even being here right now. You think that Barbara is wearing a shower cap and so she probably wouldn't need the shampoo that's giving you cover, but that doesn't mean she wouldn't grab it to put it up somewhere and see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance to your left and see that there is a narrow ledge you could walk across to the other side of the tub, where you could grab onto the shower curtain and climb down to the bathroom floor. Merissa did say you'd stay shrunken until Barbara finished bathing; you could wait outside the tub in for her to complete her shower while staying out of her sight. Of course, you'd have to be careful, since the tub slopes down from the ledge you're looking at: one wrong step and you might wind up sliding into the tub, and find yourself at Barbara's feet!</span></div></div>",

You cautiously step out from behind the cover of the shampoo bottle and begin to carefully traverse the ledge of the tub by shimmying against the wall..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you scoot along the edge of the tub, you watch the giantess soap up her long, luxurious legs. You try not to stare for too long as you need keep going, as she could decide to turn around at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're halfway across the tub, you can see that she's started to work on her upper torso, holding her arms up to wash her pits. Suddenly, you notice Barbara lose her grip on her loofah sponge as it tumbles to the floor of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" she says as she bends over to pick it up. As she bends over, some of the water from the shower goes over her back and towards you and the shower wall. You raise your arms to try and shield yourself, but you're still getting pretty wet from the spray. Unfortunately, so is the surface you're standing on, which you quickly realize when you try to continue your shimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek!\" you squeak as you start to lose your footing and slip. Your back falls against the steep slope and you start to slide down into the tub. You're not sure if it's because of your currently reduced state, but you slide for what appears to be a pretty good distance before skidding to a stop in the center of Barbara's tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, crap, crap!\" you say as you attempt to bring your sopping wet form up so that you can try to get away from your unaware neighbor's feet. However, it's to no avail, as suddenly, Barbara starts to turn around and brings one of her feet down on your prone form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGGGGGH!\" you scream in pain as the weight of Barbara crushes down on you. You don't hear anything crunching or feel anything rupturing, but it's still not the most pleasant of experiences. Merissa did say no one would get seriously injured or killed as a result of her wish granting, so that's good at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" you hear Barbara say as she lifts her foot off of you. From your position on your back, you see her set her foot to the side and bend down to look at the soft thing she just stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy!? Oh, my God!\" Barbara shouts as she scoops you up with her free hand. \"Are you okay?\" You feel a rush in your stomach as Barbara straightens back up and lifts you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... okay, I guess,\" you say, lying in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on earth did you get so small?\" Barbara asks before raising an eyebrow. \"And in my bathtub?\" You consider answering that you don't know, but given the circumstances, it seems like you better be upfront with your answer. After all, once she stops bathing to tend to you, you'll reappear downstairs at full size, confirming that there's something unusual at work here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Nichols, I'm sorry,\" you say. \"I'm actually the boy next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't exactly look like the boy next door right now, Lucy,\" she says. \"I mean, in the face you do, but I just assumed you were cousins after saying that you and him were close but not 'romantic' close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true!\" you say. \"I had found a genie this morning and wished for infinite wishes. I got that wish but every wish I make comes with a stipulation that I have to choose. That new Camaro of mine? I wished for it, but when I got it, I had to choose a consequence. I chose the one that had me change into a near double of the model who posed with the Camaro in the magazine that I saw it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Barbara says. \"I did think you have what it takes to be a model. I was actually going to consider asking to be your agent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting off subject,\" Barbara says. \"Why are you so small right now? And in my tub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say, turning your eyes away from Barbara for a moment, \"when you walked into your bathroom to take your shower, I - accidentally, mind you! - I accidentally wished that I could watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" you respond, \"and the choices for stipulations were either for me to take control of your body and shower as you or be shrunk down and placed in your tub until you finished bathing. I chose the latter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously,\" says Barbara. \"And you say this lasts until I finish bathing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Nichols,\" you say. \"Look, I'm really sorry, like I said, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" Barbara says, bringing her other finger to her lips before pointing it at you. \"I don't know if I would have believed the first parts of your story, but clearly, it would explain how someone being as impossibly small as you are now is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara continues...</span></div></div>",

I only drove it, like, for a few seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like I'll take it away from your sight forever, Master!\" Merissa laughs. \"In fact, I'll give it to your neighbor here! She has a model's body and the car's already in her driveway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how badly I need a new car,\" Barbara says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, what's the other stipulation?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa holds up the coin in her right hand, which depicts the size-changing figure you've seen before. \"This coin represents the following stipulation; the terms of the stipulation for the previous wish will change. Instead of returning to normal downstairs when Barbara finishes her shower, you will remain at your current height and up here when she's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, so I'd have to wish to grow back and get another stipulation,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's make things more interesting,\" Merissa says as she somehow produces another coin from behind the size-changing coin. You see that it depicts a large figure wearing a crown and pointing at a smaller figure. \"This coin adds this to the stipulation: you won't be able to grow at all until Barbara allows it, even if you wish for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you say with widening eyes before looking back to the blonde behemoth holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do need to have a little chat about all of this,\" Barbara laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will say that once Barbara decides you can grow back up, it'll happen without a wish,\" Merissa adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, <i>if</i> she decides to let me grow back, you think to yourself as you don't want to give Barbara any ideas.

Maybe you can make it up to me somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also,\" Barbara adds, \"feel free to call me 'Barbara,' 'Lucy.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Merissa clears her throat to get your attention. \"Mistress, we have some business to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" you sigh. \"The stipulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind stepping out of the tub to talk so I can finish my shower?\" Barbara asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Barbara,\" you say as you step out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she says as she closes the curtain. You turn your attention to Merissa who is holding her hands out closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mistress,\" Merissa begins,  \"you should know that even though you're currently at your original size, the rest of the arrangement will still occur: once Barbara ends her shower, you will reappear downstairs on Barbara's couch, ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose that makes sense,\" you say. \"There wouldn't be any need for size-changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There won't be a need for size-changing,\" Merissa says as she turns her fists and unclenches them, \"but there will be size-changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the coins and see that they both depict the size-changing figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you say. \"What's your obsession with wanting to shrink me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about shrinking, Mistress?\" Merissa laughs. \"The coin in my left hand represents the following stipulation: the stipulation of the previous wish is modified to state that once you reappear downstairs, you'll start growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing? How big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, let's see,\" the genie says as it looks like she's doing some calculations in her head. \"You were two inches, you were going to be changed to 5'10\", so that's... 35 times... so... you'll be about 204 feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just for fun,\" Merissa says with a devious grin, \"your clothes won't grow with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, I'll be big and naked!\" you say as you look down at your sexy body, which is almost there as it is with your bikini and thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, try to run outside if you choose that one!\" Barbara calls out from behind the shower curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the second one?\" you ask. \"If I pick that one and you're not going to shrink me, are you just going to grow me differently somehow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, Mistress,\" Merissa says. \"If you choose the coin in my right hand, the stipulation of the previous wish will be modified so that once you appear downstairs, Barbara will be the one to start growing, until she's just a a couple of feet shy of 200 feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the shower curtains slide open a bit as Barbara sticks her head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" she shouts. \"Why are you involving me in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, Madam, my Mistress did point out she'd return to normal height when you were done, bathing but you convinced her to wish herself back,\" Merissa explains. \"She wouldn't have made this wish if not for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wouldn't have asked her to grow back if she hadn't been...\" Barbara starts to protest before she develops a sour look on her face, rolls her eyes and nods in reluctant acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy,\" you neighbor says as she faces towards you, \"if you pick that one, I'll try to hurry up and get out of the house before it's too late when I finish up here. You should do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbara?\" you say. \"'If?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have really a say in the matter,\" she says. \"Whatever you choose, we'll deal with it afterwards. Just be ready to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, okay,\" you say as she closes her shower curtain. You look back at Merissa's hands. You liked seeing Barbara as a nude giantess but you're pretty sure she'll like being that way for the entire neighborhood. Then again, you're not so sure you would, either! Barbara seems to have accepted she might be the one to grow... maybe you should, too.</span></div></div>",

You glance around the living room for a brief moment before you hear footsteps running upstairs as a door opens. you look upstairs and see Barbara at the top, dripping wet and already looking taller than usual!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run, Lucy!\" Barbara shouts as she starts to climb down the stairs, her glistening, ever-increasing breasts jiggling with each step. You come back to your senses and jump out of your seat and run for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the door, you open it and look back to Barbara, who's nearing the bottom of her stairs. Unfortunately, the combination of her feet being both wet and expanding catch up with her and she trips, landing chest first on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" she shouts as she starts to push herself off the ground, still growing every second. She gets to her feet, but finds that her head is already near the ceiling. Sighing, she kneels and start to run to the door again, only to stumble over her coffee table in her haste, crushing it into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy!\" Barbara roars as you as she continues to grow. \"I'm not going to make it! Get away from the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and bolt out the door to the edge of her yard, the look back to see that she's almost completely filled up the living room. At this rate, she'll explode from her house in a few seconds! You think quickly; you could use a wish to get her safely outside and spare her home from being demolished, though that does mean taking a stipulation. Of course, if you let her grow through it, you could always wish to repair it (or wish for a better house for her). You're still probably going to make a wish; it's just a matter of when.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You barely had the time to regret your hasty decision as Barbara magically poofed into the air above you, what must've been over 50 feet tall already and still growing. You cried out in surprise, but went quiet as she crushed you. Truthfully, you expected to die, but you didn't feel like you were in pain? In fact, you didn't feel half bad...that must be Merissa's doing. But what was going on? You just felt really...compressed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara had managed to destroy her favorite coffee table, and she was pretty sure she might've damaged the drywall. But she realized that she'd probably be breaking a bit more than a few of her belongings as she swelled up to titanic proportions. \"Does insurance cover this?\" she mused, the living room becoming more claustrophobic as time went on. In a short time, she was filling up the living room completely, crouching in order to avoid busting the ceiling at a surprising 16 feet tall. \"Am I really going to burst out of the ceiling?\" she asked herself, the absurdity of her question flying over her as she seriously contemplated her plan of action. As she continued to grow, her spacious living room became less spacious as she reached a whopping 40 feet tall, lying down on her stomach as her legs stretched into another room. \"Maybe I'll knock down a wall and crawl out, but...the rest of the house might fall on me. Damnit, Lucy, you're going to have to pay me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-back for...Woah!\" she said, the air around her turning cold as she slammed into the dirt ass-first. \"What the hell did...? Did Lucy make a wish?\" \"Indeed she did!\" came a weaker voice from below. Looking down to the ground, she saw the woman claiming to be Lucy's genie standing between her open legs, reminding her of her 'little' nudity problem. \"My mistress used a wish to teleport you outside safely, so that way your home wouldn't be <i>completely </i>destroyed.\" \"That's...great.\" Lucy said, using an arm to hide her naughty bits from the genie; sure, she may be a genie, but she was getting an eyeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rest of the neighborhood would be soon, so it hardly mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...where is she now? What stipulation did she pick?\" \"In her haste to get you outside, she picked one without looking at what it was. You <i>could </i>say that she's right under our very noses right now!\" Merissa said with a smirk. Barbara rolled her eyes. \"So, what, you shrank her again? That's not a very good idea, considering how huge I am...and I'm getting!\" she added, realizing that her body was still sliding across over the ground as she continued expanding. \"Oh, no! I didn't shrink her. But you <i>could </i>say she's feeling a bit compressed right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara blinked blankly. \"...what are you...?\" she began and stopped asking, as a possibility dawned on her. Carefully, she managed to get off the ground and stand up...and finally take stock of how big she was. She was already 100 feet tall! Which was mind boggling. But the proof was in front of her, as her 2 story house looked like a child's play thing, and it would look smaller in a minute! But that <i>wasn't</i> why she stood up. She stood up in order to check where her cheeks had landed. And the spot she had occupied now resembled two circular piles of mud. Devoid of any signs of Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...so she wasn't under me.\" \"Don't think I'd rule that out so soon!\" came a voice from underneath her. Glancing down, she saw a tiny Merissa standing on a singular boob, at such an angle that nobody but a genie would be able to. \"She's a bit closer to you than you'd think. And you definitely sat on her.\" Gears turned in Barbara's head as she thought about what Merissa said, when eventually it clicked. \"...you're kidding me. There's no way.\" Merissa just smiled, prompting Barbara to sigh as she carefully craned her head to get a peak at own behind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she had sat on something alright. A bunch of dirt. But also a... pink disk? Carefully, after scraping away some dirt, she got under it with a fingernail and peeled it off. It felt just like taking off a band-aid. Reluctantly, she brought it up to her face to examine it, and almost felt a little light headed after seeing what it was. This was getting absurd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, but in reality was 3 minutes at <i>most</i>, you felt large hands pulling you off of...something. You guessed that Barbara had found you? Whatever the case was, you were whisked to the front of her face, and were a bit surprised to see her so large again, though you knew she would get this large. \"What's going on, Barbara?\" was something you wanted to ask, but you couldn't really talk. This caused you to panic a little bit, and you tried to move, but couldn't. Barbara could tell you were distressed, so she dropped a bombshell on you: \"Sorry Lucy, but I might have sat on you just a <i>liiiiiittle </i>bit. You... look like a pancake in a bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, Mistress!\" calls up Merissa, having changed to the \"relaxing in cleavage\" position, not that you could tell. \"I would've explained the terms of this stipulation in more detail, but you didn't allow me to! The rules of my magic do not allow you to get harmed in any way, shape, or form as a result of what I do; so you were <i>harmlessly </i>flattened by the shapely behind of your neighbor.\" This made sense, but you were hardly pleased to hear that this was something that could even happen! You felt flat and floppy, and not in control at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, change me back!\" you tried to say, but again, couldn't. \"Yelling isn't going to do you any good right now, mistress, but you needn't worry! Your body will return to its original shape in a few hours!\" A few hours? You weren't sure you could wait that long. Plus, you were missing Barbara's show! \"I'd like to make a wish, Merissa.\" you again try to say, without saying anything. \"Do you <i>wish </i>to make a wish, Mistress?\" Merissa asks, even though she shouldn't know what you said. \"Madam, if you could bring her down to my level? I'll simply read her lips to decipher her request.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara grumbled something about Merissa finding a different place to sit, but obliged, holding you in front of her at breast level. \"My, mistress, if I didn't know any better I'd mistake you for a flag, fluttering in the wind.\" You didn't find that very funny, so you made your wish, not spending enough time to think about the wording;</span></div></div>",

Is that correct? Blink once for yes and blink twice for no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink once, and then roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Mistress,\" Merissa says as she snaps her fingers. Instantly, you're surrounded by swirling pink smoke that completely obscures your vision. You feel yourself starting to fill out again, but something's different, yet familiar, about the form you're taking. The smoke clears and you realize that you're back in your yard, not in your neighbor's huge hand in her yard. In fact, she doesn't seem to be in her yard, either; least, you're certain you would see her as big as she was. All you can see is your shiny new Camaro sitting in your driveway next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I granted you wish, Master!\" Merissa says, prompting you to turn and face her. \"You wished to be back to how you was before, so I rewound time and brought us back to before you were changed at all; before you chose the first stipulation for your new car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so does this mean I choose again?\" you say. \"Well, being a girl wasn't so bad, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh-uh, Master,\" Merissa says as she wags a finger while reaching into her purse with her free hand. \"The terms are changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changing?\" you nervously say as she pulls out some coins and places two in her left hand and two in her right. She then holds up her left hand, and you see that one of the coins depicts a contract, and the other depicts a large hand taking a present away from a pair of smaller hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa begins, \"These coins represent the following stipulation: because you have effectively undone the stipulation you originally chose when you became this vehicle's owner, you are no longer entitled to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I won't have it?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that,\" Merissa says, \"but you can never wish for it again, nor any other motor vehicle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm not a fan of deja vu,\" Merissa says. \"You sound upset by this, Master. If you wanted, you could wish to be able to make that wish again and effectively undo that portion of the stipulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, knowing that means effectively taking on two stipulations - one when you wish to be able to make the wish, and another when you actually make the wish. Still, there's other ways of getting a car, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the second stipulation?\" you ask. Merissa responds by lifting up her right hand and showing two familiar coins: the gender-swap coin and the size changing coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you that recognize these coins, Master,\" Merissa says. \"They are the first that I showed you when we were in this position earlier. You had a choice between them before, but now, the stipulations they represented are combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to when this moment was actually before; you chose the gender-swap coin and were transformed into the model in your magazine who posed with the vehicle, although with a feminized version of your face. You also wound up with some of her skills, such as actually being qualified to drive the vehicle and able to do so responsibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just admitted that being 'Lucy' wasn't so bad, Master,\" Merissa continues, \"but will it be so easy if you're as big as your new car's fuel tank is full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOof. You had forgotten what that size-changing coin represented until Merissa reminded you. your size will change in proportion to how full the car's tank is. If it's a quarter full, you'll be one-fourth of your size. You remember Merissa said you wouldn't end up any smaller than an inch, and also that the tank was currently full, so you wouldn't shrink right away. Still, you realize that there's a good chance you'd be getting smaller, and not necessarily in the confines of someone's home like you were earlier. Barbara wasn't so rough with you (aside from accidentally stepping on you) but could you count on other people to be the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be fun... but maybe it's better just to let this dream go for now.</span></div></div>",

Maybe if you had done some things differently...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" you hear a familiar voice call out. You look up and see that it's coming from Barb - well, Ms. Nichols. You don't have that level of familiarity now, a fact that you're reminded of as she is normal-sized and clothed in her jogging attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi, Ms. Nichols,\" you say as she jogs over to you. \"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look depressed,\" she says as she reaches you. \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say, deciding to avoid mentioning the parts about you having a genie and being shrunken and spying on her in the shower and making her grow and nearly destroying her home, \"I thought I had a fantastic opportunity but it didn't turn out as I hoped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?

You know, do some yard work, some cleaning, stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I could handle that,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Ms. Nichols says with a smile. \"I need to get home right now and clean up after my jog, but I'll call you later to discuss the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Nichols!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, and thank you, too!\" your neighbor says as she turns to walk back over to her house.

Besides, I've just made an arrangement with Ms. Nichols and I don't want to ruin it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself, Master,\" Merissa laughs. \"But let me ask, what is the point of having unlimited wishes if you won't make any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of having them if they're just going to make me miserable afterwards?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now, Master,\" Merissa says. \"You seemed to not mind being a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did mind getting stepped on and flattened,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, none of that would have happened if you chose the other stipulation I gave you,\" Merissa points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just could have been stuck as Barbara for three days,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you didn't hurry, Master!\" Merissa responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I did, I'm sure even more bad stuff would happen,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't going to be very fun for me if you're not going to make any wishes, Master,\" Merissa says. \"If you're really having buyer's remorse, perhaps I could offer you another deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another deal?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is wish for it,\" Merissa says. \"I'll offer you stipulations that change the terms of our agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder what Merissa just told you. Being rid of these coins would be a relief, but at least now, if you make a wish, you have some idea of what you're getting into. If you wish for another deal, there's no telling what you'll get stuck with!</span></div></div>",

One more time and we'll be done with them,\" Merissa says as she suddenly sprouts two additional arms from her body, like the one you saw previously when you wished for the ever-burgeoning Barbara to be removed form her house. With one hand holding her coin purse open, she reaches in with her other three appendages and pulls out one coin in each hand. She then drops the coin purse and it disappears - forever, you hope. Good riddance. Merissa uses her free hand to direct your attention to the first coin, which shows a figure that seems to be swapping souls with another. You think it must be like the one Merissa detailed to you earlier but was too small for you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin represents the Price of the Nomadic Soul,\" Merissa explains. \"You'll be able to make unlimited wishes, but when you do, your soul will be transferred into a person nearby and you will essentially become them. Also, you must spend an hour as that person before you can make another wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what would happen to my current body?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'He' would continue on auto-pilot, as if he were you,\" Merissa says. \"'He' wouldn't be aware of me, however, and would assume whatever you wished for was always the case. Regardless of the body you're in, you will always be able to make wishes, at least once an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And be swapping bodies,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should clarify that you won't be able to wish to body swap yourself, as that will automatically be happening,\" your genie says. \"Also, you won't be put into animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'd be hard to wish if I couldn't talk,\" you say as Merissa directs you to her second coin, which depicts the same size-changing figure from so many times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin represents the Price of the Big Deal,\" she says. \"You'll be able to make unlimited wishes, but you'll be reduced to six inches tall, and you can't wish to be any bigger than that, nor make anyone as small as you. Any other way you might think of to try and wish around it will always backfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one sounds a little bit more straightforward,\" you say. \"At least it wouldn't be compounding like the Price of the Bargain. Still, I don't know if I'd want to be that small all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, there's the third option,\" Merissa says as she directs you to the third coin, which depicts three figures, with the one in the middle apparently brokering an agreement between the other two figures, one of which is dressed like a genie. \"This coin represents the Price of Intermediary. You'll get your wishes, but you'll have to earn them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earn them?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, by doing other people favors,\" Merissa says. \"Wish-type favors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems selfish to have infinite wishes just for yourself, don't you think?\" Merissa explains. \"Before I'll grant you a wish, you must convince someone else to make a wish. Once I've granted that wish, you'll be entitled to make one wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I just wish for them?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they'll have a better idea of what they want than you,\" the genie says. \"How you get them to wish will be up to you, but you must get them to make the wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, and what if I don't like what they wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not up to you,\" Merissa says with a wicked grin. \"You'll be able to spend a wish to undo another, but only after three wishes have been made after the one you wish to undo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel the Price of the Intermediary is just a different version of the Price of the Bargain, with someone else besides Merissa making the stipulations. The other two Prices she's offered could make it difficult to actually enjoy your wishes, unless you're careful. It's a tough choice but you've made your wish; there's no going back now!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes shift between the three coins rapidly, your mind working on overtime to decide what is <i>better</i>. Frankly, you were getting <i>tired </i>of all the trouble surrounding wish making. Making wishes with the Price of the Bargain was a hassle, because while you enjoyed some of the choices presented, you were usually stuck trying to decide which stipulation was the lesser of two evils. And, frankly, these other choices weren't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Price of the Nomadic Soul promised control over your wishmaking, but at the expense of, well, <i>being someone else</i>. And that sounded like a lot of fun, but say you wished for something you didn't like. You'd have to wait an entire hour just to undo it! Not to mention you might end up as someone you didn't like being, like someone who's out of shape or elderly. And would you even know how to impersonate them? Would you know any of their skills?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I chose the Price of the Nomadic Soul,\" you begin, choosing to voice your concerns, \"Would I know how to act as whoever I possess? Would I obtain their skills?\" Merissa seemed thoughtful for a moment, as clearly she hadn't considered that. \"Perhaps,\" she begins, shrugging, \"You will gain any <i>necessary </i>skills and information. But I decide what's 'necessary' of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed <i>fine</i>, but you just knew that Merissa would probably put you into uncomfortable situations because some info wasn't 'necessary'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over to the \"Price of Intermediary\", you recall what Merissa said about that one, and it's even worse than the first one! Well, okay, on paper it seems fair. Hoarding unlimited wishes for oneself is kind of selfish. But giving out the power of an actual wish to anyone else is a dangerous idea, and even more dangerous is that in order to make a wish of your own, you <i>have </i>to do that. And what if nobody is around to share a wish with? Your \"infinite wishes\" won't help you then. So cross that one off the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Price of the Big Deal...seemed like a lot less hassle. Granted, you would be 6 inches tall, and you could never make anyone your own size or grow bigger ever again! But on the other hand...you would still have unlimited wishes. Aside from the whole being small thing, everything you did from then on out would be relatively hassle free (you hoped).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, although it seems crazy to admit it, you did have fun at 2 inches tall in Barbara's shower, as short-lived at that was. And 6 inches was a significant improvement over your previous size! And, if you so chose...you could go back down to 2 inches tall. Or smaller...? The experience of spying on Barbara at that height was one you enjoyed way too much, you're realizing. You didn't realize you had such... voyeuristic tendencies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever! <i>Those </i>thoughts aside, the other benefits of the Price of the Big Deal <i>seemed </i>to outway the downsides. Or maybe you were just fed up with all these terrible choices, and just wanted to pick something <i>to pick something</i>? Whatever the case, you finally turn and face Merissa, mind made-up. \"Merissa! I've made my decision.\" you proclaim, and Merissa lights up at this. \"Yes, master, what will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to tell her your choice, but you suddenly feel yourself getting cold feet. 6 inches tall, forever? Would it be forever? Could you wish to undo this price at some other greater cost, like you did the price of the bargain? Shaking your head, you finally get the words out. \"I choose the Price of the Big Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa's smiles becomes wider, more mischievous after telling her your choice. \"Excellent choice, master. I'm <i>certain </i>you won't regret it.\" She says with a wink. Her upper set of arms toss the other coins up into the air, arms retracting into her body as the unchosen options magically turn to dust. Her lower arms sliiiide up to where normal arms should be, and she twirls the coin representing the Price of the Big Deal around in her fingers, before raising it up to her face, giving it a kiss, and flicking it high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as it soars higher and higher, before just as quickly falling down...towards you! Right as you expect it to hit you, however, it seems to freeze in place relative to you, ever-twirling in the air. You blink, trying to understand why, when the sight of your porch rushing high above you catches your eye and it clicks; you're shrinking as fast as its falling! The world zooms away from you, and you feel like you're <i>falling </i>before suddenly you <i>stop </i>and the coin threatens to<i> crush you </i>at high speeds...before predictably turning into pink smoke on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving away the smoke, you take in the sight of the world around you. Everything was huge, of course! Your house looked like an insurmountable mountain far above you, your lawn appeared to be a vast plain, and Merissa herself appeared to be an imposing giantess. You knew that she was good looking, but you were struck by the sight as if seeing it for the first time due to your new viewpoint. (Granted, you'd been small in the presence of Merissa before, but you were dealing with <i>another </i>giantess at the time.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you come to the realization that you're standing on the middle of your porches steps, your whole body about as tall as a single step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your life now. (For the time being, at least.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can't help but feel a little giddy as you stare up at Merissa, the lightly clothed giantess staring down at you with a bemused smirk and an arched eyebrow. Actually, you mostly felt lightheaded. It wasn't just now hitting you that what's going on was real, but the shock-value hasn't worn off yet so you can only continue to be amazed at the absurdity of what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly, you wonder if you'd eventually become numb to this sort of thing and not find it exciting anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to...<i>admire </i>Merissa from this angle, you think about what the first thing you want to wish for is. That's why you chose the Price of the Big Deal after all. Wish freedom! But what was worth wishing for...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the obvious problem of not being able to get around very well, being so small and all. Perhaps you should immediately wish for something like the ability to <i>Fly</i>...yeah, that'd solve the problem! If you could just fly around, getting around as someone so <i>small </i>would be a cinch. And you've gotta start somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you have so many things you could also make a wish for. It's a little irresponsible to <i>not </i>wish for flying, but as you stare up at Merissa's form, completely shadowed by the sun...you think being at the mercy of the world for a while might not be so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few things you wished for previously that you could wish for again, aswell. The car was really nice, though if you wished for it now it'd have to be toy car sized. Appearing in Ms. Nichols bathroom had, well, excited you a great deal, though now you felt a little dirty even considering it now that you got to know her a little better (and considering you told Merissa that you didn't want to do that a few moments ago, you didn't feel like going back on your word. But spying on someone else...?) And being a woman? It was, well, also quite nice, if you were being honest with yourself. And since you were now in total control of wishes, nothing was stopping you from making the change, only to turn back into yourself later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, you did have unlimited wishes...you could wish for a lot of things. It was almost overwhelming. But, after much deliberation, you settled on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing this, Merissa's monolithic form suddenly crouched down to get closer to you, giving you a bit of a scare before you realized you were, <i>ahem</i>, now on the same level as her boobs. \"Master?\" Merissa finally said, and you realize you've just been staring as you look up to meet the smirk of an amused Merissa. Your face felt flush with embarrassment (although at this point, you weren't sure Merissa really cared. Infact, she seemed to relish in the attention). \"Would you like to make a wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, right. \"I would like to, Merissa!\" you say, stepping a bit closer to the edge of the porch step. \"I wish...\"</span></div></div>",

Best to start off with something simple, something that Merissa couldn't have backfire on you.<br>\r\nSuddenly as breeze blew by, and though not strong, at your tiny state it chilled you to the bone. You looked down, the quick head motion making you a little dizzy. When your vertigo subsided you gasped! Yes, you were completely naked, but what shocked you was the size of your cock! It was easily twice the length, twice the diameter as well! It jutted out from your nether regions like a monument.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I thought you might like what I arranged down there sweetie. I'm pretty strict with the \u201cnot getting bigger\u201d thing, so I figured I'd make use of the shrink. Having a barely visible cock wouldn't have been any fun for us girls.\u201d She giggled. \u201cThat's now the max size, you can make it smaller if you want, but this is as big as it or you will ever get.\u201d She paused before continuing, \u201cJust a bit of warning though, I doubled ALL the proportions. Therefore it now effectively takes up 8X the original volume, which means quite a lot more blood any time you try to stare at little ole\u2019 me. All the redirected blood will make you pretty woozy, which just means more incapacitating fun from us girls!\u201d She smiled devilishly. Then her face quickly turned to feigned pity. \u201cIt's a shame you chose the big deal, you were about to hit another growth spurt too!What a big, strapping, muscular man you would've been! Unfortunately for all those hot, horny, female models out there, I had to stunt your growth. Again I'm pretty strict about the whole \u201cnot getting bigger\u201d thing, I couldn't have you squeezing out that last few inches and muscles of late puberty, at least relative to you, so I cut your development off entirely! So don't waste your breath trying to get it back or growing. Although I'm sure you won't mind being dominated by all us helpless girls, you did choose this after all.\u201d She winked at you, too knowingly for your comfort.<br>\r\nYou would have to let all that sink in later. At the moment you felt incredibly self conscious with Merissa speaking so fondly of your dick and lack of muscles. Another breeze jolted you again, especially breezy around your exposed \u201cequipment\".<br>\r\nYou looked back up at Merissa who was staring at you hungrily with her unsettlingly beautiful yet slightly crazy eyes. <br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you weakly said: \u201cMerissa I wish for some clothes!\u201d<br>\r\nShe snapped her fingers, continuing her hungry gaze, you quickly looked down to find that you were still naked. \u201cHey nothing happened!\u201d You shouted up at the pert giantess genie above you.<br>\r\n\u201cI granted your wish, you now own clothes.\u201d She said coyly, \u201cBUT they are currently located on Jupiter\u2019s icy moon of Europa encased under 2 miles of surface ice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUghhh! I wish I had clothes ON my body!\u201d You angstily demanded.<br>\r\n\u201cOoohhhh, yeah of course! Sure thing.\u201d Merissa snapped again and this time it got very dark and you were crashed into by a very heavy fabric, bringing you crashing to the ground, much to the pain (and pleasure) of your still very erect penis.<br>\r\nYou turned around and tried to crawl out from the massive fabric on top of you. \u201cMERISSA! I wish I had clothing for a six inch tall man on my body PLEASE!\u201d You angrily asked.<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha, ok, totally got you!\u201d She snapped once again and you were immediately met with intense pain and pressure in your penis and balls. You looked down to find them trapped in a massively stretched, but far too tight red mankini. You immediately and painfully tried to pull your massive cock out, but it was just too tight against it, and all the rubbing just hardened it further, much to your pain.<br>\r\n\u201cI WISH THEY WERE OFF!\u201d You screamed quickly.<br>\r\nYou felt relief on your cock once again as it instantly sprung up from its previously tucked position smacking you in the abs.<br>\r\n\u201cOk Merissa please, just let me\u2026, UGH! I just wish I'm wearing something that fits!\u201d You frustratingly pleaded<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess I can tailor!\u201d She said enthusiastically. She snapped once again.<br>\r\nYou felt warmer all of the sudden, with the weight of clothes hanging from you, still a little pressure in the crotch, but then again you did have an erection. You looked down to once again see your junk. Surprised this time by the change in feeling, you reached down to find that there was tented fabric over it and soft fabric all over your body in fact, yet it was invisible. Slightly less annoyed you once again stared up to see Merissa with her same hungry expression, giggling at your squirming, causing her momentous breasts to jiggle and the pressure in your invisible pants to increase. <br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever heard of that old story: The King\u2019s New Clothes?\u201d She paused to your silent response of fuming as she laughed some more. \u201cWell I kind of inspired it. And you actually never said you wanted them to be visible! Or permanent for that matter!\u201d She widened her beaming eyes to emphasize her point as you felt the weight of the clothes dissipate and the cold wind once again brush you nakedly as your cock sprung up from now non-existent confines. <br>\r\n\u201cSuch a cute little writhling thing!\u201d She said cheerfully said while beaming down at your diminutive form. You were unsure whether she meant your cock or you yourself, but it was probably a lot of both.<br>\r\nTired of the back and forth and seemingly endless fight for even simple clothing, you submitted. \u201cAlright Merissa fine! I'll just stay cold and naked! Is that what you want?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOohh sweetie, you're finally getting it!\u201d She squealed in delight before leaning down further, her breasts oozing heat in front of you, her warm breath washing over you. \u201cWell, cold\u2026 not so much\u2026 I'm sure I could think of a few ways to warm you up.\u201d She teased as your eyes immediately flew to her buxomy breasts with a warranted tightening of your cock. <br>\r\nYou only got to stare for a second before it all went sailing skyward as she popped up to stand sending you flying backward. <br>\r\nWhen you looked up you saw that she had disappeared. You stood up and felt a warm breath wash against your back as Merissa's voice whispered, \u201cCall if you need me, shorty.\u201d You felt a wonderful pinching sensation around your cock, that caused you to gasp. In a moment it was gone, along with the warmth of her breath. <br>\r\nYou turned around to find nothing but the huge expanse of the new gigantic world you hadn't yet experienced. Tired of the wish game at the moment you decided to take some time off from Merissa and explore your new size, just dealing with the cold like a man\u2026 Well a 6 inch tall man, but still! <br>\r\nYou start to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In an instant, the bubble expands, causing your crushed body to reform to its previous three-dimensional shape. You gasp, mostly to allow air to return to your lungs, but also because you realize you're really high in the air, your waist being held between Barbara's thumb and finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, here,\" Barbara says as she sets you into the palm of her other hand, giving you a less precarious perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Barbara,\" you say as you stand up, realizing that your heels are gone.

You'll be able to look away eventually, but you don't really want to right now. You're enjoying Merissa teasing you with her body, and surprisingly, the shrinking it's causing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling you're actually enjoying the shrinking,\" Merissa laughs. \"Not to mention, you haven't really complained much about being a woman, either. Should I start calling you, 'Mistress,' Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-call me whatever you like, Merissa!\" you stammer as you start to go past her knees.

No way would this mansion fit there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it could!\" Merissa says. \"If I shrunk it down, of course. I'd shrink you, too, so you could fit inside it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, what's the other stipulation?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa holds up her right hand, showing a token that depicts two figures with two arrows between them, each pointing towards one of the figures. \"This coin represents the following stipulation; I'll relocate some of your neighbors, remove or warp a couple of streets and clear some land, extending your mother's property enough that you could fit this mansion there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, but it would still be my mother's property,\" you say. \"I was kind of hoping to have my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you will, Master!\" Merissa says. \"I'll swap your body with your mother's body! Then it will all be yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't be aware of the change,\" Merissa says. \"She'll act as if she's always been you. But you'll be aware, and you'll be the one in charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... I'll be my mom!\" you whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha!\" Merissa laughs, \"Those are my stipulations, Master. Remember, you MUST choose one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just your first wish, you're starting to realize just how hairy these stipulations could be. You could always wish to undo the one you choose later, but that would bring about another stipulation. For now, which one do you choose to deal with?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAll right Merissa, I choose the first coin.\u201d You respond reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it is tiny, the mansion will be yours, and looking around there's obviously plenty to do. If need be, you could use an additional wish to alter your circumstances, but you have to be really careful about these stipulations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Master if that's what you want!\u201d She enthusiastically said, giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a woosh of air around you and a blinding light. Your vision returns and you find your face is directly level with Merissa\u2019s shapely ass. She turns around bringing her crotch to your eye-level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you look so adorable at midget height.\u201d She mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around quickly to find that your were still in the mansion, now with sunlight pouring in from the windows, but what she said was true. Relative to the mansion, you were now only 3 feet tall. Your shirt was hanging off you, almost touching the floor, and you had already lost your pants and underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY what gives!\u201d you shout up at her, but at your height, most of the yell goes straight into her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you that you'd be shrunk, master, but I never said how much.\u201d She said cunningly. \u201cOh! And it looks like you're not done yet either!\u201d She announced, smirking, as you noticed Merissa's face far above you getting higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive breasts were seemingly expanding forward as they blocked your view of her snickering face and you got lower to the ground. Shocked, you were unable to speak, taking in her widening thighs in your descent. At 18 inches high your shirt fell off entirely, with you passing through the neck hole. You were now completely nude, and only about a quarter of your original height at the feet of the beautiful giantess Merissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god, what have I gotten myself into!?\u201d You asked yourself. Although you had to admit you did enjoy the view displayed by the Genie above. \u201cHow am I supposed to live here now?!\u201d You protested. Obviously doing anything would be a struggle at your size, particularly going up the many, many flights of stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa bent down, her boobs rolling forward as she did so and placing her hands on her knees. Her long cleavage and the dominant expression on her beautiful face provided an excellent stimulus for your now tiny cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve thought more before you made this decision, Master.\u201d Adding an ironic emphasis to that last word. It certainly didn't feel like you were the master in this circumstance, Merissa seemed to be getting a lot more enjoyment out her servitude than you were. As if reading your thoughts she said, \u201cWell it isn't all bad.\u201d Giving your hard little cock a flick, the quick movement causing her jugs to shake. The sheer force of the flick caused you to jump, not so much out of pain as out of pleasure. \u201cObviously you're enjoying yourself a least little bit, and so far you've only made one wish.\u201d She said with a knowing smile. She obviously had a lot in store for you, and if you were being completely honest with yourself, you couldn't help but feel a little excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you take a look outside, you may like what you see.\u201d She said, then stood up straight in a gorgeous jiggling movement, before using her long legs to walk out of the room and down the stairs, most likely to the front door. Your eyes following her awesome swaying ass all the way out of the room. You were left alone with the sudden realization that at your size even looking outside the windows would be no easy task, you figured you might as well look out the front door since you'd be living here anyway. You decided just to go naked as any article of your clothing was much too large to carry. Unfortunately you had to climb down a two flights of stairs with steps more than half your height. You got to work lowering yourself down each step in a very slow and careful process. You didn't want to imagine what going up would be like. Eventually you made it down all the steps to the ground floor where the front door was to find Merissa had already opened it and was standing on the front porch. You went out to join her. It took your eyes a minute to adjust to the sunlight, but once they did you saw that the mansion was not where you thought it was. <br>\r\n\u201cThis isn't the lot at the end of the street! This is someone's backyard!\u201d You observed. Your mansion was tiny as promised, but instead it was located within a fenced in backyard behind a regular sized house. It did look strangely familiar though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically it is a lot at the end of your street, but, obviously not the one you were thinking of though. I received a very gracious offer from a woman in the neighborhood to rent the space. She was ecstatic at the opportunity.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why? Who? When did you even have time to do all this?\u201d You asked, obviously perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a Genie sweetie.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, the grass looks huge, how small are we?\u201d You implored up to your towering servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell me or you? Because there's a big difference.\u201d She laughed at her own joke before continuing, \u201cI decided around two regular inches tall was a great height for you, so I shrunk everything based on that. With the house being designed for someone 4 times your height, my current size, that equates to about 10 inches my size equaling about one regular inch. So I shrunk the mansion ten-fold. It now only takes up a 7 foot by 4 foot plot of land between these two trees.\u201d She explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a load rumble. \"I think it's time you met your landlady.\" Merissa said with a deviant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour landlady is:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though you've had a fantasy of being a shrunken man, you're not sure you're ready to deal with the impracticality that would come with such a choice. Unappealing as it is, you choose the other option. At least you'll be full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, I choose the second coin,\" you say with a wince. \"I'll swap bodies with my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Master,\" Merissa says as she tosses the other coin behind her back, which disappears in a cloud of disintegrating glitter in midair. She then walks up to you with her right palm raised, smiles at you, and then quickly thrusts her palm into your chest, pushing you back a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you say as you look down and see that the coin is stuck to your chest. You don't even have time to consider pulling it off as it starts to glow brighter and brighter each nanosecond until it simply becomes to intense to look at. You instinctively close your eyes tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, instantly, you feel different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and, still looking down, you see that you have a decidedly more feminine form than before, which is wearing an incredibly well-tailored dress suit with a black dress and pink jacket, along with black stockings and heels. This isn't something you've ever seen your mother wear before, but you figured she would if she were rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see that the decor of your new bedroom has changed from stuff that you'd choose to stuff that your mother would choose: more lacy and feminine stuff. On the walls are photos of you, your mother, and your late father. You walk over to the dresser mirror and confirm that, yes, you are indeed in your mother's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" you say with your mother's voice as you feel her shoulder-length, brown, spiral permed hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look wonderful, Master! Or should I say, 'Mistress?'\" Merissa teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha ha, whatever,\" you say. \"At least the mansion exists in the real world now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the window and see for yourself!\" Merissa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the window and see that it's covered by thick drapes. You push them aside and let the sunlight of the beautiful morning pour into the room. You look outside and see that you are indeed in your old neighborhood, but the window is further back from the street than before, a result of having more land as Merissa said would happen. Over the thick walls and gates that now line your property's perimeter, you see that the house of your next door neighbor, Ms. Nichols, is still there, as well as the house of the Holtz family across the street. You see gross old Mr. Holtz is his yard fiddling with his lawn mower. He looks up at your window and you instinctively close the drapes immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww, no wonder this window was covered,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your neighbor's demeanor aside, you are pretty attractive now, Mistress,\" Merissa laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, this is my MOM'S body!\" you say. \"Speaking of which, where is my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in your body, as I said she would be, Master,\" Merissa explains. \"As o her whereabouts, she is here within your new mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you say as you walk out of your master bedroom. As you walk down the hall, a door opens and you see your mom in your body walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!?\" your old body says. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, why wouldn't I be here?\" you say. \"This is my home, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know, I just though you'd be out today!\" he says, throwing in a nervous laugh at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, everything's fine, Mom,\" he says. \"I'm just going to... head out for a while, that's all.\" \"Your son\" gives you a quick peck on the cheek and adds, \"Love you, mom, see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, love you, too,\" you say in response. \"Be careful.\" You watch as he walks down the hall and turns towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose got into you, Mistress?\" you hear Merissa say. You turn and see her standing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from my mother,\" you say, \"I'm pretty sure I know what's going on. My girlfriend, Jackie, was supposed to meet me here today, and we've been trying to keep our relationship on the down low. My mom is clearly acting on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're the mother now,\" Merissa says. \"You can tell him it's okay with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'd rather it was ME dating Jackie,\" you say, rolling your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then wish for it!\" Merissa says. \"Wish for Jackie to be dating you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you respond. \"I'm my mom right now! She babysat Jackie when the two of us were younger. It... it doesn't feel right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could always wish for me to swap you and your mother back to your original bodies,\" Merissa says. \"You'd be giving up ownership of the mansion to her, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd probably be giving up something else, too, thanks to your stipulations,\" you say in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did tell you that's how it would work, didn't I, Mistress?\" Merissa says with a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've wanted your own place for a while now just so you wouldn't have to hide the fact that you're dating Jackie anymore. Now you've got your own place, and an amazing one at that, but you feel like you're not in a position to even date Jackie anymore. Switching you and your mother back to your original bodies would allow you to resume dating Jackie, but that would surely bring about another stipulation. You'd still be living in a mansion, at least, so that's pretty cool. Then again, you're starting to get keen on the idea of being the one in charge, even if only temporarily while you contemplate what else you'll wish for.</span></div></div>",

The two of you look to see your former self entering the room, holding a broom and dustpan. \"This is Merissa, one of my friends! I asked her to come over to take a look at your bottle because she's interested in antiques.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" you say. \"Your son just wanted to find out what it was worth and surprise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" your clone says, \"but I tripped and knocked it out of Merissa's hands. I'm sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good news is you haven't lost much,\" you say. \"There was a sticker on the bottom that said '1988 - Made in China.' Those bottles were mass produced fairly recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You got the year way off, but how did you know the bottle was made in China?\"</i> you hear Merissa think in your head as a look of simultaneous disappointment and relief appears on your .former mother's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think, <i>\"I didn't. Nowadays, China is associated with cheaply produced goods.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was still a pretty bottle,\" the woman says. \"Still, why did you call me 'mom', earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually said 'ma'am,'\" you lie. \"Sorry, sometimes my accent comes back when I'm nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about this mess, Mom,\" your past self says. \"I'll find a replacement for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry for over reacting,\" she says as she walks up to him and gives him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns back to you and says, \"And I am very sorry that I said those things, Merissa. I completely misjudged you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you, ma'am,\" you say. \"Umm, I actually have to get going soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I'm happy to have met you, Merissa, even if I didn't seem that way earlier. I'll just take this cheap thing back to the trash and dispose of it while you two say good-bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I think she hopes maybe you'll date her son now,\"</i> you hear Merissa tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm not going there!\"</i> you insistently think as the clone you summoned walks over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, yeah, I'll look after her and contact you telepathically you know how she's doing periodically,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, former-self,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's what you made me for. I'll be in touch,\" he says as he extends his hand outward. You both shake on it, then walk outside of your former home and life, though you get the feeling he's staring at your ass as it sways. Maybe you made him <i>too</i> well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So you still care for you former mother, eh?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, she did raise me and take care of me all those years, even if I don't really exist anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Understandable. The motherly bond between you probably kept her from regarding you lustfully as I said most mortals would.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my clone there? Was he affected? I thought he might have been staring at my derriere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He was staring, but that was what would have come naturally for him, anyway. You've got it, might as well flaunt it, I say.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" you say as you look back at your former dwelling from the sidewalk, \"I don't know how I'll handle it if everybody's going to want a piece of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You just created life with a snap of your fingers. You'll be fine. And if you're not sure how to deal with certain situations, I'll be happy to offer my advice.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet you would. You probably have wanted me to turn my mother into something for mocking us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You got me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need to find a place to stay now.

How about I restore it for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks on with dread as you snap your fingers once more, causing the remains of the bottle to fly away from her and float in front of you. You surround the fragments with your hands and will them to come together once again, making them refuse and become whole once more. For good measure, you blow on the bottle with a powerful gust of air from your thick lips, causing any dust that was on them to disappear, fulfilling the task she asked you to complete the task. With that done, you snap the bottle from the air with your hand and begin to walk back towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see?\" you say as you approach your former mother, \"It's all nice and new. Looks gorgeous doesn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in her face is apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you not believe me? Do you doubt the quality of my work? Well, then,\" you say as you open the bottle and point it at her, \"maybe you should make a closer inspection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your words, a magical pink vortex decorated with blue stars, planets and other cosmic phenomenon erupts from the bottles opening and surrounds the paralyzed woman. She begins to scream as she feels herself being drawn to the bottle through the vortex, her body starting to change into pink smoke that can't resist the magical forces pulling her in. The transformation happens from top to bottom as she's absorbed into the container. Her head is the last part that remains human, shrieking until the very end when it finally turns into smoke just before getting pulled inside the bottle. With that, you place the stopper on the bottle, imprisoning the wisp within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the bottle in your hands, you walk over to a nearby table, where you unplug the stopper and hold the bottle upside down over the table's surface. You smack the bottom of the bottle a couple of times, as if you were trying to force ketchup out. Suddenly, your former mother plops out of the bottle and onto the table, now only about 4 inches tall. You also notice that she's wearing pink version of the harem outfit Merissa was wearing when you freed her, and looks a little younger, not to mention curvier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like this change did you some good!\" you laugh as she cringes before the site of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you going to do with me?\" she asks, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Nothing,\" you respond. \"You're a genie now, and I don't really need one. I can grant my own wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you want from me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I already got what I wanted. You shouldn't have talked to me like that and now I've had my revenge. That's settled, so I think I'm just going to send you to your sister.  Your son told me you had a sister. I think she'll take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about my son? Where is he!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk as you say, \"All that I'll say about your son is that he's in a much better place. Don't worry about him, and enjoy the rest of your immortality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and she once again changes into a flume of pink smoke that returns to the bottle. Suddenly, you hear Merissa's voice speak again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Bravo! Though it is a bit risky having a genie out in the world mad at you. If she and your former aunt were to collude, it would cause you some trouble.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and say, \"My former relations will be too busy having fun to concern themselves with revenge, especially since I've just ensured that to happen. I've probably done them a favor. They won't care to bother me, or look for my former self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still have some sympathy for them, eh?\"</i> Merissa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, even if I don't really exist anymore, she did raise me, and they did love me,\" you say as you snap your fingers, causing a gift-tag to appear on the vessel containing your once mother addressed to your once aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Understandable,\"</i> says Merissa. <i>\"Frankly, I think her motherly bond with you was the only thing keeping her from lusting after your power and anything else, as I said earlier.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think other people I know won't be so restrained?\" you ask as a gift-wrapped box surround the bottle after another snap of your digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"People you know, people you don't know, it's all going to be the same to them.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking about just making this house my own,\" you say as you snap your fingers to cause the box containing your former mother to disappear and reappear instantaneously in front of her sister. \"Do you think I should go someplace more secluded?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You can do as you wish, but I must tell you that I've been cramped up in that accursed bottle for countless centuries. Frankly, I'm tired of hiding. I say let them come. Depending on who shows up, maybe you'll even enjoy it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And of course, if you don't enjoy it,\"</i> she adds with a malevolent tone in her sexy voice, <i>\"you can always deal with them as you did with that woman just now.\"</i></span></div></div>",

A luxurious, soft bed with a golden headboard is the sole piece of furniture within. Merissa's voice speaks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Interesting that this is what you would make for your pocket dimension.

You look to your side and see the original Merissa sitting next to you on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa!\" you say, looking down to confirm that, yes, you are indeed still Merissa. \"How did you get out of my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you said, I have some influence,\" Merissa responds within a wink. \"I tacked on a rider that as this was our private place, I could exit your body and have a form within its confines. Although, it is limited to this bottle dimension. I can't leave on my own, and if you leave, I must return to your body immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers, causing the color of the room to change from regal red to royal blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing to see if you still have powers,\" Merissa pouts. \"You don't trust me?\" Merissa snaps then snaps her own fingers, causing the room to change back to red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you say sheepishly. \"I was just caught by surprise. I had a fear in the back of my mind that this unison was too good of a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never do anything to hurt... me,\" Merissa laughs. \"Frankly, most people would see your predicament as the raw deal. 'Oh no, my former life is gone and I don't have a penis anymore!' You're taking it pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, I'm a god now!

She looks on in terror as you consider that if there's a restriction on you killing, it doesn't apply to plant-life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, your son has received his reward for freeing me, and he's in a much better place now. So it seems to me that you'll need someone to keep you company.

In fact, I have just the canine in mind. He's one <i>hell</i> of a watchdog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, I see where this is going,\"</i> you hear Marissa muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and a leash appears in your hands. That leash's chain eventually separates into three different chains, each attached to collars that are worn around the three snarling, red-eyed heads of the massive black canine that you've summoned into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-c-cerberus!?\" she stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, you're familiar with your mythology,\" you quip. \"Yes, this is the one and only Cerberus, the three-headed guardian of the gates of Hades. And now he's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour former mother can only stare horrified at the sulfuric-smelling hellbeast growling about in her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think he might be having trouble adjusting to his new environment. Maybe a new animal friend would help him get used to it,\" you mockingly observe as you snap your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I hear it's not always best to introduce new animeeeeeeeeoooooooowwwwwwww,\" the woman says as she's interrupted by the transformation with which you've afflicted her. Fur matching her hair color begins to cover her body as she shrinks down, with her clothes disappearing as a long tail begins to protrude from above her posterior. Her body starts to reshape as she dwindles, with her hands and feet becoming paws and her head and ears becoming more feline. She was your mother once. Now, she is a house cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the cat before you and say, \"I think Cerberus wants to play 'tag.'. I'll give you a ten-second head start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cringes before you, but as you say, \"10,\" she turns and darts away as fast her furry little legs can take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9!\" you call out as she leaves the living room. \"8!\" you shout as she starts up the stairs. \"7!\" you holler as she runs to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause briefly, and sense that she's stopped, wondering if you've stopped counting and changed your mind about what you're going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6-5-4-3-2-1-GO!\" you quickly yell as you snap your fingers, causing your leash to disappears and the hellhound to chase after its target. The newly-minted house cat starts desperately looking for a place to hide or escape as she hears the growling Cerberus plod through the living room and trample up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she left her bedroom windows closed before she left the house, the cat breaks for your former room, hoping that you might have left your window open. She dashes through the door but the Cerberus sees her tail go under the door and starts to lunge after her. She breaks for your window, but panics when she realizes you left it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns back around, only to see that the Cerberus is at the door, looking around with its three heads. The one in the center looks right at her and barks, prompting the other three heads to turn and face in its direction. With nowhere to run, <br>\r\nit's all she can do to cower in the corner as the slobbering terror aberration approaches and close her eyes tight. When she feels the hellbeast's hot breaths on her, she tightens her eyes harder and prays that it's at least over quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fear is interrupted by the tickling of a wet tongue against her face, followed by more tongues across her feline body. She opens her eyes to see that each of the Cerberus' three pairs of eyes have stopped glowing and look... friendly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Cerberus won!\" your voice echos though the room as you appear behind the monstrous mastiff, looking over the house cat that was your mother. \"Of course, such a tough looking creature would probably scare the neighbors if he was always like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and two of the Cerberus' heads disappear into its body and its scent of sulfur dissipates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made it so he'll only look that way if you or this house is threatened. No one will believe them because, really. Cerberus is a myth, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and, with a poof of smoke, the cat is now the woman who was once your mother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... why did you do this?\" she asks as she's slumped on the floor while the hound sits next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just changed you back instantaneously because I didn't care to watch you transform. I just made it slower earlier to help freak you out more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, terrify me, and then give me this... thing,\" she says, pointing at the canine, who starts to whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I implied earlier,\" you say while putting your hands on your hips, \"I didn't appreciate your insolence. At the same time, your son requested that I make sure you were taken care of and have someone. I just decided to kill two birds with one stone. I would never actually let any harm befall you, as you are responsible for me even being here in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you respond with a knowing smile, \"if you hadn't bought that bottle, your son never would have freed me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of my son?\" she asks. \"You say he is in a better place now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say with a pause. \"Your son is somewhere that he can never return from, but he would never want to, anyway. He has a great destiny ahead of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief, I suppose,\" she sighs, as she starts to pet the infernal canine. \"I was starting to worry that he'd never really amount to anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well,\" you begin, raising an eyebrow at your former mother's lack of confidence, \"Cerberus was your son's final gift to you. When I leave, you will forget who I am, but not what I tell you now; your son loves you very much and doesn't want you to worry about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if you see him,\" she says with tears in her eyes, \"tell him I love him, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that,\" you say. \"Farewell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and disappear from your former room and your former life while your mother, still crying, takes comfort from holding the last hound anyone would expect that you could take comfort from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappear sitting on your former home's rooftop, where you hear Merissa's thoughts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\"That was actually fairly touching. And funny! I thought when you said she never let you have a pet, you were going to make her a pet. But then you summoned that Cerberus! And then you did make her a pet!\"</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think if I'm to be Merissa,\" you say, \"I must be ready to keep people on their toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's the spirit!

I was in such a rush that I left home without it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm,\" you say with Merissa's voice, \"there it is on the couch, Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear,\" she says, \"but it seems we have something else we need to talk about.\" She holds up the remnants of the vessel that once held your other half, whose identity you've now assumed. She places the pieces on a counter top, then walks over to the couch and sits next to her purse. \"Please have a seat, Merissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't remember the bottle breaking when you dropped it earlier, but you think it's possible that it broke after you fused with Merissa. As you approach the couch, dreading the scolding yo know you're going to get, Merissa's thoughts fill you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your mother no longer has a son. She has a daughter instead, named Merissa, and we are her. Reality is a little different now, especially since you're a woman and a genie, but most details of your life remain the same.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I can explain,\" you begin as you take your seat, but she cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to explain, Merissa. I know what's going on. You've been unleashed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as your mom continues her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When that bottle arrived shortly after you were born, I knew I was in for a wild ride, so I looked up every bit of genie lore so I could stay one step ahead. I was technically your master, but also your mother, and I didn't want to exploit you like some of those awful mothers on those reality shows about little girls competing in beauty pageants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over 18 years, I only ever made two wishes from you. The very first wish, I made it after receiving that bottle. I wished that your genie-hood would be a secret to everyone, even to your father, and even to you! Your bottle looked like an ordinary decoration to everyone but me, keeping friend and visitors from becoming your master and taking advantage of you, and taking you away from me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the second... well, after your father passed away, I wished we would be okay. I feel ashamed because I think we would have managed, anyway, but I was scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I was scared, too,\" you say. \"I don't blame you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's comforting to hear from you, dear. I kept from making that third wish as long as I could to make sure I never lost you. But now, your bottle is broken, signifying that you've been unleashed. I'm not sure how it happened, but I don't have to worry about you losing autonomy. You'll never have to call anyone master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never even called you that, Mom,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you tried to as an infant,\" she chuckles, \"but I broke you from that habit by insisting on 'mama.' I raised you as a normal girl as best I could, which is going to make what I have to say next extra hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, studied geniei-lore as much as I could. I know that now that you're unleashed, your body won't contain your mystical energies as well. When you grant yourself a wish, people around you may be drawn by the reality warping you cause and seek you out, and their intentions may not be so pure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I warned you about this just now,\"</i> Merissa thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may think that you can stop mundane people from causing you to much grief, and you're probably right. But the more you wish, the more you may attract the attention of magic-hunters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic-hunters?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. They're people who hunt magical beings to either imprison them or steal their magic for themselves. A bound genie rarely attracts their attention because they're under the control of a master. But an unleashed genie will most assuredly be a beacon to them, especially if she goes pretty wild with her power. And magic-hunters have equipment that makes them immune to magical spells.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands and looks down at you and says, \"And this is why I need to you to be gone from the house when I return from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she sighs as she walks over to the front window, \"I'm in no position to ask you to be responsible with your powers. You're free to do what you like. I just hope I raised you well enough to not do any kind of permanent damage. But I can't take all manner of creeps and perverts and magic-hunting weirdos being drawn here every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks out the window, where you see your balding, slobby neighbor across the street, Mr. Holtz, staring at your home in his yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Especially Mr. Holtz,\"</i> she seethes from her teeth as she closes the curtains before turning to face you again..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an all-powerful being now so you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a new place to dwell, Merissa. I wouldn't ask you to leave if I didn't think you could handle it. I'd let you stay as long as I could if not for all the weirdness you're bound to attract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"You're right, Mom. I can handle it. I'll be out of the house by tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Merissa,\" she says as she walks back over to the couch to grab her purse. As she approaches, you hear Merissa speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Have you considered just turning her into a bra and taking over the house? You'd have a place to live and her support, in a way.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"NO!\"</i></b> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay, just bouncing ideas off of you. Seeing if anything sticks.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother grabs her purse, and you rise up to give her a hug and kiss. \"I'll miss you, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll miss you, Merissa,\" she says as she returns your hug and kiss. \"You can still come by and visit me once in a while, or call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" you promise as she walks away. \"Hey, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and asks, \"What is it, Merissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not obligated to do this now that I'm unleashed, I guess,\" you ask, \"but you never took your third wish. Care to make it, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie,\" she says, \"I wish that you will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you cut her off. \"I can wish for myself. You've made selfless wishes your whole life. I'm giving you a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After raising a genie for 18 years, all I really want is a normal life,\" she says, as she looks down at her watch. \"Actually, you know what? I was supposed to be at work 5 minutes ago, so how about this: When I get in my car and close the door, I wish for me and my car to be in my parking space at work 10 minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you want?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all I need, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"Okay, Mom. I'll go out with you and when you get in the car... and Mr. Holtz isn't staring... I'll send you to work ten minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear,\" she says as she heads towards the door. You get up to follow her and stop in the doorway while she <br>\r\nopens her car up and climbs inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Merissa!\" she calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too, Mom!\" you call back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuts the door and turns the engine on, to maintain the illusion. You look across the street to see that Mr. Holtz must have been called back into the house by his wife to get scolded for staring at the neighbor women again. With the coast clear, you wave at your mom and snap your fingers, sending her through time and space to receive a small advantage in the mundane, normal life she craves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your mother is a saint. It's likely her parental bond prevent her from succumbing to your powerful aura.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wanted to turn her into a bra.\" you say as you close your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eh? It's a thing I do! Anyway, she's mistaken about magic-hunters. They're not immune to magic. They're immune to implausibility.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It means you can use magic, but you have be smart about it. Let's say you're 100 feet tall and partying in the streets of Miami and some magic-hunters show up to ruin your fun. You can't get rid of them by stomping because 100 foot tall women aren't real, and you can't summon a snowstorm to freeze them in their tracks because it's Florida. But because it's Florida, you could have them fall victim to a surprise sinkhole! And because it's a busy city, a run-away vehicle could run them down! Disbelief is their strongest weapon so whatever you do to fight them needs to be believable.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And don't feel like you even need to fight them off. They can track where you teleport to but it still puts distance between them and you. And they have to actually be able to get where you teleported to track you down. No need to risk capture just to show off. Likewise, your mom did have some good advice; don't do permanent damage. Undoing anything you did (or most stuff, at least) can also throw off magic hunters.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good advice. Thank you, Merissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're welcome, Merissa. Now, I can think of a few locations that would make an excellent hideout for you. For starters...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa's thought is interrupted by the sound of your doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who that could be,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Be careful. I doubt it's a magic-hunter but it could be someone who's might have been lure by you granting your mother's wish just now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look through the peephole and see...</span></div></div>",

You decide to visit Alyssa; she's pretty trustworthy, even if she does get jealous at times (although that jealousy explains why you've never told her that you and Jackie are lovers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers to summon your cellphone to your hand, which seems to cause Mr. Holtz to begin pounding on the door, demanding entry. Did he hear your snap, or did your power trigger his sense of urgency? You don't want to think about these things just now; you snap your fingers once more and teleport yourself to Alyssa' rooftop, a few blocks from your own home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you arrive on Alyssa's roof, you hear your phone ring with the tone you designated for Jackie. You pick up, confident no one can see you on your perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie, are you okay?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask you the same thing,\" you hear from the other end. \"I see Mr. Holtz at your door, knocking and yelling at someone to let him in. I'm ducking in Ms. Nichols yard looking on. She's actually looking on here with me, and is concerned, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her I'm fine,\" you say. \"I actually managed to sneak out.

Mr. Holtz just showed up a minute ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mr. Holtz has that effect on people? Come meet me Alyssa's, I'll explain everything,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay, well, Ms. Nichols wanted to know if you wanted her to call the police for... wait, that may not even be necessary, Mrs. Holtz is crossing the street right now and she looks pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she'll handle Mr. Holtz,\" you laugh, knowing that this is likely the last straw as far as their marriage goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well, I think Ms. Nichols will keep an eye on things in case they escalate. This is just a weird day in general. First that sudden solar eclipse and now this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solar eclipse?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not notice it? Everything was dark as night this morning. I was actually admiring it before I reached your house. Anyway, I'm on my way to meet you, Merissa,\" Jackie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. See you soon, Jackie,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there shortly,\" she says before she ends the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're relieved that Jackie's okay as you put your phone away, and glad that she didn't try to approach Mr. Holtz. You get the feeling she'll be affected by your powers as well, but you'd want to see how she reacts before deciding you need to avoid her. You're also glad you left as you don't know how Ms. Holtz or Ms. Nichols would react, either. You also start wondering about that solar eclipse, realizing that's why it looked like nighttime earlier when it was actually morning. Merissa speaks to you in your thoughts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The sudden solar eclipse was an extremely local event, a sign that you've been unleashed. People who saw it may be aware that something is going on, but may not necessarily know or understand.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, it's time to find out how Alyssa takes the news. You snap your fingers and teleport down to Alyssa's front door and ring the doorbell. You have to ring it a couple of times; apparently, Alyssa's a late sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groggy Alyssa finally answers the door, clad in pajamas with her long brown hair a mess. She was a little taller than you at 5'10\" before reality shifted, but now that you're Merissa, you have 2 inches over her. Her sleepiness seems to dissipate from her face and she looks wide awake in shock at the sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa? What are you doing here so early?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a bit of a situation at my house,\" you respond. \"Mind if I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, sure! Sorry, if I knew you were coming over, I'd have made myself more presentable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, that's fine,\" you say as she lets you in. \"We're both friends, Alyssa. I don't expect you to look 'presentable' at every single moment of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah, I guess so,\" she says with a nervous laugh as she guides you to the kitchen. \"Want some hot cocoa? I'd offer coffee but we're out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cocoa sounds great,\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" she says as she starts preparing the drinks in microwavable mugs. \"So, what's going on at your house?

I want to have fun but I don't want to be the girl some guy cheats with. If I knew who you liked, I'd have stayed back and given you a shot.

I hope you two can forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alyssa, of course I forgive you,\" Jackie says, giving her friend a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you, too,\" you say, \"and I'm sorry for overreacting just a tad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Just a tad', huh?\" Alyssa laughs. \"If pancaking me with that giant ass of yours was 'just a tad', I'll make sure not to really piss you off in the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking it pretty well, Alyssa!\" Jackie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was scary at first but once I realized I wasn't really in danger, it felt kind of... well, I won't necessarily say 'fun' but I wasn't as scared. And I started realizing I was being a jerk, too. Jackie, if I see another guy I like, I'll let you know instead of simmering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then, Alyssa. You know, since I've been dating Merissa, I haven't really been with those guys for some time. If you're still interested in them... and I'm still on speaking terms with them because they're not creeps... I can let them know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be nice, Jackie,\" Alyssa says. \"Let me know which ones are creeps, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Jackie says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for me,\" you say, \"Jackie and I have an understanding that we're in an open relationship.

And I haven't been with any other girl besides Jackie, though I can do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Jackie, and she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind sharing me with Jackie,\" you offer to Alyssa, \"I'd be happy to have you as a partner as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll think about it,\" Alyssa says. \"I'm still worried about what my parents might say if they knew I was dating a girl, let alone one who's also dating another girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they give you any crap for it, I'll have them saying \"Moo\" or \"Oink\" or other barnyard animal sounds,\" you laugh, causing both Alyssa and Jackie to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer, Merissa. I will consider it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any event,\" you say, \"we may need to head elsewhere. Each time I use my powers, someone in the area may notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go round-up Angela,\" Jackie suggests. \"Complete our foursome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to go on talking horseback?\" Alyssa teases her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could,\" Jackie snickers, \"but I believe Merissa has a faster way.

The redheaded Angela stands at about 5'5\", pretty much halfway between Jackie and Alyssa. Angela is known to be pretty kindhearted so you're not expecting her to flip out the same way Alyssa did at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you arrive in her fenced-in backyard, away from prying eyes. Angela actually lives quite a bit further away from your home than Alyssa did so you're hoping you've put some distance between yourself and whatever madness might have been spawned there. You approach her back door with your friends behind you and knock. You see Anglea approach through the glass of the door, wearing the uniform of the grocery store she works at and perplexed that someone would be entering from the rear, then surprised to see it's her three amigas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what are you three doing in my backyard this morning?\" she asks. \"And Alyssa, why are you wearing pajamas?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa looks down and covers herself with her arms. \"Eeep! I forgot to change!\" You and the other girls laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela says, \"I know you're not much of an early person, Alyssa, but surely Merissa or Jackie would have said something before you left the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had a few... developments... this morning, Angela,\" you respond. \"Changing clothes was the last thing on our mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if we come in?\" Jackie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, come on in,\" Angela says. \"Alyssa, I have some of your clothes in my room from the last time you slept over. They're clean. And I know we have the same shoe size so you can borrow a pair of my sneakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Anglela,\" says Alyssa as she walks through the kitchen to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela closes her back door and asks you and Jackie, \"So what's going on? Is this related to that stuff that's been on the news, about that supposed eclipse in your neighborhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" says Jackie, as you and her have a seat at her kitchen table. \"Turns out Merissa here is a certified genie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" says Angela, \"and I'm a fairy princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie laughs as you snap your fingers, causing Angela to immediately sprout wings and reduce in size to six inches tall, and changing her work uniform into a regal pink gown with a tiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" she says with a squeakier voice as she flies up to your face. \"I guess you weren't kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That eclipse that was on the news is related to my newly discovered condition,\" you say to your diminutive redheaded friend. \"I can grant myself unlimited wishes but people can sense my power and it may cause them to crave it, or me, and react badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Holtz was pounding at her door this morning,\" Jackie adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww!\" she squeals. \"Wait, could that happen to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Jackie says. \"It happened to Alyssa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Alyssa says as she walks back in, wearing a tank top and shorts similar to what Jackie is wearing and carrying a pair of Angela's shoes in her hands. \"Watch where you sit, Tinkerginger. Or more accurately, watch where <i>Merissa</i> sits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle anybody that comes my way,\" you say as Alyssa pulls up a seat to put on Angela's shoes, \"but my mom can't. I need to be moved out of the house by the time she returns home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" all three women exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Angela asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make a home for myself anywhere, I can do just about anything, really, 'Fairy Princess Angela,'\" you say as you point your comparatively giant digit at the pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad that you're basically being asked to leave your home,\" Jackie says, \"but frankly, I'd be happy to no longer have to hide our relationship from your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" squeaks Angela, who looks around at both you and Jackie. \"You two have been seeing each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful,\" Alyssa says quickly, causing Angela to turn to face her. \"Unless you feel like pancakes.\" Angela just seems confused by Alyssa's warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" you say. \"We've been keeping it a secret from my mom due to her finding out somehow about Jackie's reputation at school. Jackie's right though; it doesn't matter anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it doesn't,\" says Angela who slowly descends to the table you've .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angela, is something wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she admits as she looks up at your face from the table, \"I was actually working up the nerve to ask if you wanted to be my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you ask, stunned. \"I had no idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't entirely sure if you were even a lesbian, even though I don't recall you going after boys,\" she explains. \"For that matter, I didn't even know Jackie was bi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda funny what you find out, isn't it?\" Jackie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never even realized <i>I</i> was bi,\" Angela explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to realize Angela must have originally had a crush on you, too, like Alyssa did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angela,\" you say, focusing squarely on her, \"Jackie and I have an open relationship. She hasn't been seeing many boys lately but she's free to do so. And she's the only girl I've been with but I'm free to be with others if I want. If you're okay with sharing me with Jackie, I'd be happy to take you on as a partner as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Alyssa interrupts as she walks over next to you, \"you'd be sharing her with Jackie and me.\" She looks to you and adds, \"That is, if your offer to me still stands, Merissa. I've had time to think about it and if I have to share you with someone, I'd be glad to share you with my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfectly fine,\" you say, as she gently places her hand on your shoulder. Jackie also rises from her seat to do the same with your other shoulder, and the three of you look down at Angela. Angela looks up at the three of you for a moment, trying to take in everything she's learned and seen here today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have one question, Merissa,\" Angela says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela points at Jackie and Alyssa. \"Are you going to care if I ask them to be my partners as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"I'm fine with that if they're fine with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very fine with that, Angela,\" Jackie agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" says Alyssa \"but only if you don't mind if I ask Jackie to be my partner, too, Angela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Alyssa,\" Jackie jokes, \"let me ask Angela!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more love to go around, the better, I say!\" the fairy princess says as she flies up to your face. \"I'm in!\" She plants a tiny little kiss on your face, then flies around to repeat the affection with Jackie and Alyssa. Alyssa and Jackie then share a quick peck, followed by the both of them planting one on you simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa's voice speaks in your mind once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"All three of these women originally had a degree of romantic affection for you. However, to each other, they were always just best friends.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, my power's making them hot for each other?\"</i> you ask in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"In a way. You have the feeling that your best friends could well be your best lovers, and they're picking up that vibe as well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I didn't wish for that, though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No. You've basically presented them with an idea, indirectly, and they're running with it. You didn't actively wish for it to happen, but it's happening anyways because they've decided they want it to happen. No one is ever going to respond to your power in a way that they don't want to.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What about Angela and Alyssa's agreement to be my lovers?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm not sure. Angela may have originally been intrigued by the offer. Alyssa wouldn't have, at least not until she got over her jealousy of Jackie. Again, I emphasize; no one's reacting to you in a way that they don't want to react.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Listen!\" the fairy princess Angela shouts, knowing just how to get your attention. \"Sorry, you looked a little lost in thought there. What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa turns to Jackie and asks, \"Is this when we have a massive orgy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. What are you asking me for?\" Jackie responds, then laughs. \"Despite rumors, I've only ever slept with one person at a time. In any event, I think it might be best if Merissa finds a new home first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help!\" says Angela. \"I mean, I'm supposed to go to work shortly, but fuck work! I'm a fairy princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Alyssa laughs. \"You want to stay that way, Angela?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I should be human again so I can at least call in and resign with my original voice so they know it's me,\" Angela reckons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fly down to the floor,\" you say to Angela. \"I'll change you back when you land safely.\" The fairy princess follows your directions and you snap your fingers, causing her to instantaneously return to being a normal human being in a work uniform she'll apparently no longer need. She grabs her phone from her pocket to let her employer know that's the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, do you have any ideas?\" Jackie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have your friends all together, you decide that...</span></div></div>",

I'll be making my home on another planet entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Jackie asks. \"That's one hell of a commute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for me!\" you respond. \"I can teleport anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jackie says. \"I meant for us, though. I know you're all-powerful now, but I'd still like to keep going to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" you say. \"I was going to ask you three if you wanted to stay with me but I was never going to have you as my captive harem. I can make arrangements so you can travel at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice,\" Jackie says. \"Having a magic girlfriend is awesome but I still want to be a veterinarian someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to stay in school, too,\" Alyssa says, \"but not at home. I'm happy to be with you guys but my parents aren't going to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela chimes in, \"I'm done with that shitty job, but I still want a career in writing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"It's an easy matter for me to create documents that will allow you to continue your education while you live with me. In fact, I think I'm going to stay in school, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you set for life, though?\" Angela asks. \"What can you possibly get out of school that you couldn't just wish into your head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends!\" you remark. \"Plus some prank opportunities...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you be attracting attention, though?\" Alyssa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" you sigh. \"Wow, I just made myself sad.

The loud pitchman is interrupted by the member of the camera crew holding up the monitor, who turns it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so, so sorry about all of this,\" Ms. Meadows says as she turns to you while her camera crew, shaking their heads, starts putting away all of their equipment. \"I think you probably use that footage to take some legal action against that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also,\" she continues, \"please keep in mind with your eventual lawsuit that I had nothing to do with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tricia!\" a member of the camera crew calls out. \"We're ready to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell management I'm taking a sick day today,\" Tricia says. \"After all of this, they'll understand. I'm just going to get a cab home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew member shrugs, says \"Okay!\" and climbs into the van. The crew drives off, leaving Tricia behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Miss,\" Tricia says to you. \"Sorry, I never got your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you,\" Tricia says. \"Merissa, would you mind answering a few questions for me, off the record?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off the record?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she says. \"Just between you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could,\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Tricia says. \"Well, I don't think anyone else watching that video noticed, but it seemed like the engine from your mother's car just stopped altogether instead of fading off as it drove away. Is there any reason you think that might be the case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, bad editing?\" you say with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Tricia says as she pulls out a smartphone and starts checking it. \"We actually talked to that same guy just before coming over here. We dismissed him as a crank, of course. I certainly didn't want to spend any time talking to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anybody does,\" you say with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, check this out,\" she says as she shows you her phone. You can see that she's pulled up Mr. Holtz's footage on uFilm and has it paused. You see that she's pointing in the lower left-hand corner, next to the time stamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is something else I noticed,\" she says. \"This video was filmed just a while ago, before we arrived on the scene to investigate these so-called 'eclipse' reports. We saw no sign of an eclipse, mind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, that sounds ridiculous,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you look like a fit young woman, she continues. \"I know that from the drive from there to here, and my own walking habits, that had you been walking here, you'd still be on your way, even if you had left right after that footage was taken. Maybe you would have arrived here shortly after we did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I ran real fast?\" you say. \"Took some shortcuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she says. \"None of your neighbors said they saw you leave the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked about me?\" you say, starting to get nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that guy was obsessed with whatever or whoever was supposedly in there. The woman next door seemed worried about you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nichols, you say to yourself. Jackie said she was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose house is this, anyway?\" the reporter asks as she looks at Alyssa's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a friend's house,\" you say. \"I came here for some sanctuary from my crazy neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, can I talk to your friend, then?\" Tricia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! She's actually lying down at the moment,\" you say, remembering that you pancaked Alyssa with an enlarged ass just before the tv crew arrived. \"This whole thing was... just too heavy for her to take!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Tricia says as she turns back to you. \"Well, I have a feeling that something is going on that you're not telling me. A reporter's intuition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's been in close proximity to you,\"</i> you hear Merissa's voice say in your mind as you gulp. <i>\"It's more than a reporter's intuition!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But like I said,\" Tricia continues as she pulls out a business card, \"this conversation was off the record. If you'd like to continue it, here's how you can contact me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks,\" you say as you accept the card from Tricia, which has her phone number, email address, social media handles and her station's logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time, Merissa,\" Tricia says as she starts to walk off. You breath a sigh of relief that Tricia isn't pressing the issue further and walk back into Alyssa's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's more mature than Alyssa, but she is still a mortal,\"</i> Merissa warns you as you open the door. <i>\"She may not wait for you to contact her to get in touch with you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she wanted me?\" you say as you walk in and close the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Probably,\"</i> Merissa says, <i>\"but for what, I couldn't tell.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back into the living room and see Alyssa lying on the couch, still a foot-tall and flattened. You walk over to her and snap you fingers, causing her to start re-inflating to her normal proportions, but retain her current shrunken height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Alyssa gasps with a squeaky voice as rises up she rises from her back and curls up her knees while looking up at you. \"Merissa, did you <i>really</i> have to do that to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to call me and Jackie 'sluts?'\" you respond as you look down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grew yourself, then shrank and squished me over an insult?\" she says. \"That's going a bit overboard, don't you think?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were ready to fight us! I just wanted to show you how fighting a genie would probably go!\" you say with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Alyssa says as she places her hand behind her head. \"I'm sorry about that, Merissa. I've just been getting frustrated about Jackie lately and... well, I don't know what came over me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lips, knowing it was probably you and your unbound genie powers affecting her.</span></div></div>",

One of them is holding a small, handheld, gun-like device with with what appears to be a antenna-like golden rod protruding from a box made of a strange, translucent blue material with a glowing screen in the center. Alyssa looks down, sees this strange group, and clings tighter to our bosom, apparently trying to stifle a nervous squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Magic-hunters,\"</i> Merissa says. <i>\"I'm surprised they were able to find us so quickly. Their technology must have advanced in these past five centuries.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably get out of here, shouldn't I?\" you think in response to your other self as you notice the hunter holding the device is pointing at the screen. The other two hunters look at what he's pointing at, and then all three immediately turn their gazes to the sky and are looking straight at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's an understatement,\"</i> Merissa says as you see the two hunters reach into their billowing cloaks and pull out small, translucent blue staves with glowing purple stones attached to the top. Instinctively, you make yourself float backwards above the garage roof as snaking purple beams streak in front of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!\" tiny little Alyssa screams as you back up further along her rooftop. You know you've bought yourself some time, but not much as hear a noise off to the side. You look over and see that a line attached to a grappling hook made of an eerie, obsidian stone has wrapped itself around the chimney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you see the line get taught, you get an idea and snap your fingers, hoping to make the line disappear as the hunters start to climb it. However, you see that the line glows purple for a faint moment and remains in tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The magic-hunters and their equipment are immune to implausibility,\"</i> Merissa reminds you. <i>\"You can't just make their things disappear.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about things their equipment attaches to, though?\" you say as you snap your finger again, this time successfully causing the chimney the hunters wrapped their line around to vanish from existance. To your chagrin, however, the line that was wrapped around the chimney remains in place, as if it were still holding on to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nice try, but they know that chimneys don't just disappear,\"</i> you hear Merissa say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez,\" you say, starting to panic as you start to realize limits to what you thought were omnipotent powers. Teleporting away would put some distance between you and the hunters and give you time to think, as Merissa advised you shortly after you joined her in unison. If the hunters tracked you down because of the news report, which is most likely the case, that means your own home probably isn't safe. It might be better to go to Angela's house, as she's further away from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe you can come up with a plausible way of thwarting (or at least delaying) these magic-hunters...</span></div></div>",

You get the feeling she'll be affected by your powers as well, but you'd want to see how she reacts before deciding you need to avoid her. You're also glad you left as you don't know how Ms. Holtz or Ms. Nichols would react, either. You also start wondering about that solar eclipse, realizing that's why it looked like nighttime earlier when it was actually morning. Merissa speaks to you in your thoughts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The sudden solar eclipse was an extremely local event, a sign that you've been unleashed.

Besides, I might scare her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Only if you go in there and be scary.

She doesn't seem to care that the curtain's no longer keeping the shower from splashing outside the tub; it's as if she senses something more important outside, and her gaze finally fixates on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa!?\" Amanda asks. \"Why are you so small? And why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too stunned to answer, or do much of anything. You're not sure how she'd react to finding out you were here to approach her daughter while she was showering... although you then remember you're a girl now and so that might not seem so bad to her. You watch as she quickly turns off the water and hops out of the tub, walking over to you as the water starts to roll off of her body. When she reaches you, she kneels down to continue talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I couldn't hear you all the way over there in the shower, honey,\" Amanda says, apparently thinking you might have tried to speak to her but just weren't very audible due to your small size. \"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how she'll react if you tell her the truth about your new powers. She might take it well or she might want a piece of your powers, or you.

Plus, there's a bit of showing off here, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, Angela may already be on her way to work,\" the giantess comments. \"I had a day off today and asked her to take her shower early so I could take mine now.

I'll meet you in there when I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sure thing,\" you say as you snap your fingers, causing you to disappear from her bathroom and reappear on her bed, still at three inches high.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Looks like you got it worse than I did!\" you announce, snapping your fingers as Amanda's face pales. Amanda's carpet, which already stood at knee height, begins to rise around her like the tide of an ocean. Dwindling down from 3 inches, to 2 inches, to 1 inch tall, Amanda's fears only continue to ramp up as the soft fibers that once lay far below her feet now threatened to sweep her away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa! Please stop!\" she yells, so small that her voice sounded like the squeaks of a mouse. \"Oh I'm sorry, Ms. Green, what was that?\" you reply smugly. \"Did you just ask me to...<i>not </i>do something to you that you don't <i>want </i>me to do to you?\" \"Yes!\" she screams, \"I...oh. <i>Oh</i>.\" Sudden realization washes over her like a freight train. She couldn't ask you to help her, because you wouldn't. You asked her to help you, and she took advantage of you! It's only fair that you do the same to her, she decides. Meanwhile, the carpet she once stood on now proudly stood above her, strands of fiber now taller than herself as she continued to dwindle. She was still frozen, but that didn't stop horrible thoughts from flowing freely. <i>Were you going to leave her down here to fend for herself? Were you even going to unfreeze her?</i> She was so scared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your vantage point, Amanda has completely vanished from view, dissapearing into the carpet below. You didn't know how small she actually was now, but your plan when shrinking her was to make her as small as you to her,  in comparison to you. That seemed fair. But even though you felt vindicated reducing her to almost nothing, for some reason you also felt guilty. Was reducing her to a fraction of an inch tall really the right thing to do..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What do </i>you<i> have to feel guilty for</i>?\" Merissa chimes in mentally. \"<i>She tried to take advantage of you! She tried to use you, use </i>us <i>for... sex!</i> <i>She had it coming.</i>\" she says spitefully. \"<i>If you ask me, I think we should leave her there.</i>\" \"<i>Merissa!</i>\" you reply. \"<i>What about our magic aura? Making people want us... lust us...</i>\" \"<i>Yeah, well, somehow I don't think that justifies anything. Do what you will.</i>\" With that, she goes silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, after almost being taken advantage of, the idea of leaving Amanda to live in between her carpet fibers is awfully tempting...but no, that's too cruel. Snapping your fingers once more, a frightened Amanda appears in the palm of your hand, still frozen in place. Oh, right. Snapping your fingers <i>again</i>, her body suddenly animates as she falls flat on her ass, gazing up to you in a mixture of fear and relief. Her whole body was trembling. You must've looked huge to her, and that's not even considering the size of the rest of the world..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa!\" she calls up to you. \"Thank you!\" ...Huh? \"T-Thank you for not leaving me down there...I thought...I thought...\" she trails off, sniffling. It was hard to tell because of the size discrepancy, she sounded like she was on the verge of tears. Why would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. So she thought you were going to leave her for dead. Maybe you've taken this too far. \"<i>Nah</i>.\" Merissa chimes in again <i>helpfully</i>, and you roll your eyes. \"I'm <i>sorry</i>, Ms. Green. I just wanted to teach you a lesson.\" Amanda, luckily, seems to have composed herself for now, laying down on your palm as she begins to speak.  \"I know...I guess I deserved to be scared after, <i>ugh</i>, almost taking advantage of you. I'm sorry, Merissa, I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, at least she's apologizing.</i>\" you think to yourself. \"<i>Yeah. Because she doesn't want you to leave her to mingle with the other </i>breadcrumbs<i> her size.</i>\" Merissa says, her inner voice sounding a <i>little </i>less sour. \"<i>You taught her a lesson she won't soon forget, though the question remains...</i>\" \"What are you going to do with me now?\" Amanda says, seemingly finishing Merissa's thought. You think seriously about this for a moment. On one hand, you did scare her half to death, but on the other hand, she was still going to take advantage of you. But on the <i>other </i>other hand, she wouldn't have done that if not for your magical aura...probably? <i>What was the right thing to do?</i></span></div></div>",

You sexy ass starts to expand and reshape itself, taking on a bulbous appearance. Six additional legs start to sprout from the bulb, which Ms. Green realizes is shaped like the abdomen of a spider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face starts to morph as the metamorphosis continues, giving you six more eyes on your head that glow with a hellish red, the same that the two eyes you started with change to. You feel fangs become more pronounced in your mouth. You look to the mirror on Ms. Green's dresser and see that your skin is changing from its olive tone to alabaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're about three feet tall, you leap off of Amanda's dresser as the growth and change continues. Your purposefully land on her foot, causing her to scream in pure panic as she's still unable to move otherwise. The t-shirt and bra you were wearing glow and reshape themselves into a tight black corset, barely containing your impressive bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow around your lower body dissipates as your growth slows down, revealing that your spiderey form has the color and patterns of a black widow. You rise to six feet (your original height) and continue to grow a little more until finally stopping at seven feet tall. You snap your fingers, now clad in long, black gloves, and release Amanda from her paralysis, and stare at her with a malevolent grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ms. Green,\" you hiss, \"do you want me now?\"</span></div></div>",

Namely... me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looks at you in confusion about what you mean as you snap your fingers. In a flash, your sexy three-inch body is replaced by a lacy bra, as black as your hair. Despite a complete and utter lack of sensory organs, you're still able to observe the world around you, and you see the perplexed look on Amanda's face as she's released from her paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa?\" she says as she lifts you from the dresser. \"Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me on, Ms. Green,\" you command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she says as she holds you by one strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, <b>'PUT ME ON!'</b>\" you insist, followed by an audible snap bellowing from your delicate form. In an instant, Amanda finds herself complying with your request, guiding her globes into your accommodating cups and fastening you around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I feel, Ms. Green?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she responds as she runs her hands along you while looking in the mirror, \"I do have to admit, you're the most comfortable bra I've ever worn, Merissa. This is actually nice. I was afraid for a moment that you were going to punish me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am,\" you say. In an instant, she feels her chest getting lighter and watches the mirror in shock as her breasts get smaller and smaller, eventually leaving her completely flat. Your bra body changes to accommodate her reduced bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" she says as she covers her smaller chest. \"Merissa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I can't my my work load lighter?\" you taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, please! There's nothing wrong with being flat, but... but I love having a fuller chest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, well, I guess I am feeling a bit superfluous now. I'll take on more duties, I suppose.\" With that remark, she feels her breasts start to expand, with you clinging tightly to keep up with the returning weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Green breathes a sigh of relief as her chest gets closer to its original size. \"Like I said, there's nothing wrong with smaller breasts. I just liked having big ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" you say as you continue to fill out her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,. I mean,\" she says before coming to a realization. \"Hey, Merissa, I think you're overdoing it just a tad. They're a little bigger than they were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just said you liked having big boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do,\" she says as she starts rubbing them as they expand. She smiles and adds \"Keep going, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to fondle herself as her cup size (and yours in synchronization) increases, rubbing against your soft supportive self as she does so. Once they're at the size of basketballs, she starts squeezing them together and admiring them in her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, this is plenty big enough for me,\" she says. \"You can stop now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry,\" you tease. \"Did you think I was done with your punishment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her breasts start expanding at an even faster rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, please!\" Amanda pleads. \"My back's starting to hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm doing just fine,\" you say, having stretched out to keep pace with her ginormous glands which continue to fill out, now at the size of beach balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa!\" she shouts. \"I... I can't stand like this much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou increase the rate of the swelling even more and eventually, the weight becomes to much for her and she topples forward, coming to rest on her beanbag-sized breasts. You feel yourself snug between them and the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa!\" Amanda shouts once more, but it falls onto deaf whatever it is that's passing for ears on you. Her body is lifted off the ground by her chest, which expands until both boobs reach the size of love seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think that's enough,\" you say, finally stopping the inflation. Amanda pants, unable to do much of anything other than flail her limbs helplessly. She's lifted far enough off the ground that she can look in the mirror once more and see her helpless ginger body propped up by her behemoth black-bra clad breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, why did you do this?\" she says as she tries in vain to undo your bra straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted you to know what it's like to feel like someone's trapping you!\" you say. \"I guess you could say this was a....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Don't</b> say it,\" Amanda groans. \"Merissa, I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. I felt something when I was in the shower and when I spotted you on the floor I just... I guess I just started taking leave of my senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I found out I'm a genie, I was basically freed from my bottle,\" you explain. \"That meant that I no longer had anything checking the power of my magic, so it could affect the way mortals perceive me. They'd likely lust after me and my power, and I think that's what happened to you. So I'm sorry if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize,\" Amanda interrupts. \"I didn't have to try and hold you captive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's right,\"</i> Merissa responds in your thoughts. <i>\"Just because you've made someone feel something doesn't mean they have to react in a bad way.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were in a bind, Merissa,\" Amanda says. \"Is that what you meant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, Ms. Green,\" you say. \"My powers may attract weirdos like people who hunt magic. And... Mr. Holtz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That creepy guy across the street from you?\" Amanda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he was actually pounding on my door wanting in this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww,\" Amanda says with a shudder, which you feel vibrate her over-sized breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's why I came over to your house. To get away. And also to talk to someone because I'm having to find a new home now. I could probably deal with the creeps but my mom can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see,\" she says. \"Well, if you can make my chest a grotesque parody of the way women are presented in our culture in general, I'm sure you'll do fine finding a place to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, sorry! I guess you've learned your lesson!\" you say as you start to rapidly deflate her breasts, stopping when they're the size of basketballs once again. \"You seemed to like this. Care to stick with these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Amanda says as she stands up again to look in the mirror. \"Thanks but I've had enough on my chest for one day. Besides, I don't want to have to buy new shirts right now. Just take me back to where I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" you say as Amanda's chest returns to its original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you need a place to stay, there's always my bra drawer,\" Amanda teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit that's tempting,\" you say with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the chime of Amanda's doorbell cuts through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, someone's here. I should really get dressed,\" Amanda says as she starts grabbing some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be Jackie,\" you say. \"I told her to meet up with me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Amanda says as she starts quickly pulling up a pair of panties. \"Hey, are you coming off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I'd like to make sure that's Jackie first,\" you say. \"I mean, if you don't mind, Ms. Green.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, and call me 'Amanda!' At least as long as you're my bra, please!\" Amanda pulls a shirt over you, which prompts you to produce another snapping sound so that you'll be able to observe what's going on around you in spite of the shirt covering you. Once Amanda has a pair of pants on, she slips on some sandals and begins running towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell chimes through the house again, prompting Amanda to yell \"I'm coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda gets to the door and looks through the peephole. She whispers, \"Merissa, it's...\"</span></div></div>",

Using the fire for cover, you quickly make the necessary changes to both her body, and her <i>outfit</i>, you included. With a cursory check of Amanda's mind, she seems reserved to dealing with this change, and even seems to be ready to get into character. <i>Great!</i> you think, willing the fire to dissipate. <i>It's show time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa and Jackie, who were now holding each other for support, let out even louder shrieks of fear as Amanda's new form was revealed. <i>\"Wow.\"</i> Merissa thinks in your shared mind. <i>\"You've really outdone yourself.\"</i> You couldn't help but agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood an imposing 9 Feet tall, a total of 10 feet if you included the height of her spiked heels or her large horns. Her skin had turned a slick, menacing red, a fact readily available to anyone with eyes due to the sheer amount of skin you could see, on account of her outfit. Of which it was very, very skimpy. Covering up her new assets was a black, practically paper-thin bikini (the top half being you of course). It left little to the imagination, especially considering how much she'd been <i>upgraded</i>, her new curves spilling out into the open air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't <i>just </i>well-proportioned, however. Her fingers ended in finely-sharpened points, claws that could easily rip someones heart out. Her blood-red horns stood tall and spiraled, like that of a satyr. A long, pointy-ended demon's tail stuck out from her backside, which would make a fine whip if anyone dared get close. Her skin, whilst smooth, was hot to the touch, and flared to skin-searing temperatures at a whim. And finally, she opened her eyes, staring deeply into the souls (metaphorically) of the two girls before her with her purple, imposing, snake-like eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, both and Alyssa and Jackie were on the ground, looking up on the \"demoness\" that once stood where Angela's mother had been in total fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What an entrance.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you weren't certain of is how she was going to play the part. Instinctively, magically, you had no doubt in your mind that she was a capable actor. <i>However</i>, you've just given <i>Amanda </i>the form of a terrifying, sexy demoness. Based on your time shrunken with her earlier, she no-doubt could get carried away in positions of power. And your magic aura might interfere with her behavior, as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your (very comfortable) position on her chest, you watched...</span></div></div>",

Amanda shields her eyes as that light fires out in two beams from your place on Amanda's bosom, which strike both girls and causes them to collapse, crumpling on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez,\" Amanda says as she uncovers her eyes, \"you gave my headlights some serious high beams!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha,\" you laugh. \"Sorry I didn't act sooner.

They're just knocked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief,\" Amanda says. \"I guess they were fighting over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I heard Alyssa asking Jackie something about why she heading somewhere before you started upstairs. She probably meant my house, and she may have prodded Jackie enough to get her to reveal we had a relationship going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so I guess Alyssa had a thing for you, too. Alyssa's mom was telling me that Alyssa was getting frustrated that Jackie seemed to be hooking up with every boy she was interested in, so she didn't think they would be interested in her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Alyssa ever talked to any of those boys, though. She certainly never told me she was interested in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know how Mark and Christine are very conservative, right? It was probably easy for Alyssa to confide to her mom about her boy issues. If they found out she had the same kind of issues with a girl, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I can imagine,\" you say. \"I'm starting to think that Christine might have been the one who brought up Jackie's sex life with my mom, and I guess she was worrying about me getting caught up in that. That was the whole reason we were keeping our relationship a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest, I thought Christine was fretting too much,\" Amanda admits. \"I guess she was worrying about Jackie being a 'corrupting' influence on you and Angela, but I don't think anyone's sex life is anyone's business if nobody's being hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised Jackie got mad at being called a slut,\" you muse. \"I'm am surprised she got so defensive about having me, to the point where she was ready to assault you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well,\" Amanda says as she removes what remains of her shirt, \"I think that probably has something to do with what you told me about your powers being unleashed. You know, I hope they don't go at it again when they wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that's my cue to teach them a lesson,\" you say.</span></div></div>",

As the smoke quickly dissipates, it reveals that Alyssa has been transformed into a red low-cut tank top while Jackie has become a pair of extremely short black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asks Jackie's voice emitting from the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're still here,\" Alyssa's voice groans from the shirt. \"I guess you're either that pair of shorts I see on the ground or they're just yours and you've discarded them because you've found another boy to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother snap comes from you on Amanda's chest, causing Alyssa to go silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just put them on mute, so to speak,\" you say. \"I didn't think you'd want to wear clothes that are clashing with each other verbally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, well, I guess they do need a time out,\" Amanda says as she walks over to examine your work.

But if they're not your style, I can always make adjustments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are fine, Merissa. Your friends are youthful, so it makes sense that the clothes they've become are the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sets Jackie on the table and kicks her sandals off, then slides her jeans down her legs. Once she has them off, she picks Jackie up again and begins to pull her up into position, then fastens her fly. She then picks up Alyssa and pulls her over her head,straightening her up and tucking her inside Jackie. You're still able to see what's going on around you thanks to the spell you cast earlier that allowed you to observe through Amanda's shirt, since that's technically Alyssa now. Finally, she slides her sandals back on and walks over to a nearby mirror to see how she looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't look too bad, I guess,\" Amanda muses. \"As I said, it makes sense that these are youthful clothes but I'm definitely not youthful anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" you say as you again produce a finger snapping sound, causing what few blemishes and wrinkles Amanda had to smooth out, leaving her looking younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's like I'm 25 again!\" Amanda exclaims. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" you say. \"I didn't want you to feel awkward in these clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's weird wearing your daughter's friends,\" Amanda points out. \"Merissa, you could be anywhere right now doing anything, and here you are with me. Any reason for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said earlier, I needed someone to talk to about my being a genie. I was hoping to talk with my friends, but, well, you saw how Jackie and Alyssa got, and they didn't even know I was your bra! So, you know, I really don't have much else to do right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. You made it so your friends can't talk. Are they aware of what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're aware. They know you're wearing them, and they know I'm the one responsible for them being changed. They're still mad at each other, though, but I think after enough time, they'll cool down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls?\" Amanda says as she looks down at her body, addressing Jackie and Alyssa specifically, \"I'm rather disappointed that you two were ready to come to blows over your love lives, not to mention that this was in my own home, and were basically attacking me as well. So I suppose you can consider your time on my body today your punishment. I learned the hard way earlier; just because you're feeling something doesn't justify reacting in a bad way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have been friends your whole lives, and Merissa's your friend, too. You shouldn't let who's dating who get in the way of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think if they had eyes, they'd be rolling them,\" you say. \"But they're calming down. I guess given enough time, I can change them back later and they'll be a little more reasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good, Merissa,\" Amanda says as she starts running her hands along her body. \"They make for nice clothing but I don't want their parents to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you plan on spending the day, Amanda?\" you ask. \"You're the only one here with mobility at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda answers....</span></div></div>",

Once Jackie hits the floor, she reaches behind her back to unfasten your clasp, and gently places you on the ground in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps back, outside of Jackie, and you produce another finger-snapping sound from your bra form, which quickly erupts into an expanding flume of pink smoke. The smoke dissipates, revealing you standing fully clothed at your original height and form... at least, that of Merissa, which is now yours. You look at the now younger-looking Amanda, standing before you naked save for her panties.

The smoke clears and where Amanda once stood, there is now a rather frilly bra, which is red to match Amanda's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, oh, wow,\" the new bra laughs with Amanda's voice. \"This is so different! I feel so soft all over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is unusual, isn't it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so not what I'm used to,\" Amanda agrees. \"So, are you going to put me on, Merissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you respond as you snap your fingers, causing your own clothes to disappear from your body, save for your panties, which you've changed to match the look of Amanda the red bra. You then reach for Amanda and lift her off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick whip of your wrist, you whip Amanda into the air and release her, then quickly snap your fingers, causing your friend's-mother-turned-bra to hover in midair and glide to your bosom. She magically wraps around your chest, cupping your breasts perfectly and clasping behind you as you guide your arms through the straps. You pat yourself, admiring how soft she feels against your boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... this is incredible!\" Amanda exclaims from your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the mirror as Merissa begins to speak in your mind....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You just didn't know how to put a bra on,\"</i> she teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I could learn, but I think this way is more fun,\"</i> you respond in thought as you admire yourself in the mirror, admiring how good you look in Amanda while cupping your boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fantastic, Merissa,\" Amanda compliments.

For a split second it looks like she's about to protest, but she thinks better of it as the idea settles in her mind. She looks around the living room, humming thoughtfully. \"You know, this place does need to be tidied up a bit...what the hell. A little bit of housework never hurt anyone.\" \"I couldn't agree more.\" you reply, and with that, the unconscious forms of your girlfriend and other friend are blanketed in a veil of pink smoke. \"Wait, what are you doing?\" Amanda asks, looking down as the girls are completely covered. \"Are you changing them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they need to look the part.\" you respond, and with the sound of snapping fingers, they both quickly and robotically emerge from the smoke, rising to stand with picture-perfect posture despite their eyes still being shut. You plan to wake them up in a moment, but you want Amanda to see the new outfits first. \"Oh...I see what you mean now.\" she says, looking at her daughters friends with interest. <i>\"Tch. How typical.\"</i> Merissa adds mentally. You ignore Merissa in favor of looking on to their changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've not changed them physically. Well, not <i>overtly </i>physically. Mostly all you did was give them a new change of clothes. To be specific, they're both wearing somewhat <i>stylized </i>maid outfits. Really, it's more cute than sexy in a way, although one would argue that the long leggings and black heels were more of the latter. And you <i>may </i>have given them very short skirts, but that's neither here nor there. Making them look the part was just step one. Step two was making them act it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you snap your imaginary fingers again, this time the loud noise startling both girls awake in an instant, though they both only stumbled slightly as they maintained proper posture. \"Wha...?\" Alyssa starts, looking around in confusion before startling at the sight of Jackie, who looked equally surprised as her eyes met Alyssa's. \"Merd\u00e8!\" Jackie said, before immediately covering her hand with her mouth. \"Wha? Mah voice?\" she asks, confusion evident on her face. \"What ees going on?\" Alyssa adds, looking just as shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, you can order them to do whatever you want.\" you say, not bothering to mention the fact that you gave them thick french accents. You're pretty sure Amanda caught on to that fact already. Both the girls hear you talking and look straight at Amanda's chest, and then up at Amanda, who couldn't hide her amusement of the girls' predicament. \"No, you have Merissa to thank for this.\" Automatically, they look at you and courtsey. \"Zank you, Merissa.\" they both say politely, before their bodies go tense afterwards as they realize what they just did. Amanda can't help but laugh at this. \"That's not what I meant! Wow Merissa, you weren't kidding about them having to do whatever I say.\" \"Merissa did zis?\" Jackie boldly asks. \"Pourquoi?!\" she says, before hitting herself in the neck like that will fix her problems. \"<i>Why</i>?\" she stresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you both were ready to to rip Amanda's shirt off!\" you say, causing both girls to again look down at Amanda's chest in confusion, because they clearly don't understand you're her bra yet. \"You know what, I'm giving the first order. Take these,\" you say, causing two feather dusters to appear in thin air, \"and go dust.\" Jackie and Alyssa both look like they'd love to argue about this some more, but their bodies turn to walk away anyway, the two freshly christened maids heading off to do your bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda couldn't help but grin down at you after they both left. \"This is amazing! Much nicer than when they were fighting. So I can make them do anything?\" \"Yes, anything!\" you reply, although you're starting to wonder if you should add the addendum: \"Anything <i>within reason.</i>\" But that won't be necessary, will it? You talked to Amanda about taking advantage of people, she surely has to have learned her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you're not planning to leave them as maids forever. That'd be cruel and unusual punishment. Just a little while, long enough for them to sort out their differences and cool off. Surely them both being in the same predicament will help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question is, what to do with <i>yourself </i>until you decide they've had enough? You could just hang out on Amanda all day, but as nice as it feels to be a Bra, you're kind of getting a little bored of the situation. A change of scenery would be nice, you think...</span></div></div>",

She must have been watching for your mom to leave since the two of you are secretly lovers. At least, that's how it was in the old version of reality. Jackie had a reputation for having many partners, which you actually found unfair; a guy could have a lot of partners and nobody would say anything, but if Jackie does the same, she's a slut? Your mom became aware of that reputation and started worrying about you and her being together, but you assured her you were just friends since childhood. At least, that's how it started, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa speaks in your mind as you open the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You and this girl indeed have a relationship now, but be careful. Her bond to you was already one of romantic feelings and lust, so she'll be susceptible to your power, unlike your mother.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Merissa, sorry I'm late,\" she says as she stands on her toes to give you a kiss on your lips. \"I got distracted by that weird solar eclipse we just had, then saw that you're mom had come back, so I stayed hidden for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolar eclipse!? That explains why your mom was going to work at night; it wasn't actually night at all! It was morning; apparently, you're starting the day over. As Jackie steps inside, she looks at your living room table and notices the remains of the bottle that once contained your other-other half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! The genie bottle broke!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genie bottle?\" you ask as you raise an eyebrow. \"What do you mean, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Merissa, you don't remember the game we played?\" Jackie recalls, \"When we were younger and I'd come over, we played 'genie' that one time. I played like I was a genie who lived in that bottle and pretended to grant your wishes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah!\" you laugh nervously. \"Now I remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We were about to swap roles but your mom came in and saw you handing me the bottle and freaked out and sent me home. I guess it was more valuable than we thought it was. She must be really upset with you if it's broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she actually took it better than I expected,\" you say. \"I have to be moved out by the time she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" she yells in shock. \"Just because of that bottle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's more than that...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she find out about us?\" she asks with concern. \"I mean, I'd be happy to not have to hide it from her anymore, but still, kicking you out seems pretty harsh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that, either,\" you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Merissa,\" she says, pulling your face to face her own, \"talk to me! Tell her what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa speaks in your mind once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your feelings for this girl are strong. I see that there's no way that you can keep your powers secret from her, and frankly, you have no reason to. Just be cautious about your confidant becoming too overtaken with desire.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie,\" you ask as you stare in her blue eyes, \"if you actually had a chance to have me play as your genie when we were playing, what would you have wished for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, this is no time for that!\" Jackie insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humor me, Jackie.

She looks around, stunned, as she sees her perspective changing as things appear to be getting smaller. Exhilaration courses through her veins as she rises, inch by inch, until finally, she's at eye level with you, now six foot tall with the same proportions she had before, so she looks a little larger than you currently do. You could have done this instantly, but you knew it would be immediately noticeable to Jackie if you let her experience the growth herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened!?\" she asks. \"You did this Merissa!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" you say. \"Turns out that bottle actually had a genie, and that genie is me! And I can grant my own wishes now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Jackie exclaims as she embraces you with her now larger arms. \"I guess that's why your mom didn't want me playing with your bottle, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you say with a smile. \"It's also why I have to leave home, though. My powers are leaking out unchecked and may have an adverse effect on people, making them want me or my power. There's all kinds of weirdos out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jackie says as she looks back to your door, \"Mr. Holtz was outside staring at your home even after your mom left for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder upon hearing that bit of news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can probably handle it but my mom can't,\" you explain, \"which is why I need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she couldn't handle me, either, and now it doesn't matter,\" she says as she leans forward and gives you a deep kiss, allowing you to experience her now proportionately larger lips and tongue against your own. It looks like she's about to lead you to the couch before she pauses and releases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Jackie says with concern, \"are your powers affecting me, too? I mean, aside from your wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" you say sensuously, \"but like I said, I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Merissa,\" Jackie laughs. \"I think for now, I'd rather not risk any of those weirdos you mentioned breaking down your door on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" you say to your now equally tall lover. \"We can continue this anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers, teleporting yourself, Jackie, and your belongings, to...</span></div></div>",

However, now that you've been changed into a girl, you figure that it makes sense that your parents bought you a dollhouse when you were younger. This actually makes you relieved that your mom snatched your bottle away from Jackie before she actually could make that wish. It also makes you intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were having size-related fantasies even then?\" you ask with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha-ha,\" she chides. \"That was innocent, nothing like what the two of us talk about now.

At the sound of that snap, you feel your body start to lighten in weight and pull itself inward. Everything in your living room appears to be getting bigger, except for Jackie, who looks to be remaining at your current scale but moving further and further away as you both diminish. You stare straight at her in awe of what's happening, while she glances around, stunned at everything growing larger around her. It takes all of 4 seconds for the process you wished for to complete itself, and you now stand 4 inches in height while Jackie is about two-thirds of an inch shorter than you. With the process having stopped, Jackie runs toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa?\" she squeaks in a now higher-pitched than usual. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, your voice!\" you laugh with a squeaky voice of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My voice? What about yours?\" she giggles, eased by your own laughter as she approaches and embraces you. \"Did you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\" you excitedly admit. \"Turns out that bottle actually did have a genie, and that genie is me! And I grant my own wishes now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unreal!\" she exclaims. \"I guess it also explains why your mom was so worried about that bottle.

The vortex curves to surround Ms. Nichols, who begins screaming as, from feet upwards, her body begins to transform into blue smoke. That smoke is pulled into the container via the magic vortex, consuming all of her until only her head remains. Her screaming ends when that, too, becomes smoke and is absorbed into the vessel as the vortex begins to wane.

The voice of that genie speaks to you in your mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Reality has changed. Your mother didn't have a son; she had a daughter, named Merissa, and we are her.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Ms. Nichols,\" you respond, \"how did you get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom must not have locked the door when she left for work. I'm sorry for barging in, but I had this strange feeling that something was going on over here during that solar eclipse that just happened, and I wanted to check in on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolar eclipse? You didn't think we were due for one. You look outside and see the darkness fading away, revealing a bright, sunny morning. It wasn't nighttime like you thought; apparently, you've started the day over. Merissa's voice speaks to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That 'solar eclipse' was actually an extremely local phenomenon brought about as a result of my power being unbound by my old body.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" she says, pointing at the floor. \"That bottle broke!\" You look and see the remains of the bottle that once contained your other half lying where she points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was just dusting it when I was distracted by that eclipse and dropped it by mistake,\" you say. It's half-true. You did drop it while dusting it but you don't remember it breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I think I can piece it back together and have it looking like mostly-new,\" she says. \"I have some Power-Glue back at my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to worry about that, Ms. Nichols,\" you respond. \"I'll just explain to mom and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" she says. \"I know it's just an old bottle but if I can save you a scolding from your mom, it'll be worth while right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it hard to fault Ms. Nichols' logic. \"Yeah, okay, I'll let you repair it, Ms. Nichols!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" she says with a smile. \"Let's gather the pieces up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to the kitchen to grab a canvas shopping bag to set the pieces of the vessel in, then help Ms. Nichols gather them up. As you do so, Merissa speaks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Three things: Number one: the bottle breaking is symbolic of you being unleashed.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I figured,\"</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Number two: the only reason your neighbor thinks it's just an old bottle is because one of the two wishes your mother, who was also technically your master, made, was that it look like an ordinary bottle to everyone else, including your late father, and even you. Of course, now you know it's not.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Understood,</i>\" you think as you drape the bag with the bottle pieces around your shoulder. <i>\"And what's three?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Number three: While this might seem like neighborly concern, she is feeling the effect of your unbound magic. This may be due to attraction that you've felt for her enticing her unknowingly. The longer you stay around her, the more it will escalate.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh dear,\"</i> you say as you follow Ms. Nichols out the door, noticing there's a little bit more spring in her step than you've seen before. After you lock your door and proceed to her house, Merissa continues...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't know if she'll lust after your magic or your body, or even both. Regardless, I'll be here with you to guide you, or make suggestions, depending on how you want to approach things. Remember first and foremost that you are never trapped by the whims of mundane mortals; you are an immortal force now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll try to keep that in mind,\"</i> you think as you enter Ms. Nichols' home and close her door, locking it behind you. You've been in her living room a few times before with your mother years ago after she just moved in and it looks about the same. Some furniture is moved around, there's a new TV, but otherwise, there's nothing that really stands out. You walk past her end table and notice that next to the telephone, there's a note with a law firm's phone number written on it, along with a doodle of a stick-figure with crudely-drawn hair and breasts bringing her foot down on a much smaller stick-figure. You've never asked Ms. Nichols about her ex-husband, but you get the feeling she's not happy at all with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep the Power-Glue in my little workshop,\" she says as she leads you up the stairs. It seems to you like she's making more of an attempt to walk sexy as she takes each step, but you try to keep your old crush for her in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns at the top of the stairs and continues down the hallway, past the open door of her bedroom that looks like it has a soft bed, to a room at the very end of the hall. She opens it and flicks the light switch inside and invite you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe center of the room has a little work table inside, covered in various arts-and-crafts supplies. The walls are covered in shelves, adorned with dolls of various kinds on one side and model cars, many of which are either of sports cars, muscle cars, exotic vehicles on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my hobby room, Merissa,\" Ms. Nichols announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen your collections before,\" you say. \"I'm impressed with them, Ms. Nichols!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Barbara,\" she says. \"We're both adults here, Merissa.\" Though she said this in a casual manner, it doesn't stop you from gulping a little as you worry about whatever effect you might be having on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, 'Barbara,'\" you say, as you set your bag of bottle parts on her work table. \"How did you get so many of both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been collecting dolls and designing them since I was a little girl,\" she recalls as she starts pulling the pieces out. \"Then, when I was a teenager, I started taking an interest in cars. I've always wanted to own a garage full of cars, but life and my paychecks conspired against me! But at least this way, I can have a little collection. Anyway, let's get started putting this bottle back together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull another chair up to her desk and watch as she begins to piece the bottle parts back together again. There are two main halves, along with a few pieces between them. She affixes the pieces the smaller pieces to the larger ones with her glue and sets them down on the table, then looks at you. \"We need to let those pieces sit for a while and dry before sticking them back together,\" she says. \"Frankly, though, I'm starting to think this wasn't the best idea. I think the damage is going to be more visible than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay... Barbara,\" you say. \"Maybe it'll turn out nice when it's finished. Thanks for trying to keep me out of trouble, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all, Merissa,\" she laughs. \"You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that bottle contained a genie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You don't say?\"</i> Merissa voice snaps in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you say, with a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, it's silly,\" Barbara laughs. \"Merissa, if you had a genie, what would you wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm,\" you pause, \"unlimited wishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Barbara remarks, \"you'd probably have to pay some kind of price for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You have no idea, sister.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you dreads what's about to come from your lips. You get the feeling it's going to start all kinds of trouble. But part of you feels a great deal of anticipation at what you're about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ask her! Assssssssssk her!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat part of you is named, \"Merissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Barbara,\" you ask, \"what would you wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" she ponders, \"part of me wants revenge on my ex, but I really just want to him to pay the damn alimony he keeps trying to weasel his way out of and be out of my hair forever. I'd rather not waste a wish on him if I could help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to her notepad on her end table and think, \"You don't imagine, like, growing to giant size and stomping on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might joke about it sometimes, but that's like stepping in manure if you ask me,\" she laughs. \"But you know, I sometimes like to imagine my cars and dolls are real when I handle them. And sometimes, I imagine myself at their scale so I could wear their clothes, or pretend to crawl inside my vehicles and drive them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I think I know why you're asking me this,\" she says as she gets up out of her chair. \"Stay right here.\" You watch her walk out the room and down the hall to her bed room, where you hear her going through some papers. She walks back to you in her hobby room and places a drawing on her work table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at it and recognize it as something you drew, when you were younger, that you thought had fallen out of your book bag. It's a sketch of Ms. Nichols, in her underwear, holding a tiny you up. Although, in this case, instead of holding up your former male form, she's holding up you as Merissa at that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this in my yard a few years ago,\" she says. \"I thought it was weird, but cute at the same time, so I hung on to it. I'm get the feeling it might have been more than 'cute' with you, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, but Barbara places her hand on yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merissa, like I said earlier, we're both adults now.  And it's okay. I told you, I have that fantasy sometimes, too. I would never ask you this if you were still a child, but... if you want, we could explore that fantasy together right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Merissa speak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your power led her to you, but this looks like something she actually wants of you,so you should know you're not taking advantage of her if you want to move forward. Be cautious, though.\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about I help 'you' complete your model car collection?\" you ask the late-thirtysomething blonde who was prepared to blackmail you to get what she wanted out of you, now petrified both by your magic and the idea that she's getting more than she hope to bargain for from you. You spin her around in mid-air and guide her over to her shelves full of models, which you overlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it looks like these are all at the same scale,\" you observe before looking at her. \"1:12\", right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, eyes wide with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very well curated,\" you compliment her with a bit of condescension in your voice. \"You know, I think I know what would complete this collection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers, summoning a copy of a car magazine to your hands from your room. You point to the cover, featuring a cherry red Camaro, along with a busty model wearing a red visor, red bikini top, cut-off jeans over a red thong whose straps are sticking out the top, and red high heels. Admittedly, you bought the magazine for the model as much as you did the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's always been my dream car,\" you say. \"I think your collection needs a model of it. Do you know if they sell one at hobby shops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't answer. She just stares at you in dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no matter. I guess I'll find the parts <i>somewhere,</i>\" you say as you snap your fingers, causing Barbara to disappear. When she reappears lying down, she sees you walk over to her from the model car shelves and look over her. She realizes that she's been shrunk to about 18 inches tall and is lying on her work table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you had the fantasy of shrinking down to really get into your work, Barbara,\" you say as she cringes at the sight of your face looking down at her above your large chest.  \"Right now, you're still too big to climb into the cars. But I had planned to let you be really 'into your work' in a different way.\" You laugh and snap your fingers, causing Barbara Nichols' fit form to collapse into various tiny parts that can be fit together to form a scale version of your dream car. You quickly reach for a tire that started rolling and snatch it well before it has a chance to careen off the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's going on?\" you hear Barbara's tiny voice project from each of the separate parts. \"What happened? I feel like I'm... all over the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me help you get yourself together again,\" you taunt as you wave your hands and cause all of the pieces to fly around in a circle. You snap your fingers to summon a tube of model glue, which you wave a finger to open. You then carefully start positioning individual pieces to receive drops of glue so they can be stuck together properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only try that for a second before remembering why you never got into model car building in the first place. You snap your fingers to have the glue spray out rapidly into just the right places, then have the pieces assemble themselves into perfect position, resembling the body of the car on your magazine. You snap your fingers to both grant Barbara vision through her windshield and summon a mirror, which you hold in front Barbara the model Camaro as she floats in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" she yells!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, we're not done yet!\" as you set the mirror don and snap your fingers once more, causing the glue to dry immediately. You then procure a bottle of primer paint from her paint set and pour it down your mouth, then spit the paint back out in a mist which coats everything it's supposed to (i.e. not the windows). You repeat the process with metallic cherry red paint and chrome, coating her perfectly. You snap your fingers so that the paint will dry, and lower Barbara's model car body down to her work table. You hold the mirror up in front of her windshield again, along with the cover of your magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out, Barbara! You're really cut out to be a model... car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this!\" she begs. \"Please, Merissa! I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa's voice speaks to you once more, cackling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ha ha ha! Excellent work, Merissa! You've shown her you're not to be trifled with! You can keep her like this if you want, of course.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I might, but I have a couple of ideas since I got her here.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbara, I'm not quite done having fun with you yet,\" you announce.</span></div></div>",

As much as you'd like to do this in her paved driveway, you'd like a little privacy and you know that no one in the immediate area is at home right now. Plus, there's a paved path leading from the driveway to her door, so you can use that for your miniature photo shoot as a stand-in driveway at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set Barbara on the path and look at the brunette model on the cover of the magazine that your brought with you. You snap your fingers and suddenly, right next to Barbara on the concrete, there is another scale model standing next to her; specifically, a miniature version of the woman on your magazine cover wearing the exact same outfit of a bikini, thong, cut-off shorts and high heels standing just a little bit under six inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be Merissa!\" the model says. \"I take it this is the site of the photo shoot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Lucy,\" you say as you snap your fingers again, causing a professional quality digital camera to appear in your hands. \"Let's get a few of you standing in front of Barbara there.\" Lucy the miniature model begins making multiple poses in front of Barbara as you begin snapping a lot of pictures and shouting encouragement and direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\" Barbara pleads with Lucy. \"You have to help me somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got the easy job, hun,\" Lucy quips. \"Just stand there. I'm the one who has to pose. I'll do all the work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you say to Lucy. \"Now let's get a few of you sitting on her bumper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on Earth are you okay with this?\" Barbara asks Lucy as she places her tiny, shapely butt on Barbara's plastic car body. \"She shrunk you and is holding you prisoner like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Lucy says as she continues to pose for your camera. \"I'm not really that same woman. I'm a duplicate she created. She's not upset with the real deal like she is with you. Plus, I'm a professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are great, Lucy,\" you say. \"Now, let's go to the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara can only sit in stunned silence as you continue the photo-shoot, directing Lucy to lean her curvy body against the model car, then sit inside after opening Barbara's articulated door. You finally conclude with Lucy splayed across Barbara's hood as an idea crosses your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy,\" you say as you snap your last pictures, \"I've been considering a career in modeling. Do you think I might have what it takes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'd go far,\" she says. \"You have the height and the body for it. You know, I dabble a little in photography as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought I'd seen that in your bio. Say, this is unusual, but how would you like to switch jobs here, Lisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm up for anything once,\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers, causing the tiny model to disappear, then reappear at full height next to you, just an inch or two shorter. You hand her the camera and snap your fingers again, appearing exactly six-inches tall in the same outfit as Lisa in front of Barbara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, now that I'm down here with you, I see that I really did a good job with putting you together, Barbara,\" you say as you look her over now that you share her scale. She doesn't respond, still in shock at the whole experience perhaps. You then turn back to the now giant-sized (to you) Lisa and await direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with a few in the front, Merissa, like you took wit me,\" the monolithic model directs. You start posing, making sure that Barbara gets a good view of your posterior though her windshield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it's all Barbara can do to be silent, as you make poses that are more risqu\u00e9 than the one's Lisa made. You make sure to rub your sexy body up against her plastic one at each opportunity you get, culminating in a finish of you lying upon her hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to get a few shots for my 'private collection,' Lisa,\" you say as you begin removing your top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your camera, Merissa,\" she says as she keeps snapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast the bikini aside and splay yourself out on Barbara's hood, making sure Lisa has a good angle. Finally, lays herself down on the walkway so that she can get a few shots of you at ground level. You spin around on Barbara's hood and roll over, pressing your breasts against it for the final shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are have all turned out great, Merissa!\" Lisa says as she sits the camera down in front of you so that you can see them displayed on the screen.  She cycles through them with her giant finger as you slide off of Barbara, allowing you to see the many shots both you and her have taken, culminating with your topless poses atop Barbara at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have a hard time selecting which ones are my favorites!\" you say, before turning to Barbara. \"What do you think, Barbara?\" you ask with a taunting-yet-sensuous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they look pretty good, too!\" the model Camaro answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say, not expecting that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be a model, too, before I married my ex. That was some really good work there, Merissa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, thanks?\" you respond, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I now realize I was wrong to try to blackmail you into having sex. I should have taken 'no' for an answer, especially considering that I hated when my ex-husband was resentful whenever I said 'no' to his requests. I have no idea what came over me, but I don't think there's any real excuse for it. I'm very sorry, Merissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Okay, apology accepted, Barbara,\" you say. \"You mean you're not upset with me transforming you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything, I love it now! I'd be happy to stay this way forever if you wanted, especially if you're willing to do more stuff like that with me! I mean, the bank's about to foreclose on my home and  that damned title pawn place is set to repossess my car, so if anything, this means I don't have to worry about a place to stay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say with a pause, \"that's really sad.\" You slump your tiny topless body down into sitting position in front of her bumper as Merissa' voice speaks in your mind... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It appears that your unchecked power doesn't just provoke lust, but perhaps empathy as well. Had you been stomping on her, she may have reacted differently, but once she got a feel that she wasn't in any real danger, she picked up on your vibes and realized the error of her ways. So she is truly remorseful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, while some people do have a transformation fetish, I wasn't necessarily getting that vibe from Barbara, so it's odd that she's happy with her current state. Perhaps it's a combination of the hard times she's going through and, again, your unchecked power. Plus, your sexy display just now. That was masterful, by the way.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I guess this is a wrap?\" the giant Lisa says as she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, \"Oh, yeah, sure, Lisa. Thanks for your work. If anything else comes up, I'll keep you in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! I hope I get a chance to work with you again, Merissa!\" she says with a smile before she disappears after a snap of your fingers. You snap your fingers again and find yourself back in the clothes you were wearing before donning the model's attire, but remaining at your size so that you can open up Barbara's door and climb into her driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbara,\" you say as you scoot over to her passenger seat...</span></div></div>",

I have the final say of where you end up though. If you wish I could put you somewhere more pleasant.\" Under her breath she adds, \"For one of us at least\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like the sound of that.

I've never been an actual goddess before.\" chuckled Merissa. The walls of her stomach pushed in as she rubbed it, sending more people into hysteria. \"I mean... what kind of food do I need to eat for you all?\" she asked, amused at this. \"What about water?

The all powerful genie would be your only company, and she was definitely not gonna be fun to be around for the rest of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little master, anything else you want to wish for\"?

Above you, a distance you can't even put a name too away, is Merissas face. Her planet sized smile meets your gaze and sends a shiver down your spine. You didn't know how small you were now, but you were definitely standing on one of Merissas tits. The thing seemed like an infinite plane of tanned flesh to your senses. \"Merissa!\" You bellow with all your might, shakily trying to right yourself. \"Change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that 'Master'?\" Merissa asks, voice now loud enough to cause you to clap your hands over your ears. \"I can't hear you, but I assume you appreciate your reward.

You squeeze your eyes shut at the moment of impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStay a while? What did that mean? The feeling of movement accosts your senses, darkness replacing the light of the room you'd been standing in. Opening your eyes you see nothing ahead of you. Wherever you are, the passage ahead is so tight you can't move your arms at all, something keeping them pinned beside you. Whatever was ahead, it was incredibly warm. Before you know it you're sweating from the heat alone. Realizing nothing is binding you legs you begin to flail them, trying to use them to shift your weight backwards and escape whatever punishment Merissa had planned for you. You make a little headway before the world suddenly inverts, your legs were now pointed upward. Try as you might flailing now was only causing you to slide down faster. You'd be fine as long as you didn't move. Something touched the bottom of your feet in the next moment, exerting enough force against you to slide you all the way into the darkness. \"Nononononononononono!\" you bellow as you feel yourself sliding more easily now. In the next moment your arms and legs come free, and you can feel yourself falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, you again squeeze your eyes shut. You free fall for a good half minute before crashing down into liquid of some kind. your head submerges and it rushes into your nose and mouth, surprising you. With movements of your arms and legs you break the surface, coughing and sputtering. The world again moves, you're not even sure how to describe it, but the liquid remains constant. Where ever you were, it was pitch black, hot, and you could hear a loud rhythmic beating in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you consider what's going on, you decide some light might help. Remembering your phones water proof case you dig into your pocket, retrieving the wonder of modern technology. It clicks as you open it, taking your phone out before turning on it's LED light. The walls that surrounded you were an odd pink color, the liquid you'd been dropped into was white and now that you thought about it, tasted rather sweet. Putting two and two together finally you can't help but curse your own greed. Merissa's voice echoes through the walls of your fleshy prison.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa smiled as she held her breast in her hand, the back half of her former master protruded from her nipple. He was flailing in an attempt to get out. God, humans were so cute. With a slight giggle of amusement she tilted her breast upward, watching as he master slid further in slightly. This was almost too easy. Apparently people in this time had forgotten how to handle genies. No fool the last time she was out would have wished for unlimited wishes. A frown crossed her face as her former master stopped wiggling, slowing his descent into her breast.  She'd really wanted to enjoy the feeling of power she had by letting him fall with nothing but gravity, but if she didn't get involved, he might find a way out. Smiling she took one of her fingers placing it against her masters feet before pushing him in. Her nipple returned to normal as her finger ran into it, Merissa biting her lip as she felt the fear and panic in her former masters mind. Slowly she tweaked her own nipple for a moment before letting her breast fall back where it belonged, tucking it into her clothing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun in there, 'Master', I don't think you'll be able to leave for a good long while!\" She taunted, turning her attention to a nearby window. How had the world changed since her last time out?</span></div></div>",

She guided it quickly to her breast, forcing it into your hand before closing it. she giggled at you as you slowly began to fondle it. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad. You pull your head away, looking to Merissas face. The genie smiles at you confidently, you smile back taking her other breast in her other hand. In all your days you'd never thought you'd one day be playing with tits this big. Wait til you told everybody about this. Within moments her nipples become erect, poking against your palms. Apparently Merissa was enjoying this as much as you were. You pull one of your hands away from her tit, looking at the exposed nipple. Again you look to her face. \"...can I?\" You ask, looking back to the breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerissa simply laughs, smiling at you. \"It's all you, 'Master', do what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened by her statement, you turn your face to her tit, rubbing your head against it for a moment before slowly beginning to kiss it. After a few kisses, you pull your head away to begin sucking...only to find you can't pull your head away. Panic sets in as you try again and fail, your face drifting closer to Merissas breast. You try to pull your hands away, but find those don't move either. Glancing to your right, you see your right hand has sunken into Merissas tit. Your eyes widen as your wrist slowly follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so alarmed, 'Master'? I said it was all you, didn't I!\" Merissa grins, your arm sinking in further as half of your head follows. This was something you'd never thought of happening, not even in your wildest most bizare fetishist dreams. Well okay, that wasn't entirely true, but you'd never thought you'd experience it. your senses begin to grow hazy as the sound of a rhythmic beating fills your ears. You try to pull back, but that rhythm is just so hypnotic. Before long it's all you can think about. Merissa grins as the last of your form melds into her torso, biting her lip at the sensation of swelling that was filling her chest. Slowly her breasts grow, your mass and matter mingling with what was already present. Pleasured moans escape the genie as he begins to fondle her new assets. A scream of ecstasy escapes her moments later as the swelling stops. Her massive yams had grown to sizes impossible for most women to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to keep this in mind.\" Merissa says to herself as she places her breasts back in the leotard, the seams of the outfit stretching to their limits as she zips up. She looked to her lamp, smiling as she snapped her finger and sent it to the bottom of the deepest ocean. With that, no one would be able to enslave her ever again.</span></div></div>",

Shouldn't be that much longer.\"  After about 20 minutes, Merissa finally stopped and placed Megan back down on the floor as the girl rubbed her sore backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Merissa said, \"that was your final wish.

That's crazy, I don't want to be a genie.\"  Merissa laughed and replied \"I kinda figured, but don't worry, you'll get into it soon enough.\"  She then snapped her fingers and gold bracelets appeared on Megan's wrists.  \"There,\" Merissa said, \"you are now a genie, bound to a bottle through your bracelets.\"  Megan immediately tried taking them off but found that there was no way.  Merissa waved her hand and the two were instantly teleported to a strange new place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked around and saw that she was in a room that looked like a harem.  She searched for an exit but found none and she asked \"where are we?\"  Merissa pointed to a window and said \"take a look.\"  Megan walked over and saw that she could see the room she had just been in.  It then dawned on her and she exclaimed \"no!\"  Merissa smiled and said \"that's right, we are now inside my lamp.  Well actually, your lamp.\"  Megan tried again to look for a way out but then felt her body unable to move.  She was lifted off the floor by an invisible force and turned around.  She saw Merissa holding out her hand and was levitated towards it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Merissa said, \"we have to go through genie orientation.\"  Megan squirmed against the invisible bonds and said \"let me go!\"  Merissa shook her head and said \"look, even if I wanted to, I couldn't.  There are rules.  Once a girl completes her three wishes with a senior genie, she becomes a junior genie.\"  Megan was confused and asked \"what's the difference?\"  Merissa continued \"a senior genie is someone who has had 10 masters or more.  When a master completes her wishes, she becomes a junior genie, subject to greater restrictions than a senior genie.\"  Megan was now curious and asked \"what kind of restrictions?\"  Merissa responded \"well, for starters, she must be supervised at all times by the senior genie, until she gains the status of senior genie herself.\"  Merissa then grabbed Megan by her cheeks, pinching them in so Megan's lips puckered, and Merissa planted a long kiss on Megan's lips.  \"So,\" she said as she pulled away from the shocked girl, \"we're going to be seeing a lot of each other for a while.\"  Merissa then said \"in addition, a junior genie, in light of her inexperience, isn't allowed to interpret wishes herself; rather, the wish is based on the inner thoughts of the master, to ensure that the wish is correct.\"  Merissa walked around Megan and slapped the floating girl on her naked ass as she said \"finally, while a senior genie has full use of her powers at all times, a junior genie may only use her powers when necessary to grant a wish.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Merissa said, \"it may be a while before someone finds the lamp and request a wish, so we need to kill some time.\"  She grabbed Megan, who was about half her size, and pulled her onto a couch.  Megan tried to get away but even without the use of her powers Merissa was much stronger than her.  She pulled Megan on top of her, wrapped her arms around the girl and began kissing her over and over again.  Megan was helpless to free herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several days, the two were interrupted by someone rubbing the lamp.  It was......</span></div></div>",

She looked up at you and then the next thing you knew, the elegantly dressed woman lifted you up and you felt light headed. Her face was enormous to you and she looked at you, her lips perched to the side and she smiled broadly. \"I'll take it,\" she said grinning at you, you were shocked at her words! You were not just some piece of art she could just buy! When the owner of the store walked over you could tell that it was Merissa! You tried to glare and she smiled at you, \"A very beautiful piece Ma'am! that will be $500.00 U.S please!\" She said happier then a school girl. What!? You are not just some slave that could be bought! What the hell was going on! You watched the woman hand over the money and she tucked you under her arm, your face pressed against her breast as she carried you out. \"Relax Kid!\" Merissa's voice rang in your head. You felt a wave of anger and you spoke back, \"What the hell is going on! Who is this woman! What happened to me!\" You screamed at her, very angry. \"Calm down! Sheesh! You wished to be beautiful, well people usually use that to describe Paintings. So I turned you into a very beautiful and sexy painting! When this old broad walked in I could sense and feel the desire in her, so  I pointed you out to her and she fell in love!\" Merissa laughed in your mind. \"I mean... She thinks you are the sexiest thing on earth! And all the things she thought about doing to you... Wow... you wouldn't believe it... Now since I sold you, You're all hers! and she doesn't have the slightest thought about giving you up! Ha ha! You two will have alot of fun together! Talk to you soon!\" You were now terrified! What was she talking about!? This was Crazy! the whole time this conversation took place you never noticed the woman pulling up in her home and taking you inside. \"No!\" You screamed in terror as you saw her going upstairs. This was not good! there was nothing you could do either! She held you up smiling and she set you on the wall above her bed. \"There we are...\" She placed her finger on your chest area and she rubbed it letting out a soft moan of pleasure. \"You are too perfect.. So sexy... God if you were only real...\" She grinned at you and then next thing you knew she was undressing! He breasts were exposed and she never too her eyes off of you, like it was a show for you! She wasn't bad looking, very nice older woman but this was crazy! Bought by a sex crazed old woman who wants you for herself! The woman smiled at you and she then laid down on top of the covers so you could still see her. She rolled a bit and then went to sleep, a very beautiful smile on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What do you have in mind?\" you stutter in fear. \"Well...

The threads wind back together, dressing Alyssa in something not entirely unlike what the genie was wearing. As the outfit forms, Alyssa slowly dwindles in size stopping only when she was the same size as you. \"It's been so long since i've had a little toy of my own! Well, other than my 'son', here.

It's cleaned out and everything!\" Angela speaks out. \"Could... Could I take him with me? to my house?\" Angela asks Merissa. \"I don't see why not!\" Merissa says. Almost ImmediatelyAngela Bends down and scoops you up in her arms. \"You are soooo cute!\" she says petting you down your back and tickling your stomach with her huge finger. She walks out the door and you look back to see Merissa waving. She tells you in your mind \"Oh I modded the Collar! Now you have to obey everyones commands!\" She says laughing. Angela takes you to her car and plops you in her lap. Your leash still in her hand you sit in her crotch, \"Try not to get too excited down there!\" she tells you laughing. She starts the car and begins to drive to her house. When she gets there she picks you up and holds you in her right hand, she gets her keys and unlocks the door. She takes you to her room and sits wiht you on her bed. \"You are just too cute!\" she says still petting you. Just then the phone rings and it's Merissa! You don't hear much the conversation but when Angela hangs up she looks at you and frowns... \"Looks like your staying the night little guy!\" she says. \"Now what should we do? We could invite Alyssa over... Or spend some \"Time\" together just you and me!\" she says smiling down at you, what do you pick?</span></div></div>",
