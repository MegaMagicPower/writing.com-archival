After she was done eating she let loose a burp that even made tito proud of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette: *lets loose a huge burp* URPPP mmm that was good now it's time to rest up for the night and get ready for tomorrrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the day of the competition arrived as tito a rather plus sized chihuahua who was indeed tall and morbidly obese accompanied his sweetheart a now 850lbs poodle who was heavily stomping to where her seat was. As soon as she got there she noticed a few other plus sized female contestants as well along with their plus sized loving husbands who were to cheer on their wives. Then the competition began as georgette simply dominated from the start as she was eating every kind of fattening food she got her paws on until she was officially declared the winner of the new york state eating competition and was awarded the prize of $1,000,000 and a lifetime supply of ubermass dogfood for her friends and herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito: sweetheart i'm so proud of you for winning and as an added bonus we'll go on a date together if you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette: tito my plus sized hunk i'd love to.</span></div></div>",

Tito seemed to like it, he sat back, enjoying the show. Tito snapped out of his trance. <br>\r\n\"Wait sweetheart, weren't we gonna go on a date?\" Tito remembered, but the poodle was too busy stuffing herself with the dog-food. She started slow and seductive, but she looked and ate like a pig as she progressed. \"This is a date enough...\" Said the poodle with her mouth full. <br>\r\nTito was shocked, she's never rejected a date, OR talked with her mouth full. \"I think we should go home now fluffernutter...\" The chihuahua gestured. He looked at Georgette who was defiantly bigger. Her butt has formed large cheeks that blocked his vision, her gut sagged into the floor, nearly stuck there, her face has developed many chins, and her legs were inflated like sausages.

YUMMY AND DELICIOUS she said.<br>\r\nAfter she became the size of the earth, the three scientists that were at tito's dogfood stand ran over to the alleyway where superdog was at.<br>\r\ndodger: superdog you've got to stop the blueberry doggie doughgirl before she pigs out on the earth.<br>\r\nsuperdog: stop her? are you nuts? look at the size of her. you'd need a cookie cutter the size of the moon.<br>\r\ndodger: no problem i along with my assistants can make you as big as her.<br>\r\nsuperdog: that yeast blaster won't work on me guys.Unforunately i'm not made out dough at all.<br>\r\ndodger: this isn't really my yeast blaster it's really my superdog inflator.<br>\r\nsuperdog: oh that's different.<br>\r\ndodger: okay guys start pumping up superdog.<br>\r\nAnd so they started inflating superdog until he became the size as his girlfriend the blueberry doggie doughgirl and walked over to her while she was still eating the earth.That's when she noticed him and said:<br>\r\nblueberry doggie doughgirl: HI THERE YOU EARTHSIZED SUPERDOG HUNK OF MINE.<br>\r\nsuperdog: HELLO THERE MY OVERSTUFFED BLUEBERRY SWEETIE PIE<br>\r\nThen dodger calls out to him<br>\r\ndodger: superdog quick finish her off!<br>\r\nsuperdog: ARE YOU KIDDING I THINK I'M IN LOVE.<br>\r\nAnd so superdog asked his girlfriend<br>\r\nsuperdog:ARE YOU GOING TO SHARE THAT WITH ME? she then hands some to him and he says<br>\r\nsuperdog:THANKS <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lay down next to him, in much the same position, her larger waistline just as exposed as Oliver's stomach. She then explained: \"See, after they have cake, they're going to come over to get the presents opened. Thing is, though, that we'll give them an extra present. There's no way they'll be able to resist giving us belly rubs when they see us like this, and they're all going to make it last a good, long time. I've seen how much children like giving cats and dogs belly rubs. They can't get enough of it.\" \"Hey, sounds like we're in for a real treat!\" Oliver smiled. \"We sure are.\" Georgette smiled back. \"Just close your eyes and wait for the nice feeling of tummy rubbing...\" So they lay back and closed their eyes, and it was not long, since kids tend to eat cake at a rapid rate due to how much they like the way it tastes, before they were hearing: \"Oh-Em-Gee! THAT IS SO CUTE AND DARLING! Let's rub them before the gifts get opened!\" and then feeling their bigger bellies being rubbed, caressed, petted, stroked and kissed by child after child, said rubbing lasting so long and being so nice that neither Oliver nor Georgette ever wanted it to end. \"Oh, you were right, Georgette. This IS fun.\" Oliver purred. \"Told you it would be.\" Georgette replied. \"Who knows? I bet Jenny might even bring home some of the treats and such and let us have some when her parents aren't looking.\" \"Wouldn't that be super?\" Oliver agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the kids finished up with the belly rubs and got to opening the gifts, but Oliver and Georgette suddenly opened their eyes when...</span></div></div>",

I'm so sorry, Georgette. I know you'll probably hate me for this, but this is the only chance I'll ever get to do this, and I just can't pass it up.

Ironically, she had soon laughed so much that all of the inflating helium she'd taken in from the vacuum had gone out of her, and she was back to normal, much to Oliver's surprise as well as her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you know? You've tickled me back to normal! Allow me to thank you for it...\" Georgette said, getting back on all four feet and looking down at him with a cruel grin.

I have no intentions of harming you...\" \"Oh, that's a relief.\" Oliver replied. Suddenly, though, she flipped him over onto his back and put her paws on his belly, prompting Oliver to say: \"Georgette? What are you doing?\" Georgette replied: \"I said I wouldn't INJURE you. I didn't say anything about TICKLING YOU BACK! SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT!!\" She then tickled Oliver all over his belly, and since Oliver was even more ticklish than she was, he was laughing even louder, longer and harder than she had been seconds ago. Georgette was fully smiling all the while, while Oliver caterwauled(pun intended): \"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! NOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!!!
