            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an unusually bustling night at Beacon Academy. Normally students would be relaxing in their dorms either sleeping or studying but this night was a special occasion. The school has decided to put on something of a show for their students. A little treat to help boost the young adults morale and for this night they were going to be treated to a very special show. Tonight the students of Beacon Academy will be enjoying a Hypnosis Show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudents and teachers alike all cram into the Auditorium. The seats were completely filled as students all patiently waited for the show to begin. Teams like JNPR and CFVY speak amongst themselves and speculate on what my happen in the show. Staff like Glynda try to make sure none of students are causing any trouble as she scans the room from the side, and even special guest from other academies  like Winter Schnee stand at the back not really expecting much but is happy to take a quick break. Although one group seems to be mysteriously absent in all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the audience quiets down as they notice the lights dim. All eyes turn to the stage to the giant red curtain that still covers it. A loud voice calls forth from the auditorium speakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentleman of Beacon Academy, I welcome you to a night of fun, fantasy, laughter, and scandal. I am your humble host 'The Hypnotist' and I welcome you to my hypnosis spectacular!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtains lift to reveal a well dressed man in a top hat standing in front of four girls seated in ar row. the audience appluases and he bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank all but I'm not here alone tonight with me are four gorgeous volunteers that were pre selected to be our lucky victims. Give it up for Beacons own TEAM RWBY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotist steps aside revealing its in fact the four members of the titular team RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow I didn't expect everyone to be here for this. I'm getting kind of nervous.\" On the left most seat was the leader of the team, Ruby Rose, who waves back at the audience nervously with a slight blush and a very warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please this is nothing, you should have seen some of the crowds I used to attract when I sung. Those were the days.\" On the second chair to the left was the white haired heiress herself, Weiss Schnee, who was giving a polite hand wave but based on her expression she wasn't really excited to participate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well let's just get this over with. Sooner we get this done the sooner we can get our extra credit.\" In the third seat was the dark and mysterious member of the party, Blake Belladonna, who did not wave and was clearly uncomfortable with all the attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on be like that. This is gonna be a ton of fun I can feel it! Cheer up Blake we got a whole room eager to see your smile.\" On the last seat was the blonde bombshell and sister to Ruby, Yang Xiao Long, who playfully elbowed her faunus neighbor before waving triumphantly towards the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the crowd simmers down and the hypnotist comes forward once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes thank you to our lovely volunteers for participating in my show tonight. I have a very exciting show planned for both them and all of you my loving audience. I have so many things planned I may not have time to actually show all of it in one show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolsters towards the audience, it's very clear that The Hypnotist loves to put on a show just in his voice and presentation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just to give you an Idea....\" leaning in towards the audience with a mischievous grin the hypnotist whispers as if he was telling the audience a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an endless supply of props, multiple induction methods, some special SURPRISE guest, and a bottomless wardrobe filled with some fun and some very revealing outfits. Trust me when I say we are going to have a lot of fun with Team RWBY here believe me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team hears all of this of course and they all look towards each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's j-just joking right haha...\" Ruby offers a very nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He better be. I won't be made a fool of so easily.\" Weiss crosses her arms in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this gut talking about?\"  Blake raises an eyebrow curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax guys, like he can actually make us do that.' Yang simply smiles and rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist hears the doubts and concerns and his already large grin grows a little larger and he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have no idea the secrets I have under my sleeves, the powers and tools at my disposal, and the plans I have in store for each individual girl. I am a showman and I always put on the best show. It could be hilarious, sexy, humiliating or all of the above. I always leave my audience want ing more. Whether these girls believe it or not, or whether they like it or not, by the end of the night everyone on this stage will be at my mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns back to the girls with his large grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then that leaves one more question that needs to be answered! <b>How and who will I be hypnotizing first!\"</b> He yells out almost startling the group. He points at them dramatically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime almost freezes as the girls worry and look back and forth between each other and the hypnotist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for either one of them to speak up or him to pick one randomly, but the hypnotist is not a patient man as Someone will be hypnotized here and now and that person will be....</span></div></div>",

Something seems fishy about all of this.\" Weiss asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... It's like Yang said earlier might as well make the most of our time here right? Besides what's the worse that can happen really?\" She shrugs as she turns back to the Hypnotist who comes up to the young huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you for volunteering my dear. Ruby was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ruby Rose sir ready to do... whatever you need me to do for your show.\" While unsure what this all will entail Ruby does her best to keep a positive outlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby I am happy to tell you that you won't regret your decision. Perhaps your example will encourage your peers to not be so hesitant. If you can stand up and follow me please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby offers her team one final smile before rising from her chair and following the man to the center front of the stage facing towards the audience. She somewhat nervously fidgets as now all eyes are on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be nervous, We are all friends here, well maybe not all. Why don't you tell us a bit more about yourself Ruby?\" Patting her on the back the hypnotist encourages Ruby to speak to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I umm.. My name is Ruby Rose as some of you may or uhh may not know... I'm a student at Beacon you know this academy and I well just really want to become a really great huntress. I-is that good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was more than perfect Ruby. We are going to have a really fun time here to night all you have to do is put on a big smile and follow my lead got it?\" The hypnotist encourages Ruby which she appreciates and nods back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I can do that no problem. Sorry if I seem nervous I just a bit unsure what to expect with this show and all. Truth be told I don't know anything about hypnosis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you don't well it's actually rather simple really. here allow me to explain it to you really quick.\" The Hypnotist suddenly swings in front of Ruby, facing her and putting his back to the audience as he stands between the 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypnosis is an act of inducing a state of pure relaxation that makes the recipient extremely open to suggestions.\" While the hypnotist explains this to Ruby he points his finger toward her face, circling it slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think I.. um what are you doing?\" She looks towards the finger confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... just remember what I said earlier, put on a big smile and follow my instructions.\" He offers her  grin as he just keeps circling his finger in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby offers back a small and anxious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah okay but I mean what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Ruby can question any further a subtle but strong Aura started emitting from his body. So subtle that only people close enough could notice, and Ruby definitely noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that energy appeared Ruby's eyes became magnetically locked onto the tip of his finger, her body freezes up and the only thing that was moving was her eyes as they perfectly match the circling motion of the Hypnotist's finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put on a big smile and follow my instructions....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...What are you doing to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat no one was aware of was the Hypnotist's secret. That he doesn't just hypnotize people normally but had a semblance with the ability to put people into a obedient trance. He has been abusing it to put people under hypnosis for his show easily and Ruby was getting the brunt of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... just relax Ruby, I'm just doing what I was brought here to do. You're being hypnotized but I wouldn't worry about it. You are doing great so far. Just remember what I told you to do put on a big smile-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And follow your instructions...\" Ruby whispers out, surprised at what she said as if it was an automatic response. The edges of her mouth raising into a small smile as her mind slowly blurs over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you are getting it. That's right just follow my circling finger. In your mind find a colorful spiraling forming in your mind. It's so inviting and makes you feel so good you can't help but just give in...\" The Hypnotist spoke in a quiet hushed tone directly into Ruby's left ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby found it harder and harder to think, much less resist. She nods along and just goes along with what she's being told. Imagining the colorful spiral in her mind, unaware that same colorful spiral starts to appear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it...It's so pretty...It's so nice to watch...It's so nice to just give in....\" Ruby parroted back, no longer able to speak for herself but just be lead along by the hypnotist. That smile on her face growing more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Ruby, in a moment I'm going to count from 1-3 and when I reach 3 you will fully succumb to trance.You'll be compelled to obey any and all instructions no matter what. You understand don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I understand...\" Ruby nods happily. Her smile was growing larger and more goofy looking, her eyes were wide open and unblinking with that hypnotic spiral her eye completely engulfing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect, then without further ado... 1-2-3!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*PING*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's mind and body simultaneously click into face. her face frozen in that goofy large wide eyed smile. looking straight ahead towards the hypnotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXCELLENT! Ladies and gentleman I apologies for the silence but I have just hypnotized my first volunteer of the night! Give it up to our lovely entranced Ruby Rose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist turns to the audience and reveals the entranced Ruby to the Audience. A few people already laughing at her stupid looking expression while everyone else applauds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stands awkwardly, her arms hanging limp to her sides, body slightly slouched forward, as she stands smiling towards audience she's currently oblivious to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Ruby why don't you tell the nice people in the audience about the state of mind you are in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hypnotist, I am completely and utterly hypnotized. I have no will of my own, the feeling I have is the overwhelming happiness I fave when I obey you.\" Ruby says so easily with a dreamy tone in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl and by the way for the rest of the show while you are in a trance you will only refer to me as master okay?\" He wraps an arm around her shoulder and gives a smirk towards the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master. whatever you say.\" She responds with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's such a team player, give her another round of applause, but you know talk is cheap, why don't we give everyone a demonstration Ruby? What shall we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

The Master, comment, she might just be playing along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely under,\u201d The Hypnotist assured them. \u201cDo you have any ideas what you would like to see her do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAct like a chicken!\u201d Yang shouted at once, earning some chuckles from the Hypnotist and the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the chicken act! Everyone suggests that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive her triggers?\u201d Blake suggested. \u201cYou can say something and she\u2019s react subconsciously, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how those work. I take it you\u2019ve been to a hypnosis show before?\u201d Blake nodded at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake her act like someone else?\u201d Weiss suggested with a shrug. \u201cI guess that would be funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll great ideas that will be used throughout the show!\u201d The hypnotist stood up and let the tranced Ruby just sit there so he could address the audience. \u201cDon\u2019t worry ladies and gentlemen. I didn\u2019t forget about you. I plan to have a few situations where I\u2019ll be asking for suggestions. Of course, the big ideas will be saved for the second half. That\u2019s the finale after all. A good show requires build up. Along with how hypnosis works. You can\u2019t get someone who just went under to do something crazy. Their conscious mind would fight against the subconscious. So we start off slow, let the deepness of the trance build up, and have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience clapped and cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Ruby.\u201d This time, the hypnotist addressed her directly. \u201cCan you still hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Hypnotist.\u201d Ruby replied in the same monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, now I want you to lean back in your chair and close your eyes.\u201d Ruby did as he suggested. \u201cI want you to imagine you\u2019re all alone on the beach. It\u2019s a beautiful hot summer\u2019s day. You\u2019re lying on a blanket, enjoying the sun over your body.\u201d Ruby stretched out a bit and smiled. \u201cYou enjoy your day at the beach, don\u2019t you Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice\u2026\u201d Ruby murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hot out though. You can feel the heat and your sweating. That\u2019s only natural as it\u2019s the middle of summer.\u201d Ruby began to look uncomfortable, pulling at her collar and sleeves to bare more skin. Her friends were snickering a little. Even though they knew that they would be next, it was still funny. Keeping them conscious was a way for them to relax by seeing their friend go under. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, next to you is a nice frosty glass of your favorite drink with a straw. Go ahead and take a sip to cool yourself off.\u201d Ruby reached to the empty space to her right and grabbed a \u2018glass\u2019 before bringing it up close to her mouth. Her lips tightened like she was sucking on a straw. \u201cWhat kind of drink is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilk!\u201d Ruby said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd burst out laughing, including her friends. Even the hypnotist couldn\u2019t resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you\u2019re cooled off, you should probably put sun screen on. You don\u2019t want to burn.\u201d Ruby set down the \u2018glass\u2019 and picked up a \u2018bottle\u2019 of sunscreen. She acted like she squirted some into her hand and began to rub it on her arms and legs. \u201cThere you go. Once you finish, you can go back to sunbathing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I want to go\u2026 swimming\u2026\u201d Ruby murmured, sounding like she was about to doze off. Everyone began to laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, maybe another time, Ruby. For now, when I count to three and say Wake, you will wake up, remembering everything you just did. However, whenever I say Sleep, you will immediately fall back into this state of relaxation. Nod if you understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the first trigger I\u2019ll be using on everyone.\u201d The Hypnotist was address the rest of Team RWBY along with the audience. \u201cThis saves time in the long run, as I don\u2019t have to keep putting them under every time I switch to someone else. This way, they can be awake and see the show too.\u201d He turned back to Ruby. \u201c1-2-3- Wake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby sat up and looked around. Her face grew red as everyone stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you like your trip?\u201d The Hypnotist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 actually saw myself on the beach and\u2026 it was nice.\u201d Ruby admitted shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d he smiled at her. \u201cAll you had to do was relax and enjoy yourself. Now, let\u2019s give you a chance to watch one of your friends go under.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it be best if I sat down and watched from the the audience.\" She got up from her seat. shaking her head while she started walking off to the stairs the side of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Weiss don't go, It's not as bad as you think! I actually had a lot of fun.\" Ruby finally spoke up, feeling bad if Weiss was leaving because of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah the show only just started. Don't bail so quickly especially after Ruby just went.\" Yang called out soon after, though it didn't't seem to phase Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point some disappointed \"Awwws\" can be heard scattered amongst the audience. Weiss was blushing red herself hearing this and speaks back to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry guys but I don't want to come on stage just to be made a fool of-\" A hand suddenly comes down on her shoulder gently stopping her in her tracks. Weiss looks towards the source and discovers it's none other than the hypnotist. He gives her a comforting smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I get it you're scared your going to be made fun of. That you are going to do something you don't want to and people are going to laugh right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss quickly shakes of his hand and turns to this hypnotist with her hands on her hips leans towards to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I know it's your job to put on a show for the school but I can't be subjecated to this kind of ridicule. As a Schnee I have a reputation to uphold and I can't be seen... doing this.\" Weiss looks out towards the crowd as she can feel the watchful eye of her sister gazing from somewhere in the large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Weiss I've been doing this long enough to understand where you are coming from but you don't need to worry so much. No one here is going to think any less of you. Everyone here is here to have a good time and see their friends fool around on stage. All you should do is relax and enjoy the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe activates his semblance once more and Weiss locks eyes with his swirling finger in a similar way Ruby fell under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait no I-I can't I should go...\" Weiss was more resistant as she pulled her head away and was struggling to avoid looking back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on just try it out, you have your friends backing you and have a very nice audience of peers. Just for tonight why don't you have a little fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss takes a moment of pause and contemplates the proposal. She spots her friends staring looking towards her, their expression on their face shows that they are a bit bummed Weiss is leaving so soon, especially Ruby. With a heavy sigh she looks back towards the hypnotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright I guess I'll try it out\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thanks Weiss!\" Ruby Cheered in the back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think you had it in you.\" said Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Weiss, I'm sure no one is recording this.\" Yang Teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look just don't have me do anything embara-uhhhhhh..\" As her eyes lock back onto his spinning finger Weiss is bombarded with the hypnotic energy of his semblance. Her go wide with an expression of wonder and confusion as she stares deeply at the spinning finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Weiss, just focus on relaxing, it feels so nice to just let go and not worry about anything. Allow me to make you feel so good and so relaxed that you don't need to worry about anything this night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax...it feels so good to let go.\" The corners of Weiss' mouth begin to lift. Her wide eyes filled with a spiraling pattern as her voice sounded content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right and it feels better with each spin of my finger. It's so silly that you'd need to be worried that you can't help but laugh thinking about how you reacted earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So silly haha hahaha hahahahaha...\" Weiss starts laughing to herself. The fears she once head growing even sillier with each passing moment. The laughter just increasing her relaxation and comfort, further cementing her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good now I'm goin to count from 1-3 and when I hit 3 you will become completely hypnotized. Ready to follow any and all commands no matter how humiliating. ready and 1-2-3\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had the biggest smile she probably ever had on her face. She couldn't help but nod in agreement to the Hypnotist's instructions. Soon enough everything clicked in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*PING*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looks vacantly in front of her, almost identical to the state Ruby was in mere moments ago only difference being a little giggle that would escape from Ice queen's mouth occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so that's what it looks like.\" Ruby realizes as it's the first time she's really seen the face of someone in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah but your smile was cuter sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist then turns to the audience once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentleman give it up for Weiss Schnee who has chosen to have some fun on stage for you all tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Audience starts to clap in response and some chants can be heard from the audience calling out her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And Weiss for now and the rest of the show if you hear applause for you it'll make you feel just o amazing and good. The more you hear the better you feel. You'll bow and thank them for their kindness as you are the star here tonight. So audience I ask you again but this time give it more feeling GIVE IT UP FOR WEISS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience applauses twice as hard and a loud clear chant can be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEISS WEISS WEISS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven team RWBY clapped for their newly enchanted companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Weiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the suggestion implanted Weiss' body begins to bow, wave, and curtsy toward the audience as long as she heard the cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Thank you all you are too kind.\" She responded in a sleepy voice. Feeling so proud and happy to the audience cheering for her. The fact she's been hypnotized no longer matters. Soon enough the crowds applause settles down and Weiss returns to her neutral hypnotized smiling state. Waiting for whatever the show has next for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit Weiss, see you had nothing to fear. Now then let's keep the show rolling and...\" </span></div></div>",

He then turned to Ruby. \u201cDo you recall what the others suggested you do when under?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Ruby replied honesty. \u201cI recall just hearing your voice. Maybe a little laughter, but it was dull and fuzzy. Not really important at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the hypnosis. You focus on one thing and ignore the rest. It\u2019s still all in your mind so you can still hear everything. Like Weiss is hearing us right now, but it\u2019s not important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s really good at tuning people out.\u201d Yang laughed, causing several people in the crowd to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Weiss here wanted me to change you personality, Blake suggested some fun triggers, and your sister Yang here\u2026 well, she wanted you to be a chicken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang!\u201d Ruby cried out to more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! It would be funny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang is right, it would be, but this is a show, we have to start off slow, let you all work into it. See it\u2019s not bad.\u201d Ruby smiled at the Hypnotist\u2019s words. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding when I saw it\u2019s all in good fun. You might get embarrassed a little, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to be that bad.\u201d He smiled at Ruby. \u201cAny thing you would like to see your friends act like during the show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember seeing a show where you could make someone believe something existed when it didn\u2019t,\u201d Ruby recalled. \u201cLike seeing a puppy when nothing was there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, hallucinations\u2026 yeah. I could do that.\u201d The Hypnotist turned to Weiss and spiraled his finger. Ruby was sitting at the edge of her seat. \u201cWeiss, I\u2019m going to ask you a few questions and answering truthfully will make you feel calm and relax, just incredibly peaceful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Weiss replied dozily, the smile still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like Arc hasn\u2019t been trying!\u201d A girl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora!\u201d Came an emabrassed male voice. That gave the man a great idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is Arc?\u201d He asked, and several people pointed to a tall blonde boy near a red head. \u201cAh\u2026 I might have use you for you in the future.\u201d He gulped. \u201cRelax, it will be later and funny for everyone. You won\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d The boy looked a lot more relaxed now and the Hypnotist turned back to Weiss. \u201cJust to be sure, since I don\u2019t like to assume, you do like boys, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Weiss confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t have a shot!\u201d Anothr boy from the audience shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it, Cardin!\u201d The girl Nora yelled back. They were really a rowdy bunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss, whenever I saw the phrase, \u2018Handsome Man\u2019 until I say the phase \u2018See Things Clearly\u2019 you will believe the person to your right is the most attractive man in the world. They are everything you wanted in a man and you want them to be your boyfriend more than anything in the world. Talk to them, flirt, anything\u2026 no stripping or assaulting though, you\u2019re better than that. Not matter what they say, you\u2019ll translate it to the words you want to hear though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026the most handsome man.\u201d Weiss sounded a little excited and people noticed. They laughed and cheered, causing her to feel even better due to the earlier suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa this will be\u2026 wait!\u201d Ruby realized. \u201cI\u2019m to her right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just realized?\u201d Blake whispered and Yang was clutching her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will wake on the count of three,\u201d The hypnotist said.  \u201c1\u20262\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Ruby cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u20263, Wake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss sad up and rubbed her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She asked looking at her friends. Yang was trying not to laugh and Blake was remaining expressionless, though her eyes were fixated on her. Ruby\u2026 she was scooting away a little. \u201cI thought you were to remember what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything yet,\u201d The Hypnotist laughed. \u201cBut I did put you under. Do you believe that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember feeling relaxed, but I don\u2019t think so?\u201d Weiss was observing him closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know someone who can make you a believer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most \u2018Handsome Man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss blinked and turned to her right. Ruby froze and went wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey~.\u201d The tone in Weiss\u2019 voice changed immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t recall seeing such a fine man around here. What\u2019s your name, handsome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Ruby.\u201d The poor girl stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReuben, I like that,\u201d Weiss purred, as the audience laughed. \u201cHow about after the show, you and I get to know each other.\u201d She ran a finger down Ruby\u2019s arm. The poor socially awkward girl had no idea how to handle this. Yang was beside herself dying and Blake was laughing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but-\u2026\u201d Ruby tried to come up with something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA man of few words, I like that.\u201d Weiss leaned closer and Ruby was flushing crimson. \u201cAre you free this weekend? I know ALL the nice places in Vale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee Things Clearly!\u201d The Hypnotist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019 expression changed and she immediately knew what happened to her. She plopped down in her seat, just as red as Ruby was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHitting on my sister, Weiss?\u201d Yang pretended to be upset. \u201cLooks like we have to have the talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Shut up!\u201d Weiss hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s give Weiss a round of applause!\u201d The Hypnotist said and the crowd began to clap and cheer. Weiss immediately felt better. The Hypnotist also left the trigger in, just for some fun between acts. \u201cNow, who next?\u201d</span></div></div>",

We want to see you go under the most!\" Sun calls out from the audience prompting a few cheers of encouragement for Blake. She simply smirks in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I mean I'm going to be put under anyways so I don't really mind going before or after Blake personally.\" Yang leans back in her chair relaxed and clearly doesn't mind the idea of being hypnotized after the fun she's seen so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I'm a bit hesitant myself on all of this. I'm not going to back out like Weiss but still I'm a bit uneasy about being put under.\" Blake seems a bit more tense about the situation. She rubs her arms and averts her eyes from the hypnotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotist takes a moment to think but not too long as he didn't wish to waste the crowds time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a perfect idea, Now everyone has seen me hypnotize individual girls but for a bit of a challenge and to speed things along why don't I try and hypnotize you both at the same time? Come on Audience you wanna see that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotist raises his arms and turns back to the Audience which applaud in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess going under with Yang will help make me feel a bit more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and like I said before I don't mind going whenever. My only regret would be not being able to see what Blake does under hypnosis.\" Yang jokes.

Isn't that right Audience?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Audience starts to clap and immediately Weiss smiled and her fears seem to fade in the applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, Blake and Yang, it sounds like I will be trying to put you both under at the same time. Are you both okay with that?\" The Hypnotist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think I'm good and doesn't seem like you have any problems do you Yang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm good. It's like a band aid, it's better to get this done quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Yang, I'm not simply putting you both under. To make our final induction for our current group a bit more interesting for our audience I propose a challenge for both of you. I propose that you both try your hardest to resist my induction for as long as possible. Whoever falls under first loses. As punishment the loser will be at the mercy of the other for the start of their hypnotic experience. Make sense? you two up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypnotist looks back and forth between the two. The pair of huntress' look at each other. Both thinking about it for a moment. Yang is the first to respond as she slams her hands together with fire in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm all up for a contest. I hope you're ready for what I have in store for you Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft fine, only because I'm interested in trying out commanding a hypnotized person myself. Don't feel bad when you lose Yang, remember you can always see what I made you did in the footage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's what I like to hear! Scoot your chairs right next to each other so I have clear access to hypnotize both of you equally.Now then Ladies and Gentleman in the audience are you ready to witness your first trance off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Audience cheers out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Audience screams out louder than before and start clapping which gets Weiss all excited especially as she scoots her chair closer to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then both girls look at me and get ready... set... GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist leans down towards the two girls, spinning an index finger in front of each of their respective faces. their eyes lock on but both are determined not to fall under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang has her eyes wide open to try and force herself to stay awake while Blake simply remained calm and tried to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on sis you can do it!\" Ruby shouted in support of Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can do it Blake. Don't let the audience down!\" Weiss added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the Audience was in fact chanting and cheering for both of the girls. Some for Yang and one for Blake. The energy in the room was growing as the audience wanted to see their respective favorite win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the two were experiencing something very different as they were being hypnotized by the Hypnotist. As he started to use his Semblance power of hypnotism the two could barely hear the any cheers as their attention and minds were being drawn in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait somethings wrong...I d-don't think this is normal hypnosis Y-\" Blake stopped unable to complete her sentence as her mind grew so clouded that she couldn't form thoughts anymore. Her eyes flutter and her mouth hangs ajar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Blake. You realized you are going to-\" The same exact sensation fills Yang's mind. Her eyes go even wider than before and  she leans closer towards the spinning finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... It's okay both are you are doing great, in fact both of you are winning.\" He grins as he continues to increase his semblance's power on the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-winning?\" Blake asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am.. doing great.\" Yang repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth slowly losing the ability to think for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right you both are winners here today. Just smile, relax, and follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm a winner...\" Yang smiles as she starts to slump as her body grows limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax... Smile...\" Blake nods and also smiles along with Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other grow large smiles across their faces as their wide open eyes that are locked onto to the Hypnotist finger form a hypnotic spiral within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow you...\" They both say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, I'm going to count from 1-3 and once I do, it doesn't matter who wins or loses, because for the rest of the show you will both obey me to the best of your abilities as I am now you master. Do you both understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master~\" They both reply in a monotone voice as they just lean forward, vacantly stare towards him with goofy smiles across their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good then, 1-2-3\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*PING PING*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pokes the center of their foreheads and the two girls lean back onto their chairs before Blake slums to the side and rests limply on the equally limp shoulder of Yang. The two have their eyes wide open and continue to smile in a perfect wide eyed trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a moment of pause as the audience and the others on the stage are left wondering who succumbed first and lost the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who lost?\" Weiss asked looking up towards the hypnotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

We wouldn\u2019t want to deprive this kind audience of your presence on stage?\u201d He points back to the audience,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Weiss come on girl don\u2019t be such a buzzkill!\u201d Nora Valkyrie called out before Ren pulled her back. Though it wasn\u2019t a sentiment that she shared alone. Other members of the audience starting speaking words of encouragement for Weiss to stay for the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, your fans just want you to have a good time, why don\u2019t you stay and try it out a bit?\u201d The hypnotist pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss ponders for a moment. Still averting her eyes from the audience and teammates. She takes a deep breath,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t go through with this, could I please be escorted off stage so I can at least watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss, come on we are a team you can\u2019t back down.\u201d Ruby begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m not going to lie even I think you are being unreasonable.\u201d Blake adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, it\u2019s quite alright. If Miss Schnee doesn\u2019t want to participate we can\u2019t force her. All we can do is show her what she\u2019ll be missing out. Here miss Schnee, take my hand and I\u2019ll sort things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist offers his hand to presumably to lead her from her chair and take her off stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you for being so understanding, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll enjoy this show much more from the audie-\u201c as Weiss grabs onto his hand instead of pulling her up off her chair the Hypnotist surprises everyone by pull her towards him and gripping her hand tightly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leans towards him he whispers in her ear. \u201cFollow my finger with your eyes, focus on it, and when you do notice yourself growing more and more relaxed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his other hand he points right towards Weiss\u2019 face and spins his finger in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait what are you-\u201c Weiss was surprised and confused by this sudden strange move by the hypnotist. He acted so quick that she was caught off guard and as the finger spinning rhythmically in front of her encompassed her entire vision she could not help but follow along with her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh just follow along, relax and empty your mind, ignore everything else as you focus on me and my finger.\u201d The Hypnotist displayed such authority and command in such a short amount of time. Weiss was utterly speechless  in the moment, her mind unable to keep up with the reality of the situation and oblivious to the others around her as they all murmur in confusion at what might be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t... I\u201d Weiss tried to protest but her mind was fogging up, her eyes caught in the mesmerizing spinning of the hypnotist\u2019s finger and as she spoke the Hypnotist would soon interject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax and Focus on me and my words, don\u2019t think just follow.  I\u2019m going to pull you into a deep state of sleep, just take a deep breath for me now.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWeiss reflexively just inhaled from her nose, so much everyone can see. Before she can question why the Hypnotist gets right next to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood and as you exhale.... <b>DEEP SLEEP!\u201d</b> the Hypnotist exclaims was he yanks Weiss\u2019 arm towards him. The shock and abruptness of the pull causes Weiss\u2019s body to slump forward and after a moment of silence the audience and the other members of RWBY watch as the young woman just sits their, slumped forward, eyes closed, mouth slightly opened, arms limply hanging upon her sides and the subtle sound of light snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist stands above her lightly holding her shoulder and rocking her ever so slightly. He smiles towards the others on the stage before turning back towards the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was called a speed induction, it\u2019s a little more advanced trick but something I wanted to pull out for our very special guest today. Ladies and gentlemen please give it up for Weiss Schnee our first hypnotized volunteer this evening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience soon applauded seeing such a trick pulled so quickly while Weiss\u2019s teammates look on in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Blake asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss are you okay?\u201d Ruby looks concerned towards her teammate though the Hypnotist soon steps in forward to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Ruby, Weiss is perfectly fine, aren\u2019t you Weiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\u201d Weiss replies faintly under her breath as she continues to slouch and snore as if she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the deception, but I thought it\u2019d be sorta lame if she simply left before trying out hypnosis. So Weiss for the rest of the show you will obey every command I give to you. I control your mind, body, feelings memories etc. Now when I snap my fingers and give you a command you will follow without question. If you understand reply yes master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes master...\u201d she mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood now then sit up and smile for the audience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snap</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicks his fingers and immediately Weiss sits up, eyes closed and smiles vacantly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you can do better than that, bigger smile and say you can\u2019t wait to have fun with hypnosis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snap</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss smiles becomes larger, almost comically wide. Her upper body is stiff and ridged as she sits up, while her legs and arms limply swing like noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have fun with hypnosis.\u201d She says with a tired voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect, now then let\u2019s make sure Weiss does have some fun and realize she had nothing to worry about. Let\u2019s see how to best accomplish that?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Eyeing up the cute blonde who appeared to be giving him an arrogant smirk in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang was it? Correct me if I'm wrong but did you say that I wouldn't be able to actually hypnotize any of you girls?\" He walks up to her and crosses his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang laughs it off and shrugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wasn't going to say anything but if you are going to put me on the spot like that then yeah, I don't think you can hypnotize anyone, especially me or my team.\" She looks back up at the hypnotist with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome \"Oooohhhs\" can be heard scattered in the audience. Yang herself leans back in her chair confident that she won't be hypnotized here tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge? If so I will be more than happy to prove you wrong in front of everyone here tonight. I will be hypnotizing you whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can certainly try buddy. I wouldn't be up here if I didn't at least want to give you a shot. Besides I like a little challenge myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh do you? Well then if you are giving me 1 shot then I might as well pull out my big guns... literally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Hypnotist pulls out from his coat pocket what appears to be some sort of toy sci fi laser gun covered in various blinking lights, nobs, and switches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA I'm sorry but what is that? Is that supposed to be a gun? It looks more like a toy.\" Yang couldn't help but burst out laughing at the mere sight of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes this is a gun, a very special gun. This little beauty is my original creation, my <b>Hypnosis Gun</b>. I've been working on it for some Time and wasn't intending to use it during this show but for you my darling Yang I'm going to make an exception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off I'm not your darling and second if you think you could hypnotize me with that electric pea shooter of yours then you are crazier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't think it I know it. This bad boy is the culmination of years of research and hypnotic knowledge. It has a ton of different features and settings that are able to mesmerize and entrance its targets and onlookers alike, but in this instance I think we are just going to start off with the normal setting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe points the 'gun' right towards Yang who simply scoffs unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you are going to do with that? Going to blind me with your little laser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll find out, any last words before you go under?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I got one, this is ridiculous Im l-\" Yang was in the middle of getting up when the Hypnotist fired the gun at Yang. Hypnotic waves emit from the muzzle and bombard Yang's body and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Yang's body stiffens as she sits up on her seat perfectly straight. Her eyes glazing over as she stares up at the gun, becoming glassy and vacant. her jaw falls open slighlty and hangs there leaving Yang with a permanent expression of surprise and confusion on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Yang I didn't catch that. What are you trying to say?\" He jokingly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuuuuhhhh...\" She drones on in response. The hypnotic power of the Hypnosis Gun too great to resist, leaving Yang an empty headed doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it seems you are struggling with your words Yang, you are suffering stage fright? I believe you were going to tell me that you believe hypnosis is very real and that you can't wait to be hypnotized right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hypnosis is real. It's so real. The most real thing ever. I can't wait to hypnotize me tonight. I've wanted to do this so long. This will be amazing.\" Yang responds with a monotone droll. Eyes partially open as she stares longingly towards the <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this everyone is the power of hypnosis. Give our mindless friend Yang a round of applause!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience clap at the display of power shown. Yang was clearly under his power was an amusing sight to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the audience response, The Hypnotist takes his finger off the trigger and pulls back his gun from Yang. With the hypnotic waves gone her mind soon returns to her. She shakes her head and looks around confused as all eyes were suddenly on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Why is everyone staring at me?\" She asks, genuinely unaware of being hypnotized mere seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it my dear. After all the shows only begun and we can have a lot more to do. Now then let's get this show really going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hypnotic blaster in hand, he looks back towards Yang and smiles. As he prepares his next big move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am now going to incorporate what is known as a <i>Trigger</i>. These are a sort of call and response type of hypnotic programming. To make this simple, I say a word or phrase and that will evoke a response in miss Yang here. For example I could tell her that the word Banana would make her run into the crowd and kiss a random person. And her body would be compelled to follow that instruction, even while she was awake! However my plan is to make her triggers a little more... Open to interpretation\" he said with a mischievous grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist approached Yang who stared blankly ahead, with the other three members of her team watching closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Yang. I'm going to give you some triggers. And when you hear myself, or a member of your team say one of them you will respond accordingly. If you understand, tell me that you love being hypnotized\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love being hypnotized\" Yang droned in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! To begin, the words <i>Go wild</i> followed by the name of an animal will cause you to act as that animal\" he began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next the words <i>A new perspective</i> followed by the name of a type of person, such as teacher, cheerleader, soldier, and so on, will cause you to act like a stereotypical version of that type of person\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally the words <i>You should really</i> followed by a simple action such as jump, dance, bow, and so on will cause you to take that action. If you understand all of this, say the phrase I'm a good little hypnotized girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a good little hypnotized girl\" she droned again, this time getting a little snicker out of Ruby<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" He began \"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

Their are some giggles coming from the audience and from Ruby but Yang doesn't make the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Yang are you feeling well? Ready to get this show started?\" The Hypnotist asked. Yang doesn't immediately respond though as she's still a little disoriented but soon she turns back towards the hypnotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Oh sorry, yeah I'm ready to go when you are. Unless you are planning to play with more toys for the rest of the show.\" She jokingly points to the *Fake* Hypnosis gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make no promises but if you are ready then can you actually stand up next to me for a little demonstration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm sure why not.\" Yang stands up from her chair and walks to the hypnotist's side right in front of the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Yang, I appreciate you coming up to help. You see you are going to help me show off hypnotic triggers for our lovely audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so what is a hypnotic trigger and how exactly do I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tell me this Yang, what are some of the more common hypnotic suggestions you'd see in movies and TV?\" The Hypnotist inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, umm I dunno, I guess like dancing around, acting like a mindless zombie, making someone act like a chicken.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, the old chicken routine, a common one but a classic nonetheless. So would you act like a chicken on stage Yang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...No. Even if you do end up hypnotizing me, I know I'm too strong willed to be made to act like that, especially in front of a crowd.\" She places her hands on her hips as she boasts confident in her own mental fortitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I see. Well you might be right about that. Perhaps I can't make you act like a chicken... but then again what if I said <i>Go wild Chicken</i>?\" The Hypnotist asked with his mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's mouth opened up as if she was going to respond but she was cut off as both her mind and eyes glaze over, her expression growing neutral and her gaze unfocused. In an instant Yang bends forward which caused whoever was directly in front of her to have a good look at her clevage, she places her fists next to her armpits, she starts flapping her arms as if they were wing, her head erratically bobbed around, and she starts to strut across the stage aimlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ba-Bawk BAWK!\" Yang clucked. Her mind fully believing she is nothing more than a mindless bird and her body reflecting as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotist crossed his arms as smiled as he watch Yang bending down to peck at the floor with her lips. He raises his hand and points to a figure back stage to signal him to start the music and over the speakers the room was filled with the sounds of the chicken dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ba BAWK BAWK!\" Yang flaps her *wings* faster and scratches at the floor with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Audience was in full laughter as they watch their class mate run around on stage like a flightless bird. Team RWBY couldn't help as well. Seeing to vacant goofy expression so closely as she passes by them was enough to make even Blake chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha Sis you should see yourself Hahahaha. This guy really did a number on you.\" Ruby tells Yang but is only met by more vacant stares and erratic head bobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist goes next to Ruby and smiles as he whispers to Ruby. \"Cup your hands together and extend them out in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't understand but she nodded and complied with his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect~ Hey chicken come here girl! We got some chicken feed for you right here.\" He calls out and points to Ruby's cupped hands. Yang who was pecking at the floor hears this, lifts her head, and rushes towards Ruby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bawk Ba-Bakaw!\" She starts pecking into Ruby's hands. Eating up the imaginary bird seed she believe's her sister holds. Pressing her lips onto her team leaders palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA that tickles Yang,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang continued to mindlessly eating and clucking without a care in the world. even while she bended over towards Ruby and waved her butt toward the audience which caused only more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist waits for a moment and allows the ridiculousness of the situation takes its course. He circles back to the position he was in before Yang was a chicken and after a few more moments he calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up for Chicken Yang everyone. Best bird on the barnyard, but I think we've had enough of our angry bird and bring back our favorite Blonde Huntress. Watch as with the power of triggers I'll bring back Yang in an instant. Now Yang <i>you should really wake up and act normal right now!</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby watch's as Yang blinks and immediately focus comes back into Yang's eyes. She looks around to find herself awkwardly bent forward and kissing her sister's palm. The sudden shock of the moment causing her to stumble a bit as she rights herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah..\" Ruby looked wide eyed in oth amusement and amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang I know that's your sister but that's inappropriate. What are you doing and get back over here. I have a show to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the hypnotist she rushes back towards his side with a hint of blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry I ummm don't know...what just happened?\" Yang places her hand on her forehead and looks around clearly very confused which isn't helped by the chuckles from her audience and team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You should really not worry about it and focus on the show Yang</i>.\" The Hypnotist suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you are right, So we were talking about your trigger thingies right?\" Yang's body language quickly shifts from confusion to the more relaxed demeanor she had before the chicken incident. The trigger taking effect and causing her not to worry on such matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes triggers, I want to perform a little demonstration with you Yang.\" He explains with an all to familiar mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what did you have in mind?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

Some fun, like making her more animals or personalities, some sexy like making her dance, and some outright crude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever everyone went hush as Yang stepped back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty, blonde huntress-in-training was now wearing a rather gaudy looking, golden, jeweled bikini top with a matching golden bikini bottom. From the bottoms stretched a length of gold fabric, essentially making a dress around her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems my assistant has returned!\" He boomed.

The RWBY girls were all down in the front row, looking up with mixes of excitement, nervousness, and apathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Yang, as usual, were pretty excited about the prospect about a hypnosis show. Weiss, however, was worried about her sister being made a fool of. And Blake, as is usual for herself, did not seem particularly interested or disinterested in the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome everyone! My first volunteer for the day is truly special! I bumped into this young lady before the show began and spoke with her about what was going on, and she offered to by my first volunteer. Please, introduce yourself!\" he boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Winter Schnee. Daughter of the Schnee family, Huntress, and operative for Atlas.\" she said, making a very stiff and proper bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Miss Schnee here has offered to be the first participant in my hypnosis show! The first to be hypnotized! Might you be willing to tell the audience why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been hypnotized. However mind altering tactics may be used by enemies or spies. I'd prefer to have some experience with it, and I intend to fight it off, just so you know\" she stated with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist simply smiled, then turned to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well! Someone is certainly confident! We shall see how this goes then! Are you ready to begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter nodded firmly, and as she did, he pulled out a glimmering, gold pocket watch. He dangled it in front of her as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Miss Schnee. Follow this watch with your eyes for me. Continue to do so as I speak to you. Watch it swing back and forth. Back and forth. Watch as it sways in and out, back and forth, and see the sun shimmer and shine off of it.\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience were mostly engulfed in watching Winter. Looking at her face. They wanted to see how her face and body would change as the hypnosis took hold, if it did at all. The RWBY girls, however, were right behind the watch, and all four of them found their eyes drawn to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice, as everything around the watch begins to blur. Slowly moving out of your vision\" he said. Winter could feel her eyes going out of focus. The crowd becoming little more than a rainbow of color around the watch. And the RWBY girls noticed the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, notice as all sound leaves except the sound of my voice.\" he said. And as he did, Winter felt it happen. Like dipping her head underwater. All voices, bird chirps, motors, wind, it all became muffled background sound. As did it for the girls of team RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, repeat after me. Quietly begin saying 'The watch will sway and I obey'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The watch will sway and I obey...\" she muttered, the hypnotist putting a microphone to her lips as she said it so everyone could hear... and so the RWBY girls couldn't be heard as they, too, repeated this phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, when I snap, you will fall into a deep trance, ready to obey.\" he said, snapping. As he did, her eyes glazed over, her mouth opening a little and her body going slack. And the RWBY girls followed in her trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the crowd in triumph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there we go, ladies and gentlemen! Miss Schnee under my control!\" he boomed. The crowd clapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back towards Winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, time to command her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did he know... he'd soon be commanding four others from the audience... So what does he tell Winter to do?</span></div></div>",
