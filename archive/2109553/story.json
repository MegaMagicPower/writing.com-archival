This photo features a family of five Pokemon which are a Gallade father, a Gardevoir mother, an older teen Gardevoir girl, a preteen Kirlia girl, and a Ralts boy. When looking closely, you noticed that they all look much more human-like than you think; they even wore clothes just like actual people! Are you in a world were giant Pokemon anthros rule? Or maybe you're still dreaming. You shook your head several times to wake yourself up from this so-called \"dream\" but after several times (few of which are slightly painful), you were still right here; inside the giant home of a family of giant psychic-type Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so you are not in your world anymore and you are already unprepared for this situation. Should you contact any of these giant? You don't know if either one of them is friendly or not so perhaps you should avoid their sight at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, you noticed that everything is quiet around here. Are they home or are they asleep right now? You hide behind the giant family photo and stand there; waiting for any noise to see if you are all alone.</span></div></div>",

There was a refrigerator, a microwave, a stove, cupboards, a dinning table, and many more. Being in such a normal room, you feel like a small scavanging insect around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you found something to eat around here: a plate of berries. Unfortunately, it is high up above the shelf so it would take a long time to climb up there. (plus you don't know if it was climbable.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the kitchen, you see a glass door that leads outside as you can see the backyard.

She just dropped my newly-brought clothes to the ground. I swear, that was definitely no accident.\" said Riley and showed her friend the clothes she got during their trip at the mall. \"Now I have to clean and wash them all thanks to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy is a classmate of the two who was also the archrival of Riley back at college. She was very popular and highly attractive Tsareena, but she was also very snobbish and doesn't seem to show any respect for anyone of lower status including Riley herself. Megan wonders if they could ever get along with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan parked the car, Riley got out of it and said \"You just wait and see Megan, she will soon regret ever making me look like a fool.\" Megan shook her head in exasperation as she got out as well with her own shopping bags in her hands; perhaps that will take a long while for that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the door flings open and saw the two giants walking inside. These giants were exactly the same ones you saw in the photo; one is an anthropomorphic Lilligant and another is an anthropomorphic Roserade. You mouth was wide open due to the fact that they were both look very humanoid and very gigantic to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lilligant girl wears a bright yellow dress tied up by a brown belt with a golden buckle and a pair of black sandals. Unlike normal Lilligants, she does not have a bud-like \"dress\" so you could see her white legs and yellow feet. She also has white arms with large leaves growing from on each elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade girl wears a red tank top, a blue miniskirt, and a pair of black boots. She was very different from actual Roserades as she doesn't have a cape behind her and two roses are now growing on top of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that they were both carrying shopping bags; they must of come home from doing shopping. The Lilligant girl heads upstairs while the Roserade girl goes to the door below the staircase which presumably leads to the basement as you noticed how dark the room looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you do now? Should you go after one of them or just decided to hide from both of them?</span></div></div>",

The weird looking Lilligant was going to be up there as well so you;d have to stay on your guard.<br>\r\nBeing very careful not to make too much noise, you climb down from the media center and scurry along the walls to your destination.<br>\r\nThe stairs look imposing at first, until you realize that there's a long woven mat covering them that should pretty easy for you to climb.<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach the top you hear a rustling noise coming from a lit room down the dark hallway, and creep closer to investigate.<br>\r\nYou find what must be the bedroom, except instead of any actual beds, the room is occupied by a wide wooden planter and a huge flowerpot, of which you can see the Lilligant slowly lowering herself into with a sigh.The rest of the room looks normally furnished with a TV hanging from the wall and a dual set of dresser drawers sitting up against the wall.<br>\r\nYou guess ir all made sense. A plant needs only warmth, sunlight, water and soil to survive and it seems to be no different for these plant type Pokemon.<br>\r\nThe Lilligant tiredly yawns, then uses her arms to partially bury her bottom half in soil.

A little bit harder to traverse, but not impossible. <br>\r\nYou crack your knuckles together and approach the ceramic vase and start looking for handholds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're exhausted, sore, and out of breath when you reach the top, but feel a rush of relief when the admittedly beautiful plant Pokemon finally comes into view. <br>\r\nYou crawl and drop over the inner edge of the flower pot and into the soft soil.<br>\r\nThe Lilligant's bottom half is completely submerged, leaving only the top of her belly and her chest exposed.<br>\r\nYou tiredly walk up close to the plant Pokemon and nestle yourself right in between her breasts and snuggle close to her for warmth.<br>\r\nThe combination of exhaustion and the warmth of the Pokemon forces your eyelids down, and  you enter into a deep, dreamless sleep.</span></div></div>",

First of all, you might be living in a world of giant Pokemon anthros like these so if you (a tiny human) ended up getting found by them, things could get rather thorny. They'll be shocked to see a creature they never seen before and you'll just get nothing but questions and disbelief in return. With that, it's probably for the best to stay like this....plus you can't help but have something else slowly coming into your head, but shook it off and stay careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far so good, the Pokegirls are currently in the other rooms doing something else; leaving you alone in the living room once again. You search the room to find a spot to seek shelter in this odd world. Looking down below the floor, you scan your eyes forward and across it until you spot a very small hole that was briefly behind the large television set. You wonder if that'll make a nice hiding spot for you because it was small enough to be unnoticeable to the giantesses but by the looks of it, it might be a little cramped up in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncomfortable or not, it's still alot better than just standing here.\" you said and made your way towards it. As you reach the edge of the table, you realized that you need to carefully climb down to the floor; making sure you don't fall and hurt yourself. You move to one of the table legs on your right and slowly attempt to climb down. You try your very best not to look down and end up taking a crap in your pants after looking at far below the ground looks and since there are no pants around here (at least one that is your size), you don't not want to spend your days in this world with a pair of pants full of doo-doo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet soon reach the solid ground and release your grip off the leg. You look at the small hole which will soon be your shelter in this house. The hole was behind a large DVD player with two stereo speakers next to it and behind them were a serious of wires. \"I could still it..\" you said \"If I could survive climbing down, I could survive this too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a dash to the giant television set and towards the hole.</span></div></div>",

She wears a small magenta tube top that exposes nearly the rest of her lower torso, an incredibly short brown jean shorts that is tied by a black belt with a grey buckle which reveals her long slender legs, and a pair of white high-heeled platform sandals.

You can't let this opportunity like this just pass you by.<br>\r\nWhile Cindy was distracted, you climbed down from your lofty perch, completely unnoticed by the fuming Riley or the increasingly worried Megan. Luckily, it was not so great a drop that you would be seriously injured, in fact the Lilligant was holding the purse in both hands low to the ground so all it took was a short hop and you were free to move around.<br>\r\nThe situation was looking tense, the petals on the Roserade's wrists vibrated rapidly as her fists shook in pure unadulterated rage. If looks could kill, the offending mangosteen would be nothing but a  smoldering pile of ash.<br>\r\nThrough clenched teeth she forced out, \"Leave... us... alone... or I'll...\"<br>\r\nCindy seemed completely unperturbed by this display, and the smug look she wore never once wavered.<br>\r\nShe tauntingly flipped her hair-like sepals over her shoulder and regarded the two with a nasty sneer.<br>\r\n\"Are you losers going to make a move or what?

Fighting her now will cause nothing but trouble for us later. Let's just leave while we still have some dignity left.\"<br>\r\nRiley turned her head towards her friend and harshly whispered, \"We can't keep letting her get away with this! If we back off now the only thing we'll be doing is showing that we're willing to allow her to continue walking all over us. We have to make a stand right here and now..\"<br>\r\n\"Ir's just not worth it,\" Megan hurriedly whispered back, \"If you two get caught in a physical altercation right here in front of Arceus and everyone you'll get yourself expelled and possibly even assault charges on your record. How are you going to explain to your parents that you got thrown out of school for fighting?.\"<br>\r\nRiley carefully considered her best friends words, turning them over in her mind.<br>\r\nOn the one hand Megan was totally correct, if she got caught assaulting another student she would likely have her scholarship revoked and face possible jail time for the deed. Walking away and allowing her this one victory would be the smart thing to do.<br>\r\nStill, it would so <i>worth it</i> to see the shocked look on Cindy's face as she popped her right in her pretty little jaw.<br>\r\n\"Um, hello? I believe I just asked you two a question?

Unfortunately for you, her shirt quickly drops down as she got up and you got swept by the giant fabric. However, you managed to grab onto the bottom of the shirt as fast as you possibly can. This situation doesn't look so frightening since she's currently sitting on the bed at first. A few seconds later however, she moves herself to the edge of the bed and stood up. Now looking below, you know that this could be your last if you were not careful enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see that this young girl has a tired look; meaning that if she looks down, she'll be too tired too see you. You thought and decided to climb up her shirt to reach her head in order to get her attention. \"It's dangerous, but I have no other choice.\" you said and began your trek upwards.</span></div></div>",

You could try to go and get the mother's attention instead. You definitely need a mature adult like her to help you in this strange world.

As the giant mother and daughter continued to talk, you push through the fibers and got out of the mat; it was time for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran past between the Eevee girl's towering legs and go straight for her Sylveon mother. It didn't take that very long to get there and thankfully you got to her feet. You look high up to see that she is obviously taller than her daughter so getting her attention is not that easy. Right now, you don't want to waste time climbing her just yet, so you decided to go on top of her foot and stay there for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing just that, you approach and climb up her left foot, using her pink fur as support. Once you got there, you found yourself surrounded by similar trees like before, but there're all pink instead. You quickly hold onto one of them in time as the giantess now begans to walk away from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as your ride walks across the hallway, down the stairs, and into the living room. You are very surprised to see that this world is very much like yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on the gigantic sofa, you saw another giantess resting on it. This one is much older than the Eevee girl and is about 16 to 17 years old. She appears to be a Jolteon anthro that wears a punkish looking outfit which consented a black sleeveless midriff-baring top with a skull on it, grey pants that's tied by black belt with a grey buckle, and a pair of black boots.

I have to run some errands this morning but I am promised I make it up to you though. Don't you worry Sweetie!\" She hugs her daughter again and give her a kiss on the forehead. \"I am going to go now but I hope you two have fun at school! Don't get in trouble you all.\" The mother says as she moves away from Jade and gets ready to go on her way to do errands and work. However, Jade was still annoyed no more than less and that she knew her mother always make it up to her somehow. Still she doesn't like to wait for her sister and that she yells at her. \"ELIZABETH, When are you coming down? WE are already late as we are, don't make me come up there and start to wrestle you!\" She yells at her as the Eevee respond back, \"I will be down 10 minutes! I am sorry Jade! I will be coming down soon!\" She says still in the bathroom. Jade waits patiently was she is on her phone looking very annoyed about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile for you, you were still holding onto the mother foot fur and that you can see she is approaching to her lovely daughter that looks really annoyed. You got a good view of Jade up closed now and that you have to say she looks pretty cute when she is annoyed. Maybe you would get her attention instead of the mother. Even consider how nice the mother is and cute but you like girls that are punkish and that maybe you could cheer her up along the way going to her school. You think it might be a best choice yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mother was just an arm reach from Jade, you made climb off from her paws, landed on the carpet again safely and made your way towards the Jolteon. It took fives minutes off your time and lucky they were talking while you were making your adventure to Jade. Their booming voices was loud to your ears but you manage plug it with your fingers. Once you got to Jade boot, you trying to decide on how to climb since it a rubber boot and that looking up, you see Jade getting hug from her mother before her foot paw slammed to the ground making you jump up high into the air until you landed on top of the boot. After that, the mother left the scene before you heard her footsteps stomping away the scene. As you were getting up, trying to find what happened, you then heard a voice so loud that you thought you were going deaf. It was Jade yelling to her sister when she is coming down and threaten her if she doesn't come at all. It nearly pop off at your ears but lucky it subdued. So you got up again, to see where you are and according to you, that you were on the boot in the middle to be exact and that you can see her looming form as she then got on her phone and start texting away. It seems it was a perfect time to climb before her sister comes down to go to school. So you make your way to the leg and you were climbing to punkish Jade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You come to realize that you are on the paw of this anthro. Studying the Eevee more, you are aware that this is some type of female because of the hills on its chest but also a rather young 14 year old teenager. The wind around you starts to pick up speed very quickly as the Eevee seems to start moving it\u2019s legs to the edge of the bed. As you hang on to dear life, you hope that since you are on the paw of this creature that you won\u2019t get crushed by the simple act of her just casually standing up. Since you are about the size of a speck, she probably wouldn\u2019t notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, when you heard a huge thump of her placing her feet on the ground, you notice that you are on the top of your paw. Just when you believe that little motion from the bed to the ground was crazy, she started to walk around her house which made hanging on to her hair strand much more challenging. After what seems like an hour of hanging on, the moving around stopped. You take a moment look at your surroundings and find out you are in a bathroom of sorts. It seems like she is following the normal morning routine of hers, but since noises were amplified because of your size, you were able to hear everything she was doing from washing her hands to her combing her hair. She was taking quite a while when you thought about it. You were thinking that you could take the time to escape from where you were to another place that didn\u2019t move around so much. But you also thought that during your escape, you could get easily get hurt or stepped on by this Eevee or any other large creature and perhaps the safest thing to do right now is just stay on the anthros paw and perhaps travel up to a safer part of her body.</span></div></div>",

Because of your tiny size, you are almost impossible to be seen or heard by the Pokeanthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Any type of fetish is allowed as long they're also focus on Marco/Micro stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The story is mostly unaware, but aware scenarios are allowed too as long as there's a detailed reason why the character got noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No humans except for you or feral Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The chapter must have at least a paragraph unless it's a choice chapter and try to put some effort into it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Use a decent grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Your personality varies in this story. That way, anyone can choose what fits right for their character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. You can end the story, but don't try to do so with only a few chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Deaths are allowed as long as the chapter is detailed enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Any ages of the Pokemon depends on the evolution forms:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Stage: 0-9<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond Stage: 9-17<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird Stage: 17-Onwards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pokemon with two evolution forms will have this kind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Stage: 0-14<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond Stage: 14-Onwards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Pokemon with no evolution will stay in that form, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n06/21/2019 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this time, the story's rating has now jumped from 13+ to 18+ giving everyone the freedom to write whatever fits their style whatever they want. Any chapters with violent, sexual or other contents that are common in older rated stories are accepted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there's still a few limits that you must follow. Just because you can write whatever you want does not mean there's no rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No extreme sexual content with underage characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so damn obvious why stuff like this should never be in the story. I don't want to see a story involving NSFW material with young characters because it's seriously messed up. So please don't go too far with this sort of stuff with the chapter involve around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No rebirthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still tolerate Insertion stuff....even if that's not my cup of tea. However, I can't really make sense with rebirthing stuff (I mean how can't you be turn into a newborn just by going inside reproductive organs) so I'm afraid this sort of stuff aren't allowed. My apologizes to all you fans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toilet stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I'm fine with some bodily functions like sweat, boogers, and so on. However, I'm not okay with pooping, peeing and other stuff that is commonly seen on the toilet. Seriously, I'm terribly grossed out by this sort of stuff. Of course, that doesn't mean everyone can't do their business as long it happens off-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you have it guys, go extra nuts and write what's ever in your mind ;)</td>",
