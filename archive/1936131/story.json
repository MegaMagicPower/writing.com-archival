            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From within a dark, dimly lit room with a large oval, curved window at the front of the room a man roughly standing at 5\" 11 wearing a black trench-coat complete with a sharp easy settling cape, he was also wearing matching black boots made of a mysterious possibly enchanted or scientifically advanced material similar to that of leather, with white markings in the shape of snakes. He wore a tight hood around his head and hid his face with a gleaming silver one-way mirrored, flat, faceless mask completely encasing his face from ever being seen by naked eyes. The man also had a small, tight but reliable belt complete with a Swiss army knife strapped under his coat hidden from view attached under the belt. The man had a decent enough physique as the suit underneath the trench-coat held to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was sitting down with his hands on his knees, the chair was large and luxurious, crisp leather was what it was made from. It was a cold evening as the sun went down roughly just a few minutes ago it was the hour of twilight, the view was gorgeous from his oval window as you could gaze for miles over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't speak, he just tilted his head up at the window and stood up, not even making enough sound to work out that he was breathing. He slowly walked over to the window and dramatically hit it with his left hand spread outright, with his black glove covered palm against the cold, icy window he thought to himself taking in the great view of Shinjuku from wherever he was standing as of this moment. (Shinjuku...the blue phoenix, Ace Kamen? ...Viola Lambert...Takato Matsuki...things are going to change around these parts, especially for the Xeno affinity corporation or the X.A.C for short...I wonder which side will win? Good or evil...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he spoke out in a loud and demanding, powerful voice which would send chills down anyone's spine, he seemed mad and hungry for power and control, typical of a leading type of person \"...Because...not everything is black and white so they say...but who are they to judge when they are neither side? ...If evil loses, I'll see it all turn and fade away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><br>\r\nPrologue \"Like a dream...\"</div></font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Later --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate at night outside a large secure military facility, three renamon were standing outside the locked entrance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first renamon was male, he had dark red fur and was roughly 6\" 5. He spoke up readying himself for something in a friendly but cocky voice \"You guys ready for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second renamon on the left was shorter only standing at 5\" 2 and had pale blue fur, she said slightly intimidated by the size of the facility, as she was speaking it started to rain as thunder arced across the midnight sky \"Frank; I was born ready. What about you Wendy?\" She asked looking to her right past Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green furred renamon answered drawing a short katana, she answered to the blue renamon \"Snow do you even have to ask?\" she was 5\" 6 being slightly taller than Snow the blue renamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all eyed the entrance as they saw three soldiers in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got down to avoid being seen as they planned their attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers wore black trench-coats, armored and tinted gas masks with steel coils attached, matching black armored leggings and boots with black leather gloves, they all wielded black carbine rifles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank the dark red furred renamon put his hand up in a fist, they all nodded as Frank put his hands together and exhaled as a blast of intense flame melted through the barbed wire defending the entrance as they cut through it like butter effortlessly despite a storm going on it did not hinder the flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the three soldiers readied his carbine aiming right at Frank but before he could shoot was slashed across the chest by Wendy the green furred renamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier collapsed as his gun danced on the floor from the impact of falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two last soldiers eyed the three renamon as they scrambled to their feet and ran away like cowards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank laughed as the rainy storm worsened into something of a tropical storm despite the climate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three renamon advanced into the compound past some armored jeeps as an alarm blared, Frank shouted over the alarm to Wendy and Snow \"Find the secondary Dictator of the X.A.C! Those two soldiers were quick to alert the compound, I'll go on ahead and provide a distraction while you two lay low and search for the second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded and ran off to find the \"Secondary dictator\". Frank burst open a door and drew his black katana as it lit up in blue flames he uttered slashing through the room without even batting an eyelid \"Flashfire, come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room burst into life as the soldiers screamed and collapsed burning Frank continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow was shooting ice shards into the sky and reflecting the light off of them to keep an eye on the entire facility from the sky using them as mirrors or crystal balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said irritated as she kept searching relentlessly \"God damn that scumbag where is he!? If we kill him we can end this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was jumping over the rooftops of the large facility using the wind to bound across the otherwise insurmountable gaps, she stopped at a tower on the side of a ledge and peeked her head around the corner into a window very cautiously as not to be seen from the dwellers within the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped as she saw a small group of Elite soldiers like the black suited soldiers except they had gleaming white armor and the same carbines as the black soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the four man group of elite soldiers was a young man aged roughly twenty-five who was wearing a casual morning suit, had short brown hair and a chiseled face, yelling at the soldiers as they were arguing about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy uttered to herself \"The secondary dictator, if that man dies his cause dies with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was about to put her ear to the glass to eavesdrop but the storm and rain made her footing gave way as she slipped and barely saved herself by landing against the glass smashing through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elite soldiers almost instantaneously as they were trained to opened fire on Wendy as she used the wind to escape through the window again and deflect the bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy landed on the ground as she caught her breath as a small platoon of the normal black suited soldiers raced past searching for intruders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hid behind a pipe as the soldiers left she came out and began jumping over the rooftops again using the dark stormy night as a backdrop as to not be seen easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said jumping back to where she last saw Frank near the entrance \"I've found him! I don't know how long he'll be there but I have to tell Frank ASAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was running through some narrow hallways setting everything he ran past ablaze in rage for the secondary dictator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank yelled over the screaming soldiers who never stood a chance as the flame purged them out of the building \"Come on out 'second dictator!' You can't hide forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy smashed through a skylight into the hallway in front of Frank as Frank asked out of breath \"D-Did you find him!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy nodded pointing at the tower halfway across the compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Wendy jumped out of the broken skylight and began making their way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank made a 'come here' gesture with his right hand as Snow saw this with her ice shards she jumped and made her way to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were together again in a group as they began making their way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later of carnage as the soldiers tried to stop the pursuit they made it to the tower, Frank melted the blast door as they began storming up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Frank could even get a flight up the stairs something punched him in the face and almost broke his jaw with so much force it smashed him through the steel barricade and out into the street again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy and Snow looked back and yelled ready to fight \"FRANK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned around to face forward as a girl walked down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to be about twenty years old wearing a streaming white dress which now had Frank's blood dashed over it and dark blue shoes, the dress covered down to her knees but no more, she was wearing nothing on her arms or her face, she had two golden blonde braids and strange artificial evil looking red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was roughly 5\" 7. She looked malnourished and severely underweight but was beautiful. Her face was gentle and thin but at the same time looked emotionless and drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl said looking down at them heartlessly from the staircase \"Frank and his worthless friends still having trouble keeping up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow and Wendy readied to fight, Snow said in disgust \"Viola! You won't stop us this time, this time we are killing the second dictator and you can't stop us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three dashed at each other to fight as Frank woke up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said lying in bed as the morning sun rose outside his window... \"That same dream again? I'll never get over how close I was to finishing off that bastard the secondary Dictator Lewis...and his lapdog Viola stopped me; the bitch!\"</span></div></div>",

He had a detective feel about him from the old movies, but his hair was short and slick back with a comb. He was looking at his watch on his wrist for a second before moving his arm down to his side. He is about the same height as the man wearing the mask looking like a phantom of the opera and he had a handsome face that wasn\u2019t blocked off by the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing by what my friend wearing the black mask said. If good loses, I will have to help them out a bit with sending a pair teachers to help out.\u201d He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA boy that has the power to transform into a digimon and a partner who is like family to him, but will he find someone to call his heart\u2019s desire. Ace Kamen, a young warrior trained by the best teachers and on the quest to find the elemental foxes. He needs to find the royal knights and ask them about the ancient paladin.\u201d He added before it started to rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill he find what he is looking for and complete his quest? I don\u2019t know, but it will be interesting to watch.\u201d he said before walking down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Chapter 1: A warrior coming home.</font></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city was quiet and still during some part of the day like it was normal, but other times it was a battle for saving the town from digimon. Two people were walking towards the city at a slow pace and they have black hooded cloaks covering their bodies from view, but one of them was taller than the other one by a head. These two were returning from a trip that lasted three years of training and another 6 months of searching for elemental foxes. They fought against armies of rogue digimon they were mostly rookies, champions, and a few ultimates. They were killed and turned into data was absorbed into the digimon that killed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digimon that killed them was a renamon, but this one is different because of it evolution line and her eyes are light pink or rose pink. Her armguards are the same, but the color is a slightly darker purple than the normal ones. Her partner is a human that can digivolve into a digimon and fight with her. The human\u2019s name is Ace Kamen and he is a special person that can use magic. He had enough training to say a single word for a spell to work and have to say the entire spell. He has short messy black hair, dark brown eyes, 4'9 or 4'10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wears a sleeveless black training gi with red flames, a headband with the ying-yang symbol on the center and the color of the headband is yellow with purple outlines on the band. His gi pants are black with blue flames, the arm guards were made for blocking sword strikes since they were rough and they were a dark gold color, and the leg guards were the same thing except the color was dark silver with wings. To tie it altogether is a belt was a dark rainbow of colors, his body shows well-defined muscles, but he is stronger than he looks and he fights to protect his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think it has been three years since that event and we had to leave for our journey for more training.\u201d the short one said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour friends will be glad to see you again and show them how strong you gotten.\u201d The tall one said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe found half of the elements we need for the final mode of your mega form.\u201d They added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust need fire, wind, ice, darkness, light, and metal.\u201d The short one said holding five cards in his hand glowing a different color of said element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the cards away before stopping to see the city he left behind for 3 years and he was happy to be back. it was a few seconds before another army of digimon appeared surrounding him and his partner. The pulled the hoods off so they can see the army of champs and ults digimon, but they smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the welcoming party, but it was in vain.\u201d Ace said before pulling out his digivice and one card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will get revenge for our friends your data fiend.\u201d One champ said before ace\u2019s renamon was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cData fiend? You are the ones who keep coming after us so it\u2019s not our fault that you are being stupid.\u201d She said before they got ready for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to end this or me?\u201d ace asked holding the card ready to scan it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me do it. I have a new move to try out.\u201d She said before making crystal shards appearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded before standing by, but his hand on his sword as his digivice is on his belt and the card in the deck case. His partner nodded thanking him for the trust to end this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiamond Blizzard Storm!\u201d she yelled as the shards teleported and it started to snow around the area<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of a few minutes, the entire army was reduced to data in seconds and she pulls the data towards her. She left some data for the digimon to reform as a digiegg but no less than that. They sighed before putting their hoods up and walking into town. She always lets them live, but they need to stop coming to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always find it weird that our teachers had digimon music on a iPod for you and it was from all of the seasons and some of your favorite music as well.\u201d She said as he was looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is them you are talking about. They always seems to surprise us during training and keep the family card out of use so we can actually train and not cheat our way through.\u201d He said looking through his music selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to get a new look or wearing the same thing?\u201d she asked and he shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well, before getting home and relax for the rest of the day.\u201d he said putting his ipod in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were walking towards a clothing store that is by their favorite teahouse. They see some people looking at them, but it was only for a few seconds before going on their way. Walking into the clothing store, he pulled his hood down so he could see the collection of men\u2019s clothing and his partner walked over to the other clothing racks. He got a black leather jacket, dark red muscle shirt, dark blue jeans, and dark brown belt. He also picked up a grey button down shirt with yellow flower pattern before paying for the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get some new shoes on the way home.\u201d He said carrying the bag that has his clothes in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the teahouse to grab some tea to go and head for home for the day, but they went to the mall for his new shoes at a good shoe store. They left the mall to get home fast so they travel by rooftops of the buildings. It took them a few minutes to get home and inside before locking the door. As soon as he did, lights turned on with a yell \u201cSURPRISE!\u201d he turned to see all of his friends there with their digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe felt the digimon and the sudden disappearance.\u201d Rika\u2019s renamon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso see the weird blizzard in one area for a moment\u201d henry said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I thought we would make it home without too much of a scene.\u201d He said as his renamon took the bags to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad to get a set of clothes and clean my gear.\u201d He said they nodded knowing he has been away from home for 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the house seeing all of his friends and their parents, but his parents are not here to greet him home. \u201cYour parents are away doing a renovation project with their digimon and they said that will be here soon.\u201d Rika said seeing the sad look on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to think of a project that could be fixing up for 3 years and he smiled. \u201cI know what is getting fixed up.\u201d He said slightly chuckling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing we got it done early.\u201d A male voice said behind him and this caused him to kick his father in the chest sending him out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was met with sweat drops and a giggle from his mother. \u201cI told you that would happen, dear.\u201d His mother told his father when walked back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore things gets started with the party, I\u2019m going to take a shower and clean up. I have to be sure that I don\u2019t have to repair my gear.\u201d He said raising a hand into a half seal \u201cFlash step.\u201d He said vanishing in a flash going to his room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot can change in 3 years so I wonder how they managed their training.\u201d his father said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce stripped down to his boxers and formed another half seal. \u201cClean.\u201d He said as his training gear was being steam cleaned while the sword was being clean with sword cleaning oil and the shoes were being polished. He grabbed a towel and a cloth before stepping into his bathroom for an overdue shower. After starting the hot shower, he jumped in before turning cold water on a little so he doesn\u2019t burn. He started to clean the dirt, sweat, and other things off his body. He started to wash his now longer hair that reaches the base of his neck. He sighed in content after he was done washing his hair and let the water hit his body. Shortly his partner hopped into the shower so she could clean off as well and it took them about 30 minutes to get done. He was drying off while hearing a sound and sees his partner puff up like a big ball of fur. He was smiling and trying to stifle his chuckles, but she knew he was failing. Taking a quick picture before helping her with her fur, he was dressed in his new clothes and putting on his new shoes. They went back to the party because they waited long enough, but that shower was heaven for them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The planners of the party heard footsteps coming down the steps and they smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing for a shower.\u201d Was heard from ace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was paradise.\u201d His partner agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas there any directions on how to clean the cloaks?\u201d she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t remember, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s either normal, dry cleaners, or a steam clean.\u201d He said shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying being home again?\u201d his father asked smiling like a kid planning something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree years since that event plus spending time with my friends before we had to leave for three years. Spent another 6 months on a search for some renamon that had elemental powers.\u201d He explained surprising them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have another mode change under my belt, but I have a final one to trigger after finding the rest of the elemental renamon.\u201d He said before pulling out ten cards from his deck case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean ace? Elemental renamon?\u201d rika asked as they were all confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused before smiling. \u201cSorry, I just got home and I\u2019m planning to find the rest of my final mode change to paladinmon.\u201d He said as they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was barking heard as ace was tackled by two viximon, Vixy and Kits, licking his face as the others chuckled at the sight.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I know you both are happy to see me; I have to get up.\u201d He said laughing and petting them before they could pin him down by growing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up before walking over to the table standing next to his partner and rika. Not getting a good look at his friends after walking into the door, he took the time to look at each of his friends. Rika and Jeri finally blossomed into older teenagers with some curves, takato and henry look smarter then 3 years ago; but takato still has the goggles of a leader, ryo being the oldest starting to have some peach fuzz on his face. Alice closer to henry\u2019s age started to bloom as well; but not reached puberty calling yet, henry\u2019s little sister, suzie definitely has gotten taller for being 10, finally ai and mako at 7 grew a little. Rika grew close to being her renamon\u2019s height so she is slightly taller than ace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure digimon has been popping up during my trip, but I think this party is just getting started.\u201d He said as hip-hop music was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA birthday party disguise as a welcome home party.\u201d He said with a laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was dancing first and ace was dancing all over the floor with each of the girls and dipped rika with a hand in her back jeans pocket. She and Jeri has a DD-cup figure with matching ass so takato and ace might be in their sights for boyfriend material. Soon it was time for cake and presents and they made it back to the table as the digimon didn\u2019t leave the table. He got more clothes from rika\u2019s mother and some tea from her grandmother, some recipes from takato\u2019s parents to make for his during breakfast, henry\u2019s family gave him several books covering a various subjects; but henry and suzie gave him some pictures of terriermon wearing a pink princess dress. Ai and mako made him a picture of ace, them and the other tamers and the digimon. He smiled before rubbing their head and turned to alice and ryo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got something for me?\u201d he asked them who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyo gave him a few copies of his cards like radiant form and goliath while Alice gave him a charm bracelet with all of the digimon including her dobermon who gave the tamers the power to biomerge to face the d-reaper. He gave her a hug and a kiss on the forehead like an older brother would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the gifts I will use them well, but before the last gifts are received I have to give a gift.\u201d Ace said before grabbing his digivice and the family card from the deck case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat gift?\u201d rika said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith great power comes great responsibility, but this is for a good cause.\u201d He said as if to remind himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigi-modify: Alter Activate.\u201d He said as the area around him became distorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to the living room before going into a meditative position and he started to float. They were all watching him withheld breaths as he was forming hand seals guiding the power. His partner gave him some of her data that they collected for this moment. Blue and red flakes of data started to appear floating around him before converging together forming a black digiegg with a slate silver band. He floated to the floor ending the card\u2019s effects and waited to feel some feeling in his legs before trying to stand up. All of them are staring at the digiegg he made with shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my gift to you, alice, I have been planning on this since the end of the d-reaper.\u201d He said before standing up walking back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the egg to alice before sitting down back at his spot and let go of his held breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be dobermon in time, but that will depends on how you raise him and he might remember you.\u201d He explained feeling slightly tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling happy to have a chance of getting her digimon back, hugged ace and kissed him on the cheek. He smiled returning the hug before turning to rika, her renamon, and his parents since they have yet to give their presents to him. Rika and her renamon turned to him gave him a photo of her and him looking at the cherry blossoms before he left for training and another one of her wearing a dress that her mother picked out. This caused his eyes to widen and stutter while getting a faint blush. They smiled liking the reaction and his partner was laughing madly in her mind hearing his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo pineapple head, you actually found a dress you would wear.\u201d He said smiling using the nickname he used on her when they met and became friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsing that old name? Thought you be more mature.\u201c she said smirking at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore both of you get into a ranting debate, we still have to give our son his gift.\u201d His father said as they walked over to ace getting behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince we took a cruise before you left 3 years ago and your friends came along for a break after winning the tournament at school.\u201d His father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is it you want to go for the next trip?\u201d his mother asked and ace started to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy teachers have been telling us tales of kids like us going to the digital world and fighting evil, but they must have gotten older by now or passed away.\u201d He said turning to see his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey might still be around or they moved away after so many years.\u201d His mother said and he looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to go to where they lived, Odaiba.\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to go see where it first started.\u201d His father said and ace nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too far away from here, but I think we can stay there for about a week or two.\u201d He added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour friends can go with you, but the younger ones will stay here.\u201d His mother said while suzie, ai, and mako groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, I want you to stay so you can get your dobermon into cerberumon\u201d ace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might get a paomon and take up to seasarmon if that happens. Both that and dobermon can digivolve into cerberumon. I added a trick to his code so you should get a dobermon in the end.\u201d He added and she nodded to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that only leaves the cake.\u201d His father said as ace cut the cake and everyone had two pieces.<br>\r\nAce\u2019s partner took the gifts up to his room while the parents took the job of cleaning and putting things away while the tamers were in the living room drinking tea and talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the training?\u201d ryo asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was hard work, but it was worth it. I would it with the training might guy and rock lee go through in the Naruto anime.\u201d Ace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had to learn that you couldn\u2019t rely on one card like the family card, but you did use your own power.\u201d His partner said phasing into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe went under physical training, spell training, and form training.\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForm training?\u201d takato asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were to train using only one form at a time to use less energy when digivolving.\u201d Ace\u2019s renamon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was during the mode changes for paladinmon that I got an idea for a new mode change, but it need both my renamon and my crystal necklace.\u201d He said before pulling out the card of his newest mode change with the attack Icicle Lance Barrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me what has been going on while I was gone.\u201d He said as they started to tell him each of their own paths for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHenry is going to be like his father, Ryo is going traveling with his digimon, Takato is going to be an artist, and Jeri wants to tryout in sports like ice skating, dancing, and gymnastics. Alice is going to school and helping at a pet shop, suzie has been babysitting ai and mako, Kenta working to be a doctor, and Kazu is like shikamaru, but he is going to be a teacher.\u201d Ace summed it up for them, but turned to see rika looking away with a faint blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo pineapple head, what have you been doing the last three years?\u201d he asked with a smirk and she gave him a deadpanned look for the pet name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been working with kaa-chan on her fashion show and look over her contracts. I trained with renamon so we could get stronger.\u201d She said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy plans are to find the other 5 elemental renamon and get my final mode change.\u201d Ace said</span></div></div>",

Fire, Wind, Water, Earth are the four primary elements while Ice, Metal, Thunder and Wood are secondary elements.\u201d He said as the cards started to glow a different color of the said element<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cards started to move into a direction with Fire, Wind, and Ice in one group. Water, Earth, and Wood in another group while Metal and Darkness into different direction while Light and Thunder are in front of both renamons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika was surprised to see her own partner is one of the elemental renamon ace was looking for and ace smirked to see his renamon one of those he needed for his final mode change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew about my renamon was one of them, but your renamon is a welcomed surprised.\u201d He said before putting the cards away into his deck case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your final mode change?\u201d takato asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSun Warrior.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the guests left leaving only rika and her renamon knowing he would take them home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre going to take us with you on your search or are you going alone?\u201d she asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I want to relax after my trip here and see where it first started with the digimon.\u201d He said shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere could be one slide evolution if I go twilight in my new mode and take it further with sun warrior.\u201d He said looking at vixy and kits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the light and darkness card point towards them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither too young to handle the power or they are like the normal renamon.\u201d He said petting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides they are needed for renamon mega form when she goes crystal.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out of his house so he could walk her home like he did in the past. He was looking at the moon and stars before turning to see her looking at his muscular body. She turned away blushing and he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be relaxing for a few days before deciding when to go on the trip and maybe I\u2019ll find something there to start my search. The cards are general in direction, but that is till they get in my line of sight.\u201d He said before letting out a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thinking about the future generation of tamers after our time is done.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel kind of excited to see it.\u201d He said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I can strong like you?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? You are strong in your own way or do you mean with getting muscles?\u201d he asked with a raised eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting some muscle without looking like a freak on steroids.\u201d She said with a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I say you are stronger than you think and it\u2019s in your way. Let us think about it and see what happens.\u201d He said giving her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of my power is hidden till I need it for a hard fight or planning to get serious. Besides I might get taller so we can be the same height, but my base power will still be stronger.\u201d He explained his hidden power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to her home and she kissed him on the cheek. He smiled before kissing her on the lips stealing her first kiss. She had a shocked look on her face and he was chuckling before her renamon took her inside. He and his renamon were laughing all the way home, but she will get even with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo good to be back home after a long trip.\u201d Ace said before getting inside and up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got ready for bed and kept his deck in a safe lock box that only he or his renamon could open under his bed and he wrapped himself around his partner feeling her fur before falling asleep. She hugged him before her too going to sleep after a long trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Time to see what will the future and time will show us. Maybe rika could use some help getting stronger.~ she thought, but it ace\u2019s decision on the matter.</span></div></div>",

Especially that dream I had two nights ago...failing to kill the secondary Dictator. I might never get over that.\" He thought to himself not feeling energetic enough to continue talking to himself (That bitch Viola stopped me...I wonder if Wendy and Snow are awake?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped up and opened his door, then walked out into the hallway and looked down cocking his head left and right to look to see if anyone was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said to himself trying to wake up stretching \"Well looks like the coast is clear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank yawned again and walked downstairs to get some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank walked across the living room and into the kitchen, Snow and Wendy looked at him, Wendy was wide awake and full of life but Snow was dreary and tired looking same as Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked Wendy amazed \"How are you so awake so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said laughing \"I don't know I just am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow asked annoyed \"Can I eat in peace please?\" she asked stuffing some toast into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sighed feeling more awake and said sitting down \"I had another dream two nights back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow and Wendy looked at him interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy asked handing him a plate with two slices of toast on it \"What was it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said chuckling while picking a slice of toast \"What do you think? It was about the Xeno affinity corp again. Or corporation or whatever you say it like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said perking up \"Tell us what it was about, were we in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded and continued while eating \"Yeah *Munch* both of you *crunch* were there, it was when we were trying to kill the secondary dictator and it was a stormy night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow and Wendy looked down remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said saddened that they were beaten by Viola \"Yeah...I remember...man I'll never live that one down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said disheartened \"It was pretty embarrassing, Viola beat all three of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank slammed the table with his left fist while the other held half a slice of toast, he spoke in disgust gritting his teeth and blinking strongly \"She wouldn't have beat us if she didn't knock me out with that sucker punch! What she did was cowardly attacking from the shadows, if I had seen her coming we would have won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said laughing as Frank calmed down \"You underestimate her, I don't know how a human is so powerful but the X.A.C must have done something to her like...I dunno, gave her drugs or experimented on her or even magic? Anyway the point is that she is a lot tougher than you think. It's unbelievable she took you down with a single punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said taunting Frank \"Yeah, beaten by a girl with one punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said chuckling surprising them both \"Like I care, you two didn't hold up very well against her either from what you told me the night after I recovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy and Frost looked at each other defeated sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank spoke up opening his eyes again while finishing off the toast \"Besides, that was three years ago just after the D-Reaper crisis, I'm so much stronger now, she wouldn't stand a chance like I am now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said narrowing her eyes \"You overconfident idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said teasing \"Overconfidence is fine when you have the power to match it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said laughing \"What's this? You're trying to be philosophical?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said gazing over to her \"Don't use words with more than eight letters you'll hurt yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said standing up \"Anyway enough of the nonsense, have you done any more training lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said chuckling while getting up \"Like I need it, all I've done these past three years is train for taking down the X.A.C again. For the good of Digimon everywhere they must be stopped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy asked as the two slowly walked out of the kitchen and into the living room \"Where are you two going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said opening the front door \"I'm going into Shinjuku to keep an eye on the X.A.C, Frank you coming too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank shook his head and said aloud \"Nah, I'm going solo, I'll keep an eye on them too but not as much as you since you have that ice mirror technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow sighed and said closing the door \"Well bye then, be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said to Wendy pondering some more around his thoughts \"Wendy, you know the X.A.C are evil and profiting off of killing our kind right? Even experimenting on them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stepped closer then nodded and spoke up \"It'll be fine Frank, three long years since we failed to stop them, now we are stronger, you said it yourself, all the three of us have done since then is train and relax. I think it is time for action again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said annoyed pushing her back \"Where do we even start? We don't know where Lewis the secondary Dictator even is right now, what are we supposed to do about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said knowingly \"Snow can find him with her ice mirror technique, I can find him quickly with my speed, it'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked interested in the answer \"Do you...do you think we are strong enough to beat Viola now head on? We need to be strong enough for her if we're going looking for Lewis again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was silent for a minute but then spoke up confidently \"Yes Frank, if all three of us fought her fair and square at once we would have nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded and asked opening the front door \"I'm going out now, anything you want from a store or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shook her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded, sighed and left shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in town...</span></div></div>",

He is head for a morning cup of tea when he sensed something kin to digimon, but also an element. He had his deck case and digivice with him just in case. During their training, his digivice changed to a gold one with a red strap and a silver band. It could also track elements because he tested it with thunder on his partner so he knew she was one of them. Pulling the fire element card out, he spin it on his index finger by the corner before taking a stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigi-Modify: Fire Tracker Activate.\u201d He said sliding the card through<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few seconds, he got a reading in a direction to a location that is not far from he was.

Now you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce spoke up confidently \"My name is Ace Kamen, most people call me Ace, the reason I was looking for you was because you are not a normal renamon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked interested \"Would any of this have to do with the fact that I can control fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said nodding after sipping some tea \"You catch on quickly, yes, you are the fire elemental renamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked intrigued \"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce spoke up putting the tea down \"It means you are a one of a kind Digimon, you are gifted with the power to control fire like no other.

Inside was a little blonde girl with two golden braids and blue eyes, her two golden braids hung at each side of her face and were wrapped in green cotton bands. She was wearing a white and blue dress which went down to her knees and did not hide any of her arms. She was also wearing teal shoes. She looked to be about seven years old. She was sitting on a man's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had a very dark grey, bushy moustache, short dark, almost black, brown hair flattened down which went down to his ears, the man looked to be about 37.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was wearing a red and white checkered shirt which shown his burly, manly physique easily. He was also wearing black trousers and had large black boots on. He was holding a storybook in front of the little girl and reading it out to her in a manly, warm voice typical of that of a woodcutter \"And the wolf blew and blew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"ARGH!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola jumped up from bed in a dark bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola stuttered with tears welling up in her eyes \"F-father...why did you have to leave me? ...these damn dreams again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola stood up out of bed still wearing her white dress. She walked into the next room which was a restroom and washed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing she heard someone knocking at her door. It was still quite early in the morning. She looked in the mirror and her eyes were not red and bloodshot anymore, they were blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the door and opened it with her left hand, she laid eyes on two elite white armored X.A.C soldiers fully equipped and holding carbine rifles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis was in between them, he had a chiseled face and brown hair with blending features and wore a white morning suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis asked worried about something \"May I come in? There is something we need to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola reluctantly stepped out of the way for him to come in, he put his right hand up speaking aloud \"No need for you two to follow me, I don't think Viola is going to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soldiers chuckled lightly under the armored gas masks and the soldier on the left said taking a stance against the wall \"We will wait here then sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis nodded as he walked in past Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis sat down on one of the chairs at a small round table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola flicked on the light and sat down opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola asked still rubbing her eyes from crying \"So what is this all about Secondary Dictator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis spoke up looking her dead in the eyes \"There's been a problem. We have reason to believe Ace Kamen is back from training and he is in the area, but that's not the bad part...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola narrowed her eyes asking more \"Then what is the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis narrowed his eyes even further dramatically \"...Frank Bellows is back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola's face turned pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola asked in shock \"N-no! I killed him three years ago, I broke his neck by punching him through a wall, I felt it! Remember? You escaped because of his death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said shaking his head \"Turns out he's tougher than to let himself be killed off so easily, he's back from three straight years of training and probably mulling over his failure at your hands. You need to be more alert now than ever. I don't know how but I think his two friends the green and blue renamon saved him back then, it's possible and it probably is that you only knocked him out with your punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola looked down in disgust and said slightly angry at herself \"I shouldn't have held anything back, I was overconfident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said getting up \"Then you know what to do if you see him or he shows up, I'll leave you to get back to whatever you were doing then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola put out her right hand as he was leaving and spoke out \"Wait! What about...did you learn anything about what happened to my father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis swallowed hard and answered after thinking about something for a few seconds \"No, we haven't learned anything else other than what I've told you; that he was probably done in back then, but we don't know who by, now get some rest, you look like you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis closed the door as Viola flicked off the light and lay back down again to think about things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How that happened? I have no idea.\u201d He explained and frank nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey picked up the pace to the house he was staying at with snow and wendy. Soon they made it to the house and frank motioned him to stay outside for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ace, where are you?~ his partner asked in his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Was getting tea for a wakeup call, but I felt the fire elemental renamon so I\u2019m meeting with the wind and ice elementals.~ he said before frank came back out and motioned him to come inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019ll be home soon so I can tell you later.~ he said to her before cutting the link and walking inside the home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is the human that found you and took you by surprise.\u201d The light blue renamon said crossing her arms looking at ace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Snow and the green renamon is Wendy.\u201d Ace said getting nods from both<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe name is Ace Kamen.\u201d He said bowing to them in greeting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted a table and pull out his ten cards and placing them in the same pattern as he did before. They came over to watch this and snow was about to say something when ace stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree years ago after the D-reaper event and some months passed, I gotten my digimon partner and she is a renamon looking like a normal one. Except her eyes, armguards, and more importantly her digivolution line is different from a normal data type renamon. I discovered that I was able to digivolve into a digimon unlike any others.\u201d He explained before pulling out some more cards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy forms are Samuriamon, Championmon, and Paladinmon. Paladinmon have some mode changes like fox form and my newest form. There is one last form I have to obtain and that is the Sun Warrior mode change. I can only get it by searching for the renamon that have the elemental powers. Fire, Wind, Water, Earth, Metal, Wood, Thunder, Ice, Light, and finally Darkness.\u201d He said as the elemental cards glowing of said element<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter meeting you three, I only need to find Darkness and Metal. I know that you I\u2019m only using you to get this new form, but it\u2019s not that simple. I have to gain the trust of each elemental renamon and gain a card with one of their elemental attacks. My own partner is of thunder and a fellow tamer has a renamon is the light elemental.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I told frank before, I\u2019m not with X.A.C. and I never really kill digimon unless\u2026\u201d he paused as his face turning dark and serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless what?\u201d Wendy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are after my friends.\u201d He finished with a cold tone it made snow seemed warm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn  Icedevimon was after my friend with a renamon and it pissed me off so much to see her scared and she developed a shiver when he comes near.\u201d He gave an explanation and his voice was much colder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get stronger so I can protect my friends and my partner. Some digimon are family to me while others are friends that I don\u2019t leave behind.\u201d He said before lightening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was looking at him with stars in her eyes before hugging him. Snow was staring at him with some shock and amazement. Frank smiled at him knowing he would do the same for snow and wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so kind and willing to protect your special people.\u201d wendy said cheerfully rubbing her cheek against ace\u2019s cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and I are the same when we fight to protect our friends.\u201d Frank said nodding to ace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow is looking at him her opinion of him changing thinking she could trust him, but not completely yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admit that you are not like them and you tell the truth, but I cannot fully trust you yet.\u201d She said and he nodded as wendy let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce hold out his hand before the cards flew to it and he put them back into this deck case surprising them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have cards for Water, Earth, Wood, and Thunder. Light, Fire, Ice, and Wind are next. Darkness and Metal will have to wait till a later date I guess.\u201d He said as he turned to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you have contact from either elemental renamon, let me know.\u201d He said handing them a card with his number on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank knows where I go for a morning cup of tea.\u201d He added before leaving their house and walking back to the teahouse for a real breakfast while getting something for his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I\u2019m on my way back to get some breakfast and tea for us.~ he said to his partner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Good, we can talk over that and see where we stand on the mode change.~ she said before leaving him be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply walked back to the teahouse for two more teas to go and some healthy breakfast.

So take it as a blessing not a curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gamma\" sighed and asked annoyed by his presence \"Right, right what do you want? I don't suppose you phoned me up to pester me did you? I'm in the middle of an important meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis asked interested \"M-meeting? What meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma answered \"My scientists were having a meeting about which venue of research to pursue next to do with Digimon, this could turn big profits for the corp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said as he face palmed himself \"Oh! Right I forgot about that, listen you shouldn't talk in that tone to your leader okay? Show some respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma said laughing \"Some respect? To you? You're not even the real leader, you're just the secondary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said pissed off raising his voice \"I AM the leader as long as whoever the hell is the big cheese is not around then I AM the leader until then got it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma said backing off from the phone \"My ears, calm yourself, watch out we got a badass over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis heard the scientists laughing in the background, Lewis yelled at the top of his lungs down the phone \"I'M IN THE AREA SO DON'T MAKE ME - *sigh* whatever, hey what evidence do you have that this 'Dictator' even exists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma said calming down the laughter \"Oh? Interesting question, maybe you should ask Viola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis glared and froze.

And the truth...will set you free...the truth, will set you free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said annoyed \"Are you playing games with me old man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma said frustrated \"You kids these days, no I am not playing games with you, I'm just having a joke. But back to the question, don't bother asking Viola about it, she'll never come clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said chuckling \"Oh right of course, almost forgot about her training and those things Doctor Alfred did to her. Anyway I'm in the area and I wanted to come talk to you face to face about the corporation's scientific research, more importantly if you've discovered any better way to execute Digimon rather than to just shoot them and extract the data?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma spoke up \"No, there is no other way I've discovered...yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said sighing \"Great, perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma asked interested \"So what is the real reason you've come out to my playground of Eastern Shinjuku?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis perked up and remembered \"Oh! Right, I'll tell you just what I've told Viola and what I'll tell Shaun, A tamer named Ace Kamen is back in Shinjuku, but now this is where it gets interesting...the \"blue phoenix\" is back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma froze and asked coldly \"Then...what do we do? Should we trust in Viola and Shaun to beat him again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said laughing \"Viola thought she killed him back three years ago but obviously not, our scouts have seen him walking around town, he's in the Southern sector.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma said laughing \"Ah yes, that cunning fox, he knows exactly what he is doing setting up his base in the Southern sector where our defenses and forces are weakest, no director controlling the South side, just normal scouts and soldiers armed with small arms, hardly any elite soldiers too, how are we going to go about this? Remember that Doctor Alfred wants to experiment on the blue phoenix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said scratching his head \"I don't know but if he's back this could be really bad, not to mention if he is working together with Ace Kamen or the three tamers that defeated the D-Reaper. Don't call him the blue phoenix, just call him by his real name 'Frank'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma said sighing \"Do I have to? Blue phoenix sounds more threatening than Frank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said speaking into the phone \"I don't know I don't care. Call him what you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the elites walked into the alleyway and asked him checking his rifle \"Secondary Dictator, will you be talking here much longer? We've just got a call that a group of Digimon are attacking on the West side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis spoke up away from the phone directly at the soldier \"No, the West side is strong, Shaun knows what he is doing, I told you to the guard this alleyway while I'm doing business so guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elite white armor plated soldier reluctantly went back to guarding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier that was still guarding asked the other soldier \"Hey what did he say about the Digimon attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other soldier answered as the one who just spoke was placing the safety on his rifle \"I don't know, I swear it's like he doesn't even listen.

His eyes changed to light blue as his body turn pale blue and a black demon looking mask on his face. The armor of imperialdramon turned into crystal before reforming into dragon and wolf themed samurai armor. His left arm has the dragon claw gauntlet while his right arm has the wolf fang gauntlet. Two sheathed swords appeared on his right side and they are made of crystalized diamond steel.

The tamers ran over to him and rika help kept ace steady as he ended the effects of the trump card meaning the white void vanished. He pulled out a flask and took a drink from it.

I\u2019ll catchup.\u201d He said with her nodding<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led them to the mansion where he used to stay at when he was younger as he teleported to where the three elementals were during the quick fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t you everything, but I can if you follow me to where they can\u2019t find you. The other tamers don\u2019t know I found you already, but my partner does and I think the light renamon sensed you. I\u2019m not sure, but it be best if you join us so we can help each other out.\u201c he told them</span></div></div>",

The three elementals were surprised to see a mansion here in the digital world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents made that house and I used to come here during the summer. If you need a place to stay, you are welcome to stay here. There is more than room, but there is security cameras built in just in case someone tries to sneak in.\u201d he said and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the offer.\u201d Wendy said hugging him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will need to be tested by you three and each of you has your own idea of a test. Use of my trump card varies in each test. Only me or my partner can use it. It could be a test of power, knowledge, speed, or a battle to see who would last the longest. It depends on your element and how you it.\u201d He explained and they nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce walked to the bridge and spoke a phrase in ancient japanese. The sound of wind blowing around stopped and he motioned them to cross the bridge before him. They did so as he crossed the bridge and the sound came back like it was howling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a wind guardian around the house to protect it and I have to say a certain phrase before letting any guests cross the bridge.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t say the phrase?\u201d snow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dTorn apart into nothing or something much worse.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it to the front door of the mansion when he stopped. He looked around feeling something and he was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~is rika shivering rena-chan?~ he asked his partner<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, ace?\u201d frank asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce turned to him and mouthed \u201cIn a minute.\u201d Before turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Just a little why?~ his partner said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Found a stress toy to use.~ he said turning to frank<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat little ice prick refuses to stay down.\u201d Ace said pulling out his digivice and the trump card before sliding it triggering the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d wendy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIcedevimon.\u201d He said as said digimon at the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will never delete me.\u201d He said and ace just got more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking towards the ultimate before snapping his finger making his hand engulfed in flames. Frank was surprised to see this, but he thought it was the effect of the trump card he used. Ace jumped high in the sky before slamming his flame fist into the ground making a crater pushing his power into the ground making red pillars of fire erupt from the ground (like fire pledge from pok\u00e9mon black and white). It was coming for the ice devil at a fast rate and soon he was engulfed in a large pillar of fire before it stopped. He was still there as ace wasn\u2019t done with him just yet. A puddle of water was underneath the ice devil before it was turned to ice and entrapped him like a sincicle surprising snow now with the control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you look like one of your captives when you first captured rika.\u201d Ace said still mad and cold hearted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging his arm down, brought a lightning strike breaking the ice before stomping his foot on the ground sending him flying into the with an earthstone fist uppercut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCyclonic Squall.\u201d He said before a windstorm formed cutting up the ice devil and surprised wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the storm stopped dropping the ice devil who is ready to be deleted by one more hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on kill me. I\u2019ll just keep coming back for her and we will have this dance again and again.\u201d He said as if he was taunting ace and his eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot this time. Mind wipe.\u201d Ace said before the ice devil\u2019s eyes went blank and drawn out his sword.<br>\r\n\u201cFire Rage Slash.\u201d He yelled deleting the ice devil as it turned to data and he ended the card\u2019s effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat felt good to relieve some stress and vent some stream.\u201d Ace said finally feeling like his old self with a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back to the three renamon before opening the door. He led them in and used a spell to flash change into a different set of clothes. He is now wearing a black shirt, dark red shorts, a crystal fox necklace, and white running shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHenry and Ryo can tell the younger tamers after we are done here. All current tamers at the table. I have some news I need to share.\u201d Ace said like a leader before leading the three renamons to the dinning room table. All of the tamers walked into the room surprised to see more renamon in the house and his partner phased next to him as rika with her renamon were the last to join them. His parents were in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce, are those the renamon you are looking for?\u201d takato asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEarlier this morning I was out for my morning cup of tea like usual when I sensed both a digimon and an elemental power so I tracked it and I found the fire elemental renamon.\u201d He explained while motioned to frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had a chat at the teahouse before going to his house where I met his two friends the wind and ice elements.\u201d He gestured to wendy and snow. Wendy smiled and waved shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAside from getting their trust, they need to test me so I get their elemental card like it did for thunder, earth, water, and wood.\u201d He said as they nodded before turning to the three renamon next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friends have been here before, but only my partner or I can open the path across the bridge to keep you from dying.\u201d He told them as they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother piece of news like before the battle with piedmon.\u201d He said like getting angry again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appeared while three man were walking on their way somewhere and it killed two of them before I got to it. Strangely enough it was two elite soldiers of X.A.C., but that\u2019s not the worst part. The third person was higher up on the foodchain like a shark. I gave him a threat while telling him to run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you say something like I should have let him die to the mega, I can\u2019t do that due to a vow I made to my teachers during my training.\u201d he said as his hands clenched into fists<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat vow?\u201d rika asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever let a man no matter how much you hate him for what they did die because you didn\u2019t want to save him from death when you can do something to save him.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate some megas more than others and piedmon is one of them.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething happened to your teachers?\u201d rika\u2019s renamon asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey almost died from using too much of their power and they said they didn\u2019t my help, but I thought I should have help them.\u201d He said and silence filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was the shark you saved?\u201d frank asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce sighed before looking at snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour enemy from three years ago. The second dictator.\u201d He said getting shocked looks from everyone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice and I\u2019m sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to break my promise to my teachers.\u201d He said slowing calming down</span></div></div>",

That means we could get another shot at stopping the X.A.C!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said happily \"Ace found him! Now we just need to locate him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said annoyed sighing \"You think it's going to be that easy to kill Lewis? He's a cunning, slippery little bastard, he's always surrounded by a group of Elite soldiers too. Besides, they really aren't the problem, the main problem is getting past the three directors Gamma the Professor, Shaun Ryan the hunter and worst of all Viola Lambert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry asked interested \"Do you know anything about these directors? I've heard their names before but none of us know anything about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank began explaining \"I'll tell you about them in order then, first of all Gamma is not his real name, I don't know what his real name is only that the nickname Gamma was given to him since he is a researcher of light radiation, he is responsible for keeping the Eastern sector of Shinjuku free from Digimon. But he also does research into Digimon, his research has proved to be invaluable to the X.A.C so it would hurt them if he was out of the picture. Shaun Ryan controls the Western sector of Shinjuku and leads the hunting part of the X.A.C, they hunt down Digimon and do things like sell them off, kill them or just capture them for research...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato asked interested \"Wait, there was one more director you mentioned, Viola?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said gritting his teeth \"Then there's 'this' bitch! Viola Lambert is someone who I don't know anything about except she's crazily powerful, I can take storms of bullets from the X.A.C soldiers regenerating my wounds seconds after but Viola can take me down using only her bare hands, she's fast, not as fast as Wendy but Viola is better at dodging than her. In all my time fighting the X.A.C I've never beaten Viola, not even once despite the times when I had Snow and Wendy with me to gang up on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika asked intrigued \"Isn't she just a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank shook his head \"She's definitely not human, I don't know how she's so powerful, it must be something one of Gamma's scientists did to her to make her so powerful. Anyway if you come across her she has blonde hair and looks to be in her early twenties, stay away from her and by no means piss her off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked looking over to Frank \"So this Xeno affinity corporation, did it grow overnight when I was away training in the last three years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry spoke up analyzing the situation \"No...they were around for a lot longer than that, they may have even been around since the first Digimon appeared. It's only after the D-Reaper was defeated that they gained fame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said pissed off to Ace \"If you had just killed him back there the X.A.C would be leaderless! How are you going to sleep at night knowing you let the man that butchers Digimon everyday live!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce groaned and said irritated \"It's not like that, I made a vow, I had a choice, either break a vow I made to my teachers or let some guy I'd never met  before live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said annoyed to Ace \"Do you even know the crisis' that could have been avoided if you had just killed him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said trying to break it up \"Guys calm down, we can stop him ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said raising his voice to Wendy \"We can't kill him because we don't stand a chance! If it's not his Elites that murder us it'll be Viola or Shaun's squad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said standing in between them \"Will you two just calm down!? We'll figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said faithfully \"I know we can do it, we just need more people this time so we can get past Viola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow spoke up sighing that she broke it up \"Maybe we could distract Viola or something?

Howling wind and striking thunder, fading darkness and shining light, burning fire and freezing ice, and finally changing earth, running water, and growing wood.

Finding ice, fire, and wind just after getting home is no small feat.\u201d The other teacher said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you mentor.\u201d Ace said with a slight bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeacher, is there a reason you called us?\u201d ace\u2019s renamon asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we will leaving our training to travel some and we might see you where the first kids got digimon.\u201d He said surprising them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever thought of this Viola Lambert person having a reason for joining the digimon killers?\u201d his other teacher asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat reason would she need when she kills digimon?\u201d snow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce was thinking for a minute like he was in her shoes before snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonal reason like she is looking for something.\u201d He said surprising them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you are catching to our method of thinking quicker than expected.\u201d One teacher said with a chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce, I think you would be best to see about getting her to turn on her team. Something may be hiding in the shadows.\u201d The other teacher said before the call ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d wendy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone made her who she is and why she is looking for the truth.\u201d He said before a bell chiming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at the clock to see the arrow moving from thunder spinning around before slowing down on wind. Ace smiled knowing who will be testing him and he looked at wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you are ready for the hurricane.\u201d Ace said and she chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease I\u2019m one with the wind so you won\u2019t beat me.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter I pass you up and win your test, I will be halfway done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind card glowed before floating up and there was a flash of light. Everyone was teleported to a green forest with faint breeze blowing. Ace used his trump card to make another set of clothes appeared on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t see them or feel them, but they are still there.\u201d He said to himself taking off the extra set of clothes before dropping them on the ground making a crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeighted clothes are good for training, but not used for testing unless for stamina or endurance like earth and wood.\u201d He said and they were sure surprised to see a medium-sized crater from the weight of the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce smiled before taking off his shirt revealing his muscles and there some blushing girls, but snow was slightly blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStare at me any longer pineapple head and I would get the feeling you would jump me when I\u2019m not looking.\u201d Ace said with a cool voice and rika turned away blushing both angry and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tamers were laughing while jerry was giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce was finally ready for the test after putting on ninja sandals and leaving the shirt off for rika\u2019s pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, what is the test?\u201d ace asked serious and ending the card\u2019s effect.</span></div></div>",

Cheater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said laughing \"I never said we weren't allowed to slow each other down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said trying his best not to cheat \"Cheating is for the weak and mischievous, I'm guessing you're the mischievous type.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said as they were almost at the top \"That's right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about to reach the pinnacle as they were closer than ever, Ace let out one final burst of speed he saved for the end as the stress of running this fast for so long slowed Wendy down he reached the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said looking down at Wendy who was now panting \"You shouldn't have held back, why didn't you use your full speed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said annoyed at losing \"Because that wouldn't have been fair, besides, a human could never beat me if I was using the full power of my speed. But I lost, so you can have my trust, my friendship and my power for your digivolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said thanking her \"Thanks... I have to admit even though this was the shortest test any elemental renamon has given me it was one of the hardest since you were only inches from beating me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said standing up straight stretching her back \"Yeah, you did well, also what would have happened if I 'did' beat you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce spoke up \"Then I would have trained some more, came back to you and would have taken your test again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said as the wind card appeared in her hand as she handed it over \"Then go with the wind, you won't lose with my power by your side with this card you can outrun the fiercest of Digimon...Or just dodge them if that's your thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said thanking her taking the card and putting it into his deck \"Thanks, I'll use it when I need to get out of a sticky situation or run to save someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began walking back admiring the forest and eventually they were back to everyone who were just talking to each other about appropriate things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika asked as Kenta watched closely \"Who won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy pointed to Ace shocking Frank and Snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Snow looked at each other making Frank ask Wendy amazed \"Did you not use your full power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shook her head \"No, that wouldn't have been fair, at least that's what I believe. If he didn't use his trump card I wouldn't use my full power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said still panting stretching out his arms \"It was a very close one, she almost beat me, plus she cheated a little bit but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said protesting \"It didn't even slow you down so there was no reason to mention it, besides you dodged my 'wisp of wind' attack just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said pulling out the wind card which was now glowing, showing it off victoriously to his partner renamon \"Look at it, how it glows with power, it's just magical isn't it? Using this card will give me the ability to move freely, dodge and sprint light as a feather far more effectively letting me keep up with almost anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis partner said amazed \"I didn't think you would beat her first time...

He pulled out four cards before laying them on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArmor of Stone.\u201d He said putting said card above the earth card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForest in Bloom.\u201d Putting the card above the wood card<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWall of Maelstroms.\u201d Doing the same to the water card<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cField of Thunder.\u201d He said like before to the thunder card<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this card need to have a name.\u201d he said putting the new wind card in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was thinking looking at the card before a card floating out of his deck case and he caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d he noticed it was his swift step card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you out of the case?\u201d he asked like he was talking to the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe palmed his forehead before putting it next to the new card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwift step grants me or rena-chan a boost in speed, but the card is going to evolve into a new step all together.\u201d He said explaining to the three renamon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a minor wind based card when I was younger, but still around I was in the hospital.\u201d He added and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cards started to slide to each other before they started to fuse into the true wind card and a flash happened. Ace was shaking his head from the flash before seeing the new card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlur step and it has all of the effect of the cards that made it.\u201d He said reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was the card you got from wendy?\u201d frank asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWind of the Four Seasons would work, but not likely.\u201d He said before putting the card above the wind card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive left to get, three to test, two to find, and one to train.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d kazu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLight, metal, ice, fire, and darkness to get their cards. Light, ice and fire has to test me. Have to find metal and darkness. Light needs to be trained.\u201d He explained as rika bopped kazu on the head sending him to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunderhead.\u201d She said as everyone was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce, put your cards away and set the table lunch will be ready soon.\u201d His mother said as he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakato and jerry, get the silverware. Henry, Rika, and both renamons grab the table.\u201d He said as they followed suit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKazu and kenta.\u201d He called them before they were saluting him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay out of the way.\u201d He said and they face vaulted while the others were laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwner, should we help?\u201d twilight asked ace and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyo, stand here at this corner.\u201d Ace said pointing to the corner closest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRika and your renamon get to your corners. Henry, do the same thing. Rena-chan, you and twilight stand in the middle of the table long ways.\u201d They did as they were told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank, snow, and wendy were watching on the sidelines. Ace started chanting something like a spell with hand seals before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull.\u201d He said as they started pulling the table making it expand longer and wider. He went back to chanting the spell making it easier for them to make the table expand. After a few minutes, the table was long enough for everyone to have a seat and not get cramped, but wide enough for the food for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce hold out his hand and the cards came to it like last time. He put them in the card case before looking at frank, snow, and wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt may seem like a waste to use your powers on something trivial like this, but I\u2019m going to need wendy on speed duty in case something really fragile falls and snow on glasses so the drinks can be cold without ice.\u201d He said and they nodded, but snow gives a slow nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything you need me to do?\u201d frank asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d He said giving frank a friendly smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was good and silverware was set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce, plates or bowls?\u201d his father asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBowls.\u201d He said before the door to the kitchen opened and bowls came flying out. Seeing them using, wendy her power to catch them while putting them in their spot on the table. She didn\u2019t miss one bowl and ace give her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d He said and she gave him a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome cutie.\u201d She said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened again; this time beer steins came out flying and ace caught them all like wendy did by using his speed. He handed them to snow who used a bit of her power to cool glasses without damaging them. After they were set on the table, the table was ready and looking perfect. Ace was counting something with his hand before stopping. The tamers and renamons were out of the way and with the other digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTable is ready.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, lunch is ready. \u201d his mother said as ace felt something moving and turned his head to see terriermon, guilmon, kazu, and kenta moving to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey felt something and look to see ace staring at them with a death glare. They see the demon mask from his crystal mode behind him laughing darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you are doing?\u201d he asked slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking our seat at the table?\u201d kazu asked slightly scared of the mask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrowed as the mask was showing its teeth making them cringe in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to wait like the rest of us or you four will be helping with combat training and it will be hell.\u201d He said in a low calm voice that scares them more than the mask and they nodded before running behind rika, her renamon, and his renamons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mask disappeared as his face returned to normal getting laughs from rika and the renamons. Wendy looks at him in thought. ~Maybe I can get him to teach me that so frank and snow can stop arguing.~ she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents came out with large bowls of food, but it\u2019s different ramen for some and other japanese dishes. The four tried again before getting caught by ace again and same result happened. Ace helped with the dishes before letting everyone sit down with the tamers sitting with their digimon and terriermon getting a booster seat. After a quick prayer over the food, bowls were getting filled and food was being eaten. Ace was feeling good to be home with friends, family, and people he can trust. It was close to an hour when all of the good was eaten and everyone was full to the limit. Ace and his renamon ate most of it and one guess why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed a home-cooked meal like that and it was perfect.\u201d He said leaning back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the dishes were put up in the dishwasher before his parents left to check on the house and left their partners to help with the mansion in case X.A.C. came to greet them. The table was put back to normal and they headed around back to the backyard where the training equipment was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I see the difference from three years in the tamers, Kazu, Kenta, and Jerry, did you actually train with your digimon?\u201d he asked like they were his soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry nodded confidently while the two boys were sweating nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour old master taught me some and your father help.\u201d She said and he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d He said before dragging the boys to some weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you will work with this set before working on the next set.\u201d He said and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRika, you can watch them while my renamon takes yours to train her light power.\u201d He said and they nodded before handing his partner the light card for training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHenry, you train takato in your martial arts before training him mine.\u201d Henry nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used the trump card and meditate for a short bit too slowly release the hidden power in his legs for him to go faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, I need you to help me train in speed training. Frank and snow can watch.\u201d He said and she nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to help you with your training.\u201d she said as they with frank and snow were teleported back into the green forest.</span></div></div>",

I almost forgot, you need to wear weights when doing this on your legs or around your ankles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said strapping weights to his ankles \"Now this makes sense to me. I remember when I used to run with weights on back when I was in training, seems like so long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said happily ready to begin \"Okay, when you are running I will be running alongside you, don't want to get rusty. This will be just like our little race except neither of us will be trying to outrun each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked interested \"Aren't you going to wear weights too? It'll help you improve faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said awkwardly \"I uh...I'm already wearing weights, they are just under my fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked intrigued \"When did you put those on? I didn't even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said looking down \"I've had them on this entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce's eyes widened and he asked befuddled \"Did you have those on in our race!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy said waving \"D-Details details, who cares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they began running back and forth to and from the mountain pinnacle with Frank and Snow watching, almost everyone was training in their own way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis was walking down a wide well lit corridor with many doors into different rooms, his four Elite soldiers followed, he walked down to the end of the corridor and signaled for his soldiers to wait outside as he opened a large unlocked iron door, he closed the door and walked into a warehouse filled with jeeps, cars, 4x4's and armored vehicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun was standing across from the door looking serious as Lewis approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis asked standing up straight \"Have you heard anything of the blue phoenix Frank Bellows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun shook his head, he then lit a cigarette and began smoking, Shaun then asked \"I heard about the attack, was it really a piedmon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis nodded, Shaun asked another question \"How the hell did it get into the city then? Isn't Gamma doing his job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said sighing \"I never know with Gamma, I can count on you and Viola but never on him, he only cares about his research, his scientists are worse, some of them are mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun said scratching his head \"Well Blackgate at least you didn't die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said narrowing his eyes \"Don't call me by my last name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun said jokingly \"What don't like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said annoyed at him \"I wish you were more like Viola, she doesn't try to piss me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun was about to make another joke until an angry, low voice interrupted them \"Lewis and Shaun in one room, a sight to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked over to see a black armored common soldier holding his rifle by the nozzle with both hands making the grip touch the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier was slightly shorter than Frank standing at around 5\" 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis asked interested \"You've got guts to just walk up to us recruit knowing who we are when we are in the middle of a -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier laughed interrupting him and spoke up loosening his helmet about to take it off \"You've got it all wrong, I'm no recruit. Let me introduce myself since I don't believe we've met...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier removed his helmet dropping it on the floor completely making Shaun and Lewis' eyes widen because of his appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier was actually a dark grey furred renamon who looked similar to Frank but with paler fur and no colour in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier continued introducing himself \"My name is Arthur Bellows, I am the Blue phoenix's younger brother, I am one of the X.A.C's commanders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said looking him up and down \"A Digimon working for the X.A.C?

Besides, it's not like it's any of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis spoke up as Shaun and Arthur stared each other down  \"I don't care about any of that, I just see the resemblance, you look just like the dog or fox or whatever I've been fighting for three years. I don't even know if he is still in the fight or even still breathes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said picking up his gun \"Oh he's alive, and I know that because he doesn't like giving up or letting his opponent get away, besides, I haven't killed him yet myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun asked looking him up and down copying what Lewis was doing earlier \"So you're a Digimon, what kind of power do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur explained \"I use my head.\" When he said that he chuckled to himself like he was hiding something or making a pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they both caught on, Lewis asked amazed \"You have telekinesis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said pointing at him \"Bingo, but it's more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had her started out making an orb of light using both hands while gathering light energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is easy.\u201d Twilight said holding an orb of light in one hand surprising rika\u2019s renamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d was asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are not ready to control their powers on their own, but their dna fuse can train in their powers.\u201d Ace\u2019s renamon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVixy will be our vaccine counterpart while kits will be the virus.\u201d She added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe training resumed as there was beams of light, orbs of light, and white fire punches and kicks. That was basic training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, the next step to use your light to create shields, bend light around you to create illusions, and create a skill of your own.\u201d She said as they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to work on their second level training with gusto. While they and ace were training, henry was training takato in martial arts, their digimon were training by fighting each other in a mock battle in the sparring ring, rika was watching kenta and kazu lifting the weight that ace instructed them to do, and jerry was training with her partner as they practice the lessons from ace\u2019s father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut your backs into it, you lazy bums.\u201d Rika said to the lazy boys as they finished another rep using the current weights<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRika, we have been at this for thirty minutes. Give us a break. We are not like ace or you.\u201d Kazu said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we get a break from this work out?\u201d kenta asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought it over as she was tapping her chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithout your digimon and this training, both of you would be dead weight and not only we are fighting rogue digimon, but X.A.C soldier who use guns and other things to kill digimon.\u201d She said and they hung their heads at the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring school, ace didn\u2019t really trust them as his friends while he was friends with the real tamers. Jerry was always hugging ace for saving her leomon from impmon\u2019s corrupted form after she heard that the knight digimon was him. He saw her as a sister figure while they were only children in their own families. Ryo was like an older brother to him, but he didn\u2019t trust him based on his history with rika. Kazu wasn\u2019t really much of a thinker based on his play style in the game and kenta was more of the thinker for both of them. Now ace was the leader with takato as his next in command if he wasn\u2019t around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can have 10 minutes before back on the grind.\u201d She said to the sweating boys who fell on the ground from their constant workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two will there all day if you don\u2019t show resolve and results when ace gets back from his training.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyo with his cyberdramon were watching this as it was going on. He had to keep his partner in control since he spent most of his time getting his monodramon back to his ultimate form. Soon the two boys got back to work doing rep on the next weight in the set. They have more determination and resolve to show that they are not dead weight. Rika smiled knowing ace would have done something to get them to show resolve or pump them full of spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~How much muscle do I want to get from ace?~ she thought about the question he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Lean and well-toned. Not as bulky as he is going to be.~ she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I could get bigger than normal figure since my figure is the average.~ was an afterthought, but that one will have to wait till when she and her renamon are in their room for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to watching them while trying to think about her workout with ace\u2019s help. The boy\u2019s arms are burning and they are sweating more than usual, but they are powering through the pain like strong boys. Ace is resting from running his 10th run from the mountain pinnacle with Wendy standing next to him slightly winded from their runs. The muscles on his legs are slowly growing bigger so he will get taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was impressive being able to run that long without a break.\u201d Frank said looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to train for long periods of time without breaks.\u201c ace said before looking at the weights on his ankles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuring that training, I had to wear a full set of weighted clothes.\u201d He added before taking them off. He felt the trump card still active and shook his head. He already taken off the full set of weighted clothes, but his teachers would usually make him wear weights that would equals several hundred pounds. If one were to guess, it had to be close to 500 pounds. His teachers tested his body\u2019s endurance and he can handle up to close 1000 pounds or on the mark. With his hidden power, 1 ton is the max his body can take before it gives out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the trump card, he made a weight vest and four wristbands on his wrists and ankles. Taking the ones on his wrists off first, he threw them off making them land next to the first crater and creating a new crater before throwing the ones on his ankles making the new crater the same size as the first one. Sighing at the thought of his teachers, he pulled the weighted vest off before chucking it with the wristbands. There was a loud thud and the crater grew from the weight making it bigger than the first one. The three renamon were gaping from the size of the crater before staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were sadistic trainers and the training was insane.\u201d He said folding his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the ankle weights back on before feeling a slight difference. Nodding in thought about the weights, he stood up before walking around getting a feel of the weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much are those weights\u201d snow asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst set, anything up to 500 pounds. The second set is around 1,000 pounds or at said mark.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything about a third set?\u201d wendy asked before ace gave them a deadpanned look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey tested my body\u2019s hidden power and the max is 2,000 pounds before it gave out on me\u201d he explained before getting ready to run again.</span></div></div>",

Shaun was in the room sitting across from the desk smoking as per usual. Shaun said puffing smoke \"When do you think they'll get here?\"<br>\r\nLewis shrugged out of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo elite soldiers were outside the door standing guard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola walked up to the door but the soldiers stood in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier on the left said shoving her back \"No visitors after hours, do you have an appointment with our Dictator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola said in an ice cold tone attempting to unnerve and intimidate them \"What's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elites shook their heads as she tried to walk past but they jumped in the way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola started twitching and said hissing \"Get out of my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier on the right said giggling \"If you don't have an appointment you can't see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Inside the office...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said quietly laughing to Shaun \"I think Viola's here, but I told the soldiers no one was allowed in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun said not amused \"You idiot she's going to ram them through the wall, you know what she's like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Outside the door...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola started raising her voice cracking her knuckles \"I order you to stand aside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier on the left said shaking his head \"We'd love to help you director Viola but we only take orders from the secondary Dictator. We can't let you in, orders are orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola said shaking with rage \"Final. Warning. Move. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers looked at each other and slowly backed off as she gently opened the door teething with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said laughing \"Hey was wondering when you would get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola ran up to his desk and narrowed her eyes staring into Lewis' soul \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers said in a bold voice because of the helmet magnifying the deepness of his tone \"Is everything all right in there sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said trying to calm her down \"It was just a prank, calm your tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola grabbed him by the scruff of his neck &amp; stayed silently staring him down making Lewis sweat bullets \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis stayed silent and she pushed him back down against his chair as Shaun said looking over at her \"Don't be too hard on him, he can't help it if he's a joker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola said pointing over to him \"I didn't ask for your opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun said lighting another cigarette \"Jeez you're so uptight, this is why we don't hang out, you remind me of my ex wife, a real control freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola said looking from Shaun and back to Lewis \"So this is who runs the X.A.C? ... I'm not impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said getting annoyed \"At least we ... I've got nothing to add, that went no where fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola stayed silent sitting down across from the desk folding her arms \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis stayed silent as they glared at each other, Shaun could feel the heat coming from both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awkward ten seconds of silence Shaun was about to say something as Lewis picked up a nano carbon fiber dagger while Viola smashed a bottle over and the two jumped up out of their chairs and held the blades to each others throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun jumped up yelling pushing them away from each other \"Whoa! Stop calm down guys! Don't let the stereotype of you two being ruthless murderous overlords turn true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola said dropping the bottle and sitting back down \"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis sighed and sheathed the expensive knife back into his pocket, he said sitting back down \"All this over a joke.

Everyone looked over to him interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man asked in the voice of the man Lewis had called in the alleyway \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything, I heard a lot of shouting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis asked interested \"Gamma! How did you get past my two soldiers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma spoke up walking in and sitting down \"They just let me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said scratching his head about it \"Never mind all that, I brought you all here to discuss about the Piedmon attack, first off... Gamma... How did it get past your forces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma spoke up nervously \"It wasn't my fault, the Digimon on the outskirts of Shinjuku launched a surprise assault, I guess one of them must have slipped by the gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis said putting down some sheets of paperwork \"Look at this mess, I've had to write this up to keep the press and authorities off of me because of you and your useless men screwing this up! Not to mention I almost got killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamma said laughing \"You wouldn't just die like that, fate wouldn't allow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola spoke aloud shocking everyone \"Dictator has a message for all of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's eyes widened knowing she isn't one to joke about things like this <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun muttered \"D-Dictator? The primal Dictator? The one that is said to not exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola nodded and continued \"The primal Dictator has ordered the death or execution of Frank Bellows and anyone assisting him, no matter what they must all be killed off.\"</span></div></div>",

He fell to his knees breathing hard and snow was helping him stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can lean on me.\u201d She said and he did as told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, when I\u2019m done with training I want a rematch.\u201d He said and they were looking at him slightly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? You have my card.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo test my speed after releasing my hidden power in my legs and my control.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to see the speed of the wind and surpass it. My body has been adjusting to the hidden power since we left our teachers and only my limbs are what\u2019s left.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank, don\u2019t underestimate me and don\u2019t assume I\u2019m an easy win. You will lose if you do.\u201d Ace said looking at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portal to the others opened up and they walked out of the forest of wind card.

I mean who would put 2,000 to 3,000 pounds of weight on a kid and expect him to handle it.\u201d He said shocking everyone there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already had to take off the second set before finishing 100 runs to the mountain. I barely felt a difference from the weights wendy gave me, but that is only for my control issue.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was hard at first, but we managed it.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard? I had to force my body to move and it puts too much strain on me. 2,000 pound is the limit on my body for the forced power.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had at least 1,000 on each limb and 2,000 on your torso. You had it worse than me. If you didn\u2019t have all that data we have been collecting since we met, then you would have been stuck.\u201d He said dropping another bomb on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf 2,000 was your limit, then what is it going to be after your power has been released?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want to find out, but I have to guess. Either twice or three times as much of that.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething came across his mind as his eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get the feeling that we will have to be careful around those four leaders.\u201d Ace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d rika asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we get caught helping frank and his friends, it might kill us.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe younger tamers are staying here for training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was thinking of something while everyone else was surprised except for his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might be too soon for that big of a change.\u201d Ace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big of a change?\u201d frank asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCity wide area.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only done small changes compared to this.\u201d His partner said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to do something a little bigger.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d snow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsing invisibility.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike becoming invisible people?\u201d kazu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a way or invisible digimon.\u201d Ace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his watch before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for me to get dinner ready.\u201d He said before walking to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need help?\u201d wendy asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Just leave everything to me.\u201d He said before using the wind card on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s best if we stay here and away from table.\u201d Rika said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d kazu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyan used his new speed card so you would be in the way.\u201d Ace\u2019s renamon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes passed before a blur shot out of the kitchen and going around the table. The table was being set within seconds and it went back into the kitchen. Another five minutes passed before it shot out again around the table once leaving a big covered silver platter on the table and going back into the kitchen. Kazu looked at the platter before looking at kitchen waiting to see if ace would come out to stop him. A few minutes passed and nothing happened as of yet, but he stayed put to see if he would pop out again. Ace came out putting some more dishes on the table with food on them and everyone had plates instead of bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can come the table.\u201d He said as he was going back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the table to see different food in bowls and they looked at the covered platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what is under there.\u201d Takato said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne way to find out.\u201d Kazu said lifting the lid of the platter reveal a pig\u2019s head with an apple in its mouth. There was surprised screams in the room and ace was laughing in the kitchen. Not even his partner knew about this and ace came out with another covered platter. Using the still active trump card, he made it fade away and teleport it to the second dictator with a note: \u2018You owe me and here a surprise\u2019. It was covered so it wouldn\u2019t ruin the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!!\u201d rika asked as everyone else was trying to regain their nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith me, you will never know what is going to happen next.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the lid of the platter to reveal a cooked chicken big enough for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need to use some old equipment I got from old friends before I left for my training.\u201d ace thought out-loud. Rika and the others aside from frank and his friends looking at him surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean those five?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded before letting them sit down and he was head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStaff, Two pistols, two Blasters, a whip, and another staff.\u201d He said knowing who gave him what weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are really taking this seriously.\u201d Henry said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have too so I can keep your families safe along with mine and prevent frank with his friends getting killed.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents can get your families and the younger tamers here, but we are the real fighters here. I will have to train my use of the trump card to make sure that none of us gets killed by them.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate dinner in peace and ace went to wash the dishes before going upstairs to bed with his partner. All of them followed him upstairs to their rooms and the three got a room close to ace\u2019s room by chance. They went to sleep as ace\u2019s body namely his legs were still growing stronger so he will be faster. It was a peaceful night for all of them.</span></div></div>",

Are they all training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow nodded but then spoke up putting the toast down \"Everyone except me, you and Frank, and some other obvious people like your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked even more interested \"Frank? Why is he not training? Does he think he's too good for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said laughing \"Don't get me wrong, Frank is very powerful and he knows it, but he wouldn't be stupid enough to sit out training just out of confidence, he's out to meet a friend in Southern Shinjuku for some information...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said slightly worried \"So he's in Southern Shinjuku then? ... he should be fine, Southern shinjuku has hardly any X.A.C presence, out of curiosity who is he meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow began explaining \"You might have to keep this a secret but ... he's meeting an old supplying friend of his who is actually a X.A.C soldier himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said shocked \"No way! Is he positive it's not a trap?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow spoke up bogging down his concern \"Of course he'll be fine, the person he's meeting with has known Frank for years, he would never back-stab him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said sweating still slightly worried and suspicious \"Where are they meeting and when?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow said thinking carefully \"I don't actually know, Frank likes to keep these things secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said looking down \"I don't like this, I don't like this one bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Meanwhile...</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was in Southern Shinjuku in a dark, musty warehouse full of metal shipping crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank muttered to himself checking his pocket watch \"Where the hell is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a long time, Frank ...\" said a voice in the darkness, a common looking black armored X.A.C soldier walked out from behind a shadowy crate and said with his gun in his right hand \"It'll be the usual fee for any documents, weapons or information you might be looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said sighing \"Don't just appear out of nowhere fashionably late you'll give me a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier said laughing in a bold voice since the helmet amplified it making him sound more intimidating \"Can't take a joke can you? Now, before we get down to any serious business ... I will require the usual fee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said reaching into his pocket and pulling out some notes \"Right, seventeen thousand yen. Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier took the money and put it away with his left hand keeping a tight grip on the rifle in his right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier said opening his arms valiantly \"Right, let's get down to business, what do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked grinning \"Where are all four of the X.A.C chairmen going to be for the next month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier said shaking his head \"Can't tell you that unless you give me specific names, who are we talking about here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said speaking up handing him photos of the four people \"Viola Lambert, Professor 'Gamma', Shaun Ryan and finally Lewis Blackgate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier said making a joke out of it \"So you said \"chairmen\" right? Viola is a woman ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey awkwardly stared at each other before the soldier burst out laughing pissing off Frank<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said gritting his fangs \"I don't need your jokes, I already payed you so tell me what I want to know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier said calming down his laughter \"All right all right, let's begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier pulled out for portfolio style folders filled with classified information on the four people in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said putting the documents in a small briefcase \"Thank you very much, now Peacemaker if you don't mind me asking aren't you taking a big risk helping me out just like the good old days of fighting the X.A.C?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier now identified by the nickname \"Peacemaker\" froze in thought for a few seconds and then spoke up \"Don't worry about it, fighting against evil is all that matters to me ... now I need to go, call me again if you need any more help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded as they parted ways as Frank walked through the streets carrying the briefcase as the sun was glimmering up over the horizon as it was still relatively early in the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knows the trump card is still active and he hold out his hand over his right eye before sliding it over to his ear making a scouter from dragon ball z appear on his face. Taking it off and looking at it, he sighed before making it fade before destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of my body has released its hidden power and my legs are still in the process of it.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you force it?\u201d snow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will either speed it up or release all of it at once and I will have to do control training to get it under control.\u201d He said eating a few bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the training that bad?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just annoying.\u201d He said sighing before finishing his breakfast and went to make some tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy legs will be done about tomorrow morning or sometime during the night.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny reason why you haven\u2019t ended the card yet?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraining my use in it. Each change I make uses a certain amount of energy from me. Small changes like making my sets of weight appear is a small change. Turning a person invisible is another one, but a group is a small-medium change.\u201d He explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is a big change?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike an area change. A city wide change might be one and a planet sized change is one step further.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t done a change that size because of the risk involved.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the of those two?\u201d she asked wanted to know<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUses too much energy or it kills me in the process.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly dropped her toast as she gasped from that little note and he looked grim at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo far it has been easy with the small changes, but I have to make bigger changes.\u201d He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMega levels are slowly becoming easy and I remember a machinedramon that was more annoying than anything else.\u201d He added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe sparring with you three can give me a challenge.\u201d He said and she smiled since he wasn\u2019t calling her weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drink his tea before getting another cup and pour some for her and he pour some in his cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the tea.\u201d She said and he nodded as they finished their tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the cups before washing them and put them in the dishwasher. He gave her a hug before gave her a small peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for talking to me, Snow-chan.\u201d He said with a cute voice and she blushed before turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Kawaii!~ she thought in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left chuckling at her blush planning to do some training on his own. Whistling a tune, he walked around back where the others are training like yesterday. They saw him too the back of the house where a backdoor is and snapped his fingers making a white door appear. He opened it before going inside and the door vanished. That surprised them except for ace\u2019s partner who might know what ace is planning to do in that room he went into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave him be for now. He will be training on his own.\u201d His partner said before going back into the light world with twilight and rika\u2019s renamon. Wendy was already in the wind world, but she will see ace\u2019s return from his room. They just went back to training as ace went to a cabinet and opened it to reveal several weapons. Several guns and two staffs in the cabinet waiting to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour wait is over.\u201d Ace said putting the staffs on his back and the guns on his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a shooting range, he grabbed his two semi-automatic pistols, which are like dante\u2019s guns, ivory and ebony, but he added 26 inches to the barrel, made them both black, and added some parts from alucard\u2019s gun, the jackal, to handle the recoil. Doubling the size of the mag, the weight would counter the weight of the barrel. He had his target, a X.A.C. soldier, in sight before aiming at the torso and unleased hell on the target. Anchoring his left foot as he moved his right foot back, he fired near 100 bullets in that one bullet storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter \u2018refilling\u2019 the mag for both pistols, he put them back on his sides before pulling the two blasters from his friends in space. Basically, they are the same model from star fox assault and he doesn\u2019t need two hands for one blaster. His blasters have power and speed from both fox and falco\u2019s blasters. He has a new target and it is a giant bug alien, but it a moving target. Charging one blaster, the shot is glowing red before orange and he fired the blast. It took a second before it made the bug explode and sent him skidding a few feet from the station of his shooting range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is one nasty recoil.\u201d Ace said before putting the blasters next to the pistols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the training ring, he pulled a staff from his left shoulder and it was krystal\u2019s staff, but it changed to fit ace\u2019s style. The gold spearhead of the staff changed to a trident head with a citrine in the center, the neck of the staff where the blue and purple were changed to red and yellow, and the key part of the staff was made a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept the original form of her staff in its small size in the jewel to hide it and going to give it to the rightful owner when he sees her again. He starts working on the stances with his staff before looking like he turned pro with it. He put it on his back before grabbing the other staff, which is a metal mic staff that can work like any other mic on a stand. Putting the mic on his shoulder, walk over to a stage with a karaoke machine and started to select a song to practice his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic: Still Alive by Lisa Miskovsky<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have changed<br>\r\nI have changed<br>\r\nJust like you<br>\r\nJust like you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor how long<br>\r\nFor how long<br>\r\nMust I wait?<br>\r\nI know there's something wrong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour concrete heart isn't beating<br>\r\nAnd you tried to<br>\r\nMake it come alive<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo shadows<br>\r\nJust red lights<br>\r\nNow I'm here to rescue you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChorus<br>\r\nOh I'm still alive<br>\r\nI'm still alive<br>\r\nI cannot apologize no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh I'm still alive<br>\r\nI'm still alive<br>\r\nI cannot apologize no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo silent<br>\r\nNo violence<br>\r\nBut inside my head<br>\r\nSo loud and clear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're screaming<br>\r\nYou're screaming<br>\r\nCover up with a smile I've learned to fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust sunshine<br>\r\nAnd blue sky<br>\r\nIs this all we get<br>\r\nFor living here<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome fire<br>\r\nCome fire<br>\r\nLet it burn and love come racing through<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChorus<br>\r\nOh I'm still alive<br>\r\nI'm still alive<br>\r\nI cannot apologize no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh I'm still alive<br>\r\nI'm still alive<br>\r\nI cannot apologize no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI learn to lose<br>\r\nI learn to win<br>\r\nTurn my face against the wind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will move fast<br>\r\nI will move slow<br>\r\nTake me where I have to go<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChorus<br>\r\nOh I'm still alive<br>\r\nI'm still alive<br>\r\nI cannot apologize no<br>\r\n(I'm still alive)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChorus<br>\r\nOh I'm still alive<br>\r\nI'm still alive<br>\r\nI cannot apologize no <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the song, he nodded before putting it back on his back and changed into his gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should talk a walk into the other parts of the city and see about testing my pistols with explosive extreme armor piercing rounds.\u201d He said with a low tone before using the trump card to conceal his blasters and mic staff until he needs them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the door and walked out of the room. The others stopped training to see ace walking out whistling like before and the door vanished again. He started to walk towards the bridge before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRena-chan, how is the training going?\u201d he asked his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are on the second level.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey can relaxed while we go on a walk into the parts of the city.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like causing some chaos for those digimon killers.\u201d He added with a weird smile.</span></div></div>",

I think I know what you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said sighing annoyed \"Do you have to follow me when I wanted to do this alone? That's the whole point I sneaked out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said laughing \"What makes you think you would be able to beat Viola this time around? Why would it be any different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said pushing him out of the way \"Because of three years of training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce argued smartly \"And who's to say she hasn't been doing the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said getting mad \"I'm not worried about that, as long as her eyes don't turn red I'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked interestedly \"Her eyes turn red? What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said scratching his head \"Years back when I fought her I would be almost evenly matched with her until her eyes turned red, I don't know what it is or how she does it but when her eyes turn red I don't stand a chance, her speed and power turn up to ridiculous levels and she beats me pretty much within an inch of my life. But after those three years of training I'm sure I can beat her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said folding his arms following him \"I think you're overconfident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said laughing \"Everyone says the same thing. I'm known for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a twenty minute walk they reached the compound which was out of the way and a decent distance away from any civilian activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said cutting down the iron chain fence \"Don't get in my way, just kill any soldiers you come across and if you see Viola or Lewis tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked confused \"How do you know Lewis will be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said finishing off the fence with his katana Flashfire \"Because a friend of mine I have working in the X.A.C gave me a few documents which I read up on, he's here on official business. I'll say it again, back me up or don't help at all, get in my way and I might hit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce sighed as they entered the facility, Frank slashed down the iron doors and slashed at the air sending blasts of flame sweeping across the area burning and knocking down all the present soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said sheathing his sword \"This is too easy, back in the day these guys used to be tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued on through the facility calmly as strangely there was no alarm set off or any signs of anymore soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce stopped at a door sensing something coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said stopping Frank from opening the door \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked annoyed \"What the hell is it now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frank Bellows...\" said a voice over an intercom, Frank's eyes widened, he spoke up \"Lewis Blackgate... I haven't heard your voice in three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of Lewis continued \"You must have someone working on the inside to have had this good of a break to find me so defenseless... or am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis continued from an unknown location \"I have someone to deal with you, ARTHUR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" Said a voice from behind Frank and Ace, they turned around to see a soldier in full common black armor complete with gas mask and holding his rifle in the same position as before when he was speaking with Shaun and Lewis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis spoke up one last time \"Kill. Them. If you can help it take Ace Kamen alive, the kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intercom switched off as Ace and Frank had a stare off with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur spoke up in a deep voice as the helmet amplified boldness \"So you are Frank and Ace Kamen? I don't believe we've met Ace, but Frank Bellows? We've already been introduced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked narrowing his eyes \"Who the hell are you? I don't remember you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur continued \"You know me all too well actually, you see...\" His voice turned sinister and cockily as he removed his helmet shocking them both \"I am your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's eyes widened, Frank said shocked \"So you must be... Arthur Bellows, my long lost brother. Why are you helping the X.A.C?! You're a Digimon yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur laughed gleefully \"To get back at you of course. Now, no more talk, Lewis is leaving this facility as I keep you both here, but I'm going to do more than that, Frank... this compound will be your memorial.\" As he said that he raised both of his hands at them and clenched them into tight fists choking both Ace and Frank before they could react, Arthur said throwing them through an iron wall \"My power is mind over matter, now come...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said getting up sore from the impact \"Ace... get out of here and do whatever you want, this is my fight since he is my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce protested getting up stretching from the crash \"I'm not leaving you alone like this -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank stopped him drawing his katana \"Ace... Please let me do this alone. You would do the same if it was your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said walking off to find some soldiers to practice his guns on \"Fine, fine, just don't take too long and don't get killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce thought to him through his mind (See if you can get him to join us if possible)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank thought back (That's the plan... but how?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur glided through the hole in the wall and landed gracefully in a dust cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said impressed \"So you can glide with your power, amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said grinning evilly \"I can do more than just glide blue phoenix, I hope you don't hold back against me or you really will die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked narrowing his eyes \"If I agree to fight you, you must tell me one thing... Lewis Blackgate is not really here is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said laughing \"You figured it out, no he's not here, he's in a disclosed location, only the three directors and his own group of elite soldiers know where he is hiding, now as I've already said before, enough talk, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get up and fight me, brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank got to his feet dizzy and in pain, he summoned Flashfire again and said narrowing his eyes \"You're pissing me off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said turning around and raised his left hand and clenched his fist as a large iron wall was ripped apart and crushed by pure telekinetic energy into a heavy chrome ball \"Let me show you my power, fall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur threw the massive ball at Frank effortlessly as Frank had to think fast, he jumped to the left while putting up a wall of blue flame the ball passed through it smashing holes and tearing down walls all through the facility while on fire from the firewall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said jumping up to the roof through the holes Arthur made as a few groups of Arthur's common X.A.C soldiers watched \"Catch me if you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said bounding up to the roof in one jump by using his psychic energy \"You can't run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank jumped back across after he landed towards where Arthur was landing, Arthur wasn't expecting this trick and quickly put up his sword to block as Frank swung down with massive force equal to three tons putting all of his might into one swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur blocked Frank's attack but was sent spinning back fifty meters through a window and into an abandoned office block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank jumped through the window following him Arthur jumped back up and looked pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank knew something bad was going to happen as Arthur roared with both hands pointed at Frank, Frank tried to run but then he clenched fists crushing Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was floating in mid air with his limbs and chest being crushed and twisted, Frank screamed in pain as Arthur kept crushing with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank summoned his sword and threw it straight at Arthur as he was forced to stop the attack and jumped to the right but the blade barely slashed across his left arm, Arthur grunted in pain as Frank got back up summoning his sword again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said grinning impressed he was still standing with half of his limbs badly torn and some of his ribs being broken \"You're still alive, I've only seen such toughness in Viola, why are you so resilient?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said barely able to stand pointing his blade at him with his right hand \"I regenerate my wounds, what happens if you whack or slice an open flame? It just comes back right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said impressed again \"You could be of great use to the X.A.C Frank, why bother resisting? Leave your other Digimon friends to die and join us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said disgusted as dark blue flames appeared around him and he had a fire in his eyes \"You already know my answer, brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank charged at him dragging his blade across the ground making sparks fly, he was a blue ball of fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur roared clenching his left hand but Frank didn't stop charging even with his body being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur couldn't believe he had so much resilience not even being fazed by the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur jumped up through the roof again like before dodging Frank's charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank stopped and ripped a hole through the roof joining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very windy at the top of this building as platoons of soldiers gathered around to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur yelled in rage with his left hand out feeling the fatigue from using too much psychic energy \"Why are you insistent on helping these scummy monsters live?! Just join us! It will be far easier for you in the long run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank yelled back as they both rested to recharge a bit after having made a mess of half of the facility \"I don't care what reasons or what you have to say to stick up for the X.A.C but don't feed me this bullshit that you don't have a choice or 'it's easier' this way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey charged at each other clashing blades in a power struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur and Frank's blades sent sparks flying in the clash, they bounded off of each other as Arthur growled clenching his left hand into a fist again, Frank knew what was happening as he jumped up over the grappling invisible energy and landed on Arthur! Frank held his blades with both hands pushing downwards into his chest, Arthur was pushing the blade back up trying to turn it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur gritted his teeth and growled in rage \"Y-you dog, so lucky, you'll die like the dog you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank roared as he put all of his might into the blade pushing down \"I won't let you or Lewis win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur jumped out of the way at just the right moment as Frank completely destroyed the roof of the block by stabbing his sword into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank dashed after Arthur as he tried to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank yelled blasting streams of flame after him which he harmlessly curved around him \"How much energy does that psychic power of yours take out of you huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was really feeling the pressure and the stress of having used so much power, he hid behind a wall in a dark alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank landed as the soldiers didn't bother fighting out of fear they backed away making a path for Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said pushing a soldier out of the way looking for Arthur \"That's what I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank saw a thick trail of blood leading into the alleyway, Arthur looked down and saw the trail and thought to himself (Shit, SHIT!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank put up both of his hands about to unleash hell into the alleyway, Arthur immediately bolted out slashing his chest on the way out \"Gotta go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank held his chest as his broken bones were slightly sticking out from the wound, Frank chased after Arthur as they were now both weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur bounded up the side of a tower with some of the last of his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank followed jumping from side to side using his sword to ascend by sticking it into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur yelled having regained some of his power clenching both of his hands into fists stretching his arms up high above him \"You'll die here! <b>KNOW MY WRATH BROTHER!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank stopped climbing not knowing what he was doing as the tower started to crack and crumble all over from the strain and force of Arthur's power, Frank yelled in shock struggling to hold on as the tower started to tilt left and right as windows were smashing into pieces all over \"Are you insane?! You'll kill us both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur made a throwing motion yelling like a madman as the supports holding the tower snapped and tilted to his right, they both screamed as the tower came down with them, Arthur jumped off slashing the air with his sword in pure rage aiming for Frank<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank looked up and saw Arthur coming down, Arthur plunged his sword into his left shoulder on the way down hanging onto him by his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank screamed trying to kick him off, Arthur ripped out his sword and kick jumped off of him leaving him to fall with the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank clutched his shoulder, Frank was now a bloody mess and looked like he was near death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank with the final remnants of his strength jumped off of the tower and shot streams of flame downwards towards the ground propelling him into the air like a jet-pack, he landed on top of an office block building, Arthur appeared in front of him laughing, Arthur licked the blood off of his sword and held it high above his head pointing down at Frank who couldn't even move or barely breathe anymore, Arthur had won \"Any last words, dear brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank stuttered out in unbearable agony \"J-just... tell me... \"why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur stumped by the question narrowed his eyes and turned serious \"So you want to know... why I do what I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence as it started to rain Frank's pool of blood grew larger due to the water, Arthur swallowed and spoke up barely hurt at all \"Years ago when we were a family, my father, mother, everyone; no one payed attention to me, no one loved me, it was all you and that bitch of a sister Sadie! <b>I HATE</b> you so much for so long, just for existing, being alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder arced across the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce saw Frank from across a hundred meters from the top of another building, Ace quickly used his trump card but it was malfunctioning! Ace made a mad dash for him \"No, I won't make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said glumly \"And now... I'll end that cycle of you living, then my sister... then my family if any more of them live... then ALL Digimon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank narrowed his eyes and stuttered out with the last of his strength \"I won't... let... you do this! Listen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur screamed spinning his sword for the final blow \"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b>I. WIN.</b></font></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank closed his eyes... \"UGH!\" The sound similar to that of a bullet hitting flesh was heard as Frank opened his eyes Arthur fell to the ground, Frank looked up and saw a soldier standing there after shooting him in the back of the head with a heavy tranquilizer, the soldier said as his voice revealed himself to be Peacemaker, walking away \"You owe me for this kid...\"</span></div></div>",

He went outside to burn the blood off the grass, bridge, the mat leading to the gate. He left to deal with the rest of it and he was thinking of something while controlling his anger that was growing. Seeing more blood, he lifted his hand while mentally commanding the blood to come to him. All of frank\u2019s blood heading them here from the fight gathered above ace\u2019s hand before it burned away with an invisible flame. He sighed before walking back through the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne mess cleaned up.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought came to him and he heard what Arthur said. This made his blood simmer before walking through the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~We\u2019ll see about that, Arthur. We\u2019ll see.~ He thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce came back across the bridge and walked pass the other training tamers to an area used for what he is about to do. Rika was worried about him when she saw the look in his eye or felt the vibes he was giving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t pass that line.\u201d Ace said to them who were looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce?\u201d Jeri asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to vent some stress and I need to train alone before having a talk with frank.\u201d He said in a dark tone that carried a serious edge meaning no funny business and he glared at Kazu mostly who nodded his head scared of what ace could to him when mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking farther into the area, a barrier appeared to protect others from harm and ace stood at the X. Ace started to tense up his body as his muscles started to get bigger from expanding and there was an air of power coming from him. His renamon appeared with the others seeing the barrier knowing he had to do this. There was a faint aura appearing around him as he was forcing his power into his body making his muscles expand. He was slowly growing taller as his body was growing to its max muscle limit and size. He was gritting his teeth from the pain of forcing his body, but he able to withstand it. Letting out a built up scream, his body jumped to its maxed size and muscles making him look like a bodybuilder plus the same size as rika and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that your full power, ace?\u201d rika asked looking at the muscles with staring eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of my hidden power.\u201d He said with a cool tone to make her shiver from the feeling of power around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you want to jump me now and make me yours, but I have to do this.\u201d He said and she turned away becoming hinata red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazu was staring at the now hulk out ace and he was rethinking about what he was going to say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce jumped high into the air and a hole formed so he could jump out before slamming his fist into the X. The ground rumbled before giving away making a growing crater deeper as it grows away from the house because of the barrier around him. The speed of the crater getting deeper is faster than it growing in size. The house did shake a little before wendy and snow helping frank appeared thinking they were found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought someone found us.\u201d Frank said still recovering from the fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d snow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was venting some anger, snow.\u201d Ace said from the crater and they finally noticed it was still spreading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were shocked to see it and they heard his voice, but did not see his body so they walked closer to the barrier. When they could see him, they were surprised to see a maxed out ace standing in the crater he made with one punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank, we need to talk about what happened and I need to teach you a lesson.\u201d He said to him just as the crater was slowing down to a stop. The crater looked like a bowl at 500 feet around and maybe 1,000 foot deep from the looks of it. Ace jumped out of it before the ground was being repaired by his trump card and the barrier faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d takato asked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Ace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long will you last this time?\u201d his partner asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTill I feel like frank learned his lesson.\u201d He said before the ring of card appeared floating in the air and an black arrow above the top card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time for another test and another card.\u201d Ace said before the ring started to spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gaining speed before maintaining it for a few minutes and finally slowing down. It stopped on the Fire card. Ace smiled before cracking his neck, back, and knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI expected this somehow.\u201d He said before they were teleported to the fire world, which was bright sunny day on top of a building in the city and a ring of fire around frank and ace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA test for me to win and a lesson for you to learn if I have to beat it into you.\u201d Ace said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy and snow were looking at them mostly worried about frank since he was close to being killed by his own brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo frank, name the test.\u201d Ace said to frank feeling really confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were waiting for his answer as ace folded his arms on his chest.</span></div></div>",

What I want to know is why you care so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce answered \"Because we are working together, you and me are allies, because of that you just don't go off on your own and do whatever the hell you feel like at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said pointing the sword at him \"I had no choice, if you had a brother you would understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce protested \"It's not just that, in all the time I've known you you've been brushing people off and doing pretty much everything by yourself, you have to stop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said raising his voice as the soldier was recording everything in his helmet cam with audio \"Like I care, that's just the way I am, I prefer to pull my own weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce argued raising his voice as well \"If you would just swallow your stubborn pride and work with us then maybe I could have helped you beat down your brother and this would never have happened and you wouldn't be in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank began becoming hoarse due to raising his voice so much in his weakened state, he spoke up \"His fighting style is a counter to mine 'and' yours, he fights with psychic ranged combat, you fight like me, we both like getting close up and ripping people apart, our ranged attacks are weaker than his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said making a good point \"With the speed Wendy gave me I don't think he would have been able to hold me down, you are more of a beefy type while I'm a jack of all trades. Besides you almost beat him by yourself, adding me in then we would have won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank yelled popping a vein \"I didn't ask for your opinion! Now onto the test... the rules are no dying, no killing, fight like your life depends on it, last man standing wins! Also...\" Frank began calming down slightly \"There is something you should know about me and my family; the Bellows family, the more emotional we become, the more powerful we become, that's the main reason my brother beat me down, he was raging and full of hatred while I was only holding myself back because I couldn't bring myself to kill my own brother or at least hurt him. Clearly he had a different mindset. That's why I think he beat me. And if that friend of mine Peacemaker didn't interfere I would be dead by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked interested \"Your friend? He looked like a normal soldier to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank spoke up seriously \"I heard his voice saying I owe him, it was definitely Peacemaker, if you see him don't attack him since he's on our side. Now back to the test...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was clutching his sword Flashfire in his right hand while Ace became tense as they were about to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank asked calmed down \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce nodded, they dashed at each other as Ace threw a punch while Frank slashed vertically downwards with his sword, sparks were flying from the sword as it seared with heat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said as they were in a power struggle as Ace's fist was now bleeding slightly from the cut \"I won't let you win so easily, even in my weakened state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce threw a punch with his left hand while his right was holding the sword back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank drew back his sword and slashed at his wrist drawing more blood, he only scathed half an inch into his flesh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce's punch landed on Frank's blade as he blocked it against his chest knocking him back crashing into the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank jumped back up with shards of concrete stuck in his back, there were about five of them jagged inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said as he was bleeding from his back and Ace was bleeding from his fists and wrist \"This is just the beginning, get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank began dragging his sword along the ground making small sparks, then he started running as the sparks became flames mixed in with embers, this was one of the traits of his sword Flashfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce began sprinting but was faster than Frank due to his training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they became close enough to each other Frank slashes across horizontally leftwards as Ace used both his hands to block it the fire burned into Ace making him flinch and shake from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank drew the sword back and thrust his sword forward as Ace jumped back, Ace said as his wounds became gashes bleeding much more than before \"That hurts quite a bit, but now I'm serious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce used the wind card and dashed at Frank and before Frank could react he grabbed him by the arm and threw him down smashing him through the roof, Ace looked around ready for him but he could not see him anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence Frank's arms appeared beneath him tearing through the floor pulling him down into the complex with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce reacted by uppercutting him through the roof as they both got to the roof Frank landed gracefully flipping over, Frank said as his sword burned \"As I said this was only the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce charged at him with great speed from the card as Frank readied his blade with both hands, he sidestepped him and slashed downwards with his left arm slashing deep into Ace's back, Ace fell over from the pain stopping in mid charge and got back up again but this time with a large slash wound across his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said as his sword dripped with Ace's blood \"Neither of us have used many of our powers yet, I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said clenching his fists in pain \"You're cockier than I remember, if you fought like this against your brother you might have been able to beat him and defend yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said sadly \"I could never do that Ace, not unless I was as angry as I was earlier, he's family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both charged at each other again as Frank lunged in with his sword in his right hand as Ace dodged around it he grabbed him by the neck and choked him, Frank spun his sword around just like his brother did to execute him and plunged it down, Ace jumped out of the way seeing it out of the corner of his eye, Frank got up choking as Ace narrowed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce charged at him again but this time a little slower and more controlled, he grabbed Frank's sword and punched him down three times, Frank grabbed his hand and kicked him back, he got up again and readied his blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both getting tired now but Frank more so than Ace, despite Ace's wounds on his fists, wrist and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said breathing heavily feeling his recent wounds from his brother getting worse \"You're doing well so far, but for how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said getting tired as well \"Thanks, but I still have to make you see the errors you've made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Ace charged each other one last time as Frank went to lunge again the wound on his arm ripped open making him yell in pain falling down, then Ace punched him in the face dead on sending him back dropping his sword, Ace punched his face four more times before Frank said stopping him \"Again, you're doing well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked looking down on him \"Do I have to beat you more or are you going to try to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said ramming him off of him and with a burst of speed grabbed his sword \"Make me. Pass the test then we'll talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was now covered in blood from his wounds and Ace's punches to the face combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank said ripping the ground with his sword charging again making sparks fly \"Come at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce ran at him as Frank slashed again he jumped over the blade, landed behind him and kicked him in the back making him drop his sword again, then Ace blocked his punch and threw his own punch to his chest knocking him back down, Frank got to his feet only for Ace to jab him a few times in the jaw, Ace then axe kicked him down before he could react and began beating his face in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten seconds of beating Frank coughed up blood and said about to lose consciousness \"You...pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank weakly handed him the card, as Ace took the card Frank's breathing became erratic and he closed his eyes and fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said laying him down \"Thank you, Frank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring of fire dissipated as Wendy and Snow walked in to help Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow asked Ace worried \"Was this really the best time for the test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce answered looking up at the sky as his hidden power left him and his body turned back to normal, his clothes were torn and burned or just covered in blood \"Yes, this was the perfect time, sure he could have not been weakened and injured but if I just done it later it wouldn't have the same impact of him learning that he has to rely on his friends sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked back through the portal and put Frank to bed again for another rest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the card, he sighed before holding out his hand and the elemental cards appeared. He felt the wounds fixing themselves before switching into another set of clothes and going through hand seals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClean and repair.\u201d He said as the spell took his gear and went to fix it and steam clean it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to walk before he started to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce!\u201d rika called out running to hm, but his partner caught him just before he hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of his energy was rage induced so he has to sleep it off.\u201d She said as she had seen it before during their training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIce and light is left of the current group, but light isn\u2019t ready yet.\u201d He said in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s put you to bed, ace.\u201d She said putting the cards in his deck case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took him to their room as she vanished leaving the tamers alone, but rika was still thinking about ace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can take a break from training for the two fighters are sleeping, but the two dead weight can keep at it.\u201d Rika said looking at Kazu and Kenta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Kazu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I had the feeling that you were going to say something to make ace glare at you and kenta needs more training.\u201d she said with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys sighed as the other tamers were laughing at them as they got back to working out on the weight sets. Ryo noticed her face and he knows that she is worried for their main tank of a leader, but she walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRika, I know we haven\u2019t have the best relationship in the past.\u201d He said as she looked at him with a blank face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that you have feelings for him and you need to tell him.\u201d He added as takato and henry nodded agreeing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyo, can you watch these two to match that they aren\u2019t slacking off?\u201d she asked him pointing to the said deadweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded taking her spot and watch them as she and her renamon went to the roof of the house to think about something. There was a slight breeze so her hair was swaying in it and her renamon looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething on your mind, rika?\u201d her partner asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce was there for me whether I want him too or not and I\u2019m guessing that he heard me singing a song. He didn\u2019t stop me and went on his way, but I think he knew I wanted to be alone. He didn\u2019t have a digimon partner like the rest of us, but he was an honorary tamer until his digimon revealed herself to him. He was full of surprises and he never back down from a fight even when the odds are against him.\u201d She said to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you have fallen for him, rika.\u201d She said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her a halfhearted glare before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about when he called you pineapple head?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was his way to counter my wit when we have what he calls battle of wits.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand on her shoulder and rika gave her a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe became my friend by being himself and he help you by keeping me safe from the bully during school.\u201c she said as ace\u2019s renamon appeared to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is sleeping peacefully as twilightrenamon is watching him for me.\u201d She said as they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you know that I have a link with him and I was thinking back to our training with our teachers. I think they were asking what drove him to want the training we were going through and he said his friends were worth it to fight through hell and back. He would fight for me, both of you, and all of his friends.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want regrets, but he was always thinking about the date in the cherry blossoms with a girl that he wanted to be at his side. He would some of the night looking at the stars thinking about what would the girl say if he popped the question to her if he asked her to be his girlfriend. He knew she would not say it in front of the others, but he had a feeling she would say yes when they were alone.\u201d She added and rika blushed knowing he was thinking about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one thing that our teachers said about the family card that I\u2019m still thinking over.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d rika asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce would vanish and take form of his normal paladinmon form in the digimon world with no memory of his time on the human world in the royal knights. I think he would have to be saved by a kiss of a love-fallen maiden or a pure shrine maiden.\u201d She explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeaning rika has to kiss him or Sakuyamon does.\u201d Rika\u2019s renamon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will only happen if ace has no choice to make a city wide change using the card.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has a few last resorts in mind when using the card, but a few of them includes taking out XAC while removing himself from the equation.\u201d She explained and they look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce might have forgotten a detail about the sun warrior, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d She said/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rika\u2019s renamon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he has to collect the cards to get the card form, but to get the actual form is that he has to fuse with the elemental renamon like he does with me and soon to be twilightrenamon if he plans to make two new variations of his first two forms.\u201d She clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if he has been planning around it?\u201d Rika asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe might be or have been, but I have been thinking of how to get it and that what our teachers said at one point.\u201d She said shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t read his mind when he needs to think about some things alone.\u201d She said and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up before stretching her body and several pops could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going for a run through the forest before going back to check on him.\u201d She said as they nodded before teleporting off the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you decided what you will tell ace about getting stronger or a bigger figure?\u201d she asked her tamer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I still want to work hard add it so he couldn\u2019t just give it to me on the spot.\u201d Rika said as her digimon nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone else was busy doing something, ace was clinging to twilight renamon like something was giving him a nightmare, but he was trying to fight it off. Twilight was trying to calm him down a little, but it\u2019s not working. He let go before shooting straight eyes wide and breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwner, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d twilight asked holding him tight still trying to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat damn dream again.\u201d Ace said before getting his phone off the charger from a low battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat dream?\u201d was asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He said trying to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing? I felt you hanging onto me like your life was in danger.\u201d Twilight said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you get everyone back into the house? I have a call to make.\u201d He asked his second partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I need to tell them?\u201d Was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will find out soon.\u201d He said leaving the room wearing his other set of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walk over to frank\u2019s wear he was resting peacefully while snow and wendy were patiently waiting on him to recover. Ace knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to tell you three something.\u201d He said opening the door into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wendy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you three to be down in the living room. Before you ask me why, snow, I\u2019m about to find out as well.\u201d He said looking at said renamon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d wendy asked slightly confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a feeling that my dream is the cause of it.\u201d He said before closing the door leaving them to talk about frank\u2019s test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to call his parents on his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello son, how are you?\u201d his father asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you and mom to come to the mansion. I had a dream and it was the nightmare again.\u201d He said and they sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright son, we will be there soon.\u201d He said to ace before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Is there another one of the Kamen family and could she be my sister?~ ace thought as he went to the living room to wait for the others and his parents to clear this mystery.</span></div></div>",

We loved them both so she knew that she would have a younger brother and she liked having a sibling to play with. Her room was next to ace\u2019s room, but she disappeared in the night. I still had the family card then and I was using it to find her, but something was blocking me from doing that.\u201d His father explained as ace walked over to his parents still with a serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen were you going to tell me?\u201d he asked in a low tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you able to handle the quest to find her and bring her back.\u201d was the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe might be sending you a message, but you would have to work through the dream.\u201d His mother said and he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will have to see if I can get her to talk with the haunting voice.\u201d He said and this confused them much like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaunting voice like a ghost?\u201d kenta asked slightly shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce chuckled before shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe girl\u2019s voice was hallow, but cheerful to have seen me. One thing though, I felt that the darkness element was close to her so I can get two birds with stone.\u201d He said and he knew rika frowned at the \u2018I\u2019 in the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are doing the same thing you scolded frank did during the test.\u201d She said and ace shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was being trained to fight and find the missing part of my family, rika.\u201d He said in a low calm tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tamers took a step back from him with widen eyes. Whenever ace was talking like that, he was set on something and nothing could change his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakato is learning to be a leader in my stead and Kazu need to use that brain of his if he wants to be taken seriously. I won\u2019t always to here to bail you out of a jam, but you did fine against the gulfmon the first time and the invasion close to your birthday.\u201d He said with a chill of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three renamon watching not knowing ace, but frank knows ace will try to find his sister and they are slightly surprised to see him talk like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was too young to help out and not strong enough, but that changed and I have my own mission to complete.\u201d Ace said before turning to the door and leaving the house for the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika sighed before face palming her forehead and the parents sighed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t always like this, but sometimes he has to do things on his own.\u201d His father said like he had dealt with this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Rika asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPride and honor.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAce is a warrior fighting for something that he believes in.\u201d ace\u2019s mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt ace had to prove something during our training with our teachers and he asked me not to help him when he was in an all-out fight with both of them. That might have caused him to use some or most of his hidden power with it controlled.\u201d Ace\u2019s renamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe sounds like frank if you think about it.\u201d Wendy said with snow nodding and frank rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce came back into the house before looking at the group. Something came to his mind and he had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither she is in the digimon world, taken by a group, or she used the card to make her teleport.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see Arthur since frank\u2019s plan didn\u2019t work.\u201d He said as said renamon was looking at him shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think you have a chance against him. I barely made it alive.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said I was going alone.\u201d Ace said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only bringing my partner in case I need to use crystal mode.\u201d He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to train with twilightrenamon later when I get back, but I also have an ace in the hole.\u201d He said smiling at the pun of his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I leave for Arthur, frank, you need to explain the card and see how it feels to be beaten by a \u2018kid\u2019.\u201c he told him using his words against him when he beat wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon.\u201d His father called him and he turned to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know dad and I will bring our family back while getting one back together.\u201d He said nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce hugged his parent\u2019s digimon in a family hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you are like family to me and I would think that you would be the aunt and uncle.\u201d he said before looking at frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell frank, what does the card do?\u201d ace asked the more calm hothead renamon.</span></div></div>",

He sensed Ace and thought to himself raring to fight (It's that kid that was with my brother! He's brought a friend too, a renamon?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur began walking slowly, then speeding up slowly, then finally sprinting down the street in Ace's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said to his partner jumping onto a tall building out of the way where there was less chance of civilians getting hurt \"He's coming this way, he knows we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce and his partner stopped on top of the tall building, the sun went down hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later Arthur jumped up to the top of the building and stood across from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur removed his helmet and asked grinning \"Why have you come for me? To get revenge for what I did to my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce spoke seriously \"I came here to convince you to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur laughed out loud and as he stopped laughing he spoke up \"And why would I do that? People like you and my brother disgust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce asked interested \"Don't you care at all for your family? All they've done for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said annoyed \"All they've done for me? All they did was hold me back for years, the best thing I ever done was disown them! That and beat down my worthless brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce's renamon said trying to reason with him \"You're a digimon yourself, working with the XAC in the end will just get you killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said spitting \"Like I care if they'll betray me or not, as long as I take my race down with me I don't care what happens to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce and his renamon looked at each other, Ace sighed and said glaring at him \"Then I have no other choice than to beat some sense into your head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said drawing his blade which was identical to Frank's sword but white \"Bring it on, brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur made the first move raising his left hand and clenching his fist, Ace combat rolled at the perfect time just as he clenched to avoid the psychic grapple, his partner was staying out of the fight until he needed assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur said as Ace brushed himself off from the roll \"You knew what was coming, you must have been studying and watching me and my brother fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce nodded, Ace charged him as Arthur did the same, Arthur lunged for him with his blade as Ace sidestepped it, Ace performed a roundhouse kick while Arthur shot a pulse of psychic energy they were both sent flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur got up after Ace, Ace glared while Arthur grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce made the next move jumping up into the air and kicking downwards, Arthur slashed at his leg just as he pulled it back and landed gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur held his blade with both hands ready and waiting for him to make his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur shook his head and slashed at the air horizontally as a beam like slice of kinetic energy raced at Ace, he ducked underneath it as it passed through and crashed on a nearby building<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce thought to himself impressed (So he still has some tricks up his sleeve that I didn't see during the fight, I need to play cautious then.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur heard his thoughts and said jokingly \"Play cautious you say? That's no fun. Now come at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur charged at Ace as he charged as well, Arthur put his left hand on the ground  as Ace stopped running, Ace couldn't move, his feet were stuck to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce said smashing the ground with his fists using a little bit of his hidden power \"So you can stop people from running away or chasing you this way, interesting ability you have there.

Then how about you hear this.\u201d Ace said before getting his thoughts into a random pattern and going all direction. This was starting to give Arthur a headache from hearing the many voices in ace\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank still cares about you as his brother and are acting like him.\u201d Ace said keeping his renamon away from the fight until he was caught in trouble again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I too have a long lost sibling, but she is the opposite of you and I have to find her for my parent\u2019s sake.\u201d Ace said getting stronger as his power level was rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to keep my real power out of this, but now I have to fight more serious.\u201d Ace said as a ring of kanji appeared around him and his fire card appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoenix Blaze.\u201d Ace said the name of the card before it vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was strange.\u201d He said eyeing the ring of kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the others a card appeared with the training people, another card appeared with his parents, the third card appeared with blaze and his two friends, and the final card appeared at the table with the ring of cards as a white orb appeared floating above the fire card. The other four cards appeared with everyone minus ace and his partner coming into the room seeing the cards in the center of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother fusion card.\u201d Rika said as frank noticed the card he gave to ace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut a five card fusion?\u201d Henry asked slightly confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five cards fused into the new fire card and one of the old cards was one that rika knew by heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked it up before seeing the picture of white samurai armor with sakura leaves raining over the armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArmor of Inferno?\u201d She asked confused at the card before it vanished in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLight and Ice are left before Darkness and Metal need to be found.\u201d Takato said with the others except for ace\u2019s parents nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarkness is with ace\u2019s sister so that leave metal.\u201d Rika\u2019s renamon said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with ace, he didn\u2019t move from the spot in the ring before a card appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be the new one.\u201d He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the new card and his digivice, he slashed it through triggering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigi-Modify: Armor of Inferno Activate.\u201d Ace said doing his own stance. The ring of kanji turned white before rolls of paper wrap around him forming a ball. Ace\u2019s clothes turned into black basic armor streaks of white and gold on his arms, legs, and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive samurai armors appeared as the armor of inferno was behind ace. He saw them and knew they help with the one behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cGuess which is our path for you to take the armor of inferno.\u201d</i> A voice said from the red set of armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVirtue.\u201d Ace said pointing to red<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLight.\u201d He pointed to light blue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustice.\u201d He pointed to orange<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife.\u201d He pointed to dark blue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, wisdom.\u201d He pointed to the green set of armor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou have made the right choices and you carry our paths so you will be to wear the armor each time you use the card.\u201d</i> Red armor said as ace nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you armor-san.\u201d Ace said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOur companion should be with yours giving her the power of both white and black blazes.\u201d</i> Orange armor said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNow for your armor, young ronin.\u201d</i> Red said before the light blue and green sets of armor glow their colors as the armguards of the white armor started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDo you think you can handle such power?\u201d</i> light blue asked ace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot think. I know I can handle it.\u201d Ace said before the two flashed into his arms and the white and red armguards appeared on his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, his partner was waiting for him to come of the ball of paper. She felt something behind her and thinking it was Arthur, but she finds an armored black tiger with swords on its  sides walking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cA companion of the warriors that the card summoned by your companion. I came to give you my power and armor.\u201d</i> The tiger said through a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger glowed a rainbow before flashing into her body giving her white and black stripes in her body. The armor appeared and the swords are on her back as her ears are poking through the helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, tiger-san.\u201d Renamon said before turning back to the ball of paper ready to help. (Ace wearing this armor and think the armor on white/black blaze on renamon but it is remodeled to fit her: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g3EfR7hKOrU/Ubr2HLRQxyI/AAAAAAAARD4/UlCj7R6waIw/s1600/Ronin+warriors+E24.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g3EfR7hKOrU/Ub...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armguards started to glow before being engulfed in flames and this got ace thinking about frank\u2019s card. Channeling his will, the fire grew as the flames were engulfing him and the orange with dark blue sets of armor started to glow their colors. The flames started to lessen revealing ace in his new upper body armor. The two flashed into his legs before the white armor appeared on his lower body and only the red set of armor was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cStay on the right path and you will find what you are looking for.\u201d</i> Red said before glowing and flashed into ace\u2019s forehead. After the flash, ace was wearing the helmet with a face mask completing his new form, but it\u2019s not a real form like his digivultions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was waiting for ace to come out of the ball of paper and he was getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~If lewis didn\u2019t want the kid alive, I would have crushed him by now.~ He thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of paper started to burn, but it exploded outward revealing ace in his armor and he pulled his own sword that was made of the hardest crystal diamond with some mixed metal and gems making it even stronger after 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the wait, but I\u2019m a certified badass.\u201d Ace said with a smirk before the area around them turned into a white void meaning ace still had his trump card active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is a surprise.\u201d He added sounding surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do this?\u201d Arthur asked shocked at the area as said area had enclosed them and only ace can get them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrade secret.\u201d Ace said as his partner was behind him waiting to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe revenge on your race stops here, Arthur. Only I can get us out of here in one piece or you will be stuck here if you kill me.\u201d Ace said pointing his sword at said renamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the sword in the sheath for a moment, he grabbed the digivice and triggered another card to help with the new fire card that he is wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDigi-Modify: Blur Step Activate.\u201d Ace said feeling that he was faster now and still wearing the armor the fire card gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the digivice back in his armor where it vanished again, he drawn out his sword again he gave Arthur a pure look of determination and burning spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to win this one for frank, but to prove that you are wrong and you are like her.\u201d Ace said as he used a small part of his mind to lessen the power of arthur\u2019s mental power without him knowing thanks to the trump card.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Keep the age rating to thirteen plus. A story based on Digimon tamers. This story is set in the Tamers universe sometime after the D-Reaper was defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory: After the D-Reaper had fallen a corporation was created known as the X.A.C or the Xeno Affinity corporation, this corporation was created near Shinjuku by an unknown man for the sole purpose of stopping anything digimon related from going wrong again like another D-Reaper outbreak, or that was what was displayed and sought to be believed by the common man. The X.A.C got it's name from wanting to change the world, as it's real nature the X.A.C truly only wants power and control, they will stop at nothing to get what they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank the dark red furred renamon in chapter 1 has been fighting the X.A.C for a long time, he has not been alone however, he has had friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way the X.A.C works is that people pay them for protection from digimon, they hunt digimon and profit off of them in anyway they can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the X.A.C the rankings go -- Soldier --&gt; Digimon Hunter --&gt; General --&gt; Elite --&gt; Commander --&gt; Director --&gt; Secondary Dictator --&gt; \"Dictator's-personal -Spy-unit\" --&gt; Dictator<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is unknown if the \"Dictator\" even exists, nothing at all is known about him publicly. Even his personal Spy unit is unknown on the highest level, however the Secondary Dictator does exist, his name is \"Lewis Blackgate\", he has no contact with the Dictator and has never seen him before but he serves and leads the corporation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X.A.C is run by three 'directors', each director controls a part of Shinjuku, \"Viola Lambert\" being the most dangerous and infamous of the directors runs Northern Shinjuku, Not much is known about her except that she is the most ruthless and cruel person out of the directors, and she is the only known person to have met the Dictator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second director is known as \"Shaun Ryan\", he controls the West sector of Shinjuku and does the most financial work out of all three of the directors by hunting the most digimon, his unit specializes in hunting and executing digimon or selling them off for profit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third and final director is known as \"Professor Gamma\" since he is a professor nicknamed since some of his research into Digimon revolves around the principles of light radiation and gamma radiation, he is a great man but he may be working for the wrong corporation. He is known to be the kindest of the directors and least demanding, despite this, his research is invaluable to the X.A.C's cause.</td>",
