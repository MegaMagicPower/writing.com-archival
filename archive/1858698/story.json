Their single mother, Carey was setting down two plates stacked high with pancakes. 10 for Zack and 7 for Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Zack said. \"10 of them, this is great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, congratulations on your B in math, I was flabbergasted by your achievement. And Cody, straight A's as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you had better hurry, school starts soon and the bus won't wait for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey left the room and the twins began to chow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were delicious,\" Zack said as he finished off his tenth pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, keep them in your mouth, not on the table\" said Cody who was still eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know there's a new Krispy Kreme Doughnuts opening just a block away from school\" Zack said as he was licking the syrup off his chubby fingers. \"Hurry up and finish your pancakes so we can grab a few doughnuts before school starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, aren't you going to be full after 10 pancakes? Asked Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so\" he replied. \"But you can't pass up Krispy Kreme, can you? It'll be fine just this once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,but just have one\" mothered Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I just have one, there's so many to choose from, Long Johns, Bismarks, Doughnut Holes, Glazed, Chocolate, Sprinkles, they're all too good to pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Zack overeating isn't good for your health, and the doctor said you were 8 pounds heavier than I am - and that was a few months ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all muscle\" Zack snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is not\" said Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but it was your idea\" Cody finished his last pancake and they headed to their room to get dressed.</span></div></div>",

He began to hook the pins together in a chain and then connect them to both sides of his brother's shorts. While he was working his hand softly brushed up against Zack's belly, causing it to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think it will work\" asked Zack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should do\" said Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins looked on as Zack let go of his shorts.

I'll help, but you owe me, fatty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Cody's help, Zack was able to convince Carey that he was ill and was allowed to stay home. When he had heard the door slam shut, Zack began to get out of bed and pull out his pajamas from his closet. But after he had pulled off his torn shorts, he realized that he was the only one in the house. He realized he could lounge around all day long in his tight, white underwear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking - well, waddling - into the living room, Zack burped loudly, sending ripples through his bulging beer belly. Pulling out the scales, he put them by the cooker and made himself a large bacon sandwich as he stepped onto the scales. As he scoffed down the bacon sandwich, letting grease run down his bulging beer belly. He burped, cleaned his belly with a piece of kitchen roll, looked down and gasped; the scales had just flicked to 145lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Am I really that fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack leaped off the scales, shoved it away and ran, as fast as he could, which, due to his bloated bulging beer belly, wasn't very fast. He skidded to a halt in front of the mirror and stared at himself. A large round belly bulged in front of him and two plump man boobs bulged forward from his chest. Thick love handles wrapped themselves around his waist and joined with the belly at the front. He put both hands below his belly and lifted it up, letting go of it and sending wobbling ripples through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have I gotten so fat?\" He inquired, grabbing a love handle in one hand. His stomach rumbled and, for a moment, he went to the kitchen; throwing open the fridge, he scooped out the food and stuffed his face with it, sobbing as he made himself fatter and fatter. He'd known for a while that he had trouble with junk food, but his fattened frame just proved what he feared. He was addicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the sofa, he threw himself down onto it, causing the junk food wrappers to fall onto the floor, and leaned back, both hands on his belly, which swelled under the calorific onslaught he had shovelled into it.<br>\r\nAt three thirty in the afternoon, Zack was awoken by someone shaking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After much convincing. Carrie let Zack stay home from school. Cody went off to school and Carrie had a rehearsal, leaving the suite all to Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing the fridge, Zack took whatever containers and tupperware he could dig through the messy fridge and opened them one by one, until he found something that wasn't one of Cody's pre-prepared healthy meals. \"Ugh, c'mon, there's gotta be SOMETHING!\" thought a hungry Zack as his stomach continued to roar violently. Luckily, Zack managed to salvage an entire drawer in the fridge loaded with still fresh leftovers from the week, consisting of BBQ Chocobo-Wings, a few cheeseburgers , some garlic fries, and half of a Deep Dish Pizza. Glancing down at his mini-feast to be, Zack's mouth watered as he started warming up his leftovers, plate by plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited, he grabbed some milk from his fridge and started drinking from the carton, gulping down massive amounts of milk at a surprisingly quick pace. Continuing without any breaks, Zack began to sweat as milk drizzled down his chin and spilled over his t-shirt. He then pressed his stomach with his free hand, feeling it expand little by little as more and more milk continued to travel down into his gullet, it was soft and jiggled slightly to the touch. Finally, he crinkled the carton as he sucked it completely dry then slammed the carton onto the table, letting out a monstrously loud belch immediately afterward. Sighing with relief, Zack then wiped the milk dribble from his mouth and patted his belly in satisfaction. \"Whew, didn;t even know I was that thirsty,\" Zack said to himself curiously, \"wonder what that was about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand still rested on his stomach, he glanced down curiously and lifted up his shirt, exposing his slightly chubby, but not qyite fat midsection. \"Man, barely even a dent!\" he gloated as he slapped his gut proudly, before letting his shirt fall back down, as the food in the microwave beeped ready. Licking his lips with anticipation, Zack took the rest of his mini-feast out from the microwave and set it all on the table in front of him. Despite having just downed an entire carton of milk in a single shot, Zack's stomach still groaned hungry for more. So Zack delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Zack immediately tore into the BBQ wings, ripping the Chocobo meat clean from the bones in big, heaping mouthfuls, gulping each one down and immediately digging in for more. \"Mmmm! *GULLLLP!* Man, I never noticed how great these things realy were!\" said Zack between bites. \"And the sauce is killer!\" Picking one wing bone clean, Zack immediately moved onto the other, repeating the same process until it was bone dry, all the while getting BBQ sauce all over his mouth and fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing the wings, Zack licked his fingers clean and wiped his mouth with a paper towel before moving onto the decent sized burgers from some unnamed restaurant Zack couldn't really remember. He didn't really care where they were from at this moment. All he cared about was where they were going to be as he began to chomp down on the first burger. All the while, his stomach continued to expand little by little with every few mouthfuls swallowed, to where his shirt began to get just a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while of stuffing his face, Zack began to slow down, resting one hand atop his gut as it pushed outward by two to three inches. \"Starting to feel a little full,\" thought Zack as he massaged his belly tenderly from beneath his shirt...</span></div></div>",

He placed his hand on his soft, jiggly belly and fondled his love handles for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.\" He thought to himself as his chubby fingers squeezed the bulging mounds of flab pouring over his underwear waistband. \"That feels new, I don't remember all that being there before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's stomach let out a mighty grumble, he gave it a pat and said. \" Soon girl, soon. I know your hungry.\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled out of the bed still in the covers and hit the floor with a booming thud, the room shook slightly and a candy bar fell from the edge of his dresser. \"Well this is my lucky day.\" Beamed Zack as he stretched upward to reach the candy his body working it's way out of the bed cover exposing his large belly as it spilled out onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Zack unwrapped the candy bar and placed the entire thing in his mouth, Cody walked into the bedroom to see Zack sprawled out on the floor, his large belly spilling out all over and a chocolate bar sticking out the end of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you're putting on so much weight! Candy bars for breakfast.\" Exclaimed  Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let out a belch and stretched, further exposing his girth to bellow his underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, wow wow.\" Said Cody. \"That's enough, you're getting a little too low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack grinned and threw the bed covers off completely. \"I'm not naked Codster, I am wearing underwear, but honestly I think I'll have to stop, the waistband has shrunk and they're making me uncomfortable.\" laughed Zack as he pulled at the waistband to reveal his red and marked waist. As he let go it pinged back as it was so tight causing his belly to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now help me up Cody, it's breakfast time and I'm famished!\" Teased Zack as he was still laying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't even if I wanted too.\" Snapped Cody. \"You must be at least 170 lbs. I don't have that sort of upper body strength.\" Cody trailed off as he left the room leaving Zack to heave himself off the floor. He pulled himself up using the bed frame, it let out a groan as he put his weight on it. \"Cheap Tipton beds.\" Zack retorted scratching his belly as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the room for a t-shirt as he peered out the window to the building across from his bedroom to see a boy about the same age as himself staring back, eyes fixed squarely on Zack's still shirtless belly. He looked down at his stomach and placed his hands on either side of it and then looked back up at the boy and gave him a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell the boy was clearly turned on and while Zack was purely only interested in the ladies he and his big ego loved attention, no matter whom it was from. He slowly walked over to the glass in the full length window, his belly wobbling with each step he stood right in front of the window and turned to his side, giving the other boy a full profile of himself in his straining tight underwear. His belly bulged forward a few inches and hung over all round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was just about squashed up on to the glass. So Zack decided he should do the same. He cupped either side of his belly with his hands and gave it a squeeze before squashing it up against the window pane, it bulged out and spread up against the glass tightly. The boy in the other room went bright red and walked off out of sight and Zack stepped back from the glass feeling mighty full of himself and his inflated ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to forgo getting dressed and walked out into the kitchen for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

He leaned back so it stretched back out to to a single round blob. He gave it a shake and it wobbled like jelly. \"Must be empty\" Zack said to himself. \"This should fix that.\" He opened the tub, picked up a spoon which he'd left in the couch the evening before and started shoveling the ice cream into his hungry mouth. He started off slow, savouring the flavour but, being the greedy boy he was, couldn't help but pick up the pace and began shoveling it in as fast as he could. As he did so ice cream would splatter onto his chubby face and drip down his double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of gorging himself, Zack had devoured the entire tub. He put a hand on his belly to give it a well deserved rub and felt something cold and sticky. He looked down to see a puddle of melted ice cream had dripped down from his chins to his naval. He dipped a pudgy finger in the brown liquid, brought it to his mouth and sucked it off slowly. \"Mmm. Not so empty now\" He said while rubbing his bloated stomach. \"I could still do with some more chocolate, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack decided to get some chocolate from...</span></div></div>",

Each button was harder to do up than the last. When he got to the button at his waist he had to suck his belly in as far as he could to get it to fit. \"I'm just bloated\" He told himself. \"It would fit fine if I hadn't had breakfast first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was dressed, Zack looked at himself in the mirror. The shirt was stretched so tight around his body that the buttons at his middle had gaps between them leaving his fleshy, ice cream covered belly visible.

She places a hand on her chin and gives a nod of improvement, \u201cYeah. I\u2019d let you take me on a date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin\u2019s eyes shot wide with magnificent surprise. Cody more shocked than Zach, \u201cW-w-what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee I told ya,\u201d Zach hopped into Cody\u2019s face, \u201cTold ya! Fat is in! Thin is\u2026is\u2026not in\u2026HA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody could hardly fathom how Maddy thinks Zach is dateable in this state or at the very least is considered more attractive that clean and cut Cody, \u201cWell yeah. Don\u2019t you know the \u2018fat\u2019 look is in? Check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy steps behind the counter, presenting her new figure for the twins, \u201cDo I look \u2018fat\u2019 or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach and Cody couldn\u2019t believe how Maddy now looked.  Her once slim physique had bloated considerably. The trademark baby blue button up and tie combo had clung tight to her spherical belly with the buttons straining to stay fastened. The shirt had failed to conceal her juicy love handles that rested above her thick waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy crossed her medium sized bingo wing arms across her full D cup breasts that too weren\u2019t hidden by the shirt. In other words, her cleavage was out there for all to see.  Maddy tapped her foot causing her cankle to ripple which made her thick, succulent thigh ripple and undoubtedly caused her big, chunky, plump rear to jiggle. Thankfully her skirt was long enough to conceal that. For the most part anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk came across Maddy\u2019s chubby face. She could no doubt see them sliver of drool escaping from the twins mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d The said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy walked back behind the counter, \u201cThanks. I\u2019ve pretty much been snacking on candy bars and junk food non-stop ever since the trend hit. Cody, my friend, you are sooooo behind the times.\u201d Maddy went back to gnawing on the chocolate bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d, Cody began to think, \u201cTheoretically. I\u2019m lame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy nodded her head. Zach laughed, \u201cYep, Theoretically. You\u2019re a dork.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother candy wrapper joined the pile, \u201cYep. And fat guys are in right now. Except I\u2019d only date one heavier than me.\u201d Maddy spoke causing Zach to raise his eyebrows, \u201cWell, how heavy are ya, gorgeous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c235, but that\u2019s only going to get higher.\u201d Maddy brushed her blond hair back and started on a cinnamon roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then. Looks like I\u2019ve got a lot of eaten to do.\u201d Zach patted his belly eyeing Maddy and Cody.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He undid his buttons one by one, releasing his plump man boobs and bulging belly then peeled his shirt off. \"Ahhh.\" He sighed in releif, relaxing his gut. <br>\r\n\"Pop!\" <br>\r\nThe button of Zack's jeans flew off and his belly gushed forwards. \"Mmm.

It felt soft and flabby and his fingers sunk in despite his stomach being stuffed with sweets. \"Feels like fat.\" Said Zack, as he continued to massage his pudge with puffy chocolate-covered fingers. \"I'm not going to admit it, though.\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, The Tipton's hotel guests stared, with confusion and disgust, at the obese, shirtless teenager rubbing his big, flabby belly in the middle of the lobby. </span></div></div>",

I know how to get dressed.\" He stood up, and stepped into a pair of jeans he'd left on the floor and started pulling them up his legs.They went past his knees no problem but got stuck halfway up his thighs. He tugged as hard as hard as he could and jumped up and down causing his belly to wobble in every direction. <br>\r\nAfter a minute of this, they still weren't any higher so he had to lay on bed, lift his legs in the and pull down as hard as he could until the jeans reached his hips. \"Now's the hard part.\" Zack said, standing up.

There was far too much pudge getting in the way so he exhaled letting his belly extend back into a thick, round ball. \"Cody!

He moaned in pleasure from feeling his own fat between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Do we have a deal?\" Cody said, walking back into the boy's bedroom.

Make sure to brush your teeth and no video games after 10:30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" the boys mumbled in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys began to get their food as Carey left the room. Zack piled on five slices onto his plate. Cody, however,surprised everyone by taking the entire box!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Zack, I'm bulking up for basketball season and I need to eat extra calories.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sure Cody, but are you not suppose to exercise and bulk at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No stupid, you bulk up a lot and then cut out the extra fat that hasn't turned into muscle. I doubt you would understand something like considering all you do is eat pizza and play video games Tubby.\" Cody then grabbed some of Zack's man boob. They jiggled wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Whatever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack and Cody both make their way to the couch and began to eat and watch TV.

The sauce was all around his lips, and some on his cheek. Cody's neck was starting to become encased in fat and his shoulders were becoming huskier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmfhfh\" Cody replied as he stuffed another slice down his paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack got into bed and began to go to sleep.

Cody's t-shirt is not properly equipped to handle his sizable girth and has ridden up to right above his belly button. His belly hangs just over his boxers, the same boxers he was wearing at the previous weigh in. The former tiny holes around the waist have become more visible. As Cody turns towards the T.V to sit down, Zack gets a view of his wide ass. It is clearly straining the seam of his boxers. As Cody sits, the couch begins to groan and visibly sinks below the frame level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack is thrilled as phase 1 of his plan has begun perfectly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Zack got ready for school, he looked at his body in the mirror. Zack had gained about fifteen pounds since then. But it had been planned....Zack knew that before he could start phase two he needed to get Cody under full delusion. His belly had covered the waistband of his boxers and was looking very hefty. Zack looked at his face. His cheeks were the definition of plump and a double chin had officially formed. As he turned around, he saw his butt bursting out of his underwear. Zack had purposely worn his tightest boxers as he was about to execute another part of his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack began to make his way towards the breakfast table to eat. Cody was already there, eating some pancakes that their mom had cooked up. Cody hadn't slowed down his bulking regime from the looks of things. Cody's face hadn't really plumped up as much as Zack's. There was a clear double chin however that had appeared on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" There's only three pancakes left...Mom usually makes 12?\" questioned Zack <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh yea, since you are on your diet and all, I told Mom that she didn't need to make any more \" lied Cody. Cody had instead eaten the extra pancakes, quickly devouring them while Zack was in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack went to sit down on the kitchen chair.  As he rested his butt onto the seat *<i><b>CRASHH</b></i>*. The chair had disintegrated under Zack's overweight body. Zack had fallen to the ground on his stomach and attempted to get up but is having a little trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, Zack are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah, lemme just get something to hold onto.\" Zack grabs onto the nearby couch and heaves himself up. As he gets up, he notices his pencil has fallen to the ground. As he bends to pick it up...*<b><i>RIPPP...</i></b>*. Zack's school pants have ripped at the seams and exposed his wide load wrapped inside his way too tight boxer briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Jesus, Zack you need to lay up the junk. Look at you, you're ripping your pants and breaking chairs. Pathetic. I thought you were on your diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am, I'm just struggling right now...\" Zack began to tear up. Crocodiles tears. * <i><b>Take the bait, Cody...come on</b></i> *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright, alright I'm sorry. Look I'm just trying to tell you that you need to stop being lazy and eating junk food. I mean, you have a living example right here of healthy living.\" says Cody as he points to his <i>flat</i> stomach. \" We need to go see how much you weigh Zack. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers head to the bathroom and get on the new digital scale Zack has bought from Arwin a week ago. Zack gets on first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA digital voice yells out *<i> 205 pounds!</i> *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My goodness, Zack, you've gotten into the 200s!! Man I could never let myself go like this \" chuckled Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody then proceeds to get onto the scale<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gets on, Zack pulls out the mobile scaler and clicks the pre-programmed weight to show up on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>162 lbs</i> *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My bulking is going well. I'm on track to be 180 in two months and then from there I will be cutting and working. I'm gunna be a chiseled physical specimen. Try not to break any more chairs while I'm at the gym Zack \" laughed Cody. \" I'm not trying to be late for school, buttface.\" Cody proceeds to leave the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Cody. If only you knew how much you <b>actually</b> weighed. Zack looked down at the mobile scaler. It showed Cody's actual weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>197 lbs!!</i> *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It has been a month since the last weigh in and he started his weight loss journey. His stomach has receded back a little and is not covering his waistband. His cheeks aren't bloated anymore but still chubby. He turns around and sees his butt has become a little less wider. All in all, decent return for the discipline Zack put in during this month. He approached the scale and stepped on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>197 lbs!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I weigh as much as Cody!!\" Zach thought. Or at least use too.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody had continued his bulking regimen throughout the month. Constantly eating anything he could get his hands on because he needed the calories, Cody was getting pretty massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>SLAM</i>* The front door had closed and Cody had arrived from the gym. He was sweating as he entered the kitchen. In his hand were two greasy old-school grocery bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Zack, I got myself some chili cheeseburgers from Wendy's. They were having a sale and I got 5....you want one?\" Before Zack could answer, Cody replied to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh wait, that's right you're on your diet ahahaha \" laughed Cody. \" I just came back from the gym and even walked back home from there as you can tell from my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What happened to your bike?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh, it was a old piece of junk. Just stop working randomly; no big deal I'll get another one with the money I've saved. Unlike you I have the will to not blow my money on food all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the truth was Cody's bike wasn't a piece of junk. In fact, it was perfectly normal except for one thing. The tires were flat. Yes, Cody had popped his tires on his way to the gym. Angry, he decided that he was going to walk home anyways and didn't need the gym for exercise today. He spent the remaining hour at Dairy Queen, indulging in a couple of Large Brownie Blizzards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack studied Cody's body while he walked towards his bedroom to change. Cody was now a full-fledged chubster. His once loose gym shirt was clingy tightly to his tummy. His belly had begun to fill out quite a bit, creating a legitimate muffin top over his too small gym shorts. Cody's wide ass was straining to create space inside his size 32 shorts as his body slightly but surely jiggled with each step. Zach smiled, for someone who was supposedly in shape, Cody was breathing heavy by the time he got into his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Cody came out wearing a button-down pajama shirt. It was bought to be a over-sized style, but you should see a silhouette of Cody's man-boobs and gut through the shirt. The shirt also covered his legs all the way down to the upper thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving\" Cody exclaimed. He sat down on the couch and began to open up the tin foil surrounding the burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>MUNCH......CRUNCH.......SLURP</b></i>* Cody began a 20 minute workout of his mouth. He would take a bite of the burger, shove 6 or 7 fries into his mouth and then shovel it down with a root beer. His stomach slowly expanded throughout this time eventually settling over his pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>BURPP</b></i>* And with that, Cody had fallen asleep on the couch.</span></div></div>",

Cody made his into the living room, where he saw his mom holding the package. Cody thanked his mom and grabbed the package and began to open it. Inside were two sets of uniforms, as well sweaters, gym shorts, and a t-shirt. Wrapped in plastic, both sets had Zack and Cody's name written on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I guess I'll just have to go with trial and error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody began to try on the first set. He put on the gym shorts and t-shirt. They were a somewhat baggy fit. He took them off and tried on the uniform. He put on the dress shirt and buttoned it up. A perfect fit! He put on the pants and pulled them up. After very very light resistance from the button, it did up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Perfect\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Zack came out of their room and asked what Cody was doing. Cody tells him that he is trying on the new uniforms that came in the mail. Cody then decides to ask Zack to try his on. Zack begins opening the other set of clothing. Once he sees the sweater, however he realizes that this isn't his clothing....Its Cody's!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" <i>I took the measurements for these when I was 205!</i>\" thought Zack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack decides to continue trying on the uniform, even though he knows that it clearly isn't tailored for his size. He begins to pull up the dress pants. Resistance begins as his thighs are too thick to fit through the pant hole. The fabric begins cutting into his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk..I guess some things never change \" teased Cody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I guess.\" smiled Zack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had woken up early so he could see his actual weight before Cody woke up. He got on the scale<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>186 lbs!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was thrilled. He had lost nearly 30 lbs in 3 months. He looked at himself in the mirror. His man boobs had receded a bit, but were still prevalent. His stomach had freed up the waistband of his boxers and wasn't jiggling as much as it use. His ass looked less lardy and more regular. He jokingly flexed in the mirror. His body wasn't muscle and still jiggled, but he had lost enough weight to where it wasn't as embarrassing as it use to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been two months since Cody had weighed in. Thinking he was 162 lbs at the time, he was still bulking over the course of these last two months. With every cheeseburger, his stomach gained more and more girth. Cody,undoubtedly, become a pig. He would shovel burgers and fries down his throat any chance he'd get. And of course, whenever Zack had leftovers, he would more than help himself to those as well. Cody was now feeling the effects of the mass growth of his body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" C'mon stupid shirt. I swear this laundry machine is terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was struggling to put on the button pajama shirt he always wore. His arms were like sausage packed inside a too-tight bag. The inseam was struggling to keep up with Cody's jerky movements and began to tear slightly. He began buttoning the shirt, each button increasing in resistance. He finally got to the second top one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ughhhunhuhnhh......there! That wasn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody finally buttoned the shirt up. He had gotten the second button to finally close......but what Cody didn't realize is that to compensate for the button closing, the shirt had to make other sacrifices. The button near the bottom of the shirt had popped off amidst the struggle and a part of Cody's midriff was now visible. Cody, however, didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now , let me get to the bathroom to see how much progress I've made. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack heard the door opening and floor creaking with footsteps landing on the floor way. Cody entered the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright lardo let's get this over with, I have plans to do stuff today unlike your lazy butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack obliged and stripped down to his boxers. Cody couldn't resist poking at Zack's(now smaller) love-handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope the scale can support there, fatty.\" chuckled Cody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack got on the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>200 lbs!!</b></i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 5 pounds? Zack, did you even try not stuffing your face for these last two months. I guess some people just can't control their urges.\" Cody continued \" Let me see how much I weigh now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody began to undress. He started with his pajama shirt. He started unbuttoning, one by one. And as he completed each one, his belly was like a hurricane pressuring a dam levy. Cody's belly had come into its own. It couldn't hold any longer.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>POP.......POP.......POP</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's shirt has ripped apart. His belly burst through the last three buttons and had landed right over his waistband. Every slight movement by Cody caused a jiggle to occur on his spare tire. The inseam had a clear rip straight down the armpit. Cody's fat, doughy arms were more than visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The laundry machine needs to be fixed. This is the second piece of clothing that hasn't fit in the past week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody continued to the scale and bent down to turn it on. Zack got a view of Cody's fat ass. It was stuffed inside his boxers and you could clearly see his crack at the top. Furthermore, strands of seam fabric were visible coming from the waist of the bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>CREAK...</b></i> Cody stepped onto the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>188 lbs!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Looks like I gained a little extra weight. Nothing I can't lose though since I'll be cutting from now on. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Cody, you want help with your cutting? I have some diet pills I got from that new clinic downtown. They apparently help you lose weight 10 times faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack showed Cody the bottle of \"diet pills\". However, this weren't diet pills. These were weight gain pills for anorexic patients. Zack had replaced the pills inside with his pills. The new pills were appetite simulators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Gimme those, its not like it could work on someone with a butt as wide as yours.\" teased Cody. He popped two into his mouth, even though the recommended dosage was one and left for breakfast, each step causing his large thighs to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now lets see what your real weight is?\" Zack looked at his device<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>227 lbs!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack couldn't believe it. His plan was working....and it was a <b><i>huge</i></b> success.

Cody had not been paying attention but his mom's appearance had undergone a very clear transformation in the past three months. Carey's face had taken a hit due to her gain, with a double chin clearly taken up new residence. Her once hourglass silhouette that had attracted guests to the hotel to watch her sing had taken a major hit. Her stomach had turned into a gut, slightly bulging out of her t-shirt. Her lower body had expanded tremendously as her corpulent backside took up way too much room out of her skin tight sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Cody.\" Cody replied pleasantries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey then turned towards the scale and bent over to turn it on.

She stepped on the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>*168 lbs!!*</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey ,I lost 5 pounds!! \" Carey exclaimed. As she bent down to turn off the scale, her sweatpants began to tear up. The seams holding together her gelatin cheeks had given way and his ass wobbled uncontrollably. Cody could now clearly see the medium sized underwear trying to contain an XL ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My goodness, the laundry machine is going AWOL. I'm getting the repairman to replace that piece of junk immediately.

For her entire life, Carey had been a yo-yo dieter, trying every quick fix diet out there. Zach rationalized that she didn't care if she didn't feel like she lost weight, the scale was the scale and it was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody came into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What is the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh nothing Cody, I just ripped my pants thanks to the laundry machine....again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wow, the same thing happened to me. I popped three buttons off my pajama shirt. I thought that too. My t-shirt was just too tight and it didn't make any sense as to why I was having so much trouble putting it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, breakfast is ready and its getting cold \" exclaimed Carey with a ravenous look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stayed back to read out Carey's weight. He looked down at the device.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b><i>199 lbs</i></b>!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack smiled. He liked where this was going. He wanted to see how long this could last as he was enjoying every single second of his revenge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a month since Zack and Cody had weighed in. Zack had continued his progress the past month, playing basketball outside whenever he got the chance too. He wanted to shed just a bit more of his new 176 lbs frame so he could be in optimal shape for basketball shape. He had restricted himself from junk food, aside from the occasional snack here and there and the results were showing. Zack swished his last shot and made his way to his stuff so he can go home. Zack arrived to the front door and opened began to open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Zack, I was just about to make my way to luncheon with a couple of friends.\" said Carey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey was dressed in a cocktail dress bought 20 lbs+ ago. She had definitely taken her supposed weight loss for granted and indulged in the past month. Her 200 lbs+ body was straining each seam of her dress. Her gut had gotten soft and flabbier. Her hourglass physique had transformed into a pudgy, plump, pear shape. It was a mystery as to how she was able to fit the dress onto her bulging body. Carey knew this, as she took careful and small steps towards her purse on the couch. As she bent down to grab it, her jiggly thighs were more and more visible. Her blubbery butt had gained inches, looking prime to burst out of her dress any second. It was no mystery as to why she had gained weight; with an A&amp;R dinner there and a buffet platter after a show here, Carey had temptation at every corner and had been loving every cheesecake and stuffed crab for the past month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm going to be out till night so don't stay up too late. I left some money if you need any for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she was gone. Zack decided to shower up before Cody came home from his workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>10 minutes later</b></i>* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody entered the house, red faced and heaving for air after having biked from his gym. He had bought a new bike the previous month to get from his house to the gym. The new bike was equipped accommodate Cody's <i>bulkier</i> frame with stronger tires and an extra wide seat for his fat butt. Cody began moving towards the cabinet. He opened it and grabbed a bottle of those \"diet pills\" had given him. He popped two into his mouth and put the bottle back. Cody's regiment for the past month included weekly trips to gym, biking back and taking the diet pills. And yet, Cody was as fat as ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody made his way to his bedroom so he could change into some cleaner clothing. He began to lug his hefty self towards the room. His once simple spare tire had evolved into a hanging gut. The lovehandles on his back had slightly increased in width to accommodate the weight of his new found jelly belly. His entire body had been covered in another layer of fat since last month, like a cake being frosted. Cody's face had gotten chubbier, with a double chin clearly residing all around his neck. His shoulders and arms were larger and softer, shaking at the slightest of movement. As too were his calves. Cody entered the room and settled himself on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>GROANN</i>* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's butt had also increased in girth. It had become much wide and was beginning to become shapeless. A sort of huge lump behind him. He got up after a couple of minutes and began changing. The baggy gym shorts that Cody had received from his school a month ago were now a tight fit, a little too tight for most. But Cody mistakenly thought that his girth was a sign that he was building muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat....right? That would be true...if Cody was actually building muscle. Cody's usual workout would consist of a very light jog on a treadmill, lifting 5lbs weights and 10 minute go on the elliptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the gym was new, it was doing everything it could to gain new members. One of the things it would do was offering members a platter to satisfy their hunger after a workout. There would be boxes of donuts,cookies and pizza for everyone to have. The company was trying to trap as many people in their cycle of yo-yo dieting as they could. Cody could not resist, as he would stuff his face with pizza and donuts after workouts, justifying it as to his metabolism having active phase after working out to which he could eat whatever he wanted. The gym didn't care, they just wanted the members to get hooked. Coupled with the appetite enhancers Zack gave him, Cody was beginning to get massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack finished showering and began to towel dry his body. He walked out of the bathroom and into his bedroom. He opened the door and was greeted at the sight of Cody bending down, trying to get his feet out of his gym shorts. Cody's butt had more than wore its welcome inside his size 32 boxers. There was a clear rip on his right cheek, as well as multiple tiny rips in and around the waistband. As Cody leaned back, the waistband looked overwhelmed as his gut began to rest over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So are we going to the mall to get some new clothes?\" questioned Zack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ughh, I'm not feeling so well. Kinda feel like I have cold coming on.\" lied Cody. He was just too lazy and exhausted after \"working out\" to go walking around the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well do you want me to get you some clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yea, I'd appreciate it, almost my damn clothes were shrunk by that stupid washing machine. Even those gym shorts I just go from school got a bit tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach tried to hide his excitement. Those gym shorts were a size 38!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright, hand me your debt card and I'll get you some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exchange was made and Zack got dressed and was on his way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack arrived at the mall and went to the local outlet store. He asked the lady if they had any clothing with wrong size labeling. Surprisingly, she commented on how they would get clothing like such all the time. She pointed Zack to a aisle with clothing hung from separate racks. Above each rack was a label that showed the actual size. Zack made his way to the 34s and got himself some boxers and jeans with a \"38\" tag. He also got himself a swim trunks He then made his way to the 40s and got some jeans, shorts and boxers for Cody with a \"34\" tag. He got Cody a pair of swim trunks as well. He finished by getting t-shirts for both and made his way out of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zack then decided to head to the grocery store to get some food to buy. He made his way to the diet food section and got himself some Weight Watchers cookies, cakes, ice cream, muffins. He stockpiled them and then went over to the regular section and got the calorie stuffed alternatives to the Weight Watchers brand. He grabbed the fudge muffins, double stuffed cookies, etc until the cart was full. He paid for the food and went on his way back home. On his way back, he stopped near a wooded area and took out the foods. Then he began opening the boxes and switching the food. He also took one of every package and either ate it or threw it away so if Cody asked why the boxes were opening, he could make up an excuse. Zack finished up with his switching and headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What to eat....what to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was surveying the kitchen. He had come out of the shower and was starving. His stomach grumbled. Cody looked inside the fridge.Nothing.Cody looked on the counter. There was the 20 bucks Carey had left for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm ordering out. I deserve it, I've been working out like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody took the phone and called the local pizza place. He ordered an extra large meat lovers and a root beer. Cody hung up and changed into some more comfortable clothes. He wore some huge pajama pants that were a gift from his grandma, who had accidentally ordered the incorrect size. However, Cody was out of luck when trying to find a larger t-shirt and had to settle for one that \" the laundry shrunk\".  The shirt was way too tight and Cody had to pull it down several times to prevent his gut from showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later and the doorbell rung. Cody opened the door and was greeted by the pizza deliever. Cody paid the man, took the food and closed the door. *<i><b>GROWL </b></i>* His stomach was protesting; it needed food now! Cody jogged to the kitchen and got some hot sauce. Then, he walked towards the couch. He put the pizza box, drink and condiments down and began to rest his bulk onto the couch. *<b><i>CREAKKK</i></b>* The couch had taken more and more punishment as Cody's waistline grew bigger. Cody shuffled around more and more to try and get his bulk situated comfortably. Small pinging sounds were heard as he shifted his bulk. He finally stopped with his body finding a comfortable position to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody opened the box and began taking slices to put on his plate. He took three slices at first and began to devour them. With a maximum of five bites per slice, Cody consumed the three slices in a blur. His body couldn't have processed all that food in just a minute and his hunger was still relentless. He grabbed 4 more slices out of the box and opened his root beer. *<b><i>MUNCH...SLURPP...BURP</i></b>* This continued on for 2 more minutes. Cody would pile the greasy,cheesy pizza down his throat ,sauce covering his lips. He then would take a swig of his root beer and resume. By the end, he had finished the 12 slice pie and his 750ml bottle of root beer. By now, Cody's belly had swelled up with pizza. It had bloated in size and was now pressing tightly against the waistband. He started to turn his body sideways and lie down on the couch. He subconsciously let his belly out from under his waistband and moved around to get comfortable. His eyes close and Cody falls asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack entered the house and could immediately smell an aroma of pizza. He smiled; Cody had ordered out again. He made his way to the couch where he finds Cody sleeping. Cody's gut was in view for Zack to see. With every breath, it would slightly push in then out. His shirt was unrecognizable amidst all his flabbiness. He slightly snored as well. Zack began to try and wake up Cody. After a few tries, Cody awoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what.....oh hey Zack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I came back from shopping and got our clothing. I also bought some diet food for myself....I see you already ate though.\" Zack pointed to the mess on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Huh..oh yea I just took some of the money Mom gave us. I didn't save you any cause you're on your diet, remember? C'mon Zack, you know how you can't resist.\" chuckled Cody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I suggest you clean up your mess on the table so Mom doesn't see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody heaved himself up from off the couch. The cushion, however, did not respond to the lifted weight. It was permanently squished; the shocks had popped. Cody began to yawn and stretch his shoulders outward. The shirt began to tear from the back, straight between the shoulders. The tearing relieved the pressure that Cody's gut was taking from the shirt and Cody continued to stretch, feeling less and less pressure as he did this. The armpit stitching began to tear as well. Once Cody was finished, the shirt had torn almost all the way down his back. Zack could see this from behind and saw Cody's huge love handles and rotund shoulders. Cody finally noticed the damage done to the t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It was getting old anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody took the trash out and the boys went to the bedroom to look at their new clothing. Cody took the bag and saw Zack's clothing on top first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Size 38....I'm guessing these are for you, Biggie.\" Cody continued until he found his clothing, <i>size 34 just like it said</i>. Cody began to put on his new clothing. After trying on his new jeans, he tells Zack they are kinda baggy. Zack tells him that he took the laundry machine into account when buying clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well in that case, you shoulda bought size 44 for yourself.\" laughed Cody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody put on his new t-shirt and flannel pajama pants. They looked somewhat baggy on him and hid his real physique. But it was a far-cry from 5lbs of potatoes in an 1 pound bag look he had going for the past two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So Cody...I was wondering if you wanted to have a swim meet in month or so. I've working out extra hard and want to set a goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well there has to be something it in for me...I mean why would a beat on a sack of lard like you for fun, I have limits you know.\" heckled Cody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Loser has to do the other's homework for the rest of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers shook on it and both continued on in separate directions, both figurative and literal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carey Martin was burned out and she knew it. She had just finished another wining and dining session with a couple of fans after her performance in the hotel. Over the past two months, Carey had been doing a little <b><i>more dining than wining </i></b> and the effects were showing. Even Carey knew she had overdone it a little too much after popping the button off of her jeans during a rehearsal last week. But after a life-long struggle with yo-yo dieting, Carey couldn't muster up the restraint to indulge herself and was giving in to temptation on the regular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the house sometime after midnight. It was spring break so the boys had just fallen asleep. She quietly closed the door and began to head towards her room. She entered and began changing out of her tight dress clothing. Carey had worn her baggiest top, a zebra print mesh shirt that was slightly see-thru around the stomach area. When the shirt was first bought it was meant to hang off her shoulders, but now it hung in other places as well. Carey began to take off the cut out top using her arms to bring the shirt over her head. Carey's arms had taken a major hit from this second assault of poundage, going from bat wings to jumbo wings. With no sleeves on her top, her arms jiggled freely as she took off shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Carey then began working on her pants. She had dressed in some wool dress pants that she had been wearing for quite a while. Since Zack had not planned for Carey to gain weight, he could not replace her clothing, meaning she would have to deal with certain nuisances from her widening waistline. These were the only dress pants Carey could attempt to wear because they had some stretch material in them. However, they had stopped buttoning up weeks ago. She was forced to use a belt to secure her pants up, causing a serious muffin top. She began to unbuckle her pants. First, she took the prong outside of the hole she had created on the belt not too long ago. Instantly, her stomach surged out and her fly zipped all the way undone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever had been left of her hourglass figure was gone, buried under a mountain of fat. Her once bulging gut had turned into a huge roll of fat. It had freed itself from the pants and was lying on her thigh area. She bent over and started to roll the pants down. Carey's lower half had taken the brunt of the gain however. The pants were like second skin on her thighs and calves. Her thighs were large and very thick; hints of cellulite were beginning to show.<br>\r\nCarey's ass had more than doubled in size since last. She had lost her bubble butt and was replaced with a wide load. As her hips got larger and wider, her ass transformed as well. None of her underwear could fit without bundling up and causing discomfort; some even had tears! She was wearing some granny panties as she bent over. Her ass crack was clearly visible, even a couple of cm of her ass as well. Carey had taken out her first foot and began taking out the other when she lost her balance. She began tilting over but luckily fell onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>GROAN</b></i>**<b><i>SPLINT</i></b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed made a long cracking noise but had not broken. Carey had landed ass first onto the bed with her belly out. Her butt had already made a crevice in the bed with the mattress sinking lower. She lifted herself up off the bed and made her way to her sweatpants to put on. Carey had been wearing the same sweatpants that had ripped during her first weigh in. Attributing it the washing machine, she had sewn the ripped seams and soaked it in vinegar mixture to help reverse some of the \"damage\". She began pulling up the pants and was having a slightly hard time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" C'mon....I haven't....gained....<i>that</i>....much......weight....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally got the sweatpants over her wide hips and covering (most of) her backside. You probably couldn't tell however with Carey's belly hanging over her waistline.  What Carey also failed to notice was her stitching had begun to tear, silent but deadly. Her once baggy t-shirt could now be mistaken for a halter top. Her flabby arms took up all the space in the sleeves, almost blending in with her. Her paunch was clearly poking out under the shirt. She turned off the lights in her room and began wobbling towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the freezer and retrieved her Ben&amp;Jerry's Choco-Chunk 1L container of ice cream. She closed the fridge, grabbed herself a spoon and headed towards the couch. Carey had been on this routine since the beginning of career as it helped relieve stress. This use to be her cheat meal..now it was a string of hay in a haystack. She grabbed the remote and settled her wide self onto the couch. It began to resist. As she let more and more of her weight go, the couch began to sink lower and lower. It finally stopped but was clearly way lower than normal. Carey however did not notice or (care to notice) and began shoveling the ice cream. With each large scoop, her body felt satisfaction. Years of holding back and restraint were being let go, Carey began scooping more and more. And as piled in more food, the couch got lower and lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 15 minutes later and Carey was about to pass out. She was pondering whether or not to get up and walk to her bed. She decided she was too tired and began trying to get into sleeping position on the couch. As she tried to lie down, the couch began protesting violently. Sounds of wooden parts began to be heard. Carey still pushed back and put her feet up on the couch. She started to rest her head on the end. She began drifting off to sleep when<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>SPLINT....CRACK</i>!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couch had finally given up after taking abuses from both Carey's and Cody's rotund rears. The back rests had split open and Carey fell into the back of the couch. This caused the couch to flip sideways because of Carey's size. She landed on the floor with her ass in the air. It looked ridiculously packed inside her sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What the heck....this couch is bogus. I'm complaining first thing in the morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to get up and had to balance herself out, while doing so she bent at the waist and well....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b><i>RIP</i></b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey's hands rushed to her butt. She couldn't understand she had sewn a new hole. Maybe she did need to check her weight for a reality check. Carey finished getting up and made her way to the bathroom. She approached the scale and used her feet to turn it on this time. The scale groaned as her heft made its way on. She looked down and saw....her boobs!! Carey had grown to the point that her boobs were in the way of her view point. And at this moment, one of her boys had woken up to the noise....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack appeared in the doorway, stunned at the what he saw. Carey's sweatpants were ripped both at the back and on the sides and inner thigh. Her t-shirt was tangled up, exposing her large belly hanging over her waistband. Her boobs were also sticking out but clearly not as far as her paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What is going on??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Zack. Could you do a favor for me.....I can't see how much I weigh, could you check for me? Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack approached the scale. He wasn't able to switch the weight since Carey had gotten on before but thanks to this new found development Zack could just tell her a false weight. He looked down and saw the number. It read out 239 lbs! Zack eyes widen....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That's like a 35 pound weight gain.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So what does it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...it says you weigh 184 lbs?\" lied Zack. He had to make the weight somewhat believable as Carey clearly knew she had put on a <i>little</i> bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my word, I've gained like 20 pounds. What am I going to do? I need to start working out immediately. Ugh, I really overdid it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Can I suggest something? I have some diet pills that I've been using and they been great in helping me lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh thank you, Zack. But I'd also like to start working out a bit. I gained <i>some</i> weight but I'm more into toning up as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, why don't you go to the gym Cody's been going to? I heard it is really cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That sounds great...I think I'm going to sleep on it. Thank goodness I have two great boys like you and Cody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey began going to her bedroom, her obtuse rear jiggling behind her. Zack sighed with relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He knew he had a big day planned ahead and needed the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ten hours later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zack woke up to the sound of the door closing. He looked around and saw Cody was still sleeping. He glanced over to his right towards his analog clock. It read 11:20 p.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh no, we're going to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack got up quickly and went over to Cody to wake him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wake up Cody or else we won't be able to go swimming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....whatat..mhfmf...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack tried to push him.

As he entered the room, he could hear groaning sounds coming his bedroom. Cody was beginning to get up. The mattress was ridiculous depressed where he had slept on. He struggled to heave himself out of the crevice he created. Cody created a bit of momentum and with a surge of positive energy lifted his bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began walking towards his closet to get changed. Cody started to take off his flannel pajama bottoms he had acquired 2 months ago. To say Cody was beginning to outgrow them would be an understatement. When Cody had started wearing the bottoms they hid his body, making it impossible to imagine what he looked like.  Now the pants were making the image too real. Cody's calves had really thickened up enough to wear the pants were stuck on them. With every step, his legs would jiggle with flabbiness; shocking for someone who worked out every week. His butt had filled with more and more fat to the point where the pajamas had given up trying to fit around his huge waistline, causing his butt crack to be shown at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing on his bottoms, Cody began taking off his top. He already had a little help however as the shirt could not cover his entire stomach. Cody's belly had gained a few inches, causing his belly to sink lower and lower nearly covering his entire groin area. It also had gotten a bit wider as well. Cody's man-boobs had also entered new territory, as the boobs expanded into the space under his armpits. The t-shirt left little to imagine as Cody had grown substantially since Zack bought the clothes for him. Two more months of <i>weight loss pills, workouts and fat-rich diet</i> had clear and indicative results on Cody's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Cody had taken off his pajamas, he started to put on his swim trunks to wear under his regular clothes. He grabbed the size \"34\" swim trunks and began to pull them on. Cody began pulling them and was successful....until he came to his thighs. Cody began to muster up his strength as he pulled to try and will the trunks up and over.  They began moving, but only at a snail's pace. Cody decided to get some leverage and walked over to his bed and lay down to help. The mattress didn't sink as their was  a dent the size of Cody's massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh..c'monnn.....\" groaned Cody. He pushed and pulled until finally he had gotten the waistband over his hips. He got up and saw that the trunks were not sliding down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on a slightly baggy t-shirt and some sweatpants over his trunks. He packed some pool slippers and made his way to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zack finished up in the bathroom and made his way to the bedroom to change. Unlike Cody, Zack's changing was a lot less strenuous and ten times faster. He finished up quickly and headed to the living room. He saw that Cody was preparing some food for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody, save it for later, you will get a stomach cramp or even worse, vomit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't worry, it's just a little snack.\" Cody then proceeded to pull out 4 waffles from the freezer and put them in the toaster. Zack shrugged and told Cody he would be waiting downstairs. He took his bag and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack went into the hotel's swimming pool and looked around. It was empty most of the time except sometimes during the afternoon. He looked at the diving board. It looked pretty old and the screws looked rusty. It must have been built when the hotel was made and hasn't been renovated since then. Zack looked around more and saw something pretty weird. A scale. And not just any scale it was a doctor's scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a scale? Perfect Zack, now we can weigh ourselves.\" Cody had appeared, finally arriving from his breakfast binge. Syrup was drizzled around his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Okay, I guess I'll go first...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody interrupted \" No, allow me I haven't weighed myself in a while and want to see my progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody walked by Zack. His stomach was clearly jutting over the waistband of his sweats. His overextended paunch was also sneaking outside of his t-shirt. He wobbled over to the scale while Zack followed. It was clear when he got near it, he could the scale was new. Weird. Cody began to undress for the weigh in. He started by taking off his shirt, causing his man-boobs to jiggle. Cody then took off his sweatpants, causing his trunks to slide down a bit, revealing a little too much crack. He took off his shoes and got on scale. It, of course, protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>*CLANK.....50......100.....150.......200!!!!.........250......*</i>{/b }<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale wouldn't go down! Zack rushed down to look at the scale's weight limit....250 lbs!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, he's a lardass.\" thought Zack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" This scale is clearly broken, I mean it couldn't stop at a number. First our old scale, now this, man digital is the way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright, let's get started with our swimming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody jumped off the scale, causing his mass to jiggle. The boys went to the far end of the pool, where the diving board happened to be......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let's jump off first!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I dunno, Cody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" C'mon stop being a wuss....I'm sure it can hold your fat ass ahah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright, fine...but I go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack began to walk onto the diving board. He began to make his way towards the end of the diving board. The diving board sunk slightly once he got to the ending. He started jump and down to gain momentum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One......two........three!!\" He jumped off the board while it spazzed in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b><i>SPLASH</i></b>* Zack had cannon-balled into the pool. He surfaced moments later, hair soaked in water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That was weak. Let me show you how to really do a cannon-ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody began making his way to the diving board. Zack watched as Cody's lard butt wobbled in unison towards the end. His butt crack was clearly showing as the waistband could not fit around Cody's belly. He finally made it to the diving board and began to get on. As he got his feet onto the board, a underlying metal sound began permeating from the diving board. He hefted himself up and the sound got louder. Zack could see Cody's body from the pool. His belly was out and covering his entire waistband. As he walked towards the end, it jiggled slightly. The diving board's groaning began to get louder and louder as well. It also began to depress more and more, weighed down by Cody's massive bulk. Cody reached the end and began to jump to try and get higher. This started a new louder metal sound when he would jump down onto the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b><i>GROAN</i></b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a couple of...*<b><i>GROAN</i></b>*....jumps...*<b><i>GROAN</i></b>*.....until.....I' m.....*<b><i>GROANNN</i></b>*.......high......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack could see this was not going to end well. The diving board could not hold Cody's jumping weight anymore. His body was wobbling all around, arms, legs  and belly. The swim trunks were sliding down a bit, revealing more and more of his fattened rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" There........we.......AHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b><i>CRACK.</i></b>.........<i><b>SPLASH</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody had landed on the board but stalled for some reason. This stalling caused Cody's weight to be doubled with his force onto the diving board, leaving it impossible for it not to crack where he had stopped. The diving board had split, causing Cody to tumble into the water. A sizable splash was still made,however. Cody had resurfaced and was angry and in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you serious? This incompetent diving board hurt my ankle. What type of hotel is this? First the scale, now this. I'm telling Carey about this. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys began getting out of the pool. Zack got out first, but then had to help Cody out. He grabbed Cody's hand and began pulling as hard as he could. He groaned a bit and Cody finally budged. Zack could see that Cody had a limp. He could also see that Cody's trunks were too low, showing most of his reddened buttocks. Zack grabbed Cody's clothes and Cody put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They walked out and took the elevator to their room. Zack thought too himself that this was an unexpected speed bump in the plan. However, he began realizing this wasn't a speed bump...it was a speed boost! If Cody had actually hurt his ankle, he would stop walking and might become a sloth. Coupled with the food, Cody could grow to proportions Zack hadn't planned for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" This is gunna be epic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack served Cody hand and foot for the entire month. Cody had Zack working like a dog, and Cody only moved to go to the bathroom. Cody would make Zack go get him his snacks (or meals for a normal person) and as soon as Zack thought he had a break to rest, Cody had finished his food and needed more. Zack allowed to be treated this way because he knew this would only make Cody bigger. And it did. In a month, Cody nearly blew up with fat, and Cody didn't even notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Cody's injury wasn't only effecting Cody. Zack never had time to work out, he never had time to make a healthy meal for himself, he only had time for Cody. Zack needed to feed himself, so he started eating some of Cody's fattening sweets. When Cody would order 5 pizza boxes (all for himself), Zack would eat at least 1 whole box. Soon Zack fell into his old ways, and was gaining weight again. Zack didn't notice it this time, however. He was too concerned about Cody's gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while Cody and Zack sat on the new couch, eating a bunch of chocolate bars, Cody's shorts ripped open. Zack was worried Cody would notice this and suspect he gained fat, since before he assumed it was the washer or his 'muscle' gain. When the button popped off, Cody didn't notice and continued eating. Zack had a sigh of relief, and Zack sat back to reach for another bar and they were gone.<br>\r\n\"7 dozen donuts Zack.\" Cody demanded and burped, and reached for the remote. Zack got up, with a little more trouble, and returned in 10 minutes with 10 large boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a sale for if you buy any amount, you get 3 free, so heres some extra.\" Zack said and placed the boxes down. He sat down next to Cody, and the twins brought a box to themselves and dug in. When the boxes were gone, Cody had 6 and Zack had 4. Zack was slowly eating more into Cody's food, and he was getting pudgier. While Zack's appetite increased, so did Cody's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Cody ordered for 10 boxes of pizza today, and Zack followed out through his order.<br>\r\n\"He ordered 5 just not that long ago, this is amazing! He's getting more of an appetite!\" Zack though excitedly. The 10 boxes came, and again they followed the routine of eating together. Cody ate 6 boxes and Zack ate 4. On his last box, Zack's button on his jeans popped off, and Zack was surprised. How could he gain weight if he was moving around all day? Zack assumed it was the washer, and kept on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 weeks passed since Cody's injury, and the doctor said it'd be healed in 8. In 2 weeks, Cody told zack to now get 20 boxes of pizza. Zack had to hold himself from screaming inside. Cody was getting so fat! After a half hour, Cody had ate 13 boxes of pizza, and Zack ate 7. Neither of them kept track of how much they were eating, just constantly wanting food in their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next 2 weeks, Cody and Zack's ratio of eating got larger and larger. When Zack got cakes, Cody would have 8 and Zack would have 4. When Cody wanted burgers, Cody would eat 20 and Zack would eat 14. With pizza, Cody would get 20 boxes and Zack would get 13 boxes, with donuts and other sweets Cody would still have the majority, but with any normal person eating Zack's amount would be unrealistic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the 8 weeks, Cody was eating all the fatty foods: burgers, pizzas, cakes, candy, donuts, ice cream, chips, ect. Cody got his cast off, and Zack wanted to see what the 8 weeks tole was on Cody.<br>\r\n\"I mustve lost weight since I haven't been working out. I need to get to the gym soon.\" Cody said, and he stepped on the scale. 376 pounds. Zack couldn't breathe. He changed the number to 178 to Cody, and Cody was satisfied.<br>\r\n\"An 8 pound weight loss isnt as bad as I though..\" Cody said, and got right back onto the couch and started eating some donuts. Zack stepped on the scale and it said 163. \"Guess all that running around did keep me in good shape.\" Zack said and sat next to Cody. However, Zack forgot to change the scale back to read the actual number. It was....</span></div></div>",

Next to Cody, Zack started stuffing more and more donuts into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with Cody able to walk, they both tried to get back to their normal routine. Cody tried to work out, but like the first day, he went there for 5 minutes, was tired out, and ending up eating for an hour at Mcdonalds. Zack tried to get back to his diet, but after a day of eating only salads, Zack had a feast full of goodies such as cookiee, donuts, chocolate everything. Although trying to lose more weight, they ended up gaining more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryday was a struggle to get on clothes. Cody tried to pull pants over his thick theighs but gave up quick to eat breakfast. Zack tried to button his jeans but failed. He constanly worr sweatpants that were too small for him, and that often lead to tears in the pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack was eating from an ice cream tub, his sweatpants again began to tear. \"What is with this washing machine?!\" Zack said and gulped down another spoonful. \"I'm gonna get us some new clothes, these are way too small.\" Zack said and he went downstairs to get a taxi, with teared sweatpants and a riding up shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there, Zack of course had to have some McDonalds. He ordered 15 big macs and 3 sides of large fries. He the entire meal on his way to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, Zack went to a clothing store and picked out clothes for Cody first. He got multiple pairs of the largest pants they had (5XL) and multiple shirts that he hoped would fit Cody. Next Zack searched for himself. He got a pair of his normal size, a medium, and found it was too small. He tested out a large in the changing rooms, too small. Zack tried an XL, small, and finally a 2XL was what he needed.

Both twins didn't realize their weight gain, and they just kept eating and eating. Zack checked out the clothes, and got a taxi on the way back to the tipton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the tipton, Cody was laying down on the couch. His stomach rumbled for food. Cody wanted to get up, but he was too lazy. He groaned and reached for the phone, He reached as far as he could and he couldnt reach. Soon, he fell on the floor with a loud thump. Cody got up, got the phone, sat back down, and called Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, on you way back, can you buy me some protein, like burgers. I need protein to keep up with ny workout, you should really try it.\" Cody said, smirking. Although the twins were oblivious to their own weight gain, they did notice each others. Zack smiled and pulled over to McDonalds, where he had just been. Zack ordered 30 triple bacon cheese burgers, excepting Cody to eat 25 of them. The tipton was still 10 minutes away, and back in the taxi, Zack started on the meal fit for 10 people, let alone 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack kept imagining Cody stuffing his face, getting his belly so big. Cody would probably rip the clothes he just got him! While Zack daydreamed, burger after burger left the bag and into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Zack got back ti the apartment, Zack had eaten everything except 2. Zack smiles evilly and gave the bag to Cody. Cody looked in, and was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think this is funny?!\" Cody asked. Zack's heart stopped. Did Cody notice Zack fattening him up? <br>\r\n\"Theres only 2 burgers in here!\" Cody yelled. Zack was confused.<br>\r\n\"No way, I ordered 30.\" Zack said, not understanding where they went. Cody rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n\"First of all, you should order 45 next time, how am I supposed to work out with no food in my body?! Second of all, you probably ate them on your way here: thats disgusting. Just eating without working out is why you got so fat!\" Cody said. Zack had to keep himself from laughing. Cody was the one doing this, not me, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody took the phone from the coffee table and called McDonalds. Ordering 45, they were okay to deliver and the burgers came soon. Once they arrived, in bags of 9, Zack and Cody each grabbed a bag, and started eating. Zack, for the first time, finished first and grabbed the next bag.<br>\r\n\"Look at him stuffing himself to the brim, disgusting\" Cody thought and shoved a burger in his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Look at him, getting so big the couch will break, amazing.\" Zack thought and shoved 2 burgers in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly 30 seconds after Zack finished his first bag, Cody did as well. He grabbed the next bag. 5 minutes later Zack grabbed the final bag and started eating. Cody looked up at him, with only 1 burger left in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Thats my bag!\" Cody said. Zack didn't know whether to give this to Cody to fatten him up, or satisfy his own hunger. 'He's gonna get fat anyways' he thought, and shoved a burger in his mouth. Cody reached over to Zack and tried to steal the bag. Zack turned around and continued eating. Cody got up and got ontop of Zack and their fat bodies were touching. Although both huge and fat, Cody was still bigger and Zack tapped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! You can have it!\" Zack said and handed Cody the empty bag. He was so mad. Zack started laughing. Cody got the phone and ordered more. He ordered the same amount, and when ir arrived, Cody surprisingly got up and took all 5 bags into his room: and locked the door. Zack, jaw to the ground, got up and tried to open it. When he couldn't he body slammed it. He didn't expect it to work, he was too light, but he did so anyways and his fat heavy body opened the door. Cody was on his bed, finishing the second bag, and Zack stole the remaining 3 and ate them in the locked bathroom. Cody, more civilized than body slamming, grabbed the phone for more. When Zack finished, the delivery man only came with 4 bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ate the store out, these are the only ones left for the day.\" He said, took his money and left. <br>\r\n\"Lets split it.\" Cody said, and they agreed on that. Overall, Zack did eat more, a lot more, than Cody. But in a month....</span></div></div>",

Zack, with a lot of trouble, got up and headed to his drawer. There was nothing in there, and he remembered yesterday he ripped his last pair of shorts. \"Looks like the washer is bag up to shrinking clothes.\" Zack shrugged. He went to Cody's drawer, and Cody also ripped all of his clothes. \"What a fatty.\" Zack thought, and his stomach rumbled. Zack walked through his room into the kitchen, and found the doorsil very tight walking by. He barely fit through it, but Zack dismissed it, looking for something to eat. Zack made stack high pancakes, and multiple plates. He made 10 plates, with 10 on each plate. \"Cody can have 8 of those,\" Zack said and started on his first plate. He finished his first, and his second, and figured since he was still hungry he could have 1 of Cody's plates, but 1 became 2, then 3, and Zack ended up finishing all 10 plates. What was weird to Zack, was that he was still hungry after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis routine became a regular, and this happened everyday for a month. Zack also was the last one in bed, eating multiple \"snacks\" after Cody fell asleep. During the day, Zack would also eat more than Cosy. Soon, Zack was eating a lot more than Cody daily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was eating a plate full of cookies when Cody woke up. \"Good morning Zack.\" Cody said. Cody was naked except for his underwear, as was Zack. Neither of them could fit into any of their clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so huge.\" They both thought.<br>\r\n\"That can't be healthy. He looks like a beached whale.\" Cody thought to himself. He told Zack everyday he was getting really fat, but he was worried for his health. Cody dismissed if, he always ate like this, he'd be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so sweet!\" Zack thought to himself. \"Cody's so big I'm surprised he can fit through the doors. And I'm not even near done fattening him up.\" Zack thought, and grabbed the last cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should weigh ourselves.\" They said together, both more interested in each other's weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stepped on the scale first. The original scale said 450 pounds. Zack of couse showed Cody a lower number. \"187.\" Zack announced. \"Man, I'm getting big.\" Cody said and flexed a muscle. \"Girls are all over me now!\" Cody said. Zack stepped on. \"194.\" Zack was shocked. He gained 40 pounds since his last weigh in a few months ago. \"I should cut back on some food\" Zack said, as he munched on somd chips. Zack made the same mistake as last time, forgeting to change the scale. Zack actually weighed 473. Zack was fatter than Cody, and it was starting to take a toll on the apartment</span></div></div>",

But by Cody's view, he might want to see how much Zack could handle the weigh since he didn't see him waddling through the door whether or not he was about to stuck at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it's aim now, and Cody's ambitions to get himself bigger to win over the ladies and it appears that he could find someone he knows how with that smirk on Zack, sitting on the couch eating as much as he could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm away to see the girls and think they like this size I gained, whilst you aren't get any, because you would be eating some food and get fatter.\"  Cody's tough words but with that smile knowing it was his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, good luck while you at it though!\"  Zack gives a lazy impression and continued eating before shrugged and exits their hotel with it much tight squeeze he take and closed the door, leaving Zack to be on his own for a moment or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's good having Zack have his own time, so that he won't have to bother from Cody's words personally, but then had though of an idea and even reach the milestone since he's about 25lbs bigger in actual weight than his twin brother.  While he was eating of course, he switches on the TV and it shows him a movie called 'Godzilla' which of course is Zack's favorite film, seeing a giant reptile and rampage through the city as much it can handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Godzilla, just as I like to watch in my spare time.  I wonder if this reptile be replaced by someone in large?  Oh well!\"  Zack shrugged to wonder and soon he was started to yawn just as minutes going through and started to fell sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the moment when a movie still rolling and it became Zack's dream.  The city are more like Boston in this and more modern to say the least.  The city was busy at this point and that was until they can hear some booming noise and ground rattling underneath their feet.  Neither of them didn't know what was going on at this point, until a man who had a clear view of it had a terror in fear and shouted to know what's going, getting closer as it gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Fatzilla!\"  A man screamed and soon everybody started to run into places and screaming along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everyone had finally spot where did this came from, and it's a fat giant boy with long blonde hair and in undies, weighing near enough 500lbs, he was standing as big as the biggest and when the people looked to see who's this Fatzilla they ask?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cody woke up and looked across the room to see that, for the first time ever, Zack had gotten up before him. He got out of bed and realised that it took more effort than usual to lift himself up. \"My arms must still be tired from working out\" he thought to himself which reminded him that it was time for him and Zack to test their progress in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was sitting on the suite's couch with a chocolate bar sticking out of his mouth wearing boxers and an open shirt. None of his shirts would do up over his bulging belly anymore and he hadn't even attempt to squeeze his fat butt into jeans. Upon hearing his brother entering the room, he sucked the chocolate into his mouth, swallowed it and began making his breakfast demands. \"Finally you're up.<br>\r\nI need you to make me some pancakes smothered in something sugary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, piggy. Today is our weigh in and it's best to do it on an empty stomach. Although it seems you're stomach is always full of chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I've only had one bar today\" Lied Zack while he gently rubbed his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That explains the six empty wrappers you've left on the couch\" Said Cody sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack frowned \"Fine. I'll show you how much weight I've lost.\" He knew he hadn't really lost any. All the time he said he spent in the gym had actually been spent at the candy counter, the rooftop icecream parlor or sneaking food from the hotel kitchen. His plump bloated body was a monument to his mighty appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later in the bathroom, Zack was standing on the scale in just his boxer shorts. Cody stood beside him, still in his pyjamas. The scale read 190. \"Zack you've gained 10 more pounds. I new you'd gotten even fatter\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have not. I've been working out must have grown some extra muscle. Unlike you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true.\" Cody stepped onto the scale and the number changed to 160. \"See. Nearly 20 pounds of muscle mass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I don't think it's muscle.\" Zack said and poked Cody's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked down. He saw a chubby belly sticking out over his waistband and his brother's pudgy finger was sinking deep into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack lifted Cody's pyjama shirt and gave his belly a pat, making it jiggle. \"Muscle doesn't wobble like that. You've chubbed up. Didn't you know you have to exercise as well as eat to bulk? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody blushed and pulled down his shirt which he now realised was skin tight and showed all his new curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed. \"Ha! And you called me a piggy. At least I didn't gain all my weight in one month. Pretty soon you're gonna be just like me.\" He grabbed his own belly in his hands, shook it and when he let go it continued to bounce. \"That's what you've got to look forward to.\" He laughed again and left the room, with His love handles jiggling up and down as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Zack gone, Cody took off his shirt and looked in the mirror. He sucked in his gut and tried to flex his chest to see what looked like pecs and a flat stomach. \"Not too bad.\" Of course, he couldn't hold it any longer than 10 seconds so soon his belly poured back out. He gave it a squeeze and it was incredibly soft like nothing he'd ever felt before. He lifted his hands and felt his chest which was soft and jiggly too. He didn't have pecs, he had moobs. Then he looked up at his face and it was completely round with a double chin like Zack's. He couldn't get the image of Zack's bouncing belly out of his head and he knew that if he didn't do something he'd end up the fatter twin. \"I've got to make sure Zack keeps on getting fatter. That way, I'll always be thinner.\"</span></div></div>",

Cody considered the work out idea, but he knew he'd just blow it over after a week. He then turned to the idea of Zack. If Cody can't slim down, at least Zack can gain weight and there will be more of a difference between the two.<br>\r\n\"As long as I don't gain weight, and Zack continues his eating habbits, I'll be fine!\" Cody said. He smiled and walked off, glad to resolved his problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 week later, Cody did try to maintain his weight. He tried eating salads only, but he always found a way to get piece of chocolate cake or a burger or 2. Cody slowly stepped onto the scale, seeing he gained 3 pounds in a week. He sighed. Zack, who continued to eat strongly, came into the bathroom and voluntarily stepped on the scale. 195, Zack gained 5 pounds in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh! Zacks right! I am going to be the size of him!\"<br>\r\nCody said. Cody tried to reavluate the situation, he was determined not to be the fatter twin. Just then, Carey called the boys for dinner. The two bigger boys walked into the kitchen to see 2 boxes of large pizza. The 2 sat down and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes Zack has eaten all of one box. Cody has finished 3/4 of the second box, and Zack started digging into Cody's slices. Cody allowed him too, and saw Zack's belly being pressured against his belt. Thats it! Cody had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he couldn't lose the weight, he could help Zack gain the weight. Just as Zack was finishing his last slice, Cody decided he would cook for Zack. Already, he was a good cook. It wad about time for dessert, so Cody got started on a cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later, a little past \"dessert time\", Cody's chocolate cake was finished. He made sure to add double the fattening ingredients to 'push' Zack in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack! I made a cake! Want to try a piece, or 2?!\" Cody called for his brother. Zack came out of his room, shirtless, and his belly jiggled as he walked.<br>\r\n\"Man does this look good!\" Zack said. Cody cut Zack a slice of the cake, almost the size of 1/4 of it, and handed it to Zack. As Zack started shoveling it in, Cody decided to try a piece, it was his cake afterall. Cody took a piece half the size of Zack's, and was surprised at how good it tasted. He decided to have another piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Zack finished the rest of the entire cake. His belly stuck out a large amount, and he didnt seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Cody wanted to do the same thing. Carey served the boys a big breakfast, and Cody prepared 2 cakes for lunch. He told himself both of these were for Zack, he wasnt to try a piece. However, when they finished, Cody couldn't help himself and he had a fourth of one cake. Zack finished the orher 1 ans 3/4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 months passed as Cody countinued this regime. After 2 months, Zack weighed _____ and Cody weighed ______</span></div></div>",

However from Cody's point of view, he was the master and Zack was his growing pet piggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Zack wasn't the only one who was growing out. Cody couldn't resist his own share of treats and was putting on a fair bit of weight himself. Zack noticed this and would tease him about it. \"You're really getting fat, Cody. Maybe you should go on a diet and leave all the goodies to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I need to taste them to make sure They're good. Plus I am basically a chef now so it's suitable for me to be a little fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than just a little. You're starting to turn into chef Paulo.\" Zack laughed but Cody didn't say anything back. He just watched as Zack's laughter caused his belly to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Cody was watching Zack happily chew a cookie when he wondered just how much he'd fattened him up. \"Zack I think we should weigh ourselves again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright but I'll need an extra large cake as a reward for not gaining weight this time.\" Zack said with a mouth full of cookies. He tried to stand but he had trouble lifting his hefty body off the couch. \"Can you help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody took his hand pulled. It was a struggle but together they managed to get Zack standing up.  Then the two plus size boys waddled to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stepped on the scale first and blushed when the number read 180. \"Oops. I suppose it just shows how delicious and addicting my cooking is. After all, they say never trust a skinny chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're far from skinny now, chubs. I'm surprised you can view the scale with your belly in the way.\" Teased Zack . He pushed Cody off the scale and stepped up, making the number rise to 220. Zack giggled \"What can I say? I'm a big guy with a big appetite and big everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was getting annoyed at Zack's attitude. \"And yet you tease me for my weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know we've both put on weight but on me it works, ha ha.\" Zack grinned and caressed his belly alluringly. <br>\r\nCody stormed off leaving Zack  to admire his Rotund figure in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cody regretted all the baking he'd done for Zack because he'd accidentally fattened himself up too. The weight didn't bother him at first but now he was obese, none of his clothes fit properly and  he was tired of Zack's teasing. So he decided to give up the baking that had made him and his brother so fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't stop Zack from himself, though. He simply started ordering room service instead of having Cody bake. Their mother had taken up extra shifts to the hotel which   allowed her family to unlimited room service. It also meant she was out the suite all day. So Zack was free to sit around all day chow down on all the snacks he ordered to the room. Zack also stopped going to school as he had convinced the teachers that he was sick. They still sent him homework but he just got Cody to do it for him. With no school, unlimited food and the suite to himself Zack was free to sit and eat all day every day. The lazy life he always wanted. He only ever stopped eating to sleep and even then he dreamed of food. He kept chocolate by his bed because he would always wake up in the middle of the night for a snack, then went back to sleep. Of course, the non stop eating was increasing Zack's weight and his body continued to expand. Every day his love handles got wider and his belly hung lower. Less than a year ago, most people would have said he was just \"pudgy\" or \"slightly chubby\" and now he was clearly past the point of morbid obesity. None of his clothes fit. He couldn't get his pants above his knees and his shirts wouldn't even cover his plump chest. This didn't matter to him, though as he never left the suite and his massive belly covered up his privates. So he stayed naked and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody had also outgrown his clothes but didn't bother to buy new ones because he had convinced himself that he was losing weight. Actually after he stopped baking his weight stayed about the same. He tried to stick to a diet but couldn't completely break the eating habits he'd picked up. He would eat healthily for a few days then reward himself with cheat day and pig out. Usually down in the Tipton restaurant so Zack wouldn't tease him or take his food. Cody couldn't be naked because he had to go to school so he would squeeze himself into Zacky's old clothes. The sweat pants were skin tight on his thick butt and flabby thighs. The shirts were even tighter around his stomach. They would only go down to his navel so his underbelly would hang visably out the bottom. At school, he tried to ignore the stares at his body and comments about his weight gain, but one day he heard something that really got to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Zack has gotten huge! He was always kinda chubby but now he is like the fattest kid in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not Zack. It's Cody. He let himself go and now it looks like he's the fat one\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody couldn't ignore that. He turned around and snapped at them. \"Hey, I am still the thin Twin! Zack is twice as fat as me now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twice as fat as you? That's impossible.\" Said one of the kids and the rest all started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've lost weight!\" Cody argued but it just made them laugh again. He was so embarrassed that he left school early and went back to the Tipton. When he got to the Suite, he went to the bathroom scale to in order to prove that he had lost weight. He stepped on the scale and the number 179.9 came up. \"I can round that down to 179. That means I've dropped a whole pound in just a couple of months... I deserve a reward. Maybe some chocolate.\" He went to the bedroom where he saw his brother sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was now so wide that he took up the entire width of his bed, each of his love handles were reaching edges. Cody reached for the pack of chocolate left on the bedside table but Zack awoke as he picked it up. \"You can't eat that! You'll get even fatter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're already way fatter than I am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But on me it works.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't even make sense. We're twins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I've alway been much more muscular. I have a strong body so I can carry a bit of extra weight and still be healthy and attractive.\" Zack stood up and pulled a flexing pose but any muscles he had were buried deep beneath fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoke scoffed at him. \"As if you're still strong. You don't look muscular and you're definitely not healthy. It's been so long since you did any exercise. You don't even realise how out of shape you are. You've turned into a big unfit blob.\" He smacked Zack's belly to make it jiggle. \"See, that's just fat. Muscle doesn't jiggle like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you how strong I am!\" Zack said Angrily. He shoved his brother. Cody fell onto the bed and Zack sat on top of him. The bed creaked and Cody whined <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me, you whale!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would but you might steal my food. I'll have to eat it all first to be safe.\" Zack took the pack of chocolate bars and started eating. He would gobble them down putting each one in his mouth whole. Soon all 10 were devoured. \"Ahhhhh. Those good\" he said while licking his lips and rubbing his belly. \"Okay. You can go now\" but as he went to get off Cody, the bed gave way. One of the legs broke and the whole thing collapsed. Both boys fell onto the floor \"Now look at what you've done. You're so overweight that you broke my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? You are obviously the heavy one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took both of us to break it. And don't act like you're not fat just because you're smaller than me. I can see that gut bulging out of your shirt... Don't worry though, I know how you can lose some weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How?\" Cody was surprised and curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just feed me instead of feeding yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't work. All that baking was what made me put on weight in the first place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking about baking. Basically I get out of breath from getting up and going back to the front door and back to collect room service. You can do it for me And If you are busy feeding me, you won't have time to feed yourself. I'll make sure there's no food left for you get fat on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to literally hand feed you? That's a dumb idea, even for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it for a week to if see you lose weight. Then you can stop if doesn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody agreed reluctantly \"Okay. I guess it can't hurt to try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ding dong*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great timing. That'll be room service now. How about you go get it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody got up and went to the front door. Zack climbed onto his brother's bed. He felt he deserved it as it was Cody's fault his own bed was broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody returned to the bedroom with two large boxes of Tipton Cupcakes<br>\r\nZack was excited for food as always.  He lay back and opened his mouth waiting to be fed. <br>\r\nCody opened the first box, took out a cake and put in Zack's mouth<br>\r\n Zack chewed quickly and swallowed \"Next.\" he demanded. Cody fed him the next one, then another. Zack was loving it. \"You got to rub my stomach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just to help me digest\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody thought that might be weird so he was reluctant but he started to rub Zacks belly.

He had always felt like the weak twin and was secretly jealous of his brother's fuller figure. That was why he had wanted Zack to lose weight. Now, while Cody was still smaller than Zack, he no longer felt scrawny and pathetic. He put his hand on his belly and felt how nice it was to have some padding there. He started to rub it and thought about how much he had enjoyed the cakes he had been eating and how delicious his cooking was. The only problem with his weight gain was the teasing from Zack but that only came when Cody provoked him first. \"I'll do it.\" He said to himself. \"I'll let myself go and enjoy getting fat with Zack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, meanwhile, was in the main room of the suite. Waiting impatiently for the doughnuts he had ordered as room service. He was in love with food. Every time he took a bite into something sweet was such an incredibly pleasurable moment. It wasn't just the taste he loved though. He adored\u200b the feeling of being stuffed. It felt so satisfying to fill his stomach as much as possible. It was so fun to feel his belly go from soft and jiggly to full and bloated. The bigger Zack's belly got the more fun it was to fill it up. By now, of course that belly was enormous and Zack would eat constantly to feed it. He especially loved to rub it as he fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding Dong!\" <br>\r\nThe suite's doorbell rang and Zack waddled excitedly to the door. His belly, moobs and love handles bouncing as he went.  He opened the door to the delivery boy who looked back in awe at the fattest boy he'd ever seen. <br>\r\nThe delivery boy  couldn't help but stare at the huge doughy belly hanging over far too tight boxers which were squeezing into big bulging hips. He looked up the at the fat customer's round smiling face, complete with wide chubby cheeks and a thick second chin, and didn't quite recognise him. \"Zack Martin?\" He asked, unsure.<br>\r\n\"That's me\" Zack said, confidently. <br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, you look different.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think I might be putting on some weight. Does it really show?\" Zack asked cheekily with his hands on his chunky hips. <br>\r\n\"Kinda... And it explains the two dozen cream filled chocolate covered doughnuts.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh those smell amazing.\" Zack said as he took the box and turned around. He carried the box over and placed it down on the low table in the<br>\r\nMiddle of the room. As he bent over to do so, his plump booty overstretched his boxers and they loudly ripped at the back.<br>\r\n\"I guess that answers answers your question.\" The delivery boy laughed as he closed the door.<br>\r\nZack didn't mind. \"Wow! My butt must be really powerful!\" He said proudly \"I guess I'm growing out everywhere.\" He gave his butt cheek a slap and felt it jiggle. \"Ooh. That explains why sitting down has felt so comfortable lately.\"  His stomach let out a grumble. \"Sorry girl I didn't mean to let you go hungry.\" He said while stroking his underbelly affectionately. \"Time for doughnuts.\" He opened his box, picked up a doughnut and gave it a lick. \"Mmm chocolate.\" Then he placed it in his mouth whole and chewed in pleasure. This it what Zack lived for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Cody came out of the bathroom. Hoping to pig out Zack-style. </span></div></div>",

No doughnuts for you.\" Zack took the doughnut from Cody and ate it. <br>\r\nCody whined. \"That's so unfair. You're a fat pig and you never share.\" He went to take another doughnut but Zack pushed him away. <br>\r\nCody pushed him back, making Zack's huge belly jiggle like jelly. <br>\r\nZack lunged at Cody knocking them both over. The two chunky, half-naked boys wrestled on the ground. Their blubbery bodies jiggled all over as they fought to get on top of one another. Their mobs were bouncing and their bellies were wobbling like crazy. Eventually Zack, being heavier and stronger, ended up on top of his brother. His bigger belly squashed down on Cody's. <br>\r\n\"I told you I'm a beast.\" Zack claimed victoriously. He repositioned himself into a sitting position, still on top of Cody. He then farted loudly and sighed in comfort as his brother winced in disgust. \"You're rather comfortable. You've gotten softer but not stronger.\" <br>\r\nCody wheezed. \"It's your big fat butt that's soft. You're sooo heavy! \" <br>\r\n\"Exactly and if you don't want to be crushed by me again, you better leave all food to me.\" Said Zack. <br>\r\n\"Just get off me!\" Cody yelled. He tried to push Zack off but the weight was too much for him. Eventually he gave up. \"Fine. I let you have all the food in the suite.\"<br>\r\nZack decided that Cody had learned his lesson so he got up and went back to the couch, to continue his doughnut feast in peace. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Cody's first day at the gym. He saw a lot of people working out, sweating, and Cody felt eary at rhe sight. He wish he hadn't gained the weight so he didn't have to do this. Cody decided he wanted to weigh himself before he got started.<br>\r\n\"181.\" Cody read. He gained a pound in a week; not that bad. Cody got started on a treadmill and set it at the lowest pace, and to increase every minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 minutes the treadmill move from a fast walk to a jog. Cody found himself incredibly tired. However he pushed throught. After 3 minutes it was a fast paced jog and Cody felt like dying. He got off the machine. He was sweating bullets and sat down. \"Damn\" He panted. Cody looked over at the weights and picked up the lightest: 5 pounds. Cody lifted for 1 minute before losing his breath again, and he sat down.<br>\r\n\"This is harder than I thought,\" he said. Cody looked out the window, seeing a McDonalds sign. He wanted every part of his body to be there right now. He lifted himself from the bench and walked over. \"That was a good enough workout for day 1.\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody ordered 4 Double Cheeseburgers. Knowing Zack would want some, he ordered 10 more for his fat brother. He then got a cab and was on his way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cody was gone, Zack had 5 large pizzas ordered. He ate them all after 20 minutes and found he was still hungry. He looked all over Cody's cabinets, feeling like he hasn't eaten in days. Zack was starving and there was nothing to eat. Zack went down into the lobby desperate for food. He saw there was a limited time all-you-can-eat-buffet in the dining hall, and this was the first time he found himself running to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, a large buffet of fattening foods were layed out. Pizzas, burgers, cakes, donuts, brownies, Zack was astonished. He didn't know where to start. His belly rumbled and he lumbered to the desserts. 5 large wedding cakes were out on display, expecting to have many people eat from them. Zack took the entire cake to a table and started gorging himself. After 45 minutes Zack had finished. His hunger was gone, but not his desire to eat. He went up and filled his plate with 10 brownies, 5 burgers, 5 donuts, and a ton of cookies. Zack ate on, and shockingly saw Cody return. He was gone only for an hour, spending 15 at the gym, 30 at Mcdonalds, and 15 on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been here?\" Cody looked at his brother. He did manage to put on an outfit before leaving the apartment. However, there was no doubt it didn't fit. His jeans didn't zip and his shirt barely covered his belly button. There was no doubt Zack was huge.<br>\r\n\"Not that long.\" Zack said as he took a bite from a burger Cody had given him. Cody rolled his eyes. However, joining Zack didn't seem like such a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went up for some more food, and they each got identical plates of burgers, pizzas, and pieces of cake. Throughout the night, Cody went back up to the buffet 3 more times, unable to control himself. Zack went up 6 more times, gladly eating everything in sight. After an hour had passed the boys were full and retreated to the appartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being in the magical sense of food, the boys saw themselves in the mirror. Zack had ripped his jeans in shirt and he stood with only his boxers digging into his sides. Cody's gut couldn't be covered by his shirt, and his jeans were already torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the only time Ill ever do that.\" Cody said to himself. The next 5 days however, Zack and Cody took advantage of 'limited time'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the buffet would only be available for 5 more days; the twins ate there day and night. Zack ate double the food Cody ate, and double the speed. Zack always had food in his mouth and was always hungry. Cody, however, wasn't that much differenr. He continued to eat on alongside his brother. The twins shared 2 wedding cakes, Cody eating a half of it, and Zack eating the rest. The boys always bust out of their clothes after their feasts, and even then ate more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 days had passed and Zack and Cody sadly ate on the couch. There was no more buffet. The two ate their food quietly. Zack was eating 3 cakes as Cody ate 1. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably weigh ourselves.\" Cody said.<br>\r\n\"After this last piece!\" Zack said and finished off his cake. The two slowly got up. Cody got on the scale first.<br>\r\n\"191\" Zack said, reading for Cody, since he couldn't see over his gut. \"I gained 10 pounds in 5 days?!\" Cody thought. So much for losing the weight.<br>\r\n\"Theres no way I'll be able to lose 50 pounds.\" Cody said.<br>\r\n\"You're right Cody!\" Zack said, eating another cookie. \"You're too far in, now all you can do is eat!\" Zack said, acting like Cody's fat subconscious. Cody sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack got onto the scale. \"242\". Cody told Zack. \"You gained 22 pounds in a week...\" Cody reported. \"Eh.\" Zack responded and continued to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody considered what Zack said, giving up and eating. He remembered how he felt after 15 minutes into the gym: he wanted McDonalds so bad. He couldn't do that again. However, he ultimately decided to</span></div></div>",

Cody hoisted himself up- getting harder as the days pass by, and walked into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was stuffing himself, as usual, with a huge breakfast.

I'm almost a hundred pounds heavier than you. And it won't be almost when I get my hands on that feast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stayed in his underwear now, as nothing else would fit him, and even his undies were getting stretched to their limits. His belly was now quite large, and he could barely see his toes when he looked down. His butt cheeks were now the size of large bowling balls, and his moobs were now prominent, nearly the size of cantaloupes. He now had a double chin, and his limbs were thick and jiggled whenever he moved them quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody said, \"Fine, I'll make you a feast.\", and he began by going out and getting the ingredients. Cody had to wear a pair of sweatpants and his biggest shirt, but he was able to cover his belly, though barely. People stared at him as he filled the cart with various ingredients for lots of food. At the grocery store, Cody got an idea, though. He thought \"If I make the feast big enough, Zack might get too full. He'll be so full and lethargic that I can have the leftovers without resistance!\". With this in mind, Cody filled the grocery cart, even piling food up on it, and he made sure to get plenty of cake ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Cody had gotten back home. He began cooking his heart out, having the feast all planned out. He made spaghetti, filling a large dutch oven. He made three chickens worth of fried chicken. He made a dozen double cheeseburgers with extra bacon and cheese, and he made a half a dozen steaks with all the fixins. Finally, he made his biggest cake ever, and it was twenty layers high. He even needed some long wooden dowels to balance it. It was nearly as tall as he was. He was cooking for both of them, hoping he'd be able to get some food in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, all was ready. He brought over all the food to Zack, but he kept the cake on the counter. \"What about the cake?\" Zack asked. \"Not until you finish your meal.\" Cody said in a nagging tone. Zack said, \"Whatever. I'll get my hands on that cake soon enough. Besides, this stuff looks good, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then began digging in. He started with the burgers, taking one in each hand and taking enormous bites out of each. He made pretty short work out of the dozen, his belly now sticking out a little more. Cody watched in awe as Zack quickly moved to the fried chicken, eating the wings in one bite, and the legs in only two bites. His belly continued to bloat out as he moved to the steaks, opting to grab them with his hands and take huge bites out of them. His belly was now touching the table, and was reaching his knees. He merely scooted his chair back, then moved onto the spaghetti, eating a continuous stream of pasta before downing the extra fattening meatballs. Cody was amazed that Zack was even able to eat this much.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow, Zack, whose belly was now sticking out past the end of the chair...</span></div></div>",

Soon, Zack finished the entire feast, and was craving for more. Zack's appetite seemed bottomless. <br>\r\n\"Cody! The cake! I can still fit in a lot more room, and im still a bit hungry!\" Zack called. Cody slowly brought over the heavy, wedding cake and placed it in fromt of his hungry brother. Zack took his hands and grabbed the peices of the cake with his hands, ignoring the utensils given to him. He geabbed a piece in both hands, and took 2 bites to finish a piece. He was onto the next, and the next, and the next. Cody still had hope Zack wouldn't finish the cake. The cake was made for 30 people, theres no way Zack could eat it all... could he. Zack was soon halfway through the cake and he didn't look like he was going to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody could only imagine how this feast helped Zack's lead on him. He was already almost 100 pounds over him, he wondered how big Zack was going to get. Cody's daydreaming was put to an end when he heard loud creaks from Zack's Chair. Everything Zack sat on creaked, but this sound was loud and alarming. Zack continued on eating, and with nothing better to do since he wasnt allowed to eat during Zack's feast, Cody grabbed the packet that came with the dinning set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chairs' weight limit is 300 lbs\". Cody read aloud. Zack must've been well over the limit by now. He was 3/4 done with the cake and the chair didnt stop creaking. After a few more bites, the chair broke! Zack fell with it, and Cody helped him up. He hoped Zack would let go of the cake since he became too big for the chair, and Zack was going to ______</span></div></div>",

When Zack was getting fatter, he was initially oblivious, but then when Cody decided to let himself go, Zack would make fun of him. On top of that, if he tried making fun of Zack, Zack would be proud of his weight. Even when Zack said that he was entitled to more food because he was the bigger brother, Cody decided to challenge him, but then lost, making Zack even bigger inevitably. There was no winning with Zack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Zack had finished everything that Cody made, Cody saw that he had no chance at getting bigger than Zack, and as a result Zack would just keep taking his food while hogging his own. Cody realized that the only way to stop Zack from taking his food was to keep him full enough not to want it, and that seemed impossible. At this point, Cody thought that his best option was to just let Zack take some of his food when he wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was still going to enjoy himself and eat what he wanted, but he had to keep in mind that Zack was going to get some as well. Cody at least took solace in the fact that Zack was out cold now. He could have some food without Zack interrupting! He had already done lots of cooking, though, so he got himself three dozen doughnuts. Hoping Zack wouldn't wake up, he gorged on the doughnuts. After finishing all the doughnuts, he was full to bursting and wondering how Zack could pack it all away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, after he finished the doughnuts he heard a ripping sound. He looked over by Zack to see the legs of his boxers begin to rip from the strain of holding his legs in. Cody saw Zack's thighs, butt, and the bottom of his belly expand out slightly, being freed from their prison. At this point, Zack's unmentionables were hidden under his belly. Either way, Zack's waistband hung on valiantly, and though it was straining, it bisected his belly, making a muffin top on both sides of the waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody played some video games in his room for a while before he heard Zack begin to stir. It was early afternoon, and Zack scratched his belly. \"Man, that was a good meal!\" He said to himself. \"I wonder if I can get Cody to do this again!\" he thought to himself. It was probably not going to happen at this point, but Zack could always try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Zack said, \"Cody, can you get the scale?\". Cody was curious to say the least, so he decided to get Zack the scale. \"Why do you still have that waistband on? Isn't it uncomfortable?\" Cody asked as he got the scale. Zack then said, \"I'm gonna break it off with my belly in no time!\" Cody shrugged and put the scale down for Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you broke 300.\" Cody said. \"Just give me the number!\" Zack said before Cody read off the number.

He had deluded himself into thinking he had a six pack and muscular arms, when in actuality, he had grown fatter than ever. He'd munched, snacked and glutted himself at Tony's and had stuffed his face every night when Carey and Cody were asleep. He had deluded himself and Carey in to thinking that he was eating more because he needed more energy to train for the swimming competition; in actuality, his gluttony had been on an eating spree and he had piled on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody, like Zack, had gained weight; he had not dieted at all, but as long as he was skinnier than Zack, he didn't care; he, like his brother, had munched, snacked and glutted himself at Tony's but had not stuffed his face at night and was ten pounds lighter than his ever fattening brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Zack exclaimed, flexing in the mirror again \"A muscular six pack and a muscular arms. Cody, you're going down!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Cody replied \"I'm going to win; you'll see! You haven't gained muscle, but have gotten fat instead.\"<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Laughed Zack \"You're just afraid of putting on your speedo as you know you've grown too fat for it!\"<br>\r\nCody snatched his speedo off of Zack, who began to change into his; Cody slipped his speedo on and felt a pang of tightness.<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Groaned Cody \"It's worse than I thought.\"<br>\r\n\"What did I say?\" Laughed Zack, turning to Cody \"You're too fat for your speedo! You look like a stuffed sausage! Maybe if you'd gone on a diet, like you'd intended to, then it'd fit better.\"<br>\r\nWhile Cody's speedo was only tight on him, Zack's was straining and his immense belly hung over it, wobbling with every step he took. They pulled on their clothes and got a cab to the leisure centre.<br>\r\nThe two changed out of their clothes and readied themselves on the diving board. All of the other competitors had thick rippling muscles and Zack and Cody looked very fat compared to them.<br>\r\nThe horn sounded and everyone leaped into the water. Cody felt himself sink to the bottom and began kicking his legs to push himself upwards. Zack, heavier than Cody, sunk a little further and kicked his legs desperately. As he reached the surface of the water, he saw Cody a little way ahead, his legs kicking desperately to haul his fattened frame around. Zack kicked his legs and began to swim after Cody, but after only a few yards, had to raise a hand to be rescued by the life guards as his weight had began to pull him downwards and he was growing tired.<br>\r\nA few moments later, Cody too, was hauled out of the water. Zack, being first to be hauled out of the water, graciously conceded defeat and he and Cody headed to the changing rooms to dry off before changing, getting in cab and driving to MacDonalds where they stuffed their faces on burgers.<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we tell Mum?\" Cody inquired, as he finished his first meal.<br>\r\n\"That we came in second and third.\" Zack replied \"That way, we don't have to show her a trophy.\"<br>\r\n\"So, do you believe me when I say you've gotten fat?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Zack conceded \"I do. I've packed on a few pounds, but so have you, and it's not my fault you're bigger. You took that job, you should fear the consequences.\"<br>\r\n\"So should you, chubby\" said Cody, who took a bite out of his second burger, which was placed in front of him \"I should go on a diet.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, eating a burger...what a great way to start\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"The best way is by weighing myself first, I'll slow down gradually on the junk. Then I'll go on a diet...after a bowl of ice cream....or some fries...mmmmm...I'm sure I can eat in moderation.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go to those scales\" said Zack.<br>\r\nHe threw the rubbish in the bin and took out a few dollars. He and Cody headed out of the MacDonalds, which was in the mall, and across to the Doctor's office, where there was a scale that anyone could use. Zack inserted a dollar into the machine.<br>\r\n\"When did we last weigh ourselves?\" Asked Zack.<br>\r\n\"We were at the doctors two months ago\" said Cody. \"I was one hundred and twenty eight pounds, you were one hundred and thirty six.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm sure I'll be ok now.\"<br>\r\nZack inserted the number fourteen into the machine for his age, followed by his previous weight of 136 pounds. The machine read <i>HEALTHY WEIGHT</i>. He then stepped on. The scales shot to a result instantly - 157 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Well, well...twenty one pounds in two months, you probably gained one and a half stone when you started working at Tony's two months ago. Man, check what the scale says!\"<br>\r\nThe words <i>ALMOST OVERWEIGHT</i> were in bright red letters above Zack's reading.<br>\r\n\"So what, my extra pounds are part of me now.It'll be gone next semester. Your turn, Mr Skinny...\"<br>\r\nChuckling, Cody inserted his money and got on the scale. He typed his age, and then his old weight of 128 pounds. The scale read <i>ALMOST UNDERWEIGHT</i>.<br>\r\n\"See, I needed to gain a little anyway\" smiled Cody, rubbing his gut. The scale went up to....- 144 pounds. Cody gulped nervously and waited for the machine reading. It came as <i>BEYOND HEALTHY WEIGHT</i>.<br>\r\n\"Oh...errmmm....I must have taken it a little too far.\" groaned Cody, stepping off. He raised his shirt again and looked at his gut, concerned. His flat stomach wasn't there anymore, it had become bigger and more noticeable. But while Cody's sweater vest only revealed a trace of his overeating, Zack's T-shirt was under strain. It didn't quite cover him and it showed every pound of his weight gain.<br>\r\n\"Not exactly super-fit are you?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up. My extra sixteen pounds are a little more spread out than your whopping twenty one.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, we've both gained more than a stone\" snorted Zack. \"If your not careful, you might get bigger!\"<br>\r\n\"That's never gonna happen. I'm not even gonna try and diet, being beyond healthy weight isn't that bad. I'll be in perfect shape soon. Come on, I'm hungry. Let's go back to MacDonalds.\"<br>\r\n\"So much for a diet.\" Zack noted.<br>\r\n\"I'll start tomorrow.\" Cody replied. </span></div></div>",

You've both gotten so fat lately, so greedy, so lazy. You haven't played Basketball in weeks, Zack. Maybe you should rejoin the team again? It might help you lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fourteen, Mom,\" protested Zack, crossing his arm and making his big belly look bigger than ever as his shirt moved to accommodate his arms and revealed a few scant inches of pudge hanging out. \"We're going through puberty; some weight gain is natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you're right,\" agreed Carey. \"Alright, go on.

I could run there, but you're too fat to keep up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm coming. Can we stop to get another chocolate bar from the Candy Counter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody chuckled. \"No wonder you're fat, Zack.\" Despite everything, his belly rumbled. \"Yeah, alright. I could use a chocolate bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not fat!\" snapped Zack, walking after Cody and shutting the door behind him, attempting to zip his coat - which was too small for his belly - up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Let's hope he hasn't replaced us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hasn't,\" replied Zack. \"I rang him up yesterday when Mom was out; he's got in some new flavours made from a new concoction for us to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big bellies of both twins wobbled and rumbled. \"Mmmm,\" moaned Cody. \"Mmmm. I can't wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor me,\" Zack pressed the elevator with a pudgy finger and fiddled with his coat again, sucking in his belly to get it to fasten.

He then proceeded to get up and stretch, causing his tight t-shirt to ride up on his stomach. He wore a pair of tight white briefs and tube socks, as well. 15 additional pounds had been added to his already chubby frame, and it was quite noticeable. His face was clearly rounder and his double chin more prominent, and his belly and moobs had also grown quite a lot over the few months. Cody looked down and cupped his big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal, I'll just start my diet soon and everything will be fine...\" He told himself, although deep down he knew that would not be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Cody, Zack had awoken. Since the two had begun gaining weight, many of Zack's habits had begun to rub off on to Cody. As the school year began, Cody grew lazier and more gluttonous. He had stopped doing much of his school work, causing his grade to drop dramatically. The two also began dressing the same, in a similar fashion to how Zack had always dressed. The two had grown to be nearly identical, and had spent most of there days playing video games, watching television, and of course stuffing their faces. It was also clear Cody had become a slob, possibly more-so than Zack had ever been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, big boy!\" Zack said while placing his hands on his brother's big moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop that!\" he said as Zack proceeded to squeeze his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed and took his hands down. He began to look for some clothes when he got a wiff of Cody's body odor. \"Man, Cody, you smell awful! You really let yourself go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody laughed awkwardly, although his statement had definitely been true. He had become a slob, and was in denial of it. He couldn't resist doing it though because he secretly enjoyed this new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, you need to get ready to go to school!\" their mother told them from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys groaned. Although Cody used to enjoy school, he had lost all focus and drive and was now quite literally just like his twin. The boys tried finding clothes that fit, but of course everything had gotten too tight. They settled on wearing tight t-shirts along with gym shorts. They jiggled their way out the door. </span></div></div>",

Sometimes he even took a detour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hot summer day in Boston, both twins slept in their underwear, otherwise it would be too hot. Cody was the first to get up. He looked at his watch: 8:14 sun. Sun meant sunday. As Ton\u00fd's was closed on sunday, it meant the twins had the day off. Cody was surprised, normally his brother would already be up watching bad cartoons. Cody turned to his personal mirror. He had been cycling for 2 weeks now and it showed. His legs were bigger, he was forced buy bigger pants. His midsection however had stayed the same. Cody wonvinced that he hadn't put any more weight on, maybe he even lost a little. He decided to to weigh himself. He walked into the bathroom, carefull not to wake his brother and his mother sleeping on the sofa. The bathroom scale shot to a result almost instantly... 139 lbs. Cody smiled and grabbed his belly which was now noticeably smaller than 2 weeks ago. Suddenly he noticed a shadow covering his legs. It was Zack standing right next to him. Unlike Cody, Zack didn't try to lose weight. Instead, he ate more and more icecream at Tony's. His body got bigger, just like his appetite. His belly hung over his underwear, it was lined with read stretchmarks jiggled with every step Zack took. His chest was a lot flabbier, and could easily be called man boobs, which jiggled slightly as pulled his pants up over his lovehandles.<br>\r\n\"Morning Zack! Slept well?\" Cody said to his brother, trying to hide his feelings about his weight<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Cody, just a little hungry how about you make some breakfast for the three of us?\"<br>\r\n\"While you do what? Have a little snack before breakfast?\" Said Cody with an annoying voice, while slapping Zack's belly<br>\r\n\"Maybe I will! What's so wrong about eating healthy!?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe because it's not!\" Cody nagged as he walked out of the bathroom and towards the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack took a good look in the mirror. He noticed he had some new stretchmarks and his man boobs looked bigger. He didn't care though he thought he was still fitter than Cody. And to prove it he would weigh himself. 160 lbs... that's what it said. Zack flexed his arms. <br>\r\n\"Huh i'm probably still skinnier than Cody, just look at my muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Cody and Carey both looked up toward the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go see what's going on.\" Cody said to his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up from his breakfast at the kitchen table and walked to the bedroom he shared with his twin brother. Zack was standing in the middle of the room with his tight black skinny jeans stuck halfway up his thighs and beneath his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody couldn't believe it. \"I knew you were getting fat, but this, this is just too good.\" he burst out laughing at the sight of his bigger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Shut up Cody, snapped Zack. \"You or Mom obviously shrunk them or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his back to Cody and continued jumping up and down to get the jeans up to his waist. His stomach wobbled with each jump as his feet heavily hit the floor beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack finally got the jean up and around his waist, even undone his belly and back fat spilled out around the entire rim of the jeans, with each movement he made his soft midsection jiggled and spilled forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody was still standing in the door way watching his brother. Zack spun around and snapped at Cody, \"Unless you're going to assist, get lost.\"  Zack grumbled and looked down at his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody left the bedroom, still laughing. \"It's okay Mom, Zack's just far too fat for his jeans and won't admit defeat. Carey looked slightly concerned over the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the bedroom Zack begun on trying to button the jeans. He held in his stomach as far as he could, closed his eyes and tried to bring the button to the material. He struggled for about 30 seconds before going red in the face and his belly gushing back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" Zack said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried it again, the button not even making it remotely close to the hole on the other side. His entire midsection spilled out all over the jeans, and the waistband rubbed tightly against his flabby underbelly. He looked absolutely stuffed as his belly bulged out over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuff it.\" Zack thought. \"I'll just wear them undone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to rummage through his draws for a t-shirt. He pulled out a medium sized grey t-shirt. He pulled it on over his head. It was rather tight around his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to his side and looked in the mirror. The t-shirt was stretched tightly around his flabby middle and his stomach was pushing the limit all around the fabric, he could see the outline of his belly button through the shirt and his stomach could be seen wobbling slightly with each breath. The shirt only just covered the unbuttoned jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too damned hungry to spend anymore time with this, I'll just have to keep my arms down.\" Zack muttered and walked out of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to</span></div></div>",

As he sat down his belly poured out over the straining, already undone jeans waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly rolled right out over the button which digs into Zack's underbelly, leaving it red and marked as the button disappeared completely under his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof.\" He said to himself as he felt a ping of pain from the metal button digging into his soft, rounded gut. He tried to adjust himself in a way to make it more comfortable. He stuck his finger between the waistband and his belly to try to adjust it slightly. The jeans were so tight and there was so little room between the two that the circulation in his finger almost got cut off due to the immense pressure his weight was placing on the waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sever come over with a menu, and his finger was still stuck between his belly and waistband. He struggled to suck in his belly and pulled his finger out from under it.

The waitress was shocked, but she went back to the kitchen to give the large order to the chef. Zack finished up the last of his eggs while his order arrived, and he began to eat again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his second meal, he decided he was full. He paid the bill and walked out to a cab, which drove him back to the tipton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack entered his suite, to find only Cody snacking on some granola bars. \"Where did you go?\" Cody asked. <br>\r\n\"IHop, had a huge meal,\" Zack smiled at the thought. He went to the fridge, pulled out a carton of ice cream and a spoon. He plopped himself next to Cody and began eating the ice cream. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing? You just said how big a meal you had?!\" Cody exclaimed. <br>\r\n\"I just walked from there to here! I walked up an appetite!\" Zack said.<br>\r\n\"I saw the cab pull in!\" Cody said.<br>\r\n\"Why are you so concerned about my weight? You should be considering yourself, fatty!\" Zack yelled.<br>\r\n\"Because I'm worried about you! Its unhealthy! And i am, notice the bars!\" Cody said, hiding the bag of chips under the couch. <br>\r\n\"Well dont! Im fine!\" Zack said, and finished off his carton of ice cream. He got a new bag of chips, and went to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody rolled his eyes. \"Why cant he see how fat he's getting?\" Cody thought to himself. \"How can I make him realize...\" Cody began devising a plan to show how unhealthy he is, so he can turn around his eating habits. Cody kept thinking while he munched on his bag of chips.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can fatten him up to the extreme to see how fat and unhealthy he is, and I can help him lose all the weight!\" Cody thought, and stuck with the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody jumped up and began to work on a huge plate of brownies for Zack, in which he would spell \"I'm Sorry\" on top.
