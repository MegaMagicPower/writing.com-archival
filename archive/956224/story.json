Kenobi! was all he could think.

He bowed and stalked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed for the main hangar of the Imperial Palace. The building had fitted into that role quite nicely over the past two years since the formation of the empire, and apparently the inhabitants had as well. There was nothing to suggest that this building had once been part of the headquarters of a republic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he reached the hangar, he found that he was undecided as to why he had come here.

He recognized it all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarth Vader had come to pay a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what in the galaxy for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flicked to the carpeted floor, where little Leia Organa sat playing with her dolls. Of course, the girl would most probably never know her true last name. Or her parentage. On one side, at least. Perhaps someday he would tell her about her mother, but he would carry the secret of her father to his grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now her father was here, unexpectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always felt nervous when Leia and Vader were in the same room. It didn't happen often, but it still scared him, especially when he was there too. All the Sith lord had to do was probe his mind, and all was over. For him. And for Leia, most likely. At least, all over for her morality. They would train her in the dark side of the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slid open and the man in question strode in. Leia looked at him with wide eyes, but stood and went to Organa's side. She already showed her talent for diplomacy at two years old, which was amazing. If Vader hadn't been in the room, Organa would have thought, \"Just like her mother,\" but he didn't dare. Who knew what Vader read in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" he greeted the other. \"This is unexpected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarth Vader made no movement, but said, after a moment, \"I am conducting a search for any surviving Jedi, and wished to assure myself of your cooperation, senator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrgana kept his face expressionless. \"I am an Imperial senator. Would I obstruct a mission of an imperial commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVader never took his eyes from his face. \"Perhaps not,\" he said, his voice unreadable.

Was there some resemblance Vader saw or felt between Leia and one of her parents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarth Vader studied the little girl standing unafraid by her father. It was unusual for children to show no nervousness around him, with his black mask and cloak and towering height. He knew he made a rather... impressive figure, to put it mildly. Kenobi had done this to him, made him seem half-droid to some. He - shall we say - discouraged such thinking, but he knew it still existed. He hated his former master for what he had done to him, but he didn't mind so much at times. His intimidating appearance could be very useful at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that his well-known tendency to use the force when he was angry didn't help or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Senator Organa's little girl didn't seem intimidated. His interest was awakened by this fearless child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senator Organa,\" he asked, \"you have adopted a girl? She is clearly not your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrgana's throat constricted, but only for a second. If Vader sensed anything like fear, it would be all over. \"She is the child of a friend. Both her parents are dead, so my wife and I adopted her.\" He looked down at Leia. Both dead. Well, they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVader looked at her as well. She was strong in the force, he could sense that. Very strong. If these had been the days of the Republic, she would by now probably be a Jedi padawan. He crushed that thought. The Jedi had destroyed him, kept him from his full power and betrayed him. Especially the man whom he once regarded as a father. Obi-Wan Kenobi had turned Padme, his Padme, against him, and caused him to accidentally take her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned his attention to Organa, who had unconsciously placed a hand on the girl's shoulder. He nodded briefly and strode from the room. These thoughts, awakened by a little girl, were too painful.</span></div></div>",

A rebellious Jedi Knight founded the Order, one who understood from the beginning that the real power of the Force was that of the dark side. Seeking to gain approval from the Jedi Council about his beliefs in hope that they be embraced and become a part of a Jedi Knight's training, he called for a special meeting with Council. Sensing that these beliefs had consumed the young Jedi, the Council exiled him, and he departed the Order with hatred in his heart. &lt;/br&gt; Not long after his exile, others who had ordained his beliefs as their own joined their mentor and created their own order, whose purpose was not to serve, but to dominate. This order was not last, however. Lust for power and dominion over fellow Sith caused the order to turn against itself. In the end, the Sith destroyed their leader, and then each other. Those clever enough to survive the civil war were quickly killed off by Jedi Knights. All of them died. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; All but one. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; The one Sith who had survived had adopted patience, cunning, stealth, and agility, all of which were taught to a Jedi Knight. Using these to his advantage, he was able to stand aside while the Sith destroyed themselves. He then went into hiding, and waited until it was believed that all the Sith were destroyed. Eventually, he came out of hiding. Growing old, he trained another to become a Master of the Dark Arts in his sted, teaching him the same techniques that had kept him alive during the Sith onslaught. Along with the concept that power denied was power wasted, he also told his apprentice that in order for the Sith to survive, it was vital that only two could exist at any one time. A Master and an Apprentice. Their war was with the Jedi, not with each other. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; Vader's eyes were opened. It all made sense now. Palpatine was the apprentice to Darth Plagueis. Having learned everything he could from his former master, Palpatine killed him to order to ensure the strength of the Sith was superior to that of the Jedi. It was Palpatine who created him, the prophesied Chosen One, due to his abundance of midichlorians to become his apprentice, Darth Vader. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; Vader exhaled with great satisfaction. One day he would learn all his master knew. He would learn how to keep the ones he cared about from dying, but even more than that, he would learn how to bring the ones he loved and missed so much back from the dead. He was, after all, the Chosen One. Someday, Padme would be with him again.</span></div></div>",

Cities which very well might hide Jedi who had escaped Order 66. Normally visitors to Selab would be stripped of their weapons before entering the city, but since the rise of the empire...certain exceptions were made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVader, flanked by stormtroopers filed into different elevators, the troops had orders to search the four cities: Skiverrn, Killet, Alask, and Veven 3.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The recently appointed Grand Moff Tarkin straightened his new uniform in a holo-mirror within his high-level apartment on Coruscant, a look of smug satisfaction written across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his elevation to such a level of power over his last few decades had impressed him - first as an little-known political advisor on Naboo, then a gradual rise under the watchful eyes of Palpatine, a man who had by circumstance possessed the same views of might and control. He'd lived through the Clone Wars as one of many of Palpatine's advisors, secretly aware of the pathetic Jedi Council's fate and the power his friend possessed. Wisely he had stood in the sidelines, onlying intervening when it suited him. And thus when the eradication of the Jedi had been completed, Tarkin received his postion of Governer of his home world Eriadu and its surrounding systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the six years which had passed since the end of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tarkin had already proven himself and created more than a fearful reputation of his loyalty and respect towards his Emperor, to the point where only perhaps Palpatine's apprentice, Vader, understood his aims and ambitions so successfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVader, yes. Tarkin paused in the fastening of his insigmas on his uniform to ponder the enigma of Vader. True, he alone knew the truth of the Sith Lord's real identity - the fallen Anakin Skywalker, last of a wasteful and foolish religion. Yes, the Jedi were extinct, and Vader and his master was all that was left of their decadent ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompleteing his outfit Tarkin reviewed a holo-crystal in his hand, displaying the image that only he and a few like-minded individuals were aware on - the ongoing construction of the Death Star. Tarkin had been assigned near-full responsibility on the update in its progress, not to mention the difficulties which proceeded making it secure from prying eyes and how to mantain a machine the size of a small moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut its long development would be worth it. Once the Death Star was completed, the Emperor would have little need for the Senate and all the political levers which sprang with it. Tarkin had already filled a report to Palpatine on a philosophy which would suit the atmosphere of such a regime. He expected his superior would understand its reasonings and fully approve. No, he knew Palpatine would. Such was their identical beliefs, he needed no reasoning for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarkin switched off the tactical update on the Death Star and proceeded out into the air of a planted-sized city. For a few seconds he took in the air-taxis, inhabitants and the shining buildings which crowded round his Imperial Quarters. To a man who could remember the days of the Republic he could certainly say that few changes had impacted the Coruscant skyline, save perhaps the presence of vast Imperial barriers adorning its gleaming walls. Even the Jedi Temple had been converted into something of a residence for his Sith Superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tarkin knew the greatest change across the capital of the Imperial Order. He could see it in the eyes of every man, woman and child he passed in the streets as he made his way to his personal Airtaxi, not some two blocks away, escorted by his own Stormtrooper squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear. Fear of death. Fear of their true feelings being revealed to those who might use it against them. Fear of loss of those they cared for. All of these things made them pretend the Empire was their protecter and ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarkin smiled inwardly. This single fact proved the idealogy he intended to embrace when the last strands of the Republic crumbled into dust would be ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the airtaxi slit shut, there was some shuffling outside as Tarkin's personal chauffer entered it, already checked in Imperial Troops to not house any weapons which might be used to kill such a highly regarded officer of the Empire. He did not speak to Tarkin but rather steered the craft in the desired direction. Tarkin prefered that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reviewed his morning in full. First to the Galactic Senate, where Palpatine would utilise his political powers to the most in expressing the danger of a newly formed threat to the Empire - a ragtag band of Rebels Tarkin barely thought glancing at. Then to the Imperial Residences for the far more significant discussion with his Emperor on the matter of his Regime Profile, including lunch. Then Tarkin would be shipped out to the highly secret Maw Installation to oversee the final completion of his long-awaited Prototype of the Death Star, started at the same time as the other on his own suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what he expected would be about one week, he would prove his loyalty to the Empire and its Emperor's plans by overseeing the ultimate test of the Super-Laser he expected would be built into the Death Star's core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with his mental report Tarkin stared out of his Air-Taxi, content with his beliefs and expectations. In a matter of minutes, he would be at the Senate Chambers, where no doubt Vader would be waiting for him.</span></div></div>",

You paused for a moment, and the tension mounted in the room. Then you fired the missile. \"What is the range of the tractor beam of a Star Destroyer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was elementary. Every midshipman knew that. Consequently he looked puzzled, but instead of answering, as everyone else did, when faced with that particular one, asked you another question of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Verdana- or Victory-class, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled briefly. \"Lieutenant Pellaeon, you have just been promoted to captain. The captain of <i>this</i> ship has your orders. Report to him immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on his face was one of utter astonishment, but then he tried to regain his customary solemnity. \"Thank you, sir,\" he said, with just a hint of excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fixed him with your eyes. \"Always remember to keep in mind the past - and it's present possibilities.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was gone, you tapped the arm of your chair. Promotion. What every officer dreamed of. Midshipmen, lieutenants, captains, commodores. Even admirals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen would it come to you?</span></div></div>",

It was two months after the birth of the Galactic Empire, led by Emperor Palentine (spelling?) and Darth Vader. The Emperor had gotten rid of the Two Thousand senators because they were \"enemies of the state\" or so the Emperor had said. Nobody wanted to argue with the Emperor, a Dark Lord of the Sith.  <br>\r\n      Admiral Zyas Tiers stood on the bridge of a Star Destoryer.  The Empire had only made a handful of these large battle cruisers so far, but Zyas saw that the Empire would make countless of these ships.  Since Zyas was commanding it, he got to name the Star Destoryer.   He decided to call it \"The Lynx\"  after an animal of his home world.  It was nothing like the Lynx that we know.  The Lynx that the Star Destoryer had been named after, was a 15-foot tall shaggy monster, much like a Wookie, but a tad stronger.  Zyas Tiers was on a mission to Naboo.  He had Darth Vader hinmself on board the ship.  Vader discovered that his wife--Padme--was buried on Naboo, and he wanted to say goodbye for good. Also, Vader was to pick a governor to run the Naboo sector.  <br>\r\n     \"Inform Lord Vader that we have arrived at Naboo\" said Zyas to a junior officer.  <br>\r\n      \"No need for that\" came Darth Vader's voice.  \"I sensed that we were here\"<br>\r\n        Darth Vader was not a man to tangle with.  If you can call Darth Vader a man.  To Zyas Tiers, Vader looked like a hybrid of droid and human.  Vader was more machine than man, that much was clear.  Vader joined Zyas on the main deck and looked at Naboo floating in an endless sea of space.<br>\r\n       \"Make ready my shuttle\" said Darth Vader.  \"I'll leave at once.  Care to join me, Admiral?\"  If Zyas felt fear, he didn't show it.  Zyas said..</span></div></div>",

Zyas vaguely knew where Tatoonie was.  The stories of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were legedary, so it would make sense that Zyas Tiers would hear about them.  Before the Galactic Empire came to being, Zyas was a Captain on board one of the ships that defended Couruscant. He was one of the few who wasn't a clone.  <br>\r\n      Darth Vader and Zyas went to Theed Palace to wait for the speeder.  People around the Palace stared at Vader, but Vader didn't notice.  The two were followed by five stormtroopers.   <br>\r\n       It happened so quickly that Zyas barely had time to duck.  Darth Vader ducked a half-second before Zyas did.  Someone had shot at Darth Vader. The shot was aiming for Vader's head.   Zyas scanned the area and didn't see where the shot had come from. The stormtroopers had thier blaster rifles out, ready for action.<br>\r\n        \"It came from above..\" said Darth Vader, more to himself than to Zyas.<br>\r\n         \"Search the Palace!\"  barked Zyas to the stormtroopers. <br>\r\n         Stormtroopers rushed into the palace, when Vader gave a command for them to stop. <br>\r\n        \"It came from a ship\" said Darth Vader.<br>\r\n        \"Someone can't fire a blaster from a ship\" said Zyas.  \"The chances of hitting something that far away is...\"<br>\r\n          \"It would be no problem for a Jedi\" said Darth Vader.  <br>\r\n          \"J..Jedi?\" asked Zyas.  \"I thought they were all wiped out\"<br>\r\n           \"A few managed to get away\" said Darth Vader.  \"My Master said that at least two Jedi are still out there somewhere\"<br>\r\n              Zyas didn't believe in The Force, as most people did.

He had been deep in thought when he moved swiftly to the left as a person leapt down from above his light saber searing the top of the stone coffin.  Anger filled Vader as he saw the desecration to his wife's coffin.  Vader brought his own light saber to life and the sound of the saber's vibrated throughout the mausoleum. <br>\r\nThe Admiral came to the doorway to find the source of the sound and at the sight of Vader and the young man stepped away.  He knew not to interfere in any fights that Vader participated in or else his life would be in jeopardy too.  He quietly went down the steps and rejoined the storm troopers not alerting them as to what was going on.<br>\r\nVader stood across from the man.  Vader knew this person but not as the person standing before him.  Vader let the force flow through him.  \"Cotar, you were Master Zehn's padawan, correct?\" Vader said matter of factly.  The young man nodded.  \"My master sent me away before you came to the temple, knowing that I would be the last hope,\" the young man said with a certain amount of hatred in his voice.  \"You were still a youngling at the time and you have never finished your training, what makes you think you can defeat me!\" Vader said sternly.  The man lunged forward and Vader blocked him easily.  The man fought bravely for nearly three minutes before Vader had him in pieces near the doorway.  Vader reattached his weapon to his belt.  Vader savored the victory for only a moment when he remembered his wife's coffin.<br>\r\nVader stepped up to her coffin and saw that he could see her hand.  Vader had not wanted to see her body.  He wanted to remember her as the way she had been, but her hand still looked like a hand.  Vader pushed the top off the grave, curiosity getting the better of him.  He looked at the Padme's lifeless body.  If he could have shed tears he would have.  The coffin must have been sealed air tight because she had been nicely preserved.  Vader reached his hand to hers.  All the sensors in his hand told him he was touching her but it was not the same as touching her with real hands.  Vader moved his hand to her stomach.  Something wasn't right.  Even if she wasn't decomposing at a normal rate, her belly should not still look like it was still full term.  Vader ran his hand over her stomach.  The firmness, the plain \"feel\" of it was not right.  <br>\r\nVader reached into the force.  All he could see was a laser scapel and a baby crying.  Vader knew at once that they all tricked him.  Someone had performed surgery on her body and removed the child.  Vader knew in that instant that his child with Padme was alive.  Vader tried to sense whether he had a son or daughter, but the force was confusing him.  It would not point him in the right direction.  'Someone was blocking him from knowing the truth.' Vader thought to himself.  Just then Yoda's face came to mind (more so because he believed Yoda to be strong enough to block him than any other).  'Master Yoda is alive and has my child.' Vader thought to himself.  Anger flooded through Vader's heart.  He wanted to know where Yoda was, but the force would not show him and when he tried to sense the child he received conflicting images.  Something was wrong.  He knew he had to find Yoda and his child even if it took him two lifetimes, he would have what was his.  Padme was taken from him, he would not let Yoda nor anyone else take his child.  Vader knew the emperor must not know about this unless Vader saw a way to benefit himself.  Vader lifted the case to Padme's coffin and put in back in place.  <br>\r\nVader left Naboo with a sorded sense of closure to Padme and a new fire had been lit his heart.  His child was alive.  As head of the Imperial Fleet, Vader could search many star systems.  He knew that one day they would meet.</span></div></div>",

Abis, Bail, and Iolani watched from the planet as Abis's sister and ship exploded.  They knew instantly that the Imperial Fleet was here.  Bail took Iolani in his arms.  \"Abis, you must go into hiding, they will hunt you down.\" Organa pleaded.  Abis looked at little Iolani who was holding onto Bail.  Bail nodded at him saying that he would protect her.  \"I will never be far away if you ever need me.\"  Abis said to Iolani and disappeared into the nearby forest until it would be safe for him to leave.  Bail took the child back to his quarters.  Bail hoped to not run into Vader.  He was supposedly on the Empire's side, so he could not run, to do so would look suspicious.<br>\r\nVader and Admiral Zyas brought down a battalion of storm troopers to search the planet.  It was Admiral Zyas who had the pleasure of meeting Senator Bail Organa.  Vader had no interest in him, he was someone from his wife's past, besides he wanted the Jedi.  He wasn't looking for a child when he should have been.  Instead his search was for the man who used to captain the freighter ship.<br>\r\n\"Senator Organa, it is a pleasure.\" Admiral Zyas said respectfully.<br>\r\n\"Admiral, may I ask what is going on?\" Bail asked hoping to learn some information.  He didn't know if they knew how close they were to destroying the Alliance.<br>\r\n\"Nothing to concern yourself with sir!  We have everything under control.\" Admiral Zyas said trying to comfort the Senator.  Admiral Zyas knew Senator Organa had never opposed the Emperor and so he had no reason not to trust him.  <br>\r\nBail knew the Admiral was not concerned with him and he released the breath he had been holding.  They had no idea how close they were to ending it all.  Just then Iolani came running into the room with a frightened look on her face.  Bail picked her up immediately and tried to quiet her hoping that she wouldn't say anything that would give them away.<br>\r\n\"Senator, I did not know you had another child.  I only knew of the one.\" Admiral said quizzically.  Bail didn't know what to say, how did he explain her to the Admiral.  \"Uncle Bail\" Iolani said looking into his eyes.  Bail knew how to explain her now and he looked into her knowing eyes.  The force was with her, he had seen that look in so many Jedi.  \"Admiral this is my brother's daughter, Lani.\"  Bail said.  The Admiral didn't even question it.  Bail's brother had died three years ago in battle.  His brother had been married but his wife was a battle warrior from the planet Zenaria.  They were a race of warriors that resembled humanoids but had catlike qualities to their features and abilities.  That race was dying out rapidly thanks to Vader and the Imperial Fleet, but only Bail knew of his sister in laws true origins as no one had ever met her except for him.  He could easily pass her off as his niece and he had a feeling Lani could help him.  The Admiral nodded at Lani and Bail and bid them a good day as he needed to get back to the manhunt.</span></div></div>",

The Fleet had been combing the far side of the planet the past two days and Bail had barely relaxed the entire time.<br>\r\nIolani had woken up in the middle of the night.  She had another dream, it was about Leia again.  Iolani knew her purpose, it was to protect her.  She knew they would grow up together and be friends, but Iolani knew her true calling was to protect her.  She was important to everything.  Iolani felt there was much more to it, but she would not understand it until she had more life experience.  Bail had told her about the Jedi Order and their way of life and what had happened to them all and that if they were not being hunted down that she would have been trained in the Jedi way.  Iolani knew now why her father had always tried to keep her abilities a secret.  Iolani was saddened by her father's death, she had felt it.  Iolani was very connected to the force.  Bail did not know how strongly she was connected to the force, but without proper training she would never know the true extent of her power or the fact that she could have rivalved Vader.   Iolani knew that one day she would die protecting Leia, but she knew that she would be at peace because she would be saving her friend.  She didn't know why sometimes when she was meditating and she thought of Leia she would suddenly have images of a boy in a desert.  She didn't understand now, but she knew that one day she would.  She was up early and joined Bail and his family on the ship as it left orbit and jumped into hyperspace.  <br>\r\nVader felt the sudden departure of the person that he felt the force so strongly in.  He knew at once that the person he was looking for was not on this planet.  He was angry at the incompetence of the people serving him.  Admiral Zyas was lucky he was elsewhere at the moment.  Vader returned to the ship with half the fleet and when the Captain on the Lynx had not followed through with Vader's request to track all ships and to not let anyone leave, Vader killed him instantly without waiting for an explanation.  No one dared to offend Vader at the momemt.  Vader called the rest of the fleet from the planet and the newly promoted Captain was given orders to track everyone down that had left.  Admiral Zyas returned to the ship and wanted to say something to Vader for killing one of his crew but in fear for his own life said nothing.</span></div></div>",

Vader contacted the Emperor and asked if he should go after Bail and the Jedi.<br>\r\n      \"Organa is no traitor to the Empire, Vader\" said the emperor.  \"we'll hunt the Jedi on Alderaan soon enough.

There was no way to speed up the construction either.

There was no water anywhere.<br>\r\n        Darth Vader didn't know of any creature that could live in an enviroment so hostile..but, all things were possible in the big universe.  Darth Vader had 10 clone troopers with him.  Because of the war, the clones had been almost extinct.  And Jango Fett was long-since dead.  Someone had stolen Jango's DNA sample from the cloners.  And Baba Fett didn't want to have a clone army of himself.  Besides, nobody knew where the young bounty hunter was.  Rumors had reached Vader that Baba had found work on a remote world called Tatooine.<br>\r\n      Tatooine.<br>\r\n     Nothing there but barren wasteland as well.  <br>\r\n     Finally, the small army came to a ship that had crashed on the planet.  The ship was a Perry-Class barge, designed to transport mass amount of people to one planet to the other.  Vader had once been in one of those transports with Padme, but this ship was even bigger than that transport had been.  Darth Vader found a hatch and opened it, with some diffuculty.  He could now sense the force within the transport.  Yes.  Someone was in there who had the Force on his side.  The transport's system was still on-line.  The distress beacon onboard the ship was of no use.  Probably the crash took it out.<br>\r\n       Vader sent the clone troopers on one side of the ship, and he the other.  Vader was walking down a hallway that led to the cargo deck, when it happened.  A boy around 20 leapt from nowhere and held a lightsaber.  This young Jedi wasn't strong enough to defeat Vader, he quickly fell dead after a prolonged saber fight.  The boy was an expert at saber duels.  <br>\r\n      Vader entered the cargo deck and inwardly gasped.  The cargo deck was filled with children.  Some children were Jedi, while others were not.  There was a small town of children.  A small voice inside Vader told leave the children alone.  At least the Non-Jedi ones.  He had killed younglings before.  This would be no different.  The Force was strong in the cargo deck....a little too strong to be coming from younglings.  <br>\r\n       When Vader came to what look like a town square, he was greeted by 20 Jedi younglings and a man in his mid-fifties.  The man was so strong in the Force, Vader knew him to be a Jedi Master.  All of the younglings were holding lightsabers.  <br>\r\n          \"A-Anakin...\" said the man.  <br>\r\n         \"I am Darth Vader\" said Vader flatly.<br>\r\n        \"Yes..a great pity\" said the man.  <br>\r\n        \"I don't remember seeing you at the Jedi Acamedy when I was there...\" said Vader, more to himself.<br>\r\n        \"I left the Jedi Order three years ago\" said the man.  \"I am Jizim\"<br>\r\n        \"Jizim?\" asked Vader.  \"ah, you were the one who went against Master Yoda's wishes...tell me, do you know where Master Yoda is?\"<br>\r\n      Jizim shook his head.<br>\r\n     Vader could feel Jizim had the Dark Side in him.

Jizim stood peacefully, his hands at his sides and pleasant look across his face, the force radiating from him like a beacon.  Vader was not sure whether to consider his act one of contempt, considering Vader too young or inexperienced to even be a source of danger or one of respect, leaving his fate up to Vader to decide.  He chose to believe the  latter.  Rumor of his immense power had surely circulated, Jizim knew full well what danger he faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJizim was not fool though.  \"See,\" he commented, \"perfect trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust?

A great Jedi knows what knowledge is important and what can be disregarded as ignorance and does not ignore wise words simply because they came from a source that is not desirable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you consider yourself a great Jedi?\"  Vader still held his lightsaber menacingly before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" Jizim was still as calm as ever.  \"There is a balance between controlling the force and letting it control you.  The Sith believe that they are the Forces master, the Jedi believe the the Force masters them.  I believe neither.\"  Vader was silent, Jizim could tell he was debating striking him dead right now.  But he also knew that he had caught the young mans attention.  He was hungry for Jizim's knowledge.  This was good, the boy was not a complete fool then.  \"THe Force and I are equals.  No master.  We work together, we share our powers.  Perfect trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVader was taking in this theory, this class of thinking.  No master.  This Jizim was wise.  But Vader knew he was being manipulated.  Well, as long as he knew it there could be no harm in learning what Jizim had to teach, what Jizim had in plan considering he was still surrounded by a group of younglings.  Vader could always kill him later.  He allowed his lightsaber to blink from existence as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect trust.\" he intoned, \"Tell me more.\"</span></div></div>",

But she was scared. She could feel that something wasn\u00b4t right about this man.<br>\r\nEveryone in the Senate Chamber went silent as Palpatine began to speak.<br>\r\n\"My dear friends, you all know why I created the Galactic Empire. I wanted to bring justice and order to the galaxy, I wanted to get rid of corruption. And everyone in this chamber will admit that I succeeded. But, senators, there\u00b4s a movement that is threatening all we built: a movement that is just like the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a movement that wants to destroy our new order and bring anarchy over the galaxy. I speak about the Rebel Alliance!\"<br>\r\nSome senators were outraged about the mention of the Rebel Alliance and began to shout something, but Leia didn\u00b4t listen. She looked at her father, and she knew that something was wrong. He sat in his senate pod without batting an eyelid.<br>\r\n\"Order! Order!\" Mas Amedda, a loyal follower of the Emperor shouted.<br>\r\n\"My friends, this Rebel Alliance already attacked several important planets of our Empire. It is clear that we must act on this! We must destroy the Rebel Alliance in order to maintain peace and justice!\"<br>\r\n\"Peace and justice!\" the senators shouted full of enthusiasm. Bail Organa shook his head.

He is the leader of the Imperial Starfleet, a cunning warrior and pilot and Palpatine\u00b4s apprentice, yet Leia didn\u00b4t know what that meant.

Only 7, but there could still be more out there.\"<br>\r\n\"And how did you come to Jabiim.\"<br>\r\n\"We were attacked by an imperial ship over Jabiim, and we had to land on the surface. We were able to destroy our pursuers, and after some time, we met the rebels here. Some of them fought back then for the Separatists, but there are also some who fought for the Republic. The creation of the Empire seemed to bring the inhabitants of this planet together again after the Clone Wars. Looks like Alto Stratus was right back then...\"<br>\r\nAlto Stratus...a highly respected member of the Confederacy of Independet Systems. On Jabiim, he was a hero for those who were opposing the Republic. And Obi-Wan fought against him.

The pilot gestured to Obi-Wan that they had the opportunity to escape, but Obi-Wan quietly shook his head. He was waiting for a reunion with Anakin since the moment he left Mustafar fateful evening. He clenched his lightsaber which was fastened tightly in its sheath at his waist,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what you must, Vader. I'm ready for you.\" he said to himself quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, on board the Star Destroyer, Vader made his move,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open fire!\" he cried, in which his Imperial Pilots responded by firing their green laser beams at the small, rusty, old ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move right! Right!\" Obi-Wan shouted, in which the Great Hope pilot swerved out of the way of the beams. The pilot then responded to the attacks by firing back, to no avail, sadly, because the Destroyer's shields were up. Obi-Wan cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn board the Destroyer, Vader chuckled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have you now, old man,\" he said quietly, turning to the soon-to-be-Starkiller, only a child at the time, who looked up at Vader, quivering in his small boots at Vader's frightening appearance and armor. Vader ignored his fear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, WE shall have him, and the Jedi will be no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarkiller seemed to ignore Vader, but to keep staring deep into Vader's shaded eye armor, looking to see if there was sign of a man under the nightmarish suit.

Our shields are up, and our cannons have locked onto them! Just give us your approval and we'll blast them out of space!\" one of them said. But Vader ignored them, staring blankly off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense...another disturbance in the Force, a distant disturbance...one which I can barely feel, yet it is neither Obi-Wan nor Yoda...Who could it be?\" Vader thought to himself. Little Vader knew that it was actually his own son Luke, living safely on the remote planet of Tatooine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back on the Great Hope, their useless attempts to bring down the Star Destroyer's shields were leading them nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?!\" Obi-Wan's pilot cried. \"They've locked their laser cannons onto us! If we don't flee now then they'll blast us to smithereens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the whole ship vibrated. Obi-Wan stumbled for a moment, nearly falling over, until the vibrations stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" Obi-Wan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know!\" the pilot said nervously, pushing buttons and throwing switches left and right to see what was happening. Finally the pilot gasped in fear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! We're done for, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?!\" Obi-Wan asked, walking over to the pilot and peering over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-They've l-locked us in an abduction ray! They're pulling the ship towards them! They're going to take up as prisoners!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi-Wan drew his lightsaber, a brave look in his eye,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I have anything to say about it! Besides, I've been looking for a good battle!\" he said boldly, \"And a chance to speak with Anakin...\" he said quietly to himself so nobody could hear but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on...\" The pilot said, pushing more buttons and throwing more switches. \"It seems we might have an opportunity to escape; their abduction beams aren't very strong!\" he turned to Obi-Wan, \"Do you want to try it? Or stay here and be abducted by the Empire and then try escaping heroically like all of you bold Jedi are?!\"   </span></div></div>",

That's not at all how the story went, so let me start from the begining here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Parn Veila, but my old Master called me Jake. Being easier to remember than \"Parn Veila,\" the name quickly became what I was known by informally amoungst my peers. If not for the dog tags that I keep in my back pocket, barring that name, I myself may have forgotten it years ago. You see, that name is my only tie to any sort of family or heritage. When I was left on the steps of the Jedi Temple as a baby, I had nothing but the clothes on my back and those dog tags. As far as I'm concerned, I'm Jake now (\"Master Veila\" if you must be formal). I once asked my Master why he kept calling me that, he cryptically responded that I reminded him of an old Padawan he had....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy training was brutal, more physically and mentally taxing than the path of the average Jedi. By the time I hit puberty I was a master of 5 different lightsaber techniques and fluent in 7 others. Master Windu expressed great concern with the way that my Master trained me, but no action was ever taken to alter my training. By the time the Clone Wars rolled around, I was one of the Republic's greatest lesser known assets. My six foot four, 230 pound frame made me an imposing figure in combat, and I had essentially been bred for war before one had even broken out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of service in battle, I was finally made a Jedi Knight. All of my trials were complete aside from the Trail Of Soul. My Master struck a deal similar to Obi-Wan Kenobi's win Anakin Skywalker's, and so the ceremony went on. Master Yoda knighted me under the condition that I would face a Trial Of The Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never did before the Jedi Temple was destroyed. </span></div></div>",

To cut a long story short (because I'm getting off topic), myself, several other Jedi and two battalions of clone troopers managed to beat the separatists back, and many of them fled to Kashyyyk and Utapau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so I arrived back at the Jedi Temple, ready to relax after a month of warring. I entered into the temple and immediately caught sight of some old friend of mine: Dayle, Haila, Shem'mto, and Firnril. We had been younglings at the Academy together, and we always managed to remain close despite being assigned different masters and very rarely being able to gather together at the same time. I haven't seen any of them since that day... I told them that I was looking for Master Garn and they directed me to one of the youngling training rooms (which is probably what saved my life). As I walked toward the training room, I remember passing by Masters Windu, Fisto, Kolar, and Tiin who all seemed concerned and somewhat disturbed, though I paid little attention to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several flights of stairs, and one brief stop to check the archives for any new information on Balmorra, I finally reached the training room. The door separating the room from the rest of the temple slid open automatically as I approached it. Inside I found dozens of younglings stood around socialising, but no Jedi watching over them. In all honesty, I think I would have been more concerned if they were practicing without a supervising Jedi present. I asked them if they had seen Master Garn and, right before they could answer, that was when it happened. The sound of blaster fire coupled with painful screams rang out, reaching as far as the training room where I had found the younglings. I told them to remain in the training room whilst I investigated. The door of the training room slid open once again as I stepped near it and I was immediately caught off-guard as a blue blaster bolt cut through the air and struck the wall directly to my right hand side. My feet carried me forward a few steps but the rest of me was in shock as I watched hundreds of clone troopers marching around the temple and shooting down Jedi masters, knights, padawans, and younglings alike. <br>\r\n\"There's one!\", a recognisable voice called out from my left hand side. I turned just in time to see two clone troopers with their rifles raised at me. Almost without thinking, I channelled the force through my hands and used it to pull my lightsaber from belt and into them. I activated and repositioned it infront of myself just in time to deflect the soldiers' subsequent blaster shots directly back at them. Each shot was reflected back into their respective chests, and I watched as the two troopers both crumpled to the ground, both sets of their armour then marked with black scorch marks. Confused, I returned to the training room and looked amongst the younglings who all looked fearful. <br>\r\n\"The clones are attacking us! Tens of Jedi are already dead throughout the temple!\", I exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen?\", one of the younglings, a small blue skinned Twi'lek girl, asked with tears beginning to form in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I am going to get us all to safety\", I stated, which seemed to provide some of them with some form of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real question at the time was, how would I get them to safety?</span></div></div>",

Like Fett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bounty Hunter landed his already infamous vessel, the Slave 1, in an out of the way valley somewhere to the North of the area he suspected he would find Kandus - a foolish pirate who had dared to smuggle larges piles of Rodian Salt Crystals, a rare spice craved for across the universe, from the clutches of his most regular sponser - Jabba the Hutt. Jabba had told Fett to find Kandus and bring him back to Tattoine - alive or dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his ship Fett activated a visual map of the area inside his helmet, the single real settlement on the planet some five miles to the South. Checking his weapons, the Bounty Hunter moved towards the place he hoped to find his prey...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n###############################<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Fett reached what looked like a the local Cantinia, a grotty establishment which sat around several aged houses of grimey mud, a forboding set of mountains towering over this unsettleing scene. Fett wasn't concerned with the environment though, and he stepped into a smoked-patch room filled with the regular wide assortment of space-farers, cut-throats and Bounty Hunters like himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the entry of such a familar figure, the whole room drew silent, save small whispers of \"Its Boba Fett!\" He stepped up to the Innkeeper, who tried to show any signs of composure on his fear-ridden brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for Kandus Teht.\" the gruff and battle-scared voice of Boba Fett rang though his helmet's audio recepters as he spoke. \"Something told me you know where he is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I couldn't possibily know-\" The Barman stuttered to a halt as in a flash Fett stuck his trademark Blaster Rifle under his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're mistaken. I'm not asking, I telling.\" The weapon moved further up to the Barman's sweat-stained forhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning a huge shadow suddenly looned behind the Bounty Hunter. Stupid, he thought. The Barman has friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith expert precision Fett twirled to shoot a raging Wookie inbetween the eyes. At once its huge form slumped to the ground. The two other blaster-armed men behind him, one a Zamark and the other human, took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFett returned to the Barman. \"I don't like surprises. Kindly tell me where Kandus is, or you receive your friend's same order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-He's somewhere in the Nureilous Valley, some kind of fortress, protected by a energy shield. Thats all I know, I swear!\" The barman's heart was pumbing like a rabid wamp rat, but it calmed as Fett slowly lowered his weapon and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night sky was making this pace bitterly cold, but the Bounty Hunter scarely noticed. He also failed to spot a short, squattish creature racing off to a nearby alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuere was a timid Bronian, but he had his orders from his master - if something came up what threatened Kandus, he would have to tell him about it...</span></div></div>",

She sees his uncaring posture, his stupid humming, she knows that his mind is probably lurking somewhere equally inappropriate.  She knows her brother and is seriously considering stabbing his eye out at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't he care about anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is so much that needs to be done.  They need to decide where they are going to go, what they are going to do.  They need to battle their inner-demons, they need to battle them now, this very moment or they will get stronger and eventually devour them.  Yolanda knows that powerful emotions, once ignored, build fortresses within your own carefully built walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is trying to come to terms with the death of her parents, of her planet, of her entire life as she once knew it.  But damn that humming!  She can't think!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your feet off the control panel.\" she says, almost snaps at her brother.  He does not respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feet off!\" she picks them up and tosses them over the side.  Abis does nothing.  He's being unresponsive on purpose now just to annoy her.  It's a game to him, they played it as children.  Abis still had a miraculous way of making his older sister extremely pissed off.  He felt that it kept her in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're pulling this bullshit at a time like this.\" she said in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.\" Abis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax?\" Yolanda almost laughed, the idea of relaxing now was perposturous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing we can do right now.  Not til we get planetside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abis we don't even know which planet we're going to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we do, do we?  Well, it'd be nice if <i>I</i> knew which planet we're going to considering how I'm piloting the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one logical place for us to go, my dear sister.\" he always called her that when he knew that he had though of something she had not, when he knew that he had the upper hand.  He didn't have it long though.  Yolanda knew where he was talking about immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else can we trust right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, my <i>dear</i> brother.\" two could play this game. \"Tantooine it is then.\"</span></div></div>",

Yolanda placed her pistol in the holster at her waist and opened the hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No playing around, okay?  We find Garner and stay out of trouble-\" Abis was already down the ramp and making his way to a seedy looking tavern across the way.  \"Right, of course he isn't listening.\" Yolanda muttered to herself.  \"Abis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic and smoke filled the tavern and there were more then one who eyed the two of them with suspicioun or dislike as Abis made his way to the bar.  This was nothing though, Yolanda was used to far worse on Tavis V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One crater shot.\" Abis ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not here to drink, Abis.\" Yolanda hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what just happened, I think I deserve a drink.\" her brother responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, that's just what we need right now, impaired judgment, as though your judgment isn't impaired enough already.\"  Yolanda leaned against the bar and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abis!?\" a man in a dark brown tunic with an artificial eye came striding towards them.  \"Abis?  Is that you?!\"  Abis spun around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kraig!\" The two men embraced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was you, I thought it was you!\" Kraig laughed heartily.  \"Yolanda.\" he said with a nod of the head.  Yolanda nodded in turn to the greeting.  \"So, what brings the two of you to a rock like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't believe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your business.\" Yolanda cut her brother off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still as fiesty as ever, I see.\" Kraig commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a real bitch, truth be told.\" Abis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for defending me.\" Yolanda said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?  Needing defending?  I'd never dream of it.\" Abis said and the two men laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say you come on back to my place?\" Kraig offered.  \"I got some ale better then this dung.\"</span></div></div>",

Yolana sighed and walked out of the tavern with the two old friends.  <br>\r\n      Kraig Hirs was a friend of the Mal family for years.  Kraig is also a smuggler.  Some people might say that Kraig is the best pilot on Tatooine.  Kraig moves from planet to planet, smuggling illegal goods for the right price.  Kraig doesn't do buiness with the Galactic Empire though...even if the Empire wanted his help.  Kraig and Abis were childhood friends who had a friendly rivalry with each of thier ships.  The Glory Road has been said to be the fastest piece of junk in the galaxy.  Kraig's ship, The Worthless Fool, is fast too.  It was hard to say which ship was faster than the other.  <br>\r\n        Kraig, Abis and Yolana entered a hotel that looked as seedy as any hotel on Tavis V.  Kraig, Abis and Yolana make it to Kraig's room.  There, Kraig pulls out a couple of bottles from under the bed.  <br>\r\n     \"I'm smuggling these babies to Mustafar\" said Kraig, handing one bottle to Abis and Yolana.  \"got a hundred cases on board my ship\"<br>\r\n      \"Jamelan Ale\" said Abis, looking at the bottle.  \"you know if you get caught with this...\"<br>\r\n      \"You know me, Abis\" said Kraig.  \"I never get caught and I never will\"<br>\r\n       \"What are you doing here on Tatooine, then?\" asked Yolana.<br>\r\n         \"Gotta go to my employer and get paid before I go to Mustafar\" said Kraig.  \"so...what brings you here, Abis?\"<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",
