Bagi approached the stream<br>\r\nand starts to drink water. However, behind her, someone is watching, it had a gun, which was appointed for her.<br>\r\n - Smile, mysterious creature.<br>\r\n When him try spotting better, he steps into a dry leaf. Bagi's ears begin to tremble, she turns to where the sound came, and sees something shiny, pointed at her.<br>\r\n - Damn, she saw me. Plan B!<br>\r\n  He squeezes the trigger and the gun shoots. Bagi is faster and deviates from the bullet, she turns and runs away. The man gets up and continues firing.<br>\r\n - You can run ... BUT CAN NOT HIDE!<br>\r\n He runs after her, firing at the same time. Bagi glides through the dense forest, but she was tired, thirsty and hungry, she began to lose speed. The man had trouble atravasar plants, but he had a huge machete, and with that, he had no trouble passing. He can see a pink dot in front, he was reaching for her.<br>\r\n Bagi try to run more, but something catches her by surprise, stop and see that she arrived at a precipice, down only had the ground and the continuation of the lake, she turns and sees the man pointing the gun at her. He lets out a laugh<br>\r\n- There's nowhere to run, jump and you die, do not move, it will not hurt anything.<br>\r\n Bagi face him and let out a roar.<br>\r\n - I'll take that as a \"no. \"<br>\r\n He aims his gun and prepares to hold down the trigger. Bagi does what any animal would do in a situation like this, she turns around, gives a boost, and jump towards the water. The man runs to the edge and says angry:<br>\r\n - You will not escape!<br>\r\n He aims and shoots Bagi. Even being in the air, Bagi is hit in the back, but they were not bullets, were sedatives. She lands in the stream and swim out, but she can not run or even walk, your vision begins to embarrass, she falls to the ground and the last thing you see is the man approaching her.<br>\r\n - Hmmm, this is a sedative for elephants, but I think for something like you ... is quite reasonable ... I do not know what you are, but I'll find out, let's go my land: Japan!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing visible was a large window in the wall, on the other hand, the mysterious man was sitting, mixing in a modern super computer. Bagi wanted to leave, she runs up against the glass, it beats, and nothing, she tries three more times before the mystery man leaving the computer and go to the glass. The only thing that separated the faces of the two was merely a sheet of glass.<br>\r\n The men was tall, had short blond hair, was muscular, wore a black leather outfit, and to complete, a black glasses (this guy looks like Wesker)<br>\r\n - I see that you woke up. Excellent, now I can start.<br>\r\n Bagi responds by hitting hard on the glass.<br>\r\n - No use beating or scratching, this glass is not bulletproof, but it's pretty tough.<br>\r\n The man turns around and picks up a recorder on a table, he turns it on and starts talking.<br>\r\n - Here is Uzalki, im a tech hunter, i catch rare animals and researching them, and soon after, i sell Them. It seems something wrong, but it's all for science ... Today, I found a creature so rare, maybe that is the only of its breed. Your hair is pink, I've never seen a specimen like. The specimen appears to be female, however, her body seems to have feminine detailing human, i mean, she seems to have ... uhmmm, breasts. She seems to be a fusion of ... C'mon, this can not be true. It's better I start doing analizes of her brain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Uzalki start seeing some strange results on your computer. He starts getting shocked.<br>\r\n - My ... her brain has virtually the same amount of neurons that have a human brain ...<br>\r\n Uzalki turns to Bagi.<br>\r\n - What are you?<br>\r\n Bagi hits the glass again. Uzalki returns to the computer, picks up the recorder and the league.<br>\r\n - Now I found something even stranger, she has a brain similar to a human, I say, not even a monkey has this capability. But most of the neurons seem to be disabled, turned off ... How is this possible ...? Is it from someone?<br>\r\n Uzalki shuts off and starts thinking.<br>\r\n - If they are off ... maybe ... is possible to turn on!<br>\r\n Uzalki back to your computer and start researching and planning, Until<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

NO, I will completely shut down what is changing her brain.<br>\r\n Uzalki bar measure decreases, until completely empty.<br>\r\n Bagi feel a pain in the head. Had begun. She falls to the ground, and puts the hands on her head. Everything was slowly returning: Bagi, Superlife, dancing, friendship, knowledge, dreams, memories ..., Ryo.<br>\r\n Wait, who she is?<br>\r\n - (Im. .. Ba ... gi) - Remember her.<br>\r\n Meanwhile, Uzalki watched, with the recorder in hand, he records.<br>\r\n - The specimen began to collapse, she's alive?<br>\r\n Bagi was still shaking on the ground, her head hurt too much, but she seemed to be enjoying her lost memories.<br>\r\n (Flashback)<br>\r\n Bagi are staring Ryo , she was inches away from Ryo, she felt a great desire to bite and shred it, but just know that it was Ryo,, her only friend, she could not. Suddenly she felt something piercing her belly, was Ryo, she collapses and loses consciousness ... Bagi wakes up, she was inside a bag, she breaks down and, though wanting to see Ryo, her wild side was in control, leaves the house and ran into the forest, she comes running ever since.<br>\r\n( End of the Flashback)<br>\r\nThat was not a good memory for Bagi, the pain begins to stop, she tries to stand on foot. Uzalki sees it, not beliving in what he's seeing.<br>\r\n - WAIT, she is trying to stand on foot, this is impossible ... Does she already knew how to do this? I gonna talk with her\u200b\u200b.<br>\r\n  Uzalki presses a button near the glass and begins to speak:<br>\r\n - Hey! Hey!<br>\r\n Bagi hears this and turns around, still trying to stand on foot.<br>\r\n - (She know what I mean?)<br>\r\n - Hun ... you, know, talk?<br>\r\n  Bagi knew she had this ability, she opens her mouth and slowly begins to speak:<br>\r\n -... Ye ... s<br>\r\n Uzalki longer shocked by it.<br>\r\n - She can speak!<br>\r\n Bagi not know where I was, but she knew what she wanted. Ryo.<br>\r\n - Hey .... ... can ... help me?<br>\r\n - Now it is her! Incredible, I'll get rich with her\u200b\u200b! Millions will want to pay to see her.<br>\r\n Bagi hears this, she would be used as an attraction.<br>\r\n - (No, I do not want, I want to leave.

You can watch here:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDyajky_0Bc&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDyajky_0Bc&amp;feature=related</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, continue the reading <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/cool.png\" alt=\"*Cool*\" title=\"Cool\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first I thought it would be a Japanese film meaningless. But over the parts of the movie and I could see a touch of emotion, the characters had a strong personality, and the story was very detailed and with a certain moral at the end (that man should not be playing God.) Well, I like the ending, but that type of ending left room for a sequel (If you watched the movie, you know what I mean), i have Waited, Waited, Waited, But even a mere news about a sequel, while others idiots anime gained a lot of sequels. Well I gave up waiting and started to assemble a sequel to the film, one that is worth watching, or should I say, read. This is supposedly a sequel to the movie, i will try to make it faithful to the original.<br>\r\n To please you, dear reader, I would like you to send suggestions, compliments and criticisms to me, for me to do a story that pleases everyone (although it is impossible to please everyone ...). You can add chapters if you want, but know that there are some rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bagi Can be considered a furry, BUT do not put any sexual references, i mean there was none in the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fan character can even be added, whether human or not, but they must have a good participation in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Please, nothing gay, lesbian, or bisexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI LOVE a good story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guest it all. Have fun !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning,WARNING!!: Good chapters will be well rewarded. ( 100 GP to 150 GP).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn memory of Bagi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
