This man's name is, Junto Ryusuke, and his life in this world isn't very good. \"OK, just one more dash and I should be able to cross out of this dimension,\" he drew the last stroke and a bright light flashed and he was knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    When he came to, he found himself in a white room with a giant door behind him. He got up and looked at the door to see what it was. \"You're a curious one, aren't you?\" said a voice behind Junto. Junto turned around and saw a humanoid shape without any features whatsoever and it's voice was distorted making it hard to know whether it was male or female. \"Who and what are you?\" Junto asked. \"Me? I am all, I am nothing, I mean nothing, but I mean everything. I am known by various names, god, the world, the universe, even the truth,\" the figure said in a gleeful voice. \"So, why am I here? I just wanted to prove that other universes existed,\" Junto said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You don't know the laws of equivalent exchange, do you? Basically, you will be able to visit other universes, but what are you going to give up?\" the figure said in a mock questioning voice, \"I got it! You'll have to defend every single universe from an all powerful evil! I think that's fair, but you will gain powers of your own as you fight, you will also gain the powers of every world you visit as well but they will be anchored to that world,\" the figure explained as it snaps it's fingers and a wide array of doors appear with different emblems on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what will you choose, Junto Ryusuke? Think carefully, you wouldn't want to run head first and kill yourself,\" The entity stated as it disappeared. (Hmmm, I have to think, all I can think of is the various symbols that might hint at a choice. Screw it, I'm going to pick THIS ONE!) he thought as he randomly chose a door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    As soon as Junto opened the door he immediately got sucked in with little time to act and passed out. When he came to, he found himself in what looked like a city with various people walking around and him in an alley way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Junto walked out of the alley and started walking around himself until he noticed an odd sight in front of him. A tall guy with orange hair carrying a sword about as tall as he was and had a slightly pissed off expression on his face and beside him was a girl with black hair also with a sword that was pure white and they were both wearing similar clothes that resembled kimonos while fighting some sort of monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Upon seeing this, Junto decided to hide. (Dammit, this isn't what I signed up for, a freaking monster and two people fighting the fucking thing,) Junto thought to himself while keeping an eye on the fight. He sees the guy slice the monster in half causing said monster to evaporate. \"Rukia, let's go home already. We had to have killed every hollow in the area by now,\" the man suggested with a sigh. The girl, Rukia just thought for a second before karate chopping the guy to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"HELL NO, ICHIGO! YOU ARE NOT BEING LAZY AT THIS TIME, NOT WHEN YOUR SOUL REAPER POWERS ARE JUST RETURNING!!!\" Rukia yelled in frustration. Junto was surprised to see that no one was noticing this outburst. \"I see, so you're the one who appeared out of the blue,\" said a deep male voice. Junto turned around to see a black cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ummm...sorry, were you just talking to...me?\" Junto asked in confusion as the cat smirked. \"Can't get anything past you, can I?\" the cat said with an amused smile. \"OK, now it's official, I've gone crazy, a freaking cat is talking to me, a couple of people just destroyed a monster without being seen, and I've dimension hopped, yep, I am sooo crazy,\" Junto said freaking out about everything that's happening. The cat just responds with a scratch to Junto's face to assure him that everything is real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Are we good? Good, so, introductions. My name is Yoruichi, and I've been instructed to bring you to my friend,\" the cat explained as it started walking away with Junto in tow. Junto was willing to follow the cat, hell, it wasn't the weirdest thing he's seen or done today. After a few minutes they came upon what looked like a shop that was out of the way for a casual shopper. \"Well, are you going to go in or do I have to get Kisuke out?\" the cat asked while wagging his tail. Junto went inside to see a man with blonde hair wearing a green and white striped hat standing behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Ah, the anomaly, pleasure to meet you, my name's Kisuke Urahara, and welcome to my shop,\" the man greeted with a smile. Junto didn't know what to make of this guy, he pretty much just kidnapped Junto out of the blue yet he's acting really friendly. \"Uhhh...hi, my name's Junto Ryusuke and ummm...I'm not certain what to say here,\" Junto said with a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You don't have to say anything, sir. Just know, your spiritual pressure's really huge, you're lucky that a hollow hasn't tried taking a bite out of you yet,\" Kisuke said in a serious tone. \"Wait, hollows?! YOU MEAN THAT THING THAT I SAW TWO PEOPLE FIGHTING?!\" Junto yelled in surprise. \"Ah, so you've already seen our resident Soul Reapers. That tears it, Junto. You're going to become a Soul Reaper yourself,\" Kisuke said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Kisuke then proceeded to lead Junto down to the basement which looked like a wasteland filled with rocks and boulders. \"Wow, who knew this big place was under your shop,\" Junto said in amazement. Kisuke then starts crying tears of joy while Junto looks at him with a confused expression only for Yoruichi to come in and scratch Kisuke on the arm. \"Right, enough foolishness,\" Kisuke said as he poked his cane on Junto's forehead causing him to fall back on the ground but for some reason he felt a little heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Junto looked down to see a chain and saw that said chain leads to what looks like him. \"WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!\" Junto screamed in a mixture of fear and anger. \"Ah, that's your body, part of your process of becoming a Soul Reaper,\" Kisuke said in a nonchalant manner. (A/N: I'm gonna skip the training to the severing of the spirit chain, cause it'll just be a repeat of Ichigo's training until that point.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Upon getting hit and standing up, Junto was suddenly bound by a muscle man with glasses, a mustache, and a braided ponytail. \"Now, you either become a Soul Reaper or a hollow there's no turning back now,\" Kisuke explained in a grave tone. Junto then passed out and when he woke up he was in what looked like a half heaven half hell landscape. \"Welcome, Junto. To our home,\" A soothing female voice greeted. Junto turned around to see a white dragon and it was looking at him as if he was someone precious to her and next to her was a demonic looking wolf who was licking it's chops about what Junto could be thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Uh...h-h-hello, it's nice to meet you two,\" Junto stuttered clearly intimidated by the demonic wolf. The dragon put it's head within Junto's reach to try and get him to pet it. \"Don't worry, Junto. We won't harm you,\" the dragon said in an almost motherly tone. Junto then reached out and gave it a quick touch before pulling back slightly then feeling a bit braver started petting the dragon's head. \"By the way, who are you two?\" Junto asked the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"My name is Ten No Ryu, and that wolf's name is...\" Ten No Ryu started saying before the wolf spoke up. \"Name's Jigoku No Okami, pleasure's all yours,\" Jigoku said with a evil grin. \"We're your Zanpakuto, Junto. We both represent one blade each and all three of us are a team,\" Ten No Ryu explained as she dropped a pure white sword at Junto's feet with what looks to be inscriptions on the blade written in blue. \"You'd better do us justice or I'm going to kill you myself,\" Jigoku No Okami said in a threatening tone before tossing a pure black sword with red inscriptions on the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Junto then woke up with most of his soul chain gone. He quickly jumps out of the hole wearing a robe similar to that of Ichigo and Rukia and having two swords at his side. Kisuke's jaw dropped in shock at what he was seeing. He had never known of a Soul Reaper with two zanpakuto before! Junto then drew his zanpakuto and tried slashing the air with both of them. \"I LOVE THESE TWO!\" Junto practically cried as he aimed the black sword at Kisuke. \"How about we train?\" Junto said with a smirk. Kisuke quickly regained his composure and nodded then took his cane apart to reveal his zanpakuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Time to train then,\" Kisuke said as he charged at Junto. (A/N: I'm gonna continue this later, I used over half of the maximum characters already.)</span></div></div>",
