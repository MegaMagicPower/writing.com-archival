Sparx flew forward and circled Spyro a couple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro brutha you don't know how much I've missed ya!\" Sparx told Spyro joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could take a guess, Sparx!\" Spyro responded. \"But Cynder and I have news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Spyro and I... we're officially a couple!\" Cynder told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Spyro did you really fall for the she dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did... I mean how could I resist someone as beautiful as my Cynder!\" Spyro responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro are you nuts? I mean She's tried to kill us multiple times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparx just look at her with those beautiful green eyes, shining silver horns, amazing face, mesmerizing rump... I mean you did once call her sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Spyro you purple love beetle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that slipped. I didn't mean to say that.\" Sparx retorted to Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder were kissing as Sparx finished saying that and his jaw dropped. He couldn't say anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparx they're adorable and absolutely happy to be with each other. Just let them enjoy the moment.\" Hunter said walking up next to Sparx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...\" Sparx started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. Just let nature do her work. This is meant to be trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't... Oh hey sexy what are you doing tonight?\" Sparx got distracted by a female dragonfly flying by and flew toward her to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro and Cynder finished kissing as Ignitus landed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro, Cynder it's good to see you again in one piece.\" Ignitus said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chronicler Ignitus how's it been?\" Spyro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow but I expected as much being in a deluxe library cave. How's it with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynder and I just got back here a moment ago. Cynder and I are mad in love with each other too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to hear it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! Look! It's Spyro everyone!\" Someone with a heavy French accent called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" Cynder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mole-yair! It's great yo see ya man! How've ya been?\" Spyro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problems back at home. How's it been with you?\" Mole-yair responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got here with Cynder actually. We've been doing great.\" Spyro kissed the black dragoness next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're with the black dragon Cynder!!??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my love and joy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spyro what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a different and beautiful dragon since I been liberated her three years ago.

The two dragons turned to see the citizens making way for the gaurdians. \"Cyril, whats wrong?\" Spyro asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you, my old friends,\" Ignitus said with a smile. \"Good to see you as well,\" Terrador said,\"but we need to discuss with Spyro and Cynder about a urgent matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnitus' smile droped when he realised the seriousness of the situehation. \"I see. Let's disguss inside,\" he said. The group of dragons, as well as Sparx - who was able to escape from his pesky lover - went inside of the temple, away from the eyeing crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro, Cynder, and Sparx entered a very large cylindrical room. The walls where covered by paintings depicting some sort of scene in which dragons played a large part. The chamber was lit by a sun roof, which was also round in shape. In the center stood a well-like construction, filled to the brim with greenish liquid; it was a Pool of Visions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the group gathered around the pool, Cynder asked,\"What's going on? Is there some kind of trouble?\" Suddenly, the Pool of Visions lit up, revealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: a scene where a group of apes are harvesting some sort of strange dark crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: a large army, consisting of black dragons that looked that it could be part of Cynder's race, advancing towards Warfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice three: a wizard performing some kind of spell on a village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice four: a strange ape-like creature wearing armor, and was riding a even stranger in the Avalar forest.</span></div></div>",

Apes ran back-and-fourth, loading mining carts full of strange dark purple gems. A whip cracked through the air every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Spyro asked, narrowing his eyes. \"Dark gems!\" Ignitus exclaimed. \"Dark what?\" Sparx said, confused. \"They are very powerful and dangerous crystals,\" Terrador explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene suddenly zoomed out, revealing two mountians covered in snow. \"I know those mountains,\" Cyril said. They all looked towards the ice dragon, waiting for his explanation. \"They are called 'The Frozen Hell',\" Cyril said. \"They used to be mined for exotic crystals, but were closed down because there was too many cave-ins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the apes doing with them?\" Spyro asked, growing worried. Ignitus was the one to answer Spyro's qeustion. \"Young one, if you have enough Dark gems, you can do powerfull dark magic, even raise someone from the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even Malefor?\" Cynder asked, worried about the possabillity. \"Even Malefor,\" Ignitus confirmed. Spyro felt his heart begin to race. It was happening all over again. \"We have to stop them.\" The purple hero declared. \"Where can we find this 'Frozen Hell'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on there, buddy,\" Sparx said, \"I mean, you guys just got back. Don't you wanna rest or something?\" \"Sparx is correct, you two should replenish your energy.\" Volteer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..\" Spyro began. \"Don't be alarmed, young one. The guardians and I will keep a close eye on the situation,\" Ignitus told Spyro. Spyro sighed. \"Alright, but we should see to this problem as soon as possible,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards, Spyro, Cynder, and Sparx had their share of dinner at the mess hall. They where the escorted by Terrador to their room: a large chamber with two single beds, a balcony, and even a tiny bed Sparx made for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like it,\" Terrador said, \"This is the largest room we have in the temple.\" \"It's great. Thank you, Terrador,\" Cynder said. Terrador nodded and left, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was gone, Spyro helped Cynder push her bed closer to his. After the did that, they climbed upom it, getting themselves comfortable for sleep. Cynder drifted off to sleep quickly in Spyro's arms, but, for some reason, the purple dragon could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was constantly thinking of the dark gem crisis. It was later that night when Spyro finally drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was in the early morning houers when Spyro woke up. The room was only a blue haze, he observed, and Cynder was still sleeping peachfully in his arms. He sighed, tightening his arms slightly around his lover. Everything in the world seemed right...until her rememberd the crisis looming over Avalar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro groaned. As much as he wanted to save the world from a epending doom, he also wanted to relax and be with his soon-to-be-mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro lifted his head and gazed at the room. The only thing he saw was Sparx's faint glow and the heavy drapes over the windows and balcony door. It was far too early for anyone, even the gaurdians, to be awake. Spyro sighed and rested his head back on the pillow, but found he could not go back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Spyro, carfull not to wake Cynder, got out of bed and tip-toed to the balcony door. He glanced back at Cynder and then Sparx. Both where still sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe removed the drapes slowly and opened the balcony's door. The air was slightly chilly, Spyro felt, and a few krikets still churbed. The city was also empty of life, besides for a few gaurds marching on the walls, who where finishing their their last night-shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro took a deep breath of the early morning air. It soothed him a little, abelling him to think more clearly. \"The view is nice, isn't it,\" Spyrp heard a vioce say. Spyro jurked around and saw Cynder. \"Oops. Sorry if I scared you,\" she opollagised. Spyro smiled at her, and said,\"It's okay. But why are you up?\" Cynder smiled back at him, saying while she aprouched him,\"I heard you leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro didn't say anything. He only invited her to sit next to him, tugging his wing around her and moving Cynder close to his body. They watched the first rays of sunshine creeping its way over the hilltops, illumanating the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later that morning when Spyro, Cynder, and Sparx made their way to the gaurdians courters. They had already eaten there breakfast, and all where wide awake for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro wad the first to knock on the large wooden door that led to the gaurdians chamber. They where greeted by Cyril and led in. Inside Volteer and Terrador had already assembled. Ignitus was starring at the pool looking at whatever scene there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, young ones,\" Ignitus greeted, looking up from the pool. \"What's the situation?\" Spyro asked, walking over to the pool. \"I'm afraid it has gotten worse,\" Terrador said. \"The have been collecting Dark gems in great numbers. We fear their supplies maight increase soon,\" Volteer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to stop them and fast,\" Cynder declared. \"With what army? Have you seen how many apes are myning there,\" Sparx said, looking at the scene depicted in the pool. \"Have you ever heard of planning a attack, Sparx,\" Cynder restorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calme down,\" Ignitus ordered,\" Sparx is right; you will be needing some help.\" \"That's why I went out and recruited the best help I can find,\" Cyril said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the shadows emerged two dragons. One was a blood-red colore, with zick-zack like horns. Long spikes beginning from the top of his head to the base of his neck. He had a leaf-like blade for a tail tip and his wings where the same colore as his scales. He was well-build, wearing a cowboy-like hat and a plain necklace on with a single sharp looking bone as the main decaration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one was a bright-pink colore. She had frills running from the top of her head to her hart-shaped tail spike. Her eyes where a baby-blue color. Her wings where a yellow color, like her underbelly, and she wore a heart-shaped locket. Her body was slender build, but had a larger then normale rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yound dragons, I like you to meet Flame and Ember,\" Cyril said. The two dragons stepped fourth. Spyro held out his paw to shake Flame's paw, but was then grabbed and shaked violently by the red dragon. \"Pleasure to meet ya, mate,\" he said in a deep australian accent,\"and this must be the lovely Cynder. Pleasure to meet you aswell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber was the next to greet them. \"It is a pleasure to meet you two,\" she said in a mid-Atlantic accent, bowing her head respectfully. She then looked up and shot a wink at Spyro. The purple dragon only smiled at her, but Cynder clearly got the message that Ember had a crush on Spyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They volenteerd to help you with your mission,\" Cyril explained,\"Flame is a expert at tracking and navagating. Ember here can heal someone by touch and is a great medic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems that you are all set, yound ones,\" Ignitus said, aprouching the group. \"So, when should we leave?\" Spyro asked. \"Any time from today,\" Terrador said,\"we will give you time to prepare, but then you must be off.\" Spyro nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing the young dragons the location of the mountians, the group finally left the chamber. Ember and Flame walked infront of Spyro, Cynder, and Sparx. It was then that Cynder noticed that Ember was swinging her hips in a rather sudductive way, showing off her shapy rear, and Spyro, though he tried to hide it, was taking great pleasure looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder growled softly. 'She is going to be s probleme,' Cynder thought.</span></div></div>",

They where all gatherd buy the temples front gate, ready to go on their qeust, but they where delayed by Ember, who claimed that she had a few things to go over in her first-aid kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, what's taking lala-girl so long?\" Sparx said, resting himself on Spyro's head. They have been waiting atleast a half houer for the pink dragoness. \"Ember just likes to sometimes take her sweet little time, that's all,\" Flame said in defence,\"she don't mean to stall everyone, mate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder frowned. \"Well, she has been stalling us enough,\" she said angrely.

Cynder growled softly. 'She has quite the little attetude,' the black dragoness thought in dusgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to leave the room aswell, but something catched Cynder's eye. It was a bottle, filled with strange orange liquid. Curiousity getting the best of her, Cynder went over to the bottle on the shelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the bottle and investigated it. It had a labell intitled 'Growth' on it. Cynder removed the corck and sniffed it. It had a rich sweet smell to it, almost like flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore curiousity took hold of her. She wanted to drink it. But did she?</span></div></div>",

The pool zoomed in to two dragons speaking to each other, both male. There was nothing strange to note, except for their large bobbing obscenenic members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, this thing is spreading. Half of the city has it already, and there has been reports that some in the farming lands have been catching it too,\" the red dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really! Gods be damned. Our alchemists better find a cure fast. My cock is getting too big. Its grown at least two inches bigger from yesterday,\" the yellow one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At Least it's your cock and not your balls. I've heard that it's pleasurable when your penis grows, but it hurts when my nuts expand.\" The red one tucked at his inflated ballsack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene suddenly dissapeared and shifted to another one. This one was somewhere in a throne room. On a brown oak chair sat a slightly overweight dragon. From the golden crown on his head, it was easy to tell that he was king, but he was not spared from the virus it would seem. His huge penis spurted little bits of cum and his balls touched the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cure is not working!\" the blue dragon roared, tossing a vile he had in his paw to the floor. The king then grabbed a mole by his neck (who also seemed to be infected), and said,\"You better tell those alchemists that they should get their cure done, or I will hack off all their overgrown cocks, you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..y..yes, Y..Your Grace,\" the mole said in fear. He dropped the mole and he scurried away. The king growled, rubbing his member. \"I sould hack these things off, but I love them too much. Hollard!\" the dragon called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheetah came running into the room. The front of his breeches were bulging badly. \"Your Grace?\" he said. \"Get me a whore. I must fuck something before my balls explode,\" the king demanded. \"But, Your Grace, the alchemists said that you souldn't mate anyone. Your cock would only get big-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what that idiot alchemist said! I want something to fuck, now!\" the king snapped. The cheetah ran off, doing what he was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene evaporated and the pool returned to its normal state. \"What was that?\" Spyro said in shock. \"The Northern city,\" Ignitus said,\"It borders Avalar.\" \"We have to do something,\" Spyro declared. \"We will in time, young one, but now you should rest. We will keep watch,\" said Ignitus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
