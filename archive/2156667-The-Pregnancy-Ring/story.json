He was the school's deadpan snarker. But Connor also had a secret he kept from all: he had a fetish for pregnant women. It didn't matter how plain a girl looked- if she was pregnant, he wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while walking to first period, he spied a solid gold ring. Curious, he rubbed it. It seemed to do nothing, but a few seconds later, a voice inside his head made itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Put the ring in your pocket,' it commanded. Connor's mind was unsure, but his body had already decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have obtained the Pregnancy Ring,' said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The what?' Connor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Pregnancy Ring allows you to create new pregnancies or edit existing ones, finetuning them to your preferences. However, only women who were on campus when you picked it up can come under the ring's influence.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That sounds perfect. When can I use it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right now!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor was excited, but he was unsure who to use the ring on first.</span></div></div>",

She had blonde hair with dark roots, frosted tips, mid-length hair.  Kind of a messy-chic that he saw from behind more often than not.  Curvy but not thicc, with soft features and a tendency to wear clothes just a little snug.  She wore too much makeup, and had a bit of a prissy attitude most of the time.  She didn't like him much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the very end of last year, it was rumored that she got pregnant by her on-again, off-again boyfriend, whom she dumped on the last day of school.  The notion captured his imagination all summer long, and he couldn't wait to see what truth came of it come September.  When school started and she <i>wasn't</i> showing, an entire summer of fantasy came to nought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eyes moved to the left one, catching on another girl hard at work chewing on her pencil.  Cherie Fircrest.  She'd been a staple in his life since kindergarten, when she lived down the street in the apartments at the end of the block.  Her dad was the chief of police in town, a big African American man; her mother was reportedly part Shawnee.  This gave Cherie a look that stood out from the norm- features that marked her as different, but pretty.  He'd had an eye on her since as long as he could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She had been friends with him, back when they lived close together, until her parents moved into a house outside of town.  Overnight, she stopped talking to him, stopped looking at him.  It was as if her moving had made her a different person.  She was a very smart girl, always receiving top marks in class, and as Connor was at best a B-student, it was one more thing driving a wedge between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was here that Nicole Hulitzer, the twin sister of his best friend Nick Hulitzer, hit him in the back of the head with her ruler.  \"Hey Con<i>nerd</i>- you got some paper I can borrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Connor frowned and turned towards her, \"You're out of paper already?  What the hell, Nicole... are you eating it or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Choose one!</b></i> came the voice, more commanding this time.  He didn't really have time to think about a response- the name just popped into his head:</span></div></div>",

He reluctantly handed off a small stack and, in the span of time it took to turn, she was back at her desk, with the larger share he previously had, the small stack that he has taken off from it was left in his hands.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dGuess this is mine.\u201d He grieved<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>so shall it be done!</i>\u201d the voice within his head spoke aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As sudden as the voice came,a loud gurgle erupted within the room. All eyes shifted, trying to find its source when it occurred once more, eyes on Nicole as she looked so discomfited, wearing a belly shirt and Jeggings when she rose and rushed from sight, immediately snatching the pass from the teacher and running off toward the gn bathrooms. </span></div></div>",
