Mike was on his way home from what had been an uneventful day at school and he wasn't in a rush to get home since he'd just be bored there too. <i>At least tomorrow is Friday</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was walking, Mike almost tripped over something. He stumbled, but caught his balance just in time. He turned to see what had almost caused him to fall and discovered a weird looking remote lying on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A remote?\" he asked no one in particular. \"What's this doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike picked up the device and examined it. It was unlike any remote he had seen before. It had a screen and four buttons: Fuse, De-Fuse, Select, and Reset. It had the words <i>Blarg Industries</i> engraved along the bottom, just underneath the buttons. The screen appeared to be displaying some kind of directions. Reading through, it appeared to be claiming that the device could be used to fuse things together. It seemed to be designed with fusing people in mind but it said that it could also work on inanimate objects and animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Mike said. He knew it couldn't be possible, but at the same time he was curious. He had to know if it really worked...</span></div></div>",

The question remained, who should he test it out on first?</span></div></div>",

She was quite the studious worker, and with all the honors classes she was taking she would start working on schoolwork as soon as she got home. Today she was wearing a short denim skirt and a white girl's cut t-shirt. Her long hair was up in a bun so keep it out of her eyes while she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan didn't see Mike watching her, so it gave him some time to think of who or what to fuse her with.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking he might as well try the remote out on himself too, Mike decided to fuse himself with his older sister. First selecting Megan as the first target, then himself, Mike hit the Fuse button. There was a bright flash of white light, temporarily blinding Mike, then he found himself standing in his sister's room. The first thing Mike noticed was that Megan was nowhere to be seen. He then looked down at himself and figured out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, it worked!\" Mike gasped, seeing a pair of breasts on his chest. He then covered his mouth. His voice sounded distinctly feminine, and somewhat like his older sister, although a bit lower. He imagined it was what he would sound like if he had been born a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the reality of the moment sink in for a second, Mike walked over to the mirror on his sister's closet door to get a look at himself. He was greeted with a rather interesting sight. The first thing he noticed was that his face looked like a combination of Megan's and his own, although it had a very feminine appearance. Judging from his appearance, Mike would have guessed he looked about 16 now, halfway in age between Megan and himself. His hair was about shoulder length, somewhere between the length of Megan's hair, which reached down to her waist, and his own short hair, a lighter shade of brown than his own, but darker than Megan's. His figure was more slender, but not quite as slender as Megan's had been. He still looked quite feminine, however, curves and all, but those curves were just ... less curvy than his sister had been by a little. Height-wise, he was now 5'6\", halfway between his height and Megan's. He also had her C-cup breasts on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of the clothes he now wore, his outfit seemed to be a mix of what he had been wearing and what his sister had been wearing. He was wearing her short denim skirt, and he could feel her bra and panties underneath his clothes. He also had on the Nirvana t-shirt he had been wearing, although it was now more form-fitting. He also had on his sneakers, but a few sizes smaller to fit his smaller feet. Additionally, his face was done up with makeup like Megan usually had hers, and his nails were painted a pale pink shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" David said to himself as he looked away from his reflection. Peering around the room, Mike began to notice that it looked different. It had a lot of Megan's stuff, but also a lot of his stuff. Curious, Mike went back to his room and saw that it was now a guest room. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike wandered back to his new room and looked back at his reflection. There was still one thing he wasn't sure of. Was he a girl now? He had no idea what this device had done. There was one way to find out. Sticking a hand down his skirt and into his panties, Mike felt around to see what parts he had down there. It only took a second to discover that ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling around with his feminine, manicured hand, Mike first found what he was used to finding between his own legs: a penis and a pair of testicles. The only difference that there was no trace of pubic hair to be found save for a small strip just above his penis. However, there was more to it than that. With a little more feeling around, Mike discovered a pair of fleshy lips behind his now-hairless balls.This was so weird. Because he had fused himself with his sister, it seemed that Mike had become some weird combination of a boy and a girl. Curious, Mike slipped a finger into his new womanhood, sending a wave of pleasure rippling through him and causing his penis to harden. \"Woah,\" he gasped in surprise and pleasure. It felt <i>good</i>. It was weird and very different from anything he was used to, but he liked it. He definitely wanted to explore further. Sticking in two fingers this time, and probing deeper, Mike felt an even stronger ripple of pleasure that brought his dick to full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.\" The sound escaped Mike's glossy lips in the form of a soft, feminine moan of pleasure. These alien sensations felt incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't before Mike was lying on what had until moments ago been his sister's bed, totally naked and furiously sliding his fingers in and out of his new vagina. His other hand, meanwhile, was jerking off his dick with the same amount of vigor and it felt way better than any time he had jerked off in his regular male body. Having this combination of a male and female body came with all sorts of pleasurable feelings, some familiar and some alien, and Mike was certainly going to make the most of things while he was in this state. Who would pass up a chance like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he increased his pace, Mike suddenly felt an intense wave of pleasure flow through him as he reached his first female orgasm. It was immediately followed intense, glorious explosion of pleasure from his penis. However, instead of the low that always followed the pleasure spike of shooting a load, Mike felt only an incredible high that seemed to linger for quite some time. It must've been what always happened after a female orgasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, Mike relaxed on the bed and basked in the glory of his orgasm. It was quite the experience. However, he only took a few moments before getting dressed again. There was more about this reality to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through the strange combination of his and Megan's belongings that were now all his, Mike soon came across a driver's license. It said he was, in fact, now 16, which explained why he had it. In this reality he was a brand new driver. The license also listed his gender as female and his name as Michaela Hunter instead of Michael Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm definitely a girl now,\" Mike said aloud, starting to get used to his new feminine voice. \"That makes sense, I guess?\" It made as much sense as something could in a world where a device capable of fusing people together existed. The logic was sound enough; since he had an entirely female body now with the exception of still having a penis in addition to a vagina, he was seen as a female in this reality. It did make more sense than being seen as a male. Now the question remained ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do now?\" Mike wondered to himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Curious to see just how extensive the fusion remote's reality changing capabilities were, Mike decided he would stay fused with Megan -- stay as Michaela -- for a bit longer and explore the new reality he found himself in. He could return things to normal any time he wanted, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Mike thought to do was check his Facebook profile. He sat down at his computer, or rather what had once been Megan's computer and booted it up. Interestingly enough, his password was still the same as his own and for the most part everything was set up how his own computer had been, although there was a mix of his own and Megan's files. It was pretty surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike soon navigated to his Facebook profile, or more accurately the Facebook profile of Michaela Hunter, the fusion of himself and his sister. Looking through everything, Mike learned quite a lot about the person he was in this new reality. It seemed his personality and interests were pretty much an even combination of his and Megan's. He was also now a sophomore, the grade between his own and his sister's. He still had all his old friends though, as well as some new ones from his new grade ... but he also had all of Megan's friends too. He was glad that Megan was currently single because he definitely didn't want to have a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be weird,\" Mike said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done looking through Facebook, Mike got up and began to wander around the house, leaving the remote behind in his new room. Looking through the family photos on display, in all the pictures that had included both himself and Megan, they had been replaced with just Michaela, and each of them had been replaced by Michaela in pictures only containing one of them. As a result, there was now way more photos of Michaela than there were of Mike and Megan's younger sister Alexis. Personally, Mike found that rather amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mike found his way to the kitchen where his mom was getting dinner prepped. Was it that late already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie,\" Mike's mom greeted him, finding nothing off about his appearance. To her, he was just her eldest daughter, Michaela. \"How was school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom,\" Mike replied. \"School was fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about helping me with dinner while you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Mike agreed. He wasn't exactly sure what to do, but found himself instinctively knowing what to do to help his Mom prep the meal. It seemed he had Megan's knowledge as Michaela, but since he was aware of the fusion with his sister he wasn't consciously aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much later, Mike was sitting down to dinner with his parents as well as his sister Alexis. Again, no one in his family saw anything out of the ordinary. This was all totally normal for them. It was just a regular old day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Mike helped clean up before heading back up to his room. He was fascinated by this new reality and still trying to process everything. It was a bit much and was thinking about maybe unfusing with his sister, but on the other hand, he was curious to keep exploring this new reality or maybe even seeing how things would change if he caused more fusions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding there was so much more to this reality that he had yet to experience, Mike decided to stay as Michaela for a while longer and go to school the next day. He could always return to normal at any time. With that decided, it was time to figure out what to do next. That's when something inside him told him he had homework to do. Normally, Mike was rather lazy and put his homework off to the last minute, but some part of Megan's personality was pushing him to do it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Mike sat down at what had until recently been Megan's desk and took a look at what work he had to do. It was all totally unfamiliar to him. All the material was for sophomore classes as he was one in this reality. Fortunately, he had access to lots of Megan's knowledge. As a junior, Megan had already taken these classes the year before and that knowledge was now part of his knowledge as Michaela. Being aware of the reality change was making things confusing, but Mike worked through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mike completed all of Michaela's homework. By then, it was pretty late, so he decided to go to bed. Megan's bed was super comfortable, and Mike felt a bit jealous as he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Mike awoke feeling a bit confused. He was wondering why he was in Megan's room until he remembered the day before. He had found a remote that could fuse people together and he had fused himself with his older sister. \"It wasn't a dream,\" Mike said with his new feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got his bearings again, Mike began to get ready for school. Due to being fused with his sister, he felt the strong urge to put makeup on, and he knew exactly how to do it. Once he was all ready, it was off to school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool as Michaela, as it turned out, proved to be rather overwhelming for Mike. He was friends with all of his friends, all of Megan's friends, plus a bunch of people from his new grade. Michaela may have known them all, but for Mike, who was aware of what things were like before he had fused with Megan, it was hard to keep track of them. And because he was now a grade above them, Mike didn't even have class with his friends. He would have very much liked to be able to spend more time with Jon and Marisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the flip side, classes were a breeze. Since he knew all that Megan knew, he knew all the material because she had taken all these classes the year before. That meant he really didn't need to pay attention. This particular aspect of being Michaela was like having the best of both worlds. He could be lazy and not pay attention in class and know all the material too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one of the only good things about school in this reality. By the end of the day, Mike was feeling very drained. He hadn't even bothered using the remote, which he had brought to school, because navigating through a new reality after just one fusion was overwhelming enough. Maybe if he himself wasn't involved in the fusion he would be less overwhelmed by the changes. No matter, he was committed to exploring this reality until the end of the school day, which was finally here. As soon as he got home, he would be undoing the fusion. And once he did that, he would spend the weekend seeing what else he could do with the remote ... and he would leave himself out of the fusions for a while.</span></div></div>",

He had brought it with him, after all. He pulled the device out and took a look at it again. It was so powerful. It could alter reality itself. He had no idea such a thing was possible. Just one use of the remote had changed his entire perception of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the stresses of the busy school day were beginning to subside, Mike found himself wanting to try the remote out again. On other people this time, of course. Looking around, he took in what he had to work with. On this part of the street, there weren't many people around. There were two goth girls from his school walking together nearby and a mother in her 30s walking her 6 year old daughter home from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as to what would happen, Mike targeted the little girl and one of the goth girls. As with the first fusion from the previous day, there was a bright flash of white light. When it cleared, the goth girl was gone and the little girl was looking quite different. Her cute dress was now black and very gothic looking. In fact her entire style became that of a goth girl even though she still looked to be just as young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Mike fused the remaining goth girl with the mother. After another flash, the woman was now decked out in a goth outfit and was a few years younger. She looked quite hot to Mike. He felt his penis harden and strain against his panties and he also felt the still alien sensation of his vagina getting wet. \"So weird,\" he muttered to himself in his feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the gothic mother and daughter, Mike thought about how the rules for how fusions worked seemed random. The three fusions he had so far caused all had drastically different results. Still thinking this over, Mike reversed the two fusions he'd just caused. He wasn't ready to leave anyone else fused for an extended period of time, even if he didn't know them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing on his way, Mike soon arrived at his house. He was greeted by his energetic dog Kobe as soon as he walked in the door. Just as with all the people in Mike's life, Kobe thought he had always been Michaela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, boy,\" Mike told Kobe as he eagerly jumped up at him. In his excitement, the dog knocked the remote right out of Mike's hand and onto the floor. He could not have predicted what happened next.</span></div></div>",

No pieces had broken off and the screen appeared to be displaying things normally. \"Thank God,\" Mike said, his fear of being stuck fused with his sister subsiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seemed to be well, so Mike made his way upstairs and into what had been Megan's room before he had fused with her. What he wasn't aware of was the fact that the remote had, in fact, been damaged by the fall. The impact hadn't done much to the device's exterior, but it had caused a minor hiccup in it's internal memory systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnorant to these facts, Mike set his things down and prepared to return to normal. He took aim at himself with the remote and selected himself as a target, then he hit the De-Fuse button.

He gave her a one over, Megan\u2019s very masculine teenage body was covered in very feminine skinny jean shorts with panties coving an obvious bulge her shorts, Blouse and a hint of an unfilled bra underneath.  A hint of scruff, signifying the beginnings of a beard, covered her masculine facial features and her short brown hair looked unbrushed, like she had just woken up.  Having to look slightly upwards at Megan at her 5\u2019 7\u201d height from his 5\u2019 5\u201d height.  \u201cAre you okay Megan,\u201d asked Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes. Um, I guess so.  That was sort of freaky.  But in a good way. I just never realized that someone could fuse together like that.  So, um, yeah.  I don\u2019t exactly know how to respond right this second.  Except to say that it was actually kinda cool, and nice, to experience a day in the life as someone else.  Like seeing things through the eyes of someone else.  I actually started to feel your feelings and hear your thoughts as if they were my own too.  But enough about me.  Are you Okay Mike?\u201d said Megan, coming out of her daze.  She looked Mike up and down to make sure he was physically okay.  His T-shirt, with his favorite baseball team\u2019s logo on it, covered his obviously feminine torso.  His Breasts, firm and perky stuck out of the T-shirt like mounds of flesh.  Looking down to his very feminine hips his basketball shorts hung down to midthigh.  His feminine legs, shaven.  Looking back up to his face, Mike\u2019s very feminine facial features were accented by his long light brown hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course I\u2019m fine.  That was actually really cool.  I didn\u2019t really expect that to happen.  Sorry about that Sis,\u201d said Mike in his very feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Mike,\u2019 said Megan in her very masculine voice.  \u2018It was fun to be someone else for a day.  Maybe, when the time is right, we could do that again.  You know Mike, you really should get a bra for those \u2018girls\u2019 of yours.  Trust me, it\u2019ll help your back.  I know you\u2019ve been complaining to mom that your back hurts sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, like you\u2019ll know Megan,\u201d jibed Mike, with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Megan said, feigning insult as she slugged in playfully in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Megan\u2019s cell phone rang.  Megan answered, \u201cHey girl!  What\u2019s up?\u2019 turning away from Mike Megan started to walk up to her room, looking back at Mike she took the phone away from her mouth, \u2018Hey Mike.  Let\u2019s talk about everything later ok?\u2019  putting the phone back up to her mouth, walking out of the room.  \u2018Yeah, that was just my brother.  We were just having a, conversation.  I don\u2019t know.  He can be strange sometimes\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked like a 5\u20197 woman, who was likely around 49 and 50 years old, and had features from both Mike\u2019s father and mother, with hair that went to her shoulders. It was dark brown with light brown highlights, which Mike found odd, since he thought it would be a shade between the two like his own fusion had been, but he guessed there was a reason behind it. The woman also had Grace\u2019s C-cup breasts, and was wearing a mixture of the clothes Grace and Philip had been wearing. Grace was wearing a yellow dress while Philip was wearing a red shirt and blue jeans. The woman\u2019s clothes were an orange tank top and a blue skirt. Mike couldn\u2019t see it, but the woman was also wearing a black bra with pink polka dots on it, and a matching pair of panties customized to fit her penis and testicles above her vagina. This underwear being a fusion of Grace\u2019s pink lingerie and Philip\u2019s black boxers. Mike saw a purse sitting on the couch where Philip was a moment ago, and walked over to look inside it. He found a driver\u2019s license that said his new parent\u2019s name was Philipa Hunter.

I was careful enough to use protection whenever I slept with someone, but one night, when I was older, I masturbated, and ended up getting myself pregnant. I don\u2019t want you to go through that, not as young as you are at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you got yourself pregnant?\u201d Mike asked, still processing that information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.

If he got himself pregnant, then since he\u2019s fused with his sister, then wouldn\u2019t that be like getting his sister pregnant?

Slipping a finger between them, Mike felt a wave of pleasure ripple through him. \"Woah,\" he gasped in surprise and pleasure. It felt <i>good</i>. It was weird and very different from anything he was used to, but he liked it. He definitely wanted to explore further. Sticking in two fingers this time, and probing deeper, Mike felt an even stronger ripple of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.\" The sound escaped Mike's glossy lips in the form of a soft, feminine moan of pleasure. These alien sensations felt incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't before Mike was lying on what had until moments ago been his sister's bed, totally naked and furiously sliding his fingers in and out of his new vagina. His other hand, meanwhile, massaged one of his new breasts. Having a female body came with all sorts of pleasurable feelings that were very different from those of a male body, and Mike was certainly going to make the most of them while he was in this state. Who would pass up a chance like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he increased his pace, Mike suddenly felt an intense wave of pleasure flow through him as he reached his first female orgasm. It wasn't the same immediate and glorious explosion of pleasure that came and went in just a few seconds, but a more spread out, less intense feeling that last quite a bit longer. It was an incredible high that seemed to linger instead of the low that always followed the pleasure spike of shooting a load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, Mike relaxed on the bed and basked in the glory of his orgasm. It was quite the experience. However, he only took a few moments before getting dressed again.

It said he was, in fact, now 16, which explained why he had it. In this reality he was a brand new driver. The license also listed his gender as female and his name as Michaela Hunter instead of Michael Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm definitely a girl now,\" Mike said aloud, starting to get used to his new feminine voice. \"That makes sense.\" It made as much sense as something could in a world where a device capable of fusing people together existed. The logic was sound; since he had an entirely female body now, he was seen as a female in this reality.

The TV was on MTV and was showing your run-of-the-mill white rapper trying to be black. The video was a basic rap video with lots of money,cars and girls. Mike could barely understand what the guy was saying as he was just mumbling a lot or screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he wants to be black so much let me help him!\" He smiled as he fired; now in the midst of all the girls sat a tallish girl with chestnut skin and a large frizzy hair. The girl had lots of heavy makeup on (highlighting her beautiful sky blue eyes and large lips), extra large hoop earrings and large golden nails. The body was now devoid of body hair and was now largely feminine with H cup boobs and a VERY large butt, jiggling like a bowl of jelly. Although she still had the rapper's gold chain, watches and even gold grille, she now wore a very short black crop top, accentuating the large boobs she had and a mini skirt that threatened to burst at the seams at the back while a massive 8\" penis strained the front. A designer Gucci jacket was draped over her slender shoulders and she also had Gucci shades to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video continued in basically the same way it was before with her tossing out money at the assorted girls that were twerking and gyrating in front of her. Mike could feel himself getting hornier as the rapper started grinding up against another beautiful woman. He checked google and saw the rapper, Drizzy Drex, had become the most popular and sought after rapper in the world due to his fusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy...\"</span></div></div>",

The policeman made a weak attempt to grab the criminal while trying not to drop his donuts. A tall-ish woman rushed out of the store and looked at the officer in disbelief. \"Are you gonna stop him?!\" The officer just shrugged and continued chomping on another donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be more focused on your job and not that donut.\" Mike smiled. A second later the police officer realised what was happening and discarded the donuts. Now possessing a body that was now more in shape from the young tall-ish woman, he proceeded to chase down the man and tackle him to the ground. It didn't help that the man was now 500lbs after fusing with an obese man ordering at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Mike selected an infant child who was bawling his eyes out and an exhausted mid 30s mother who was trying to comfort him, sitting on a bench. Now there was a stunning 22 year old girl standing on the bench, looking very lost and starting to sniffle a little. The Mickey Mouse shirt the baby was wearing was now a crop topand the trousers he was wearing now very short shorts. Mike went up to her and sat down.\" What's wrong?\"he asked. \" \"W-W-Well my boyfriend is c-coming to pick me up but he f-f-forgot to bring me my choo-choo train and Choo-Choo always me f-feel less n-n-nervous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worrry, I'm sure he'll come soon,\" Mike said as he patted her on the head,eliciting a happy squeal from the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking away, Mike saw his 2 least favourite people in the world- Ashley McAarons and her boyfriend Bray Bielsman. At 5\"11\" with DD cup boobs at 17 years old,Ashley towered over most girls in Mike's high school, phisically and socially.As the captain of the cheer squad and all around *bleep*, everyone outside of her friend group everyone hated and feared her. Everyone knew she was dating 6\"5\" Bray just so she could get him to beat up anyone she didn't like.Fishing two tickets out of her purse, Mike saw that both she and Bray were going to the Drizzy Drex concert.Mike realised that now was the perfect time for revenge and looked around for people to punish them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the road he saw two people that were sitting next to each other,both looking depressed. One was a girl in Mike's class called Anita. Even though she stood at a diminutive height of 5\"2\",Anita used to be 250lbs. After months of bullying and tormenting,Anita had refused to eat and began starving herself, becoming anorexic in the process. The other person was a boy his age called Eugene who was relentlessly bullied by Bray and the rest of the football team as he was your stereotypical nerd- braces,large circle-rimmed glasses and a pathetic physique with a horrendous swarm of acne. He was also       <br>\r\nchair of the chess,mathletes and multiplayer RPG games clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're perfect! But Anita needs some more muscle on her bones...Oh well! Easily fixed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou zapped both couples and the results were very amusing to Mike. Now Ashley, instead of her being a curvy high school goddess, she now was a lot less muscular with a tiny stub that was a sad excuse for a penis.She also now had Eugene's large spectacles and acne no amount of makeup could disguise. She also had his braces and now spoke with a bad lisp. Bray,on the other hand, had lost a bit of his muscles but it looked like all of the excess muscle had transferred to his butt and bosom(he was now a H cup). Mike noticed he had his rock hard abs and his 9\" cock. The head looked more like Anita with shoulder length hair,brushed to one side of his face, exposing one of his emerald green eyes. Although the face was Anita's,the jaw was more chiseled and there was no makeup on the face, making her face look beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bray, I got uss two tickets to thhhat Drizzy Drex conssert in thhemall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! But baby, when we go out this time,please don't try to suck my tits again- your braces really hurt them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bray it's not my fault you have humongous boobs or that their bigger and juicer than mine.The way they jiggle I'm surprised you can still RUN AROUND while playing football!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with your giant glasses, I'm suprised you can keep them ON while doing all your flips and stunts on the cheer squad.  Not to mention juggling that with the chess,math and RPG clubs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Bray!\"<br>\r\n\"And I love you too Ashley!\" Their lips locked as Mike skipped away, whistling a happy tune to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the shop window of a store he saw a young boy pleading with his mother.\"Please-please-please,mommy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Kenny! You know how sugar makes you hyperactive! Plus I'm not sure that this 'Tigerman' is suitable for kids your age!\" The kid broke down in tears bawling his eyes out.\"Stop making a scene Kenny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored out of his skull by Jon's ticket capers,Mike started fantasising about the woman fusing to see what she would do then.Suddenly,a shout from Jon brought his mind back to reality.\"Hello,Earth to Mike?!Were you even listening?!\" Mike attempted to feign interest in whatever Jon was talking about.\"Uh,yes Jon.I was listening and I am disappointed that,as your best friend, you would doubt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,huh.So how did I get the tickets?\" Mike's face turned a deep shade of red.\"Well,didn't you buy it from that guy,who got them from that dude,and um...you're not buying this are you?\" Jon just shook his head and laughed.\"You're in your own world,Mike...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from that embarrassment, Mike checked the store window and was shocked to see what had happened- there standing with the boy was a 6\"2\" anthropomorphic female tiger.Although it was covered with unruly orange and black fur, it was wearing a simple green polo top and jeans the mother was wearing before. It had no shoes on revealing four toes with four sharp claws. Although she had fur covering her face, the tiger woman still wore light dashes of makeup and the mother's jewellery. \"But mommy,there's no scary tiger on this box!,\"Mike heard the kid say.\"How dare you use that language!That is extremely stereotypical,assuming that because I'm a tiger I'm going to scare people away! No,you cannot have the cereal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike saw the mother turn around and growl at her son,extending her hand claws.The son just whimpered and accepted defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...did I do that?I just thought about it and it happened! Did I just get like,fusion powers from that remote...AWESOME...\"</span></div></div>",

Mike suddenly shook his head and let Jon take him away- he had enough time to experiment later anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---3 HOURS LATER---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike just stood waiting behind a barricade while Jon and Jessica started bickering about something trivial. He would've listened in but he was too excited to concentrate. He'd never been to a concert before and couldn't wait for Drizzy Drex to come out. He looked round and saw his friend (and secret crush) Marisa Martinez. Although she wasn't EXCEPTIONALLY beautiful, she had a killer personality and a killer butt to match with it. She was wearing a small hoodie and skintight leggings that accentuated her curves. Mike would have gone up to her but her 17 year old, 6 foot tall brother Diego was guarding her like a hawk. Many other guys stared at her butt and Diego threatened them with a large fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw many other beautiful women, all wearing excessive makeup and jewellery along with body hugging clothes. He even saw a girl with sparkling emerald eyes wink at him. She had a near perfect face with DD cup boobs and a very plump bum. Unlike all the other girls, she wasn't trying to look trashy as she just wore a normal Nike tracksuit instead of trying to expose every part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, loud music started pumping from the speakers near Mike. \"Now presenting, the hottest hip-hop artist in the biz, Drizzy...DREX!\" An uproar came from the crowd as a jaw-dropping bombshell strutted onto the stage wearing large hoop earrings, a sports bra and tiny shorts. \" YOU READY TO PARTY?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd all screamed back, including Mike, as the beat dropped. The lyrics weren't exactly the best, but the club music style had everyone jumping. Mike saw many men dancing and ogling as women twerked and gyrated on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike even felt himself getting a boner as he watched Drex grinding on multiple different beautiful backup dancers behind him.

So, what do you think of Drex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike chose his words carefully so she wouldn't think he came here just to ogle at Drizzy Drex. \"She's no lyrical genius but her beats are sick. They really reflect the hyperactive nature of Drex herself and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah,woah,woah! Slow down Music Man! Try explaining in five words or less!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike thought. \"It makes the crowd jump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. I definitely agree with that.

I'm Esmeralda.Everyone calls me Esme though.\" Mike returned her smile and shook her outstretched hand. \"Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mike. You know, I'm glad we met today; you're like the only other person here that actually cares about the MUSIC instead of peering at Drex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..,\" Mike replied shifting his body position to hide his erection from Esme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mike, do you want to dance with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shirked away and scratched his head. \"I don't really know how to dance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsme flipped her brunette locks then cocked her head to one side as she giggled at Mike. \"Have you ever danced before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, kind of, but only when I was dancing by myself in the shower listening to rock music...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do THAT!\" She grabbed his arm and pulled him into a small area that was empty on the dance floor. \"Come on,show me? Pwetty Pwease?\" She pouted at Mike. \"Ok...(here goes nothing)\" Mike started shifting from side to side, much to the dismay of Esme. \"Come on, show me your moves Music Mike!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little spurring on by Esme, Mike gradually became more confident, dancing and moving like no one was watching. A crowd quickly surrounded them and started chanting Mike's name. \"MIKE! MIKE! MIKE!...\" He started playing the air guitar and head banging in time to the beat. He was so into the dance he didn't realise a small, metal remote was slipping out of his pocket. As Drizzy Drex's song came to a halt, Mike jumped into the air and as he went up, a certain remote flew with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike heard it and knew it could only be one thing.

They both were quite well built young-ish men, one black and 6\"3\" with a small curly Afro and the other white and 6\"1\" with shoulder length ginger hair. They wore standard black suits with black ties with earpieces in their ears, surveying the crowd like hawks. In particular they were staring at 2 girls dancing with a squad of about 10 boys. One girl was African-American and was wearing large hoop earrings and subtle makeup that highlighted her fine cheekbones and deep hazel eyes. She wore bright red Nike shoes, a black Nike jumper with one shoulder off and ripped, faded jeans, exposing a large E cup bust and plump butt. Her friend, while maybe not as blessed in the bust department with D cup boobs, wore tight, form fitting leggings that accentuated a large bum, possibly larger than her partner. She was Caucasian with piercing blue eyes and a long, blonde mane. She wore a crop top and wiggled her breasts at the drooling boys in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn another part of the dance floor were a young teenage couple talking and dancing awkwardly. The boy's head kept craning around to see 6\"5\" mountain of a man that was his date's father. An obvious former Navy Seal, he had a grey buzzcut and muscles rippling everywhere and popping out of his camo t-shirt as he gave the boy a look that said 'try anything with my baby and I'll snap you in half'. Meanwhile, his date looked at his mother who was pointing at her stomach. She wasn't exceptionally tall which wasn't helped by the fact her stomach was bloated with a pregnancy and she had to bend slightly to accommodate the weight. She had her brown hair tied into a messy bun while she wore a dressing gown and no makeup. She was gesturing towards her pregnancy and mouthing 'this will be YOU if you mess around'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy a sheet of transparent glass, a 25 year old couple started making out, pushing each other onto the window pane;they both looked like death metal rockers(which was weird as this was a rap concert). The male was skinny with a large mop of wild,black hair and heavy black makeup with piercings in his tongue and eyebrow. He wore a shirt with the emblem of a death metal band and had both arms covered in screaming skulls, dragons and all kinds of stuff. He wore skinny black jeans, failing to conceal the large erection he had. The girl was basically dressed the same but with a tangled nest on her head. She had large black lipstick which nearly hid the lip piercing she had. She had about a dozen piercings in each ear, ending with two large skull earrings. She had a large nose piercing like a bull and heavy eye makeup to go with. She actually had quite large boobs and a tight butt, helped by a short skirt and black and white hooped leggings leading to worn out Doc Martens. Watching with disgust was a early 30s Asian mother walking with her daughter past the window. It was easy to tell the mother was quite beautiful in her younger days but giving birth and taking  care of a child had taken its toll; she had DD cup boobs that sagged a little in her conservative yellow polo shirt and had casual jeans and flats. Her daughter was about 5, wearing a pink Barbie dress and a little tiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- -- ---- - --- --- -- ---- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blinding blue flash and the guards who were guarding the door were no longer there; now dancing with the ten boys were 2 slightly different women. The fist was what seemed like an African-American women that stood at 6\"0 tall. They  had brown,frizzy hair tied into a bun on the back of their head. They still wore the large hoop earrings and makeup but now they wore a black jacket and a tie but with black jeans and black sneakers. Their companion now wore a short cropped shirt going over their belly button with a tie and a black suit jacket with short sleeves. They wore black leggings, displaying a large,well toned ass. They had shoulder length blonde hair that faded into a fiery orange as well as hypopnotic aquamarine eyes. A boy tried slapping the prior's bottom to which they responded with a punch to the gut and a manly-speaking feminine voice saying,\"I'm really not into that-next time, I'll break that hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, instead of a teenage couple and two adult chaperones, only two young adults remained. The girl still had her feminine face and features but had a more chiseler jawline,perched on the large,muscular body of her father. She now had short silver hair, looking like it was cut with scissors in the mirror. She had large pecs leading to a solid set of abs. A giant 7 inch snake bulged out of her trousers as she stood talking to her,also changed, boyfriend. He had lost about 2 inches to 5\"9 and his face had become more feminine,resembling his mother. He now had the brunette bun and dressing gown from his mother as well as the pregnancy she'd been carrying for 6 months. The Amazonian girlfriend went in for a tender hug and kiss as she wrapped her new grizzly arms around her boyfriend. \"Dani,baby, I know we're DEFINITELY gonna raise the perfect baby cause YOU'RE the most perfect father a child could ask for.\" He now blushed as his girlfriend stroked his milk-filled breast. \"Nik, you're so sweet.\" They pulled for another passionate kiss, Dani now standing on tiptoes to kiss his girlfriend who used to look up to HIM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the window stood a weird sight, a 28 year old woman being groped and kissed by her young,12 year old daughter. The daughter now made out with her mother, uncaring to the unruly mop of hair covering one of her eyes. She was now lankier, still wearing a Barbie shirt but now had Barbie in goth clothing sitting on a skull. The girl had the piercings from the man and even the sleeves of tattoos.The little girl even had an erect 8\" trouser snake. Her mother looked a LOT different. Adorned with the woman's clothes, tons of piercings and layers of black makeup, she looked almost unrecognisable. The girl pulled away for a second and looked at her mother. \"Mommy, what if dad finds out about...you know...US? I don't want to make him upset. It doesn't seem right( not that I'm complaining that it isn't nice)...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,baby girl, I've just got some needs your father can't give to me. So please, help out your mommy and give me what I so desperately NEED.\" The daughter agreed reluctantly, following her mother to the bathrooms in the back for some quick satisfaction...</span></div></div>",

He saw the girl trailing her mother and realized that girl had probably been forced to have sex with her mother for a long time. He also saw the boy he'd fused that was now pregnant and wondered if he was actually WILLING to have a baby. He tried de-fusing them but the remote did nothing. \"Stupid remote...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"Esme asked, peering at the remote.\"Oh....It's just a broken toy I'm fixing...for my sister...\" It was hard to lie when Esme's emerald eyes stared at you. \"Sure...whatever you say Mike.\" He breathed a sigh of relief as he thought she bought it. \"Are you okay Mike? You look sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...my...DOG! Yeah, my dog died, my family's not taking it too well, you know! Loved that dog...Well, gotta head home- so sorry about this - you know, my dog died...\" Mike rambled as Esmeralda just laughed at his awkwardness. \"Umm, if you want to call me my number's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already got it,\" she told him showing his phone to him. He couldn't help but smile as he pocketed his phone then frowned again. \"How'd you unlock my phone?\" She laughed and gave a knowing grin. \"Maybe I'll tell you how when I  call you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike waved goodbye and left the mall. Although he still felt guilty about the unintended fusions he made, it was overpowered by an overwhelming image of Esme in his mind, her mesmerising green eyes and her infectious, pure laugh.</span></div></div>",

Her hair was wavy and a little curly in nature whole her face had a soft warm smile accompanied by a few wrinkles, the show is something Mikes seen his mother watching on occasion called \"Warm Southern Cooking with Grace Maryheart\" or something like that. And warm it is going off the hosts short plump body from her wide hips stretching out her blue dresses waist line to caress and mold to the form of the sides of her chunky hips and ass cheeks to the adorable plump belly jutting out with her impressive bosom trying to escape from the tight confines of her bullet bra hidden under her blue dresses V shaped cleavage window. Her thighs leaving little in terms of a gap as she struts around the stage counter showing off the different cheeses shes about to cram into a casserole that looks like a tray of loaded potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, Mike selects her, \"Ooohooo shit this is gonna be good, how the hell is this thing gonna slam these realities together~?\" Mike chuckles and fired the control, making the T.V flash for a second before settling to reveal his creation. The backdrop being a mix of a kitchen with less of a rustic touch and more of a modern sleek look to it while the array of cheeses and and potato mash replaced with lean cuts of meat and desserts? But the main treat is the woman standing before the camera, donning a cute pink apron and her messy raven hair kept in a bun, her body had become a mix of the fit trainer and the pudgy motherly cook with the woman still being tall but softer, as in that lean muscle of the trainer was now covered with a pleasant padding of fat to give her a more cozy look with her ass having the plump chunky 45 inch measurement but some lift to it like the owner put in some work with the squats as those jeeks wobbled and jiggled around with her thighs while being hugged by a thin tight pair of yoga pants giving way to the flaccid 6 inch dick wresting up against her thigh beneath the things...her face was soft and a bit more lifted and youthful while having just some hints of wrinkling around the corner of her eyes while sporting that warm Maryheart smile...but what really got mikes attention was when the new Grace plopped her meaty ass on the counter making the large plump and unsupported H-cups wobble and struggle to stay contained in it's thin workout top along with the bit of paunchy chub resting on what used to be visible abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...s-she became a strong-chub trainer cook? Damn...and a bit of a slob from her hair I guess, but the rest of her looks freaking snuggly!\" Mike coos and wiggles his fingers in their air.</span></div></div>",

The change complete by giving Mike the dog's canine ears, Mike's nose and mouth had changed into a short snout which only half size of the original snout of the golden retrieval.

After a second, he opened his eyes to see Mocha was gone. He looked down to see a pair of breasts on his chest. \u201cWhat the?\u201d He felt his new breasts, realizing his hands were now feminine, and his fingernails were sharp, like claws. \u201cHow did fusing with Mocha turn me into a girl? Was it just because Mocha was female? You\u2019d think I would just be me with cat features or something. Maybe the fusion just took the cat features, and Mocha\u2019s female chromosomes, and combined them with my human physiology.\u201d Examining himself further, he noticed he had four extra nipples on his abdomen, but they weren\u2019t \u2018inflated\u2019 like his top pair were, despite still being almost as sensitive. Going further down, he found his new vagina, oddly within panties. Apparently, the remote changed reality so he wore panties since he was a girl, but they didn\u2019t have a very girly design thankfully. Touching his new vagina, while being careful not to poke himself with his sharp fingernails, he felt a sensation he never experienced before. Deciding to save that little exploration for later, he continued examining himself, or rather herself. The newly female Mike, noticed she also had a tail and her pants had a special hole for said tail. Looking into the mirror on the wall, she saw her hair was still dark brown, but appeared to be about half an inch longer, with a feminine style. Her eyes were the same color as before, but had slitted pupils. She also had whiskers on her nose, and sharp fangs in her mouth. Mike also saw she no longer had human ears, and instead had fat ears on top of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding her new body amusing, Mike did a feminine cat pose, with her hands clenched and hanging loosely like paws, and smiled wide, showing her fangs. \u201cI\u2019m a cat-girl, nya.\u201d Mike quickly covered her mouth. \u201cDid I just say nya?\u201d Mike then looked around her room, finally realizing it has also changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her bee hadn\u2019t changed, but there were now cat toys all over the room, replacing all of her usual stuff. Mike was even surprised to see a litter box in the corner of the room. As she looked over the room, her attention was drawn to a ball of yarn, and she practically leapt at the ball, and started passing it back and forth between her hands, playing with it like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichaela! Dinner!\u201d Mike\u2019s ears perked up, and she rushed out of the room. Arriving at the dining room, she found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Her food was on the table. She\u2019s still treated like a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Her food was in a bowl on the ground. She\u2019s treated like a pet.</span></div></div>",

As she ate, new memories floated into her mind. Despite being the second daughter of Grace and Philip Hunter, she was born with deformities that made her like a cat. Because of this, and her cat-like personality traits, she\u2019s treated like a pet, but still a member of the family. Since she\u2019s so cat-like, her parents were worried she\u2019d be bullied at school, so they decided not to enroll her in school. Instead, Megan teaches her everything she learns in school before going to bed. Thanks to this, Michaela is a bit smarter than Mike, having two more grades worth of knowledge being taught to her. And her cat-like intelligence help with that as well, since cats are actually rather intelligent creatures, but she tended to say things a typical cat-girl would say, such as nya, like she did earlier, or meow. Normally, she said nya at the end of her sentences, while she usually replaces the me syllable with meow.. Her reflexes are also much quicker too. Michaela still remembered being Mike, though.

So I wanted to be wearing some nice clothes when I show up. And you are my nicest clothes outside of formalwear.\u201d Megan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica Mills? As in the captain of the cheer squad, Jessica Mills? The hottest girl in school and Jon\u2019s older sister?\u201d Mike was surprised. Megan may be relatively popular, but she wasn\u2019t popular enough to hang out with someone like Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. Crazy right?\u201d Megan said. \u201cSo? Can I wear you tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Mike said a little too excitedly. He was basically being given a perfect excuse for going to a girls sleepover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. Have you seen my duffle bag? I need to pack some things for tonight.\u201d Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had an idea. If he could get the fusion remote to the sleepover, he could try it on the girls there. Maybe fuse some of them together, or with inanimate objects like he did to himself, or even fuse himself with one of them. He was curious as to whay would happen if he fused himself with someone while he was fused with some clothing. Especially if he fused himself with a girl, since he\u2019s fused with girl clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll pack everything you need. Why don\u2019t you take a shower before putting me on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, thanks. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d She started heading towards the bathroom. \u201cJust be in the bathroom by the time I\u2019m done.\u201d She started taking her shirt off as she walked out the door. Normally, she would never do this, because of Mike and their father being in the house. But since their father isn\u2019t home at the moment, and Mike is one of her outfits, there\u2019s no issue with it. Mainly because the only other people in the house are girls, and as one of her outfits, Mike gets to TOUCH her naked body, or rather be ON her body, so seeing her naked is no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be an awesome night.\u201d Mike said as he packed Megan\u2019s bag, making sure to hide the remote in the bottom of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished packing the bag, he headed to the bathroom. \u201cThat you Mike?\u201d Megan asked as she heard the bathroom door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. Be out in a bit. Just wait there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Mike sat on the toilet, but was surprised when his \u2018clothes body\u2019 collapsed onto the toilet in a pile. \u2018Well that was different.\u2019 He laid like that on the toilet, and waited until Megan turned off the shower and got out, drying herself off. Mike was greeted to the sight of Megan\u2019s naked body, before she walked over to him and picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you lay on the toilet? You usually lay on the counter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Just trying something different.\u201d Mike replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Let\u2019s just put you on, so we can get going.\u201d Megan pulled the panties part of your body, which you hadn\u2019t even noticed since it was underneath the skirt, up her legs. \u201cSo did you pack my bag like you said you would?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. All packed and ready to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. I need to get there soon.\u201d She said as she pulled the skirt of your body up her legs, then grabbed the long sleeved turtleneck, and putting it on as well. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty hard to believe. Jessica inviting me to her sleepover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I knew you were popular, but didn\u2019t think you were THAT popular.\u201d Mike agreed as Megan put the leggings on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, same. I never really even cared about popularity, but still. Being invited to a sleepover is always nice, so I couldn\u2019t just say no.\u201d She put on the high heeled boots. \u201cWell, we\u2019re all set. Let\u2019s get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing her bag, she walked out the door while wearing you, and got into her car, driving to Jessica\u2019s house. Once there, she knocked on the door, and Jessica opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you could make it, Meg. You\u2019re just in time.\u201d She ushered Megan inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I was looking forward to this.\u201d Megan said. \u201cIs Jon here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. He\u2019s staying at a friends house. It\u2019s just us girls tonight.\u201d Jessica smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. Just us girls.\u201d Megan smiled nervously. This exchange made Mike realize that no one seemed to know about Mike. As he thought about it, new memories flowed into his mind. Apparently, he was born as an outfit, confusing his parents, and especially the doctors. He was small enough to fit a 2 year old when he was born, and his boots didn\u2019t have high heels on them, he grew over time and so did his heels. The only reason his parents even knew he was male was because, despite being clothes for a girl, the doctors discovered he still had DNA, and had XY chromosomes. So they named him Mike. Also, his body was more gender neutral when he was born. It was basically just plain pull ups, toddler boots, socks, and a dress, but as he grew, his pull ups changed into panties, and his dress split in two, becoming a skirt and a shirt, before the shirt split into a shirt and a bra, and the shirt eventually changed into a turtleneck, and his boots slowly grew heels, and his socks became leggings. His family knew going to school would be difficult, since people could bully him for being clothes, and he could get ripped, so his parents decided he would only go to school when Megan would wear him, and the rest of the time, she would teach him what she learned in school. So they kept his existence a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was unsure how to feel about these new memories, but when he saw all the girls at the sleepover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: His thoughts changed to using the fusion remote on the girls to fuse them together or with objects, but he had to wait until Megan changed into her pajamas later, since he can\u2019t control his body while being worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: He realized he couldn\u2019t unfuse here, since he wouldn\u2019t be able to explain why he was there, and wasn\u2019t sure the remote would send him somewhere else once unfused, so he decided to fuse with one of the girls to try becoming human again while fitting in at the sleepover.</span></div></div>",

The most obvious choice would be Jessica.

He grabbed the fusion remote out of the bottom of the bag and sneaked into the room the girls were in.

He staggered forward as his vision swam, reaching out a hand for his bed post while another went to his forehead, brushing heavy strands of hair out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disorientation ended a few seconds later and Mike steadied him...herself. Everything had changed, gone was the average room of a teenage male, instead the room was a mix of purple, white and black and all the furniture had been re-arranged. Instead of his smaller twin bed next to her, now there was a huge queen sitting against the far wall, decked out in matching colors to the room's darker aesthetic. The walls were covered in album covers and similar rock posters and Mike spun around taking in the sight of it all until she faced the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gorgeous. Mike was clearly a knockout that was a few year younger than Lizzy Hale, and while there were similarities it was clear they were still two different people. Mike's hair was a rich auburn that hung down to her nearly bare, slender shoulders on one side of her head while the other was shaved to a fine buzz cut. Hooped earrings decorated her exposed ear and Mike slid a slender hand beneath her new hair and confirmed. Her face was heavy with mascara and eye liner, and ruby red lipstick caused her plump lips to stand out from her soft yet angular face. Mike's eyes were dark brown but flecked with gold and combined with the makeup made her eyes glitter mysteriously. Those eyes wanders down to the twin mountains that were protruding from her chest, mountains of soft flesh that were quite a bit larger than Lizzy Hale's and seemed close to bursting out of the black top that she was now wearing. Her midriff was toned and studded by a single rhinestone, and her hips were incredibly shapely and her huge ass strained against the tight, rugged blue jeans she now wore. The jeans seemed scuplted to her body, from her jaw dropping hips and rear to her legs that seemd to go on forever, ending in a pair of rather un-ladylike boots. With a cautious, almost terrified urging, Mike slipped a slender hand down into her pants and suddenly recoiled; She was 100% woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so crazy!\" Mike said to herself, and suddenly yelped at the sound of her voice. Beneath the higher, somewhat sultry voice she heard and felt power, a feeling that felt like it could erupt from her throat at any moment. A singer's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...wow!\" She breathed as her hands started to wander...When suddenly a sharp BING tore her attention away from experimentation and towards an expensive looking cellphone. Mike walked over, not noticing the natural grace in her steps and unencumbered by her new dimensions, picked up the cellphone and swiped the screen open. There, on the front of the screen was a long list of messages between her and someone named Clint, the most recent message reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hey Mikayla. You gonna get your ass down here to McFly's? If you want to be famous you actually have to show up for gigs, even if they are basements and bars. Get here or I'll start looking for some other walking pair of tits willing to do cover songs.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, or rather Mikayla, stood there for a moment, partially disgusted, partially in shock, and partially in panic over losing her big chance. It was clear that while she had fused with the picture of a genuine rock goddess, \"Mikayla\" wasn't there yet, just getting started in the small time venues. Shaking her head and sending her new hair cascading all around her, Mikayla decided to...</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t a brand new car, but it was a Chevy Camaro, so it looked pretty nice, and was red. She was about to get in the car, when another car pulled up. Like hers, it was a nice one, but not brand new. It was a yellow convertible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Babe! I why aren\u2019t you at your gig yet? Was it cancelled?\u201d Said the driver, some guy a year or two older than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikayla didn\u2019t recognize the guy, but since he called her babe, he guessed he was her boyfriend in this altered reality. She was slightly disgusted at the thought, but she also felt sexually attracted to him, making her crotch wet, so she walked over to his car with a smile. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just running a bit late. I was just about to head over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen hop in.

Just strap in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did so while turning away from him and blushing furiously. Despite her attraction towards him, the Mike part of her is disgusted and embarrassed that she just kissed a guy, but her female side was more dominant. Mikayla briefly thought it would probably be best to undo the fusion, but pushed it to the back of her mind for now.</span></div></div>",

Maybe he felt a little bit brittle, but the remote made him take multiple power naps in succession, so that didn\u2019t seem like something unusual. Mike realized that the prospect of the remote working could very well have been a dream, and that he should have savored it while it lasted instead of getting picky. He sat down on his bed, sulking in his lost fantasy, the remote in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, mike heard his father\u2019s car pull up the driveway and the front door squeal open, followed by familiar footsteps. \u201cHi I\u2019m home!\u201d said Mike\u2019s father from the other room. \u201cHi\u201d mike faintly responded. \u201cMike! Hey I\u2019m hungry!\u201d called his father. \u201cOkay?\u201d responded mike. \u201cQuit being difficult just come here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike curiously walked into the kitchen. <br>\r\n\u201cThank god I\u2019m so hungry\u201d said Mikes father.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Mike said begrudgingly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take anything, I\u2019m starving\u201d said mikes father, who looked like he could rip apart anybody and everybody to get a scrap of food. \u201cI\u2019ve barely eaten all day!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMake something then, anything,\u201d mike said, gesturing to the pantry, or where there was actually no pantry. Mike looked so confused as to where the pantry had gone. Then his eyes widened as he realized that he had fused with the pantry earlier. No sooner had he realized this than had he felt a rip in his arm.<br>\r\nMike looked to his outstretched arm to discover Phil Hunter ripping open his arm, and it felt funny, but not painful, kind of good actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDad, what-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were offering me food\u201d said his dad, who just took a few bites out of his peeled open arm.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I was pointing at the pantry so you could get some\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPantry? With you around we don\u2019t really need a pantry, are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo could you just stop eating me!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon you\u2019ll grow it back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... didn\u2019t tell you to eat me!\u201d Said mike, thinking of a defense that wouldn\u2019t get him found out for being from some separate function of the space time continuum. \u201cI\u2019m going back to my room now, get something from the fridge!\u201d He said, retracting his partially-nibbled-upon arm to reveal to him that he was a banana beneath his skin. Mike retracted to his room and locked the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on his bed more in eager than anger, he was excited to know that the device works. But, he was also interested in being food. He stared at his open arm, which had about six bites taken out of the inside. The banana was the same diameter as his arm, which is to say rather large. Reconnecting the four parts of peel his arm had he formed a fully human looking arm, as if nothing had changed, although he couldn\u2019t control it at all. And releasing the grip of his other hand made all of it recoil with the force of gravity. Curious, he took a bite. He tasted very good. He shivered a bit in excitement. He took another big bite, and swallowed another piece of himself. And more and more of his yellow fruity innards, until he had nearly reached his elbow. Now just his skin dangled off of it like an eaten banana held by the intact side of the peel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike figured that there was more than just bananas in the pantry when he merged with it, so looked around his body for more signs of food. Eventually, he found that tugging on some hairs on his head in a certain way opened his head up like a plastic chip bag. Reaching inside his noggin, Mike of course found some upsized chips. They were tortilla chips, and big ones too, just smaller than the palm of his hand. He bit off a piece with his teeth and decided it could use some salsa, and something told him it would be in his ear, so unscrewing his ear, Mike found a massive vault of salsa. He put down his jar cover of an ear on his desk, no longer able to hear out of it, and dipped his chip inside before eating it (which took a few bites). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike wanted to eat more of his body, but figured he should wait until his family had gone to bed so he could have access to kitchen utensils. He turned to lie down in his bed to take a nap, with his half eaten arm, dangly skin, misplaced ear, salsa hole, and wide open bag of chips that was his head. Waking up later, he found that his head felt like it did before he ripped it open, and that his right hand was fully formed again, and that his ear somehow came back to him. Worried again it was a dream, Mike looked around his bed for evidence. He found a few crumbs, salsa stains, and a large chunk of banana. That was good enough for him. He looked at the clock. 12:36. Lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike snuck to the kitchen, wanting to try a few things. Which did he try first?</span></div></div>",

What caught his eye about this was that it was so much bigger than any other bottle opener he\u2019d seen before. It must have been specially made for his body because it seemed to be the perfect size to snap his head clean off. The thing was massive. He hooked it around his head, so that it went under his chin and over his forehead, as some strange inclination told him to do. He managed to get enough leverage on the handle side somehow and popped his head clean off. Without much warning, mike was unable to see, hear, smell, or feel his head. With his hands, he traced his neck, which went higher than usual, and eventually turned into a glass cylinder with a rim on top. Beneath his head was a bottle of beer, although he couldn\u2019t drink any, because his mouth was MIA. He needed something to cover his bottleneck, so that he wouldn\u2019t spill until he grew a new head. Also he needed to find his head, so it wouldn\u2019t be suspiciously left in the kitchen. Mike luckily found, quite miraculously without his head, a giant cork to squeeze into his tipsy top. On his way out of the kitchen he nearly tripped over his head. Mike went to bed to regrow his head for the next day. Luckily, mike woke up late, after everyone in his family had left the house, to have a day alone to experiment. What was his first move?</span></div></div>",

His head had grown back! Mike went out into his kitchen again after waking up to experiment more with the walking pantry his family apparently took him for. Mike didn\u2019t want to do something involving taking off his head right away, so he could really savor the day instead of sitting around unable to sense the world as before. Starting small, Mike decided to just take a knife to... a piece of his leg or something. Something minor. Mike grabbed a butter knife from the kitchen drawer and pulled his underwear up high before grazing his thigh with the knife. Smooth butter accumulated on the surface of the knife as mike raised it to his face. Interesting. He was hungry for breakfast, but knew butter alone wouldn\u2019t suffice, so turned to the pantry for bread...only to remember that he was the pantry. Without hesitation mike grabbed a serrated bread knife from the knife dock. Mike laid his arm across a cutting board, which felt oddly familiar for something he\u2019d never done before. As if second nature, he sliced through his wrist and then once more about half an inch up his arm. Then again for good measure. His empty husk of a hand fell limp on the cutting board, and his two slices of arm bread were scooped up and placed into the toaster. Mike grabbed his detatched hand and stared into its bready insides, and then to his arm stump, also breaded at the end. Only on his insides, however, did mike seem to be bread. If viewed from away in which the bread part was unseen, his hand looked like a normal, albeit severed, hand. Ding! Mike\u2019s Mike toast was ready. He took what used to be his wrist out of the toaster and used his working hand to butter it. His bread stump arm was used to keep it steady. Somehow, mikes arm toast tasted better than usual, it was almost as if he could feel himself being eaten by himself in that faint moment. Mike was excited to keep trying out different things, but wanted more viability. He was thinking either he could invite someone over to play with him, maybe eat him. That might spice things up a bit. He had a feeling this might be a regular occurrence with his best friend Jon. Or perhaps he could utilize the power of the remote to make his experiments easier. He knew he had a two headed alien action figure in his room. If he could give himself a second head, he wouldn\u2019t be out of luck doing anything with his head.</span></div></div>",

He craned his neck up to see his shelf above him. He looked down to see a strange sight. Most drastically, at the bottom of his shirt, where his pants would have been just a minute ago, the wooden neck of his guitar extended many lengths of his upper body. At its bottom lay the main body of his guitar, and now of Mike himself too, sitting in his guitar stand.<br>\r\nMike unbuttoned his shirt to see where exactly his body changed from wood to flesh. To his surprise, instead of his two hands coming in to unbutton, six came. Mike looked in awe as he realized that his shoulders, all now-six of them, were replaced with small metal poles before becoming his arms. His arms were replacing the tuning knobs. To test it out, he twisted his top left arm backwards with ease. He did it without even touching his arm/tuner. He could tune himself as a basic motor skill.<br>\r\nUpon finally unbuttoning his shirt, Mike found that his abdominal region looked distinctly human, except that he now had three pairs of pecs atop each other, one per pair of arms. Furthermore, one of his strings coiled into each pectoral. <br>\r\nMike felt very good like this, high on the euphoria of excitement of changing his body. He noticed, however, that he was stuck not only in place, but in this form, because the remote was at his feet...err...base. It was too far away to reach and even as such it was huge compared to Mike\u2019s tiny upper body. <br>\r\nSuddenly, Mike heard the noise of the front door shutting. Someone had arrived home. Who?</span></div></div>",

He was skeptical, but he figured there was no harm in trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted two girls walking together on the other side of the street. He recognized one as a sophomore at his school, a year older than he was. He didn't know her name though. The other girl was a lot younger, probably around 8. He assumed that they were sisters. The did look a lot like each other. They were both blonde and pale skinned. The older girl had her hair down, while her little sister had hers in pigtails. The younger girl was wearing a cute pink dress while her older sister was wearing skinny jeans and a t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming the remote at the two, Mike decided they'd be a good pair to test it on. He selected the two as targets then hit the fuse button, unsure of what would happen. There was a blinding flash of light for a moment, completely obscuring Mike's vision. When he regained his sight, he was stunned. There was only one girl standing where there had been two. She looked about halfway in age between the two, appearing to be about 12. Her hair was down like the older girl's had been, but she was dressed like the younger girl. It was hilarious because the clothes were clearly meant for a little girl, but they were scaled up for the girl's 12 year old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike would have laughed at the sight, but he was still shocked that the device actually worked! After snapping out of it, Mike tried out the de-fuse button just to make sure it worked. There was another blinding flash, and then the two girls were back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another moment, a grin appeared on Mike's face. \"This is gonna be so much fun.\"</span></div></div>",

Spotting a little girl, maybe about 6 or 7 years old, playing in her yard, Mike selected her as the first target for a fusion. He looked around for a few moments before locating a goth girl from his school who was a grade above him. Thinking it would be an interesting combo, Mike selected her as the second target and hit the fuse button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same blinding light was emitted by the device, and suddenly the goth girl had disappeared. Looking back to the yard where the little girl had been playing, Mike was greeted by an interesting sight. The girl now looked a bit older, around 11, and her outfit was like a blend of what she had been wearing and what the goth girl had been wearing. She was still wearing a somewhat poofy little girl's dress, but it now had a black and gray pattern, and the top part of it now had that gothic corset style to it like the dress the goth girl had been wearing, emphasizing the budding breasts she now had. The dress was complimented by the high heeled goth style boots the goth girl had been wearing. She also had the long black hair, heavy black eye makeup, black nails, and deep maroon lipstick of the goth girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that's hilarious,\" Mike laughed to himself, continuing on his way and leaving the two girls fused together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit further down the street, Mike spotted a girl in his grade. Her name was Michaela and she was a typical scene girl. Mike had talked to her a couple times before, but they didn't have the same circle of friends. She was walking home from school with her older brother Brandon who was a senior and played for the school football and baseball teams. Curious as to what would happen, Mike tried fusing them together. After the blinding light had cleared up, the resulting person looked mostly like Michaela. There were a few key differences, however. Most notably, while still the same height she had been, she now had Brandon's muscles, which looked a bit bigger on her smaller frame. Her hair was still in the same choppy layered cut scene girls tended to have, but it was now Brandon's blonde color instead of her natural black. As for her clothes, this new girl was wearing Michaela's Converse trainers, skinny jeans, and makeup, but also Brandon's New England Patriots football jersey. As he got a bit closer, Mike also spotted a pretty big bulge in her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's interesting,\" Mike mumbled to himself. He was quite amazed by the power of the remote still.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Continuing down the street, Mike decided to keep fusing people. However, he decided to try mixing things up and fuse them with objects instead of other people. As a middle schooler rode past on a skateboard, decked out in typical skater garb, Mike selected him as the first target for the fusion. He then selected an advertisement on the side of a building as the second. The ad featured an attractive female model holding up the product it was trying to sell. Hitting the fuse button, Mike was greeted by the now-familiar flash of white light. When his vision cleared, Mike noticed that the ad was still on the wall, but no longer featured the model. The 14 year old boy on the skateboard, however, now had the body of the model, although he still had the clothes he had been wearing. Mike laughed as he watched what looked like a hot 23 year old woman ride away on a skateboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was still in the downtown area between his school and his neighborhood, there were lots of different shops and stuff that he could use to fuse people. Walking past a hairdresser, Mike selected a picture showing off a women's hairstyle as the first target of a fusion. He just needed to find a person to use as a second target. Spotting a mother walking with her 8 year old son, Mike selected the boy as the second target. The flash of light happened again, and suddenly the boy now had a cute layered women's hairstyle. Not wanting to leave the mother unfused, Mike selected another picture, this time one featuring a stylish men's hairstyle, and fused her with it. After another flash, the 37 year old woman's shoulder length hair had been replaced with the male hairstyle that had been in the the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too good,\" Mike laughed, amused by this latest batch of fusions.</span></div></div>",

Near the crosswalk stood a woman who looked to be in her mid-30s with two kids who looked to both be around 6. Mike assumed that they were her kids, because they were both tugging on her slacks shouting \"Mommy, mommy!\" while she waited to cross the street. The kids, a boy and a girl, were both begging for different things. \"I want to go the movies!\" exclaimed the boy. \"No, we should go shopping!\" shouted the girl. The mother wasn't responding, and she looked tired, drained, and simply miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike felt bad for her, and decided to make her kids more bearable. After a flash of light, one kid stood next to the mother. They had the boy's darker blonde hair, but it was almost as long as the girl's. They wore a purple shirt and skirt, a combination of the boy's red shirt and jeans and the girl's blue dress. The two kids had similar features to begin with, so the fused kid looked like they could've been their sibling. Mike supposed that the new kid had both genders, but they looked decidedly feminine in the skirt. Besides, most kids looked similar at that age, regardless of gender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fusion, the situation hadn't improved that much. \"Mommy, I want to go shopping and then go the movies? Can we? Can we please?\" The mother still looked tired, so it appeared that this kid was just as needy as the two had been. \"Hmm...what to do?\" Mike muttered. Then a wry smile appeared on his face as he selected the kid and the mother. The light flashed once more, and Mike snickered at his handiwork. The woman looked to be about eighteen, and wore a pink blouse (the mother was originally wearing a white one), a purple skirt, and black tights. She looked like a more youthful version of the mother, and Mike wasn't entirely sure what her gender was, although she looked female. She appeared to have a lot of energy, fidgeting her hands and bouncing on her toes while she waited for the light to turn green. When it did, she skipped through the crosswalk toward Mike. 'Interesting,' Mike thought. 'Even though she's still technically an adult, she's really childish.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got across, Mike smiled and said, \"You look happy!\" She returned the smile and said, \"I am! I'm going shopping and then going to the movies!\" Mike gave the thumbs up, and she giggled at started walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Mike do?</span></div></div>",

Spotting a brunette girl of about 10 years of age in the yard of a nearby house, Mike selected her and fused her with the teen boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the flash of light, Mike was laughing once more. The resulting person from the fusion was still clearly a teen boy, but his body was devoid of any body hair. He did have the long braided hair the girl had had, but it was a dirty blonde shade. He was also wearing a scaled up version of the outfit she had been wearing, a sleeveless white top with a lacy trim that looked silly with his broad shoulders, and a pair of tight pink shorts, now with the bulge of his penis quite apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is never gonna get old,\" Mike said to himself, chuckling as he continued on his way down the street.</span></div></div>",

The ringleader was about 6\"3\" and built like a mountain, similar to the other two. He was white while the other two were black and Latino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you,pervs!,\" one of the girls screamed back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I would do with that ass..!\" one of them chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike chuckled as the familiar flash of light engulfed both parties.Now the girls were gone and at the construction site stood 3 bombshells. The white man now had luscious blonde hair, concealing large hoop earrings,and sky blue eyes.His face was now very feminine with makeup and large red lipstick. The black man had gotten lighter skin with deep brown eyes and a cute pert nose while the Latino man had hypnotic green eyes and flowing raven hair. They all wore similar makeup and earrings as they were part of a bridal party that was on a hen do. They had all shrunk slightly from stocky 6\"3\" builds to lean but muscly 5\"10\" bodies. The largest changes were that the white girl had large E cup breasts that weren't surgically enhanced.The Latino girl had slightly smaller C cup breasts but had a very large rotund behind that barely fit in the sexy black and yellow overalls she was wearing( a result of her black dress fusing with the man's clothes). The most bizarre was that the mixed race girl, while having D cup breasts and a quite large butt, was now packing heat with a 7\" schlong creating a large bulge in her overalls. It grew even more as another group of women left the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a load of those hoes!,\" the white woman spoke with a soft feminine voice.\"I'm getting wet just lookin' at 'em!,\" the Latino squaled as she started hollering at the women! \"I'm getting SO hard...\" the light skin women mused, stroking her now 10\" cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha,ha! Guess the personalities didn't change!\" Mike laughed.</span></div></div>",

They had three little children, two loud boys with short hair dressed in shirts and jeans, playing with toy robots, and one shy girl dressed in cute dress and having pigtails, playing with toy ponies, but also glancing at toy robots with a clear desire to play with that as well. There were also two older siblings. One is a bratty girl with beautiful long hair, and other is a sports-loving boy with a flat top, they were arguing over the idea that either of them must be a top priority for their parents. As for parents, father is a rather tired businessman with some baldness, obviously overworked to keep his family, while mother clearly loves to spend his husband's budget, dressed all formally, having wonderful updo hairstyle and having pretty athletic figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this family is kinda too big... let's help them out\" Mike thinks for himself and presses the remote, fusing younger kids into one, older kids into one and parents into one, creating one-parent and two-kid family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo little boys and one little girl got merged into one boy of same age, but in more sparkly clothes. His hair is middle-length, but boyish, and his toy is still a robot, but more sparkly.

The concrete depressions is filled with teenagers, skateboards and the faint smell of mountain dew. There were screams and joy. And the amazement when one of them does a flip.

Underneath the shade, benches dotted the place. It is either home to the children's mothers or tired skaters. Other than that, student's from the local summer school rests on the ground. Oddly, their numbers are at large today. One closer look and Mike saw the reason why. A stage is being built in the largest clearing. From the banners it says, \"Summer Love Fest\" and it's starting today and will last until three days later.</span></div></div>",

His entire lower jaw had merged into the slide, and his incisors lined either side. Like his tongue, they were now made of plastic, but he could still feel them. He winced as a kid started walking up his teeth. The kid crawled into Mike's upper jaw, which had morphed into an archway leading to the jungle gym. Mike turned his eyes as far as he could to look at the rest of his body. His arms had become support beams, and his hands were splayed on the ground. His rib cage had been converted into the jungle gym, and he was shocked to see that each of the swings had a nipple on the seat! Mike moaned as two kids sat on the swings, sending a jolt of pleasure throughout his body. Finally, he saw his legs squatting at the opposite end, with a staircase leading to his spine resting atop them. His body was painted in blue, red, and yellow, and the whole thing was made of plastic and metal (his nipple-swings had some sort of cushion in them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so friggin' weird,\" Mike thought, as the conflicting sensations of pain and pleasure flowed through his body. A kid ran up to one of Mike's eyes, and started to slap it, giggling as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike tried to say \"Hey, knock it off!\" but what came out of his altered mouth was \"Hue, nawna-law!\" The kid laughed even harder and continued beating Mike. Mike sighed, and shifted his gaze to his left arm. He saw the remote sitting on the ground, about two feet from his hand. To his relief, he could still move his arms, albeit slowly. Mike gradually moved his hand toward the remote, shifting the wood chips as he did so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was a strange feeling; because he now lacked a head, Mike was now able to move his line of sight a full 360. degrees all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was due to this new omni-directional sight that Mike discovered exactly what he had ended up fusing with: a jacket, belonging to one of the young kids on the playground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, Mike was relieved that he didn't end up as some weird jacket-human hybrid; but on the other, he was still a little freaked out at being, essentially, a normal jacket. A child jacket, at that. It was even more obvious to Mike when he studied his current 'body' closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jacket looked to be the right size for a 7-year-old. It was dark purple with a hood and with characters from the 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' tv-series on it. It was currently draped across the back of a chair beside the playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished examining his 'body', Mike noticed something odd. Although he currently didn't have a 'head' per se, his line of sight was placed in such a way that it was just over the neck-piece of the jacket; as if he was looking out of the eyes of the child wearing the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Mike became aware that he could still feel his torso, in a certain way. Both his chest and his arms felt hollow and yet solid; almost as if his body had become the jacket and yet was wearing it at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis odd feeling made Mike wonder; since he could still feel his arms in this way, was it possible for him to still move, in spite of being fused with an inanimate jacket?</span></div></div>",

And as interesting as it was to be fused with a child's jacket, he didn't want to be stuck as one forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery slowly, he tried to move his right 'arm'. To his great relief, he saw the right sleeve of his current jacket 'body' move like it was his actual arm; which it technically was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went on to moving his left 'arm', he began to think about how strange his current situation was; being able to move the sleeves of the jacket he was fused with as though they were his human arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis discovery led him to realize something else; even though he didn't have hands anymore, he could still feel them in a strange way. It was just like with his non-existing head; they technically weren't there, but he could still use them. And it wasn't just his head and hands that felt this way; he could still feel his legs, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, with his jacket 'body' hanging over the back of the chair, it felt like he was down on his knees, if he had had them. The odd part was that, if he had had his legs at the moment, they would have gone through the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Mike to realize something else; because he had fused himself (a living human being) with a jacket (a lifeless piece of clothing), it would be logical that the fusion left him with the necessary attributes required of both, so that he could still function in either capacity. Ergo; even though he could simply function as a plain, ordinary jacket, he was still capable of acting like a normal human being. A human being whose body was mostly both invisible and intangible, apart from the parts that had become the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Mike had a leg to stand on (so to speak), he decided to try to 'stand up'. Somewhat apprehensive, he 'moved' his intangible/incorporeal 'legs' so that it felt like he was touching the ground with his nonexisting feet instead of his knees. Nervously wondering if this would even work, Mike pushed downwards with his 'legs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his great surprise and shock, not only did he manage to achieve a feeling of 'standing up', but his current 'body' (i.e. the jacket) had followed suit; detaching from the back of the chair to float above it, roughly where Mike's torso would have been in comparison to his 'legs'.<br>\r\nWhat was even more shocking was that he could still feel himself standing on the ground, even though his non-existing 'legs' were technically going though the seat of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is completely bonkers,' thought Mike. 'I've basically become a living, floating kid-sized jacket!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he examined his jacket 'body' a bit more, Mike suddenly became aware of something heavy on one side of his 'body'. It was the remote, now tugged inside an inner pocket in the jacket that Mike had fused with. It was a great relief for him; now he would be able to go back to normal if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to examine himself, Mike also wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Compensating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more beams shot out from the handheld device, headed for the children of the mother while two larger beams struck Danny and the woman. In a flash of light that almost blinded Mike behind his closed eyelids, there was a soft beep, and the teenager opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Danny had been standing was now a twenty-four year old gorgeous Latina dressed in slightly revealing clothes. Toddling next to her, holding the Latina's hand, was a very young girl that looked remarkably similar to her. The newly minted woman and what Mike had to guess was her child walked beside Diego, who apparently did not notice that his brother had just become a much older and pretty hot college aged co-ed and what had to be her little sister appearing from nowhere beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike crept up a little closer to hear what Diego was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Danielle, you should convince mom to let me come to your work. I'm really interested in seeing where my aunt works at!\" Diego was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle snorted, \"Diego, you may be my favorite nephew but there is no way in Hell that I'll ever convince my sister to let you come to a strip club. After all, I need you to help her watch Laura tonight while I'm at work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike glanced down at the remote. This was so cool, but he did feel a little bad. Maybe it was because he had known Danny? All the other people he had messed with, it didn't bother him because they were all just anonymous random passerby...But with Danny he truly felt the weight of his choices. He'd turned a thirteen year old boy into a twenty-four year old stripper, who was apparently a mom! And the two kids that had been involved on accident...now they were a toddler!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the upside, Mike thought as he listened to the new Danielle list off things that she expected to be done for her child this evening, she did seem more mature...And Diego wasn't annoyed anymore. Should he really fix it?</span></div></div>",

The beeping sound from the remote had silenced itself and the alert on the screen had been replaced by a message saying, \"LOCAL FUSION COMPLETED!\" She quickly made a mental inventory: frizzy black hair- check; breasts- check; painted fingernails- check; clothes- check. She felt an itch in her crotch and scratched it casually, manoeuvring her dainty fingers in and around her growing testicles. 'Penis and balls accounted for,' Micaela thought to herself. 'Have to trim this pubic hair though- it's getting PRETTY hairy down there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to have been no surprise changes made to her body physically but Micaela couldn't be sure. On the one hand she was happy that nothing happened but on the other she wondered why the message on the screen had popped up for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was still pondering this someone crept behind her and squeezed tight, lifting her up in a grip as strong as a boa constrictor and planting wet kisses that squelched on her cheek. \"MOM!\" Micaela squealed as she tried to escape her mother. Danielle Martinez was relentless though and held on stating, \"Oh, so I'm not only allowed to show my adorable baby how much I love her?\" Micaela somehow squirmed out of the vice-like grip and gasped as she sucked air into her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you love me Mom, but you don't have to try and KILL me to show it!\" Danielle placed her hands on her wide hips and looked at her daughter playfully. \"I'll try to keep that in mind for next time. Anyway, I've got to head off to work now; your cousin Diego's looking after you tonight so behave yourself please. Love you Laura.\" She planted one more kiss on Micaela's cheek that left a big red shape on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer Mic... Nevermind, love you Mama, have fun.\" Danielle smiled and turned to leave, strutting her fat booty as she did so. If Micaela could remember that she was actually a combination of some random woman and the formerly annoying Danny Martinez, she probably would have fallen to the floor laughing. Instead she sighed deeply as she dreaded the inescapable boredom that would come from the evening with her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I've got the remote,\" Micaela thought to herself, smiling mischievously as she imagined the mischief she could do.</span></div></div>",

She had to admit that she would have gotten a bit hard had it not been her own mother, however, she still found it hilarious that Diego had the hots for his own aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Diego,\" Micaela quipped sarcastically as she snapped her fingers to break him from his lustful trance. As Diego turned to see his smirking cousin looking up towards him, realising he'd been caught staring. \"Come on squirt, I promised your Mom I'd look after you.\" He grabbed Micaela's wrist with a little too much force, a small payback for laughing at him, while dragging her away with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! You're hurting me, DUDE!\" She clawed at Diego's arm but his gargantuan arms were wrapped round Micaela's like a vice. Somehow instinctively, she pulled the device out of her pocket, hoping to use it to weaken him and get him off. At this exact moment, a prissy 14 year old girl walked down the street opposite while texting on her phone. She stopped momentarily, cussing out a homeless dude for sleeping in the middle of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy pure chance, Micaela pressed a button twice, capturing both Diego and the girl in the ray and they were engulfed by a white light. Feeling a softer and smaller hand gripping her wrist, Micaela pushed off, accidentally sending the owner tumbling onto the floor. \"OW! Like, OMG, Micaela, you are SO dead!\" She just about heard the shrill, squeaking voice scream before she ran. Spotting a bus pulling up, Micaela hopped on quickly and parked herself on an empty row by the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... That was a close one...\" She silently congratulated herself on her quick thinking before her train of thought was interrupted by a sudden banging on the window. Outside was a girl of no more than 15 who looked TICKED OFF to say the least. They were wearing a casual Nike T-shirt with a worn out denim jacket on top with red Nike leggings and kicks. She had chestnut skinned, not black but just tanned, with grey eyes and brunette hair done into in an immaculate bun. Micaela realised this must be the result of the fusion between Diego and someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cracked up as the now 5'4\" Diego tried to look intimidating as he mouthed, '...you're SO dead...\" Micaela laughed hysterically as she waved goodbye to her cow of a cousin. \"Now, that's over- what do I do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Coincidentally, the bus she was sitting on started to fill up with people coming back from their jobs. Micaela shuffled across in her seat as a large, heavyset man wearing a suit and tie parked his large frame next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gagged as the revolting stench of the man\u2019s body odour invaded her nostrils. She pulled out the device from her pocket, making sure she avoided the man\u2019s sweaty rear end. She randomly pressed a button and breathed a sigh of relief as she started to breath again. She looked over at the man and giggled as he was now literally a man baby. He wore only a diaper now as his adult body sucked on a pudgy finger. A tear ran into his immaculate goatee as he had looked around, calling for his Mommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to bawl, a tired, young woman who couldn\u2019t have been more than 23 trudged up to the man child. She had plain clothes covered in puke and what Micaela hoped was old chocolate, little dark ringlets circled her eyes that showed her obvious lack of sleep. \u201cCome on, Vinnie, quiet down.\u201d She heaved the man up with an unsurprising degree of difficulty, cradling him in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw, poor lady,</i> Micaela thought, <i>She\u2019s so tired, she can\u2019t even take care of herself. Don\u2019t worry- I\u2019m here!</i> Micaela locked onto the mother with one beam looking round and spotting a goth chick sitting melancholically on the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Perfection!\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe zapped a second beam and now the goth chick stood cradling the giant baby in her arms. Although the mother still had her face and body, her wardrobe had been altered drastically, a bright blue Mohawk running across the top of her head like a snake ready to pounce. She traded her dirty blouse for a black tee and a leather jacket, her trousers going skintight and black with large holes in them. Piercings were scattered all over her body, filling every hole and surface available. She now had a long drain tattoo running down her left arm, the same arm she used to stroke her baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheer up, Vin.\u201d She now spoke in a very drab voice and Micaela couldn\u2019t tell if that was from exhaustion or the goth nature she\u2019d acquired. \u201cAre you hungry? Come on, open wide.\u201d The woman pulled open her jacket and lifted her shirt, exposing two puffy nipples with big bullrings inserted inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man eagerly latched on, finding more sexual pleasure than nutritional as his penis started to rise out of his diaper. He began to fondle his mother\u2019s breast, both of them becoming aroused. \u201cStop Vinnie, you\u2019re making a scene!\u201d She fireman carried her child out of the bus, her face getting redder and redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Micaela said as she rubbed her growing erection. She looked around the bus, scouting for potential victims.</span></div></div>",

Micaela points the remote at the girl and the guy and pressed the button and the flash of light swallowed them. As the light disappeared, both of them were gone and there stood in their place was a fit 15 year old looking girl wearing a tank top.<br>\r\n\u201cTory, how many times do i have to tell you. You\u2019re a girl and you can\u2019t have a relationship with a girl!\u201d the mother thinks that the newly formed girl was her daughter.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, mom. Like I\u2019m already 17. I\u2019m almost 18. You tell me what to do. I like Claire and I want doing it with her.

As the light gone away the bimbo disappeared and pulling on Tory\u2019s hand was the thick slut version of her mother wearing a more revealing version of her mother\u2019s clothes. <br>\r\n\u201cTory I like, told you already. I don\u2019t want doing it here. I like, want to lick and kiss you and have sex with you where people can see us\u201d her new mother complained<br>\r\n\u201cChloe, i want to do it too, privately but we\u2019re not here for that!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo! no no no no no!!! I want everyone to like,  see us doing \u2018IT\u2019 so your daddy will get like, super jealous .\u201d the slutty mother protested as she made a tantrum making her huge assets bounce attracting not only gaining everyone\u2019s attention but also the men\u2019s lustful gazes<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, mom! its our secret that dad shouldn\u2019t know about. Why would you want him to know!? \u201d <br>\r\n Squirming as if she was embarrassed to tell her daughter(?). The mother shyly said, \u201cthat\u2019s because I like, want him to know that your better at pleasuring than him.\u201d*giggles*<br>\r\nEmbarrassed by what her slutty mom said, Tory pulled her mother along with noticeable tent on her crouch and got off the bus.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he had stopped to think, the Martinez brothers continued to walk ahead, making the distance between them and Mike grow. \"I need to think of something fast before they get too far away.\" He did not want to keep following them, in case they turned to see him. Explaining why he was following them would be awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another quick look around, he decided against the young children and their mother for several reasons. The kids were far too young, and he figured that the merge would only make Danny more annoying to his older brother. The mother, on the other hand, might make Danny too old, and Mike was not sure what would happen if he merged a female with a male. It might create some hybrid gender that he did not want Danny, or his family, to have to deal with. Mike shuddered at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... and the business guy should probably be out too. Danny would be too old as well.\" Mike said to himself and he took a few more steps to keep the Martinez brothers in sight. To his initial relief, they were now waiting at the bus stop, but that brief reprieve quickly vanished when Mike noticed that the city bus was nearing. \"What?!\" He exclaimed out loud. \"They never run on time!\" It was just his luck that this driver would be punctual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike bit his lower lip, needing to make a decision quickly. \"Nerdy high school student it is...\" He said aloud after a few moments. While escaping from his family would be nice, Mike figured that it would be best to use the student who was just a year older than Diego. Mike recognized the graduating senior as Arthur Blanc, president of the comic and video game clubs. Arthur was a straight A student who did not have the best home life; so in a way, Mike told himself that the merge would help the senior out as well. He turned back to where he had passed Arthur, but the student was no longer in sight. \"Where did he go?\" In the distance, he could hear the squealing of the bus breaks. Mike was running out of time. He cursed under his breathe for the trouble he was having when he was just trying to help out a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked down at his hands. \u201cI could still fuse myself with Danny\u2026\u201d He said to himself. A thought then occurred to him, which brought a smile to his face. Mike told himself that he could spend more time with Marisa. While he would technically be her brother during the merge, he reasoned that he could learn more about her and her family. The end goal would be to ask her out, after ending the merge with Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could move forward with that plan, he spotted Arthur walking towards the bus stop, where the Martinez brothers were just about to board. \u201cShould I play it safe and just merge Arthur with Danny, or should I merge myself?\u201d Without a second thought, Mike made his final decision.</span></div></div>",

The window was slightly tinted, but he could still recognize their forms. He made himself take a deep breathe before pressing the merge button. Instantly, a flash of light engulfed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next moment, Mike found himself seated on a hard plastic chair. An empty row was in front of him, and a center aisle was beside him on the right. He was now on the bus, having been fused with Danny. Though, he did take note a few weird happenings. A small child, no more than four years old, stared at him, mouth agape. The child probably would have continued to stare if her mother had not scolded her. Of course, the small girl was not the only one to stare. The adults on the bus tried to hide their gawking through sideways glances. They would also quickly avert their gaze if they noticed Mike look at them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bus finally started to pull away from the curb, the other passengers seemed to become distracted by other things. But Mike wondered why they were staring at him. He looked down at his lap, and counted a normal amount of legs, arms, and fingers. Though his skin was notably darker, more like Danny\u2019s original light brown complexion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, Mike became aware of an odd sensation, or rather, lack of sensation. His left hand rested by his left knee, but he could not feel either limb. It was like they were missing, even though he could clearly see them. Mike suddenly realized with panic that he could not feel the entire left half of his body. It was like that side of him was paralyzed. Though curiously, he could see his left foot tapping on the bus floor, as if it had a mind of its own. Every now and again, his left knee would bump into his right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind began to wonder. \u2018Did Danny have some weird condition? Could he only feel half of his body?\u2019 Mike asked himself in his head. \u2018But then why is it moving on its own?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Mike registered movement in his peripheral vision, to his left. He slowly turned. Directly beside him was Danny. The other boy was looking a something off to the side, and so Mike could only see half of his face. It was clearly Danny, though older now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brain was slow to register just how abnormally close he and Danny were. When it clicked, the stares from passengers and lack of sensation suddenly made sense. Something had interfered with the remote, as he and Danny were not completely fused together. Mike figured they resembled something like a two-headed boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny seemed to sense Mike\u2019s unease and turned to face him. There was just enough space between them for Mike and Danny to look at each other in the eyes. Danny had a small smile on his face, and surprisingly, Mike felt somewhat reassured. He wondered if it was some \u2018twin thing\u2019 between them. Danny then commented, \u201cYou okay Mikey?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He felt his ear merged with Danny's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople continued to stare the same way people stare at a burning building or a car crash without offering to help. Diego still hadn't noticed what was happening right beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's mind made contact with Danny's mind. Mike could tell that Danny was happy about what was happening. Danny's thoughts were still the thoughts of a thirteen year old but he understood that he and Mike were merging and he was eager to let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike though was beginning to worry. He hadn't realized that he'd be merging minds with Danny. He had a vague notion that his mind and Danny's mind would share the same brain but he thought they would still be separate minds. This merger was more complete than he expected but unless the remote completely restored itself to normal, there was nothing Mike could do to prevent himself from merging completely with Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened slowly. Mike was very aware as his and Danny's minds slowly became one. Mike started learning all of Danny's memories, how Danny didn't have many friends his own age. Danny had friends at school but none of those friends lived nearby. So Danny didn't have anyone to play with except his big brother but Diego had plenty of friends his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike also learned that Danny was already mature for his age. He wasn't as mature as Diego but for a thirteen year old, Danny already understood things about work, money, and girls that a typical thirteen year old did not understand. Danny had been doing as many odd jobs as he could to earn money and he saved some of his money. He didn't just spend it all like most thirteen year olds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike started to see life through Danny's eyes. Danny wasn't trying to be a pest. Danny just felt frustrated because he was alone. Each of his family members was always off doing their own thing and ignoring Danny. Fernando, Danny's dad, was often away as his work crew worked at various sites around the state. Danny didn't have anyone to teach him how to shave or do other things men did. Fortunately, Danny still only had a little peach fuzz on his lips and didn't need to shave yet but he was at the age when he soon would need to start shaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus finally stopped at Brown Street and Manny jumped off. Diego finally noticed that his brother was acting weird, suddenly getting up and jumping off the bus. Everyone else had stopped staring since Manny only had one head, not two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny ran back to see where he left part of his body. There was nothing left. He looked at the remote and it was completely restored. He realized that he had completely merged with himself. He wasn't leaving anything behind anymore. All of Mike was now merged with all of Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he also noticed that he was completely aware of having been two separate people until a moment ago. He had three sets of memories now: Mike's, Danny's, and Manny's. Manny's memories were a strange merger of Mike's and Danny's former lives. Diego was Manny's half brother as Roberta Martinez had an affair with Phil Hunter during a rough time in Roberta's marriage. Manny was now fourteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny remembered how Danny had been eager to merge and how Mike had chosen to merge even though Mike wasn't as eager as Danny had been. Manny wondered if he should just stay merged for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego came running up shouting, \"What was that all about? Why'd you jump off the bus?\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't know how to explain the situation to Diego. He was still adjusting to the merger and all this mental activity gave him a headache. Then Mike felt his mind separate from Danny's. They still shared a body but they were no longer Manny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike tried to use the remote to defuse them but Danny refused.

It was an odd way to communicate, as if they pushed thoughts back and forth to each other. \"It is kind of hard to give you space when we don't have any.\" Danny pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image of Danny smirking appeared within his thoughts. They had also quickly learned that they could send more than just messages back and forth. \"You could be quiet for a moment.\" Mike said back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir joint body was seated upon a bed in a sterile room of the hospital, alone. The room was sparsely decorated with posters indicating how to live a healthier life style. Danny's brother and parents were outside speaking with the doctor. Both were thankful for that, as the could not control the spasms that jolted their body as they warred for control. They were plagued with a migraine, which only intensified the more the two warred for control. Fighting each other was taking it tole. Finally, Danny relented, \"Fine... lets unmerge.\" Mike smiled, passing his sense relief, and their headache almost entirely disappeared. They took the remote from their pocket and held it in both hands. It appeared to be back to normal, and displayed their individuals names on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they pressed the unmerge button, and a flash of light seemed to engulf them and the room. Mike found himself seated, just to the right of where he and Danny had been. He looked down, and was glad to see his own body before him. It had worked, he was separated from Danny. He then felt a sudden tug, as the remote was nearly pulled from his right hand. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was seated beside him, with a firm hand on the remote. \"You've had a second to think. Now, lets try merging back together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you kidding?\" Mike gawked at the younger boy for a moment, before easily prying Danny's hand from the remote. He held by his side, opposite of Danny. \"We just separated from... whatever the hell we had become. I'm not too keen on returning to being Manny Martinez.\" Mike was surprised that Danny even remembered the events of the merge, but figured that thanks to sharing a brain, Danny now knew as much as he did. After all, he had seen into Danny's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither, and I don't really want to have to share a brain with you either.\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment took Mike by surprise. \"You don't? Then why do you want to merge again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to merge completely; I just thought that was our only way out of being stuck in the same mind. I figured that Manny would separate us eventually.\" Danny explained. He hesitated for a moment before continuing, \"What I really want is to try that half merge again... where we were sharing a body but had our own heads.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike remembered back to when he first appeared on the bus. He and Danny were essentially a two-headed boy. It was not for very long, but the remote seemed to have glitched for those first few minutes which caused him and Danny to share a partially merged body. \"Why do you want that merge?\" Mike asked, even though he was unsure if they could even recreate that event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to explain it.\" Danny looked down at his feet. \"I guess I just don't want to be lonely any more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike also looked down at his feet, having unique insight into Danny's thoughts. While sharing a brain with the younger boy, he had felt how alone Danny had felt in his family. Somedays were difficulty for him to even summon the energy to get out of bed. \"Okay... lets see if we can make that happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Danny looked up, taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not making any promises that it will even work, but I am willing to try this with you.\" Mike raised his pinky finger between them. \"You just have to pinky swear that you will not fight me when I want to undo it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinky swear... Really?\" Danny tilted his head questioningly. \"That for little kids. I'm thirteen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pinky swearing is a big deal with me. You should know... you've seen at least some of my memories too.\" Mike stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny nodded in agreement and wrapped his piny around Mike's. \"Fine. I pinky swear to help you undo it when you want to.\" They held it for a moment, before releasing their pinkies. \"Thanks for trying this out for me.\" Danny smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem little man. Its not like I'm giving up half of my body to be attached to a thirteen year old or anything.\" Mike smiled at Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be attached to a thirteen year old, because we'll be fourteen.\" Danny smirked. \"I'll be one year wiser and maturer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike laughed, \"Sure...\" He then composed himself. He then brought move the remote closer so Danny could also see it. \"I'm not exactly sure how to make that merge work though. There are only three buttons, and last time, I think it only happened by accident because of the distance between us maybe.\" Mike shrugged his shoulders. \"I don't think pushing the button halfway would do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if both the defuse and merge buttons were pushed at the same time?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shrugged his shoulders again. \"I mean... its worth a try.\" He held the remote so Danny could grab onto it as well. \"On three... I'll push the fuse, you push the defuse, and we'll see what happens.\" Mike counted up, and on three, both buttons were pushed simultaneously. </span></div></div>",

Within the room, two bodies became one, then became, and then became one again. Mike, Danny, and the third composite conscience of Manny were disoriented as each appeared and disappeared from existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were unable to hold onto the remote, and it fell from their hands. But just before it fell, the remote released a final flash of light, Danny and Mike reappeared. They watched in shock as the remote vanished within the hospital bed. They lost sight as it slipped between the frame and mattress, disappearing somewhere inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Remote!\" Mike and Danny both exclaimed as they jumped from the bed and collapsed onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike groaned, \"What happened?\" He looked up at the bright light of the hospital room; his eyes had not adjusted from the blinding strobe light of the remote. He rubbed away the spots in his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tackled me to the ground. That's what happened.\" Danny complained from beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.\" Mike ended the argument, figuring that they must have tripped over each other when trying to catch the remote. He turned his head to the left face the younger boy, whom seemed to have fallen just to the side of him. Mike had to do a double take, because the boy beside him did not look like Danny, at least not completely at first. \"Is that you, Danny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, who else would it... be?\" Danny replied as he turned to face Mike. It was his turn to also gasp. \"Is that you Mike? You look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different... so do you?\" Mike answered. He suddenly became aware of how strange his body felt. He realized with a start that it was the same unusual feeling he experienced on the bus. Simultaneously, the two boys sat up. \"Well, I think you got what you wanted... Explains why we fell suddenly.\" Danny and Mike were indeed sharing a single body from their necks down. Danny's idea appeared to have been successful in partially fusing them together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... this is so strange.\" Danny said as he lifted his left hand. He stared at Mike's right hand for a few seconds before turning to him. \"Why can't I move the whole body? Why can't I feel my whole body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because half of it is mine.\" Mike pointed out as he waved their right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right. We're like twins now, aren't we?\" Danny said as he turned to look towards Mike. \"Do we look identical now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. Last time I did not have a chance to look in a mirror or anything. The remote seemed to...\" Mike paused for a moment, remembering the urgency they had before. \"The remote, where did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was not so easy to answer. Now that the two were partially fused, they seemed to have split feeling and control of the body. It was as if they were cut in half and stitched together down the length of their body. Neither could feel what the other did with their half of the body. </span></div></div>",

We're sharing a body, half mine and half yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you wanted.\" Mike emphasized 'you' when he spoke to his would-be twin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You agreed, so you obviously were curious enough to try it again.\" Danny smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed, having to admit that part was true. \"Yeah, but I don't want to be stuck to you permanently. Help me find that remote, and we'll stow it away in my backpack for now.\" He looked past Danny to the backpack resting on one of the extra chairs. Surprising him, the backpack did not look like how he remembered his to be. It was black with a few Pokemon clips attached to it. \"Our backpack...\" he corrected. It felt strange referring to it as both of theirs, but given how physically close they were now, the backpack would have to be shared between them. Even if they technically owned two separate backpacks, the Mike and Danny in this version of reality would only be able to wear one backpack at a time. As Mike glanced back at their body, he wondered how much they could even feasibly do separately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's loud sigh derailed Mike's thoughts. \"Fine, lets get the remote.\" His would-be twin agreed. \"But, we're putting it away and not using it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving their single body proved to be a much more difficult task than either had thought. The two argued back and forth saying: \"No, you hold your hand there.\" \"I wasn't ready.\" \"Stop moving your foot.\" \"Brace. Brace.\" \"We can't step at the same time.\" \"Slow down.\" Finally, they were kneeling by the hospital bed, having spent a long period of time getting themselves to stand and slowly step next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIke looked anxiously behind them at the still closed door. \"What time is it?\" He wondered aloud. He was afraid that a doctor or nurse would pop in at any time to check on them. He wanted to avoid having to explain what the remote was, and they needed to retrieve it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop asking questions and help me lean closer.\" Danny said from beside him. They were facing the bed, with both hands holding onto the frame. Mike tried to get a better look, but smacked heads with his would-be twin as they both tried to see in-between the bed and frame. \"There is not enough room for both of us to look\" he complained. \"I'll reach in and get it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was forced to sift around so their left, Danny's side, was positioned closer to the bed. That also meant that he could not see what his other half was doing because Danny's head blocked his line of sight. \"You see it?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, give me a second.\" Danny whispered. \"Almost... Got it!\" he cheered. Slowly, Danny pulled his arm free and showed the remote to Mike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike held the remote in his hand, his fingers hovering over the buttons. He was tempted to select the de-fuse button, but after a long moment said instead, \"Alright, lets put it away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid you were going to separate us.\" Danny said as he looked at Mike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. Like you had said, I am curious about how this all works.\" He motioned to their body. \"Now help me get over there before I change my mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the two stood up and walked towards the backpack resting on the chair. They put it safely away, just as the door to their hospital room opened. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike heard the door to their room open, and a voice from behind said, \"Sorry for the delay boys. I know you must have been restless waiting for so long.\" They carefully turned around to see it was a doctor. He was dressed in scrubs with a white lab coat over them. He placed a tray he had been carrying onto the table top opposite of them. It appeared to hold a needle containing a some kind of fluid. \"The last thing before you are released is a flu shot. Whose arm?\" The doctor asked nonchalantly, as if he regularly treated twins as close as he and Danny were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, of course, never liked needles; sometimes they made him feel queasy just being near them. He quickly raised his hand and pointed it at his would-be twin brother. He also stated, \"His,\" but he heard an echo from beside him. Mike noticed that Danny was pointing his own had at Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on boys.\" The doctor sighed as he looked back and forth from Mike to Danny. \"It is not going to hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike did not believe the doctor. He had too many experiences of when doctors said that something would not hurt, but it was always the opposite of what they claimed. \"Please...\" Mike pleaded with Danny. \"You owe me.\" he said that last part in a whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider us even then.\" His twin whispered back. \"Fine, you can use my arm.\" Danny stretched out their left arm, palm-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had to look away, even though he was not the one getting the shot. \"Alright, all done. Your mother is waiting for you in the lobby.\" The doctor smiled as he put the needle back on the tray. He went to the desktop in the corner of the room, seemingly inputting notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike wondered if he and Danny had their own medical files, or if they shared one. He could not imagine many treatments or procedures that did not impact both of them at some level. \"Um, lets get our backpack.\" he heard Danny whisper beside him, dragging him out of his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Mike said as he turned around with his twin, but he froze, staring at the black backpack. Putting on a backpack should have been easy, but Mike had no idea how to coordinate that action with his other half. The two of them were still figuring out how to walk together. Danny must have had a similar reaction because he did not move to grab it either. He felt his stomach, or rather their stomach, flutter with fear. How were they going to walk out of the hospital? The doctor was still on the computer, so he did not seem to have noticed their delay in leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike then felt something prickle the back of his mind, like a memory trying to resurface. Mike closed his eyes and allowed it to come into his mind's eye. He saw images flash by. Strange, unfamiliar memories appeared before him for a moment and then vanished. \"Did you... see that?\" Danny asked from beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You felt... and saw them too.\" Mike whispered back. He reached for their backpack, and Danny leaned forward with him to grab it. Mike slipped his hand through the right shoulder strap and flipped it around. Seamlessly, Danny caught it and slipped his own hand through the left strap. Mike looked towards his twin, awestruck with their sudden demonstration of coordination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch more easily then before, the two turned around and walked toward the hospital door. Mike paused so Danny could open the door for them, before they continued moving down the busy hallway. Mike realized that that flash must have been some kind of memory because moving with his twin suddenly became easier. It was like he knew how to work together with him, to move their joint body. He was certain this must have been some kind of delayed effect of the remote, allowing users to adjust to whatever fusion they desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway split into eastward and leftward passages. Mike tried stepping to take the right hallway, but he immediately felt resistant along his half of their torso. He knew, without having to ask, that his brother was trying to walk towards the left hallway. He paused in the middle and looked at Danny. \"I guess that sudden flashbulb experience does not help with forks in the road.\" he commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is what you want to call...\" Danny hesitated as if trying to find the right word. \"...remembering... something that has never happened. Its weird that I just know how to move in tandem with you all of a sudden. Or at least until like you said, we come to a fork where we both think we know the right way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smiled. \"Though in this particular case, I think you were correct.\" You pointed to a sign marker on the wall in front of you. It noted that the lobby was towards the left, and the lab/blood work was towards the right. \"Unless of course you wanted to give some blood in addition to taking our shot.\" Danny just sighed and began heading towards the lobby, and Mike followed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike heard footsteps just outside of the hospital room before the door opened. He hastily zipped the backpack closed with Danny's help. He and Danny turned around just in time to see Diego step through the door, followed by Danny's mother, Gabriella Martinez, father, Juan Martinez, and sisters, Marisa and Isabella. The heart in Mike's chest began to beat faster, and his palm grew sweaty. He was not expecting most of Danny's family to come in. He was nervous how they would react, or if they would react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike noticed Danny looking at him from the corner of his eye, and he wondered if his would-be twin felt his nervousness. He and Danny shared one body, so it made sense that his twin would feel their single heart start drumming rapidly. \"It will be okay.\" Danny whispered, just loud enough for Mike to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Danny's family walked in, Gabriella rushed forward and wrapped her arms around Mike and Danny. She rested her head in the crook between their necks, and held them like that for several long moments. She spoke no words, but surprisingly, Mike felt comforted. He felt his and Danny's heart relax to a steady rhythm. He wondered if Gabriella was his mother now too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their mother let go, the rest of the family came up, one at a time, to hug them, though the embrace was shorter. Danny was very confused about the show of affection from Danny's family. He felt that the remote must have simply inserted him to the Martinez family, as if he had always been a part of their family. And if that was the case, why did all of them suddenly have the urge to embrace him and Danny. He hoped that he and his 'twin' were not sick or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella, his new mother, spoke, \"I am glad to see you on your feet and... starting to adjust. We will be there every step of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the bright side.\" Isabella, the youngest sister, spoke up, \"It is much easier to hug you both at the same time now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike felt the mood in the room dampen, as if Isabella had said something taboo. He looked to Danny, and his 'twin' seemed to be just as confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get you guys home.\" Juan, their father, said abruptly. \"Diego can you grab their backpack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got it.\" Danny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike felt a sudden tug toward the left, as if being pulled from the inside. He realized that Danny wanted to turn around, and he carefully tried to comply. 'We got it.' ended up being an overstatement. He and his twin struggled with slipping it on, nearly topping over in the process. Diego had to hold it so he and Danny could slip their arms through the respective straps. Surprisingly though, no one batted an eye. It was almost like they expected him and Danny to struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Danny slowly began to stumble forward. Again, no one seemed surprised that conjoined twins of the family had difficulty moving together. Diego and Marissa even stepped up on either side of them to help support them leave the hospital. It was not until Mike and Danny were seated in the family's car that he began to piece it together. \"Danny...\" Mike whispered, so only his twin could hear. \"I don't think we were born like this, sharing a body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny whispered back, \"If that is true, then how did we end up like this?\" Mike opened his mouth, but he then quickly shut it. The rest of their family piled into the car, and he did not want any of them to overhear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride home was quiet. No one seemed to know what to say. When their father finally, parked the car, he and Danny carefully tried slipping out. Mike pushed the door open, and they scooted up to the edge of the seat. Through a series of semi-coordinated movement, Mike and his twin managed to get partially out of the car before they lost balance and fell onto the driveway floor. Their mother and Marissa helped pick themselves back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, slowly, they walked through the front door. The house was just as Mike had remembered it. Before the remote, he had visited the Martinez's family home to see Marissa many times. The front doorway opened into a hallway leading toward the family room and stairs on the left, or the kitchen, dinning room, and bathrooms on the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Danny walked towards the family room, agreeing to want to spend some time alone. As they turned left, Mike paused abruptly when he saw the family portrait hanging over the fire place in the living room. The picture had all the smiling faces of the Martinez family and seemed to have been taken several months ago. What stood out to him was the identical twin boys, himself and Danny. Mike did not know who was who in the portrait, and he did not care to know at that moment. The picture clearly showed one twin on the far right, and the other on the left. He and Danny clearly had two, separate bodies at the time of the picture. It confirmed his suspicions, but it also opened up a lot of questions. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Did you see the portrait Danny?\" Mike asked his twin. \"The twins... uh, we... had two, separate bodies in it.\" He looked toward his brother, but Danny was still staring ahead, seemingly at the painting. \"What did the remote do?\" He whispered, so only Danny could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, we can take the painting down. We don't want it to bring back any painful memories or anything.\" their mother said from behind them. \"Juan, we really should have taken it down before they got home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, its okay mom.\" Danny spoke, surprising Mike. \"There is no point in hiding it away. Mike and I are okay with what happened.\" He paused as their mother and father came into the living room, giving him a knowing look. \"Okay truthfully, we are not really okay yet with what happened.\" Danny corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, we don't really know what happened.\" Mike whispered in his brother's ear. He then said aloud for his parents to hear, \"But, we are dealing with it. We will be fine.\" Mike emphasized the word 'fine' as he spoke. \"Is it okay if we go up to our... room.\" he paused for a moment before saying 'room'. Mike was not sure if their twin selves in this reality had separate rooms or not. His mind reeled as he tried to remember what the house was like before the remote was used. All of the Martinez siblings had separate rooms, from what he recalled. Since Mike was added into the mix, it only made since that he and Danny shared a room before whatever happened forced them to share a body in this version of reality. In any case, he reasoned that it did not matter since he and his twin had no choice in the matter now. It would have been ridiculous for them to have separate bedrooms, separate beds. He swallowed hard, realizing that they probably had hardly any 'separate' at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" She hugged them before joining Juan on the couch in the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and Danny slowly, carefully walked the stairs to the second floor. They had to speak to each other in hushed tones, \"my leg first... now yours... let me grip the railing... you're going to make us fall... slower.\" Finally though, Mike and his brother made it to the top of the stairs, entered their room, and closed the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks pretty much like my old bedroom, except why are there two beds?\" Danny asked as he pointed ahead of them. He and Danny stepped further into their 'new' room. The walls were painted a pleasant green color, and the carpet was the same, soft cream color from the hallway. A pile of clothes were thrown in the far corner, seemingly the dirty clothes pile. There was a closet rolling door in the opposite corner. In the center of the room were two beds, near each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shrugged his shoulder, and some of the muscles between his and Danny's neck flexed. \"Whatever happened to the us in this reality must have happened quickly, unexpectedly.\" He turned to look at his brother. \"Its the only thing that makes sense. The remote made it so something in this reality forced us to need to share a body. What that something is... who knows.\" His mind was spinning with both real and science fictional reasons as to why they needed to share a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\" Danny nodded his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and his twin had stopped in the middle of the room, slowly looking around. Mike noticed that there was a mirror attached to the rolling closet door, and he motioned for them to walk over to it. Mike took in a quick, surprised gasp of air as he stared at their reflection, and he heard Danny do the same beside him. It was their first time seeing their reflection. The boy, or boys, who stood in the mirror were of a darker, tanner skin tone than Mike was. They were also shorter and stockier. Mike gazed at their identical faces wondering for a moment how their family could have told them apart before... they were sharing a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna check out how we look?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mike looked at his twin with raised eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... I know you're just as curious as me.\" Danny smiled. \"Call it a twin-tuition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, Danny.\" Mike shook his head, but he did have to admit that he was curious. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly worked off their shirt, revealing their bare chest. The first think Mike noted was that there was no line, no scar. He half expected their to be an ugly scar running down the length of their body, signifying that they used to be two separate people. But, there was no trace of a dividing line. Mike's half of their body meshed perfectly into Danny's. He noted that they even had a single belly button, as if he and Danny shared an umbilical cord in the womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and Danny struggled with undoing their belt and the button of their jeans. But after a few attempts, they kicked their jeans and boxer down around their ankles. Dangling between his leg and Danny's was one penis. \"Of course we'd have to share...\" Mike commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We share everything else.\" Danny shrugged his shoulders. \"Why not a dick and an ass too.\" He half-smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike reached to grab the penis between his and Danny's legs, curiosity getting the better of him. But, he stoped just a few inches away. \"Is it okay, if I... touch it?\" He asked his twin, to which Danny nodded his approval. Mike then grasped the appendage, and he felt half of himself, Danny's half jerk. He let go. \"Clearly, we do share it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Danny blushed. \"It just surprised me.\" He then traced a hesitant finger down the length, making Mike shudder. \"What if we get an urge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his better judgement, Danny's words made Mike's mind think of his best friend's sister, Jessica Mills. She was drop dead gorgeous in his eyes. He wondered what it would feel like if she messaged his and Danny's penis. </span></div></div>",

Jessica, Jonathan's older sister, you know...\" He made a squeezing motion with his hand to help explain what he wanted to say. Mike realized that Danny was also blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... and now I have to deal with the result of your fantasy too.\" Danny looked away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry.\" Mike sighed. The blood flow to their shared penis slowed, which he was thankful for. For as long as they remained joined together, Mike knew that he and his would be twin would run into more embarrassing or uncomfortable moments. He began listing in his mind other moments which, would have typically been private, he would have to share with Danny. He imagined them sitting on the toilet going to the bathroom, not sure if the act of relieving themselves would need to be coordinated between them. The image then shifted to taking a shower, and having to wash each other's side of the body. He then imaged themselves helping each other with shaving and trimming their nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked at Danny through the mirror in front of him. His twin was still looking away, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. He and this previously younger kid were now closer, more related to each other, than Danny was with any other members of his family. Before the remote, they had not been strangers, but they had not explicitly 'hung out' together either. And now, he and Danny were essentially always going to be 'hanging out'. Mike felt his heart, their heart began to beat faster. The sudden increase in heart rate must have alerted his twin to something as he turned to look at Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Danny. My mind was wandering again.\" Mike apologized as their heart began to beat more normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it wasn't about Jessica.\" He half-smiled. \"What was freaking you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike paused for a moment, taken aback by the question. He guessed there were some advantages, if you would call it that, to sharing a body. Danny was a surprisingly insightful. \"Look, we're two completely different guys, not even twins, in one body. If we keep agreeing to stay in one body, we're going to inevitably struggle with sharing it.\" Mike sighed. \"So, just give me some slack, and I will give you the same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny furrowed his brow, \"That goes without saying. What else were you thinking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the day-to-day stuff. We have to take a shower together, get dressed together, go to the bathroom together, and we really don't know each other too well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did share a brain for awhile...\" Danny reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shuddered. \"Yeah, but that is not exactly the same thing.\" Though, he had to admit to himself that the experience gave him some insight into Danny's mind, which is why he agreed to attempt to share a body in first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to back out... I will not stop you from using the remote.\" Danny said after a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who is the one having second thoughts?\" Mike questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me. I was just giving you away out of this if you really wanted. I'm in this for the long haul; through thick and think.\" Danny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough...\" Mike shook his head. \"I'm not backing out.\" He then smirked. \"You're fun enough to hang out with, so I can excuse your quirks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Danny stated as he looked away, but Mike saw in the mirror that he was smiling. \"Lets get dressed. My half of the body is starting to get goose-bumps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike helped his twin with pulling their boxers over their waist. They leaned forward to grab their jeans, and a thought suddenly occurred to him. They had left the remote in their backpack, and he did not remember where it was. He lost track of it, after entering the car. \"Danny, we forgot the remote!\"</span></div></div>",

Green checks appeared next to the first and second target on the screen. Just before hitting the fuse button, the Martinez brothers turned a corner and disappeared from sight. The remote flashed a warning on the screen 'Targets out of visual sight. Move closer to targets.' The green checks had also turned into red Xs. You frowned, remembering one of the basic rules about the remote. You pick up your pace to chase after the siblings. As your approached the building where the brothers disappeared behind, you could hear the Danny's excited voice. Turning the corner quickly, you saw the brothers standing just on the other side, but you did not have time to stop, bumping into the older one. Dazed, you fumbled with the remote in your hand and dropped it. \"Sorry\" you say automatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah no problem... Mike?\" Diego said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mikey!\" Danny said with mischievous smile. \"Hey, fancy running into you here. You here to see Marisa?\" Danny said his sister's name with a tone indicating he knew about your crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Diego... Danny.\" You said Danny's name in a flat tone. Looking past them, you noticed the store the three of you were standing in front of was the Martinez's antique store. Mrs. Martinez ran it, and her children were called upon to help sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you dropped... whatever this is.\" Danny reached down and grabbed the remote before you could. \"What does it do?\" You did not notice him pressing one of the buttons, switching the second target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a new device I got for my phone.\" You snatched back the remote and pocked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you are here to see Marisa, she won't be at the store for another couple of hours. She's at a friend's to study. Unless you wanted to buy something...\" Diego said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's okay. Sorry for bumping into you.\" You apologize again as you walk past the brothers, slowly. You still wanted to test the device but you did not want to walk too far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright see you, dude.\" you heard Diego say from behind you as he opened the door to the shop. A bell chimed, signaling that someone was entering the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept walking a few more feet before you dared to look behind you. The Martinez brothers had entered the store. You take out the remote, and quickly check it over. \"Few.\" You sigh with relief. The remote did not even have a scratch from the fall. Surprisingly though, only the target two had a check next to it. As you walked closer to the store, you passed by one of the windows. It was tinted, so you could only see your reflection, but a green check replaced the red X next to the first target. \"Guess it works through windows.\" Then the red X appeared again by the first target, and then changed back to a check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message then flashed across the upper part of the screen 'Targets becoming too far apart. Use with caution.' You looked at the remote quizzically. \"I guess the Martinez brothers are splitting up, better use it quickly.\" Without hesitation, you pressed the fuse button. You were surprised when a flash of light engulfed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly standing inside the shop, behind the cash register. Having visited Marisa here, you recognized the oak walls and display cases. A couple of bills were in your right hand, or what should have been your right hand. Your skin was darker, as if you had spent time tanning. You realized that Danny must have unintentionally set you as one of the targets. Another hand, also the same color, was open, palm-up beside your right. It took a long second for you to realize that the other hand was your left, or should have been your left. You could not move it; you could not feel it. It dawned on you that you also could not feel your whole left arm, or your left leg, or the left side of your body. You felt a cold chill on the back of your neck. Something went terribly wrong with this fusion.</span></div></div>",

'<i>What did she mean by boys? Who was she smiling at?</i>' you asked yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer, you saw movement in your peripheral vision. Your left hand pressed something on the cash register and the bottom tray popped out with a bing. A familiar voice spoke to the older lady from directly beside you, \"Thank you Mrs. S.\" Realizing that you were still holding the money, you quickly reacted and placed the extra one dollar bills inside the tray. The left hand then pushed in the tray. You then watch as the woman walks away; the door bell rings as it shuts behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that Miguel? I have excellent taste, and... I get one more point added to the sales chart.\" The left hand made a tally mark on a sheet by the cash register. You remember Marisa mentioning something about a sales chart her family had as a friendly competition. However, you were more focused on the person controlling the left hand. Turning your own head further to the left, a second head came into view. That additional head was clearly joined to the left shoulder of your body. Based on the brief conversation that transpired, your other head was Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Diego turned his head, you realized that his appearance had changed. His skin tone was lighter, his face was less rounded, his nose was more pointed, and his cheekbones were higher. You had to resist the urge to touch your own face to see if changes were made, but Diego seemed to realize something was amiss.  \"You okay Miguel?\" He asked, concern was etched on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I was just distracted is all.\" you say with a half-smile, hoping he would not see through the facade. Inside, you were trying not to panic. You realized that the fusion was not complete because you and Diego were too far away from each other, just as the remote had warned. Dread welled up inside, \"Where is the remote?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The remote?\" Diego asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had not intended to state your question out loud. \"Uh...\" You started to say, leaning your neck further backwards, away from Diego. Our heads were far enough apart to so that we could turn our necks to face each other, so long as we bent our necks. You rub the back of your neck, trying to think of some excuse. '<i>The one that incompletely fused us together.</i>' you thought, being careful not to make the same mistake. \"Uh... the grey remote with the screen... and four buttons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fusion remote...\" Diego finished your thought, to your surprise. \"You were holding it in your hand, just a few minutes ago. You insisted on carrying it.\" His voice had an accusing edge to it. You watched as he used his hand to pat the left pocket, of the jeans you shared. You decided to mirror his action and patted the right pocket, but neither of you had the remote. \"Where did you last have it, Miguel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, outside...\" you said, knowing that was where you had just used the remote to get yourself in this situation. Diego then turned his head as he took a step away from the counter. Your foot remained planted, unmoving. You felt slight tension in the muscles down the middle of your chest and abdomen when your side of the body did follow Diego's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a jerky stop, Diego turned his neck to face you. \"We need to get the remote before someone else finds it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>No shit!</i>' you exclaimed in your head. '<i>Only problem is that I don't know how to move. How we move.</i>' You pondered telling him that you had already used the remote, but thought better of it. He does not remember how things were originally. \"Yeah, yeah.\" you say out loud. Praying not to fall flat on your face, you lifted your leg off of the ground. Diego seemed to brace his leg, like you would have done if you had control over both. Swinging your leg and him around, you planted your foot in front of his. Almost like muscle memory, you knew to brace your leg when Diego lifted his. It felt awkward and the first few steps were slower than normal, but you were able to move together with Diego. You could not explain it, but you remembered how to walk with him, as if you had done it your whole life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Diego crossed the space between the counter and the front door without falling, as you had previously feared you would. He reached in front of you to grab and turn the handle of the door. Opening it, you stepped forward and outside. The bell jingled above, but you ignored it. Just outside, you noticed the remote lying on the ground. It was in the same spot where you had just been before using it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout needing to say any words, you and Diego bent your knees. Before you could pick the remote up, Diego grabbed the remote with his hand. Holding it between you, he spun the remote around slowly, examining it. \"Phew... it doesn't look to be damaged.\" He then turned to look at you. \"Dude, you had one job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling defensive, you quickly make up an excuse. \"I had thought I put it in my pocket.\" You then reach for the remote, but Diego holds it out of your reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, we have it back now.\" Diego turns back to face you, his face a mixture of excitement and curiosity. \"If we selected ourselves, do you think we would count as one target or two?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question surprised you, \"Uh... one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. \"Yeah, your probably right.\" He shrugged his shoulder, and you felt the muscle between your necks twitch. \"Want to test it out again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assumed that Diego somehow knew about the girls you had previously tested the remote on. It seemed that the remote was far more powerful then you had realized, giving people false memories to accommodate whatever fusion happened. If that were true, it would make sense that Diego would remember that first test. You and he would have obviously had to have found and used the remote together. \"Lets wait till tomorrow. It will be the weekend, and we can spend the day testing it.\" You quickly say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not curious now... fine. I guess we still need to mind the shop until we close.\" Diego said before turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill to your amazement, you easily moved with Diego to step back inside the shop. You were not sure how, but the remote must have given you muscle memory of how to coordinate the body you shared with Diego. You did not remember anything about this life, just how to move with him. Diego and you then walked back behind the counter, where your backpack hung on a chair. You were tempted to take back the remote and his the de-fuse button, but you found yourself more curious about how things were now. Believing that it would not hurt to remain joined to Diego, you helped him unzip the pouch and place the remote safely inside. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the remote hidden inside your backpack, you and Diego stepped back to the counter. You had not noticed before, but to the side of the register were two open text books with two sets of worksheets. One of the text books was open to Pre-Calculus and the other to History. '<i>Were we doing each other's homework?</i>' You asked in your head. Several questions flew through your mind about how school worked for you both. You imagined siting in the same chair as one of you took notes. '<i>Do we take quizzes together or do we have to do the separately?</i>' A picture of a giant divider situated between your head popped into your mind. You smiled to yourself at how ridiculous it looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diego appeared to get back to completing one of the problems in the Pre-calc book, you decided to take a look at the history lesson. Parts of the book were highlighted and notes were written in the margins. You quickly recognized your shorthand even though the handwriting was somewhat different from how you normally wrote. \"Hey, can you double check this Miguel?\" Diego asked, pointing to problem 12 of the math worksheet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" You quickly say, even though you were inwardly panicking. Before the fusion, you were a grade behind Diego in school. Your class was still working on Trigonometry equations. However, when you looked at Diego's work, you found yourself understanding the higher math. \"Right there dude; you used the wrong function notation.\" you pointed out the error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was dumb of me.\" Diego laughed. He erased his mistake and fixed the work using the calculator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to start back on the History work, but you were distracted by Diego working beside you. He hummed a pop tune out loud and rocked your body back and forth slightly. But, he was also not the only thing distracting. A pressure was building in your bladder at the same rate that your burning curiosity to know what was between your legs grew. More than that, you wanted to know what you looked like. You had seen Diego's altered face but not your own yet. With your curiosity at a breaking point, You announced \"I-We\" you quickly corrected, \"need to use the bathroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego looked at you, appearing confused, but he did not argue. You and he walked to the restroom across the room. As he shut the door, you gawked at yourself in the mirror. You had defiantly changed. Your face had a much darker complexion and was the same color as your hand. When Diego turned to look in the mirror, you had to resist the urge to open your mouth in shock. You and he were remarkably identical. You had the same pointy nose, the same golden brown eyes, and the same bright smile. Your hair was cut longer though, with strands covering part of your forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to remain calm, you turn away from the mirror, hoping that it did not appear strange to have been staring so long. Diego and you face the toilet and he lifts the seat while you fumble with the zipper. Diego reached into the opening and slid his hand into your boxers. You stiffened when you felt his hand on your dick. Both of yours, you realized when he pulled out just one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrinating proved to be another task that you needed to coordinate. At first only dribbles came out, before you pressed your side of the muscles to help push the fluid out. You knew somehow to do it, just like your knew how to walk. You and Diego then put your penis back inside and zipped up your pants. You stopped at the sink to rinse your hands before heading back to the counter to continue your two sets of homework. </span></div></div>",

You look to your left and see Diego\u2019s eyes staring daggers right into your own. \u201cMiguel, is some wrong? You\u2019ve been acting all weird today, and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d He questions you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou state back at him quizzically, pretending to act like he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t see how I\u2019ve been acting strange.\u201d You responded in a confused tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt just seems like you\u2019re acting like this is the first day we\u2019ve been sharing a body. We\u2019ve been like this our whole lives, y\u2019know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell no duh I know we\u2019ve been like this our entire lives. It\u2019s just not something you can really get over, y\u2019know? Like the whole having to constantly be coordinating with each other just to do simple things like walking around get\u2019s old after a while.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I agree that having to deal with this everyday gets old; but at this point, after being like this for almost 18 years, I think I\u2019ve gotten used to it. I don\u2019t know about you, but this doesn\u2019t bother me as much anymore as it used to.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve gotten used to sharing our private parts? That doesn\u2019t bother you anymore? Cause I sure as hell haven\u2019t gotten used to it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look, I hate having to share what\u2019s down under just as much as you do. You think I feel comfortable touching our dick knowing that you can feel it too? Hell no, man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I hope you\u2019d understand that me acting all \u201cstrange\u201d is really just me still not being comfortable with us being in one body, having to share everything for the rest of our lives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to shut Diego up, as he looked away from you and back down to his homework. You did the same and continued to do your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, once both of you had finished your respective sets of homework, it was time to go back home. You gathered your things, and walked out to your car in the parking lot. The whole time, you felt extremely nervous, as you had no idea how you and Diego were gonna be able to coordinate driving a car together. After all, you had never driven before when you were 15 and in your original body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in the driver seat, and stuck the key in the ignition. Once the car started, you slowly stepped on the gas and began driving. Since you were used to coordinating your shared body in this life, driving ended up being fairly easy, with you and Diego being able to steer the wheel together with little to no issues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you got home. It felt weird walking into Diego\u2019s house, being familiar with everything in it as if it were your own. You walked up the stairs and reached your room. Immediately, you noticed how the room was covered with posters of things both of you liked, such as your favorite bands and sports teams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rooms colors were split down the middle, one side blue, and the other grey. Your favorite color was blue, so you assumed the blue side was supposed to be yours. Even the bed was split into to separate color halves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Diego took your bag off your back, and set it down next to your bed. You then laid down on your bed and looked up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels nice to finally relax after working, right dude?\u201d Diego asked. \u201cYeah bro, it feels nice.\u201d You respond back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lying flat on the bed in silence, you take the time to gaze around the room, taking everything in. It was strange how familiar it felt, even though you had never been in this room until now. The bedroom door, was on the grey, left side of the room. You had a harder time seeing that side as Diego's face was partially in the way. The blue, right side of the room definitely seemed to be yours. The posters of your favorite bands and movies, the ones that were hung in your original room, were on the wall closest to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost perfectly in the middle where the blue and grey walls met, a large desk with a windows computer was pushed against the wall. Pictures, that you and Diego must have taken, appeared on the screen for a few seconds before they faded into a different image. It was surreal seeing yours and Diego's two-headed body posing for different scenes. The images cycled through depicting two happy young men, or boys in some images. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou switched your gaze to look at the shelf above the desk. It surprised you to see several trophies lined up, though you could not make out what they were for. Diego was athletic in the original reality, being one of the top long distance track runners in the school. You also remembered watching a couple of his soccer games with Marisa. Perhaps you and Diego were still star athletes despite sharing a body; the trophies seemed indicate that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head back on the pillow to stare back at the ceiling. The blue-grey line went all the way and bisected it. Before thinking better of it, you asked, \"Why did we paint our room two separate colors?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego laughed lightly beside you. \"I tried to tell you it was a dumb idea. It still is ridiculous. Though, I guess I can't talk much shit about it since I did convince you to dye our hair different colors that one time. Middle school was a tough time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you replied, not sure how to respond. Diego seemed to be reminiscing about old, awkward adolescent times that you did not recall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how we were convinced...\" You felt his gaze on the side of your face, and you turned to look at him. Diego had a crooked smile on his face. \"...that if we pulled hard enough in opposite directions, we'd pull ourselves apart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou imagined yourself and Diego as young, naive kids, with two contrasting dyed hair, trying to pull on the sides of two railings. You laughed out loud, as if you really remembered the incident. \"We weren't always the brightest. Though, too bad it did not work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really too bad?\" Diego asked, and you sensed from his tone that that conversation was becoming more serious. He leaned forward, and you felt the muscles in your abdomen half-clench. You leaned forward with him, shifting into an up-right position. Each of your arms, were braced on the bed to support your torso. You were not sure how to answer, but thankfully the questions seemed to be rhetorical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back then, we were stupid kids who wanted to be like everyone else, to be normal.\" Diego looked down at your chest. \"We tried everything to be as individualistic and separate as possible.\" He turned to face you again. \"And, I'm not saying that is bad because I like how we differentiate ourselves, y'now. I like being me and you being you, but... I also like us as we are. Even if we could be safely separated in a surgery or magically get separate bodies from the remote or whatever, I would still want to share a body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you...\" You quickly corrected, \"we don't even know what it is like to not being like this. Aren't you at least curious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious. You know I am open to trying new things, more than you are. But, I don't want to be separated, at least not permanently.\" He gave a half-smile, \"I hope you really don't hate being stuck with me. Being totally honest, I also don't hate sharing a dick with you.\" You were surprised when Diego blushed. \"I feel pity for all the guys out there for whom masturbation is a solitary activity. It is so much better when my arousal fuels yours, and yours fuels mine. The multiplyer effect is... amazing. That first time we had a boner... that was exciting, when we realized we were feeling the same exact bliss. I want to share everything for the rest of our lives, and I hope that you really do too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Diego, not sure what to say. You wondered if Diego, before the accidental fusion from the remote, would say the same thing. Maybe he had some desire to have a conjoined twin, and now this was a perfect reality for him. You watched in silence as Diego moved his hand to your jeans. You were surprised to feel a bulge growing between your legs, not sure if it was yours or Diego's doing. </span></div></div>",

You reluctantly nodded your head and helped him take off your jeans. After your jeans were slipped off, Diego went to your underwear, and slipped that off on his own, revealing your shared boner which immediately stuck up in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, who gets the honor to jack us off: me or you?\u201d Diego asked you. You weren\u2019t sure how to respond. In your mind, all you could think was how alien this felt to you. You were clearly uneasy and nervous about performing such an act knowing that you shared your penis with a bodymate. <i>No, I can\u2019t do it myself,</i> you thought. <i>If this is gonna happen, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s gonna do it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do it. It\u2019s your turn, anyways.\u201d You responded, somewhat unsure if you\u2019re ok with letting Diego do this. \u201cWell alright, if you insist.\u201d Diego said, excited to indulge in this activity. With no hesitation, he brought his hand to your shared penis, and gripped it in his hand. You nearly gasped at how it felt. It was like your penis felt way more sensitive than normal. Diego began to stroke it up and down at a controlled pace, while quietly moaning to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t lie to yourself, it actually felt really good; but, you still couldn\u2019t get over just how uncomfortable you felt doing this. It was almost like someone else was giving you a hand job, and that person was a guy. You could only think how gay it was to you. You weren\u2019t homophobic, but you never wanted to be homosexual, either. <i>I can\u2019t take this anymore. This has to stop now, </i> you decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached your hand down to Diego\u2019s, and pulled it away from your penis. Diego looked at you with a confused expression on his face. \u201cWhat, you want a turn now or something? I mean, I guess I\u2019m game for it, but you did say it was my turn.\u201d Diego said inquisitively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not why I did that. I\u2019m not in the mood for this at all. I don\u2019t want to jerk off.\u201d You said adamantly, which brought Diego\u2019s face from a confused expression to an angry one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t want to jerk off? We have a boner dude, you can\u2019t deny you didn\u2019t want to do this!\u201d Diego responded in a harsh tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were the one that caused it, not me! I was never in the mood in the first place, you were the one that brought up our dick. And I must say, I don\u2019t share your sentiment about it at all. I don\u2019t like sharing my cock with you, and I certainly don\u2019t feel bad for other guys who don\u2019t have to share one. I think they\u2019re really lucky that they don\u2019t have to worry about always having to share their private parts with someone else!\u201d You almost yelled as you spoke this to Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego looked mortified after you said this. You could tell he wasn\u2019t expecting you to say this at all. Diego looked down at the bed, probably pondering how he was going to respond to you.

Or, maybe it was your own guilt for acting defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to speak, but the words you wanted to say were not coming out. On the second attempt, you said, \"I did not mean to come off that way. I just...\" You were not sure what else to say. You did not know how to articulate your feelings without explaining the whole situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego turned away from you and attempted to pull your boxers to cover your receding boner. He was struggling to do so by himself, and you helped pull them over your joint waist again. He turned back to look at you, his face was hard to read. \"I just don't understand what is going on, Miguel. You have not said anything about how you felt before.

What has happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked to the right, but, of course, your shared torso kept the two of you locked together. You could feel your pulse starting to race; your armpit became damp with sweat. \"I...\" You could not finish your thought as the panic you felt rose. You realized that you were a a crossroads of sorts. You could either confess the whole truth of what has happened, or you could try to get to the remote now. If you stretched, the backpack containing the remote was only an arm distance away. </span></div></div>",

You decided that attempting to grab the remote would not end well. Slowly, you relaxed your hand and turned to face Diego. You signed heavily, \"I... I'm not Miguel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Diego seemed taken aback by your answer but his face quickly contorted in anger. \"Dude, I'm being serious here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" you said softly. \"I'm not Miguel, not really. My name is Michael, Michael Hunter. That was me, at least before the remote made this happen, which was an accident by the way.\" You motioned towards the single body you and Diego shared. \"I was 15 years old. We were not related; we weren't even friends. I lived a couple of blocks away and often hung out with Marisa. You were always nice, but we never really talked with each other.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego's face was hard to read, but he did not seem to believe you. \"That is a great story.\" He said, flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, trying a different approach to explain. \"Earlier, you asked me about acting weird. When did you first notice I was acting differently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego stated after a few moments pause. \"In the shop... When Mrs. S was buying the timepiece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... that was when I became joined to you. Just a few minutes before, I ran into you and Danny outside of the the shop. He messed with the remote without me knowing.\" You decided to not say that you had originally intended on using the remote to fuse Danny and Diego. \"When I pressed the fuse button, the remote mixed me up with you, but only partially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The remote doesn't do that.\" Diego frowned. \"When we used it on the girls, they were completely fused together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats what I thought until I was joined to you. The remote... it gave a warning that the two of us were too far apart. My best guess is that the remote didn't have the range or enough juice to fuse us all the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego snorted. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm telling the truth.\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well your story has a few holes. How can we coordinate our movements so well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, \"I'm not sure... All I know is that I could move with you. I just know somethings about this reality, and I can remember some moments as if I have lived them. Just not everything.\" That was the truth. The longer that you remained joined with Diego, the more memories of this life flowed into your brain. It was a strange sensation remembering moments from two different sets of memories. \"Look, I know you don't believe me, and why should you. You only know this life because the remote filled everything in.\" You abruptly pushed off of the bed, pushing you and him into a standing position. \"If we hit the defuse button, you will know what I am saying is true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Diego said as he helped you retrieve the remote from your backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and he held it between you, both hands on the remote. \"Ready?\" You asked, and Deigo nodded. Simultaneously, you both pressed on the Defuse button.</span></div></div>",

A moment later, your brain was overloaded with different sensations. You leaned forward and closed your eyes. You brought both of your hands to cover your face to reduce the sensory input. Realization then struck. '<i>I have two hands!</i>' you said in your head. Opening your eyes, you stared dumbfounded at your two, fair-colored hands. You were back to normal. You had expected the remote to work, but it was still a shock to be back to your own, original body. The left-hand side of your torso and limbs felt prickly; it was the same sensation as if they had fallen asleep. You flexed your left hand hand and it moved just as it should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miguel...\" a bewildered sounding voice said. You turned to see Diego, who was also back to how he was before. He groaned and covered his face with both hands. A second later, he also stared wide-eyed at both hands, like you had done. He then looked at you, the only other person in the room. He messaged his temple with his left hand. \"I mean... Mike. This is so confusing. Its like I have two sets of memories.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do have two sets of memories. The remote separated us, and since you were holding onto it, you have kept the memories of when we were twins. I have those memories too, just not a whole lifetime.\" You then took notice of the bedroom, which had also changed. The entire room was painted grey. It was now only Deigo's room. Everything was back to how it was. You were Michael Hunter again, and Diego did not have a conjoined twin. You could not help feeling that something was missing when you looked at your left shoulder. You hoped that the feeling would pass over time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I understand why you were acting so strange before. When you were explaining what the remote had done, I thought you had either gone crazy, or you were stringing together some wild story like you used to do when kids asked why we had 'two heads'.\" Diego had a small smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, an image of you and Diego, when you were twins, popped into your head. You could see in your minds eye the shocked looks of the young children as you and he explained some dark tale about an experiment gone wrong. The memory brought a smile to your face. \"Yeah and now you know why the thought of sharing a body, sharing a dick was so alien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego nodded his head. \"But, I have to ask. Why did you not use the remote earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I was curious about that life. Sharing an entire body with someone else... I wanted to know what it was like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you do it again?\" Diego asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I don't know.\" The question took you aback. \"I don't even think we could recreate that kind of fusion again. It was like a freak accident.\" You squeezed your hands, suddenly aware that you were not holding the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lying on the carpet between you both. Before you could even react, Diego snatched the remote from the ground. Despite spending all that time in the same body, you were not sure what he was planning. </span></div></div>",

Neither of you spoke for a few long moments, and he filled in the gap, \"Now that I know my brother was not loosing his mind; I <b>want</b> to be twins again, conjoined as you bluntly stated it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" You raised your hand, palm facing your friend's brother. \"For one, I may have been curious but I don't want to be your twin, let alone be inseparable from you.\" You made your raised hand show two fingers. \"Second, we don't even know if we can make that type of fusion happen again. We could end up stuck with only one party-fused mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is worth the risk.\" Diego takes a step closer. You stare up at his face, suddenly remembering how much stronger and taller he was compared to you. \"And it can't be that difficult.\" he continued, \"All we need to do is stand in the same spots at the shop, with one of us pressing the button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one of us will remember!\" you stated firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will use the remote then since I know how uncomfortable <b>you</b> were with sharing a body.\" Diego smiled, as if that offer made the decision to be fused back together easy. \"All you have to do is stand by the register. Then, Miguel and I will be back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't normal; that wasn't even real! Do you even hear yourself?\" You yelled, afraid of what Diego was planning. \"All of that was just a fake reality created from the remote.\" The power the device seemed dangerous now, and you did not want it used against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is relative. You know as well as I do that this 'reality'...\" Diego made air quotes. \"...is probably not the 'original' reality. How many times do you think that someone had used the remote before we found it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question made you pause; you actually had never considered that the remote had been used before. \"Either way, I don't want to be fused with you.\" you finally restated. Before Diego could retort, you asked, \"But what about Danny?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny?\" Diego raised his eye brows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes more sense for you to be fused with him, as he is your actual brother.\" An uncomfortable memory from the previous reality had popped into your head as you mentioned Danny's name. \"When we were twins, it made <b>both</b> of our families worse because we were essentially an accidental love child between my dad and your mom.\" The remote had created a reality where your actual dad had a one night stand with Diego's mother. The end result was you and Diego being born as conjoined twins, and a very complicated, messy home life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego seemed to also be contemplating that realization. He stared at the remote for a few moment before looking at you in the eyes. He then opened his mouth to answer.</span></div></div>",

Miguel! Your father is on his way over right now to pick you up for your trip to the Baseball Game.  I suggest you two stop doing whatever you two are doing and get ready.  He'll be here in 20 minutes time,\" interrupted their mother, Roberta Martinez, from down the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Diego remembered that the reason they were so much lighter than the rest of their family was that his.....their mother had an affair with their father, Phil Hunter, during a rough spot in his mother's marriage to their 'other' dad Fernando and 40 weeks later, the doctors brought her into surgery and they came out healthy as can be for conjoined twins.  At first there was a lot of fighting between the two families on who exactly would raise Diego and Miguel. But it was settled that they would live with their mother and her family.  But Phil and his family would take them every weekend and over the summer when school was not in.  Since then it had worked out pretty well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom,' called out Miguel.  'We'll be right down.  Just give us a moment.  Are you sure there is nothing wrong Diego?  You really were giving a weird look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I guess this may sound a little weird Miguel.  But, do you remember a person named 'Michael'?  A person that you many or may not have been just a moment ago?\" asked Diego nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Diego a 'what are you talking about?' look, Miguel said, \"No.  Why would my name be 'Michael'? Are you feeling alright Diego? You know as well as I that we've been attached to each other since birth.  Always will be and always have been. And I would never want to change that.  You are my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego smiled at Miguel.  He thought to himself that the first hurtle had been jumped over successfully.  But wanted to make sure but didn't want to miss the Ball Game that their dad was going to take them to.  So Diego decided that he would go with the flow and see what happened.  Putting down the controller on their bed.  Diego said, \"lets get downstairs before mom has a cow.  I'm ready for the ball game.  Aren't you Miguel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Miguel said, \"Of course, it'll be fun.  Lets get downstairs fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now conjoined twins walked out of the bedroom and down the stairs to wait for their father to show up, finding it very easy to walk in tandem....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of the memories were a fuzz, and he was having difficulty processing them. Michael gazed around his bedroom, the one he had lived in for nearly his whole life. It was a dual colored room with one side being a steel grey and the other a midnight blue. Posters lined the walls and trophies sat on shelves. He realized with a start that this was not just his room; he shared this room. Along the middle of the far wall, a computer screen caught his attention. An image currently displayed on the screen, and he quickly recognized the headshot as himself. His black hair hung around his face with slight curls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image then faded and shifted into a different headshot, but Michael immediately knew that it was not himself. The face was nearly identical, but that was, \"Diego?\" Michael whispered the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Miguel. Everything is back as it should be.\" A voice, similar to his own, said from his left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name he called Michael seemed very familiar like it actually was his name. He turned his head towards the voice, and the same face that had been displayed on the screen smiled beside him. He felt the corners of his lips being tugged upward in small smile to mirror Diego's. But then, Michael became aware of something unusual. Diego was standing beside him. He and Diego were standing in the same spot, the exact same spot. For a few moments, his mind reeled trying to explain how two people could be standing in one spot. Realization finally came to him. He and Diego were not just twins. They were much closer than any ordinary set of twins. They had literally been inseparable since birth. He shared a body with Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael let his gaze wander down, letting his eyes confirm what he had remembered. He was wearing a collared black, stripped shirt with blue jeans and a simple pair of sneakers. He shook his head, realizing his mistake. He and Diego were wearing the outfit, together. They had no choice but to dress in the exact same set of clothes since they only had one body between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then became aware of a new sensation, or lack there of. He watched as his left hand tap the side of his left leg, and his left foot tapped against the carpet. All of these movements were not his. Michael realized that his brother, Diego, was moving them. Michael had no control, no dominion over the left half of their body. That side belonged to his twin. The right side was Michael's. But, had that always been the case. Something was not right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain, like a needle, pricked at his brain. \"This isn't right.\" Michael finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what isn't right?\" Diego asked beside him, confusion written on his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right.\" Michael emphasized. \"We're not supposed to be twins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we're twins Miguel.\" Diego smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Michael exclaimed. \"My name is not Miguel!\" Michael rubbed his forehead as memories, two different sets flashed through his brain. This is why he was so confused. Two sets of memories were swirling in his head. He was not sure how, but his old memories, the memories of being Michael, were still in his mind. Though, those memories seemed to be weakening, fading. \"The remote! Give me the remote!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego seemed suddenly concerned. \"You don't need the remote Miguel. Everything is back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is not what it is supposed to be!\" Michael yelled. He saw the remote in Diego's hand, their left. \"Give it to me!\" He thrust his hand towards it, but Diego swung his arm back, out of his reach. Michael did not give up though; he knew that Diego had done this to him, fused them together. He swung his leg wildly in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop Miguel!\" Diego yelled as their body crashed into the carpet from Michael's struggle. Their back landed on the floor. Diego's left hand remained stretched out of Michael's reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the remote!\" Michael yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? We don't need this thing anymore. You will see that this was how it should be.\" Diego smirked before throwing the remote into the nearest wall. There was a loud crash, and the remote fell to the floor in several pieces. </span></div></div>",

The advanced technology, pseudo-science, magic tech, or whatever it was could not have been destroyed by simply smacking a wall. He pressed his hand into the carpet and bent his knee as he tried stand up in vain. The weight of half of his body, not working in tandem with him, held him fast. Michael turned his head and glared at the other head that shared his body. The face, some combination of Diego's and his original faces, smiled smugly. He had copper skin, black hair that curled slightly at the tips. It was both familiar and alien all at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked into the other face, Michael remembered spending 17 years with his brother, Diego, firmly joined at the shoulders. Their parents told them that they were a team, for better or worse. Memories of them growing up flooded his mind. Like a first-person movie, he saw through his own eyes how they learned to ride a bike, blew out birthday candles, and swung a baseball bat to earn a home run. He remembered the thrill they shared when they landed a skateboarding trick, frustration when they could not agree on how to spend their Friday night, and his worry for Diego when they fell off their dirt bike, injuring his brother's ankle. The mix of emotions, mostly positive, hit him like a truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael could not catch his breathe. He tried his best to push the memories, the emotions to the side, but more washed over him. More and more washed away the old Michael, leaving Miguel behind. \"It will be okay Miguel.\" He heard his brother say, like the thousands of times before. \"We're a team, for the better.\" His brother said. It was a familiar montra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were young, he and Diego had changed the words that their parents has said, '...a team for better or worse.' Their condition, their bond was not for the worst. Miguel closed his eyes. He repeated the phrase they used, \"We're a team for the better.\" When he opened them, his brother was smiling back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Miguel?\" he asked, seemingly cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... what happened?\" Miguel asked. \"We were going to do something with the remote, and then...\" he rubbed his temple with his right hand. \"I had this... terrible migraine. Did I black out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Diego replied. Slowly, they pressed their own arms into the carpet to raise their torso off of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel immediately noticed the remains of the remote. \"What happened to it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I broke it when you were having your episode, or whatever it was.\" Diego admitted. \"Good thing I did too. It seemed to fix things as soon as I threw it against the wall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. It would have been cool to test out.\" Miguel commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sense worrying about it now. We should clean it up though, before Mom and Dad get back. She will throw a fit, otherwise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not helping to clean your mess.\" Miguel rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ass is just as much on the line.\" His brother retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel shuddered. \"Our ass you mean.\" He remembered the trouble they used to get into when they were younger. Once when they were in their Sunday best, they found the perfect mud puddle to play in. The brief amount of fun was not worth the storm their mother could become. \"Fine.\" He agreed verbally, even though he had intended to help anyways. It was not like his brother could clean it up by himself anyways. </span></div></div>",

Realizing that Diego probably wasn\u2019t able to move the right side of the body, you quickly reacted and handed the change to the customer. As the customer walked away, you could hear what sounded like Diego\u2019s voice coming from inside of your head. \u201cWhat the hell...\u201d You realized that you could hear what Diego was thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiego, it\u2019s me, Mike!\u201d You thought, trying to communicate with Diego. <br>\r\n\u201cMike? Why the hell does your voice sound so close to me? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Diego questioned you. At the same time, his side of the face turned into a confused expression. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell can\u2019t I feel the right side of my body? I can\u2019t move it either. Mike?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDiego, calm down for a second. We need to walk to the bathroom so I can explain.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018we\u2019? That doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust DO IT, Diego!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego reluctantly agreed, and took a step back. You both almost lost your balance in your shared body as it felt weird to not be able to feel or control the other half. You pivoted your half of the body using your right foot so that you faced the bathroom. Diego used his foot to take the first step, and you used yours to take the next one. After almost tripping a few times, you made it to the bathroom. Diego used his hand to close the door, and then immediately spoke using the one mouth between you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike, if you\u2019re still there, you need to tell me what the fuck is going on!\u201d Diego sternly asserted. <br>\r\nTo help prove to Mike that you were there with him in his body, you used the mouth to speak. \u201cOk, don\u2019t freak out alright. I know this sounds really freaky, but my mind is in your body with you right now.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean, and why did my lips move when you spoke?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt means that both of our minds are together in your body, and we each only control one half of the body. I have the right, you have the left. Since we only have one mouth and tongue, I guess we share control of those.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense! How the hell did your mind end up in my body? And I only control the left side? I don\u2019t want to share my body with someone else! I don\u2019t also want to have to share a mouth and tongue with someone else, that\u2019s just super weird!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if you\u2019d just calm down, I could explain how this-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to speak, you were interrupted by Diego, who took control of your shared mouth. \u201cJust shut up! I don\u2019t want to hear your explanation, I want you out of my body!\u201d Diego tried pulling away from your half and turned your shared head to the left. \u201cDiego, stop it right-\u201c You tried to say something, but Diego interrupted you again. \u201cStop using my mouth! It feels weird!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you grew just as frustrated as Diego, and tried pulling away from him as well, while also trying to turn your shared head to the right. Your shared body wobbled in place as you both tried pulling in opposite directions. Your shared head pointed forward and shaked in place as the conflicting signals your were both sending it caused it to spazz out. You both tried using your one mouth to argue with each other, but you kept cutting each other off as your mouth and tongue twitched sporadically from the conflicting movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like forever that your were fighting with Diego...</span></div></div>",

Diego's body had never moved in such a way, and it was putting a strain on you both. Trying to relax your muscles to reduce the unusual pain, Diego placed his hand on the left side of the sink, and you mirrored him. Leaning forward, your mutual face looked downward into the bowl. It took close to a minute before your quick, deep breathing calmed into a normal rate. Finally, you both raised his head to look into the mirror. A chill ran down your side of the neck. It was strange seeing Diego's face, instead of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid another conflict, you decided to speak with Diego through your linked minds, rather than using his mouth. '<i>Look, I want to get out of your body as much as you want me out. This was a complete accident.</i>' you spoke, directing your thoughts to Diego. This was a strange sensation in and of it self. You could not read each other's minds, but you could share some thoughts. It was like speaking to yourself, inside your own head, but louder. '<i>This was an accident. That remote that fell to the ground outside your shop... it did this.</i>' You decided against telling him that you were originally planing on merging him with his younger brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, so how do we undo this?\" Diego spoke using his mouth. \"Where is the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good question. You suddenly realized that you did not have it; or more accurately, Diego's body did not have it. '<i>Back at the cash register?</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego agreed, and the two of you slowly rotated his body away from the sink. It was just as difficult as before to coordinate the movements of Diego's body to walk. Staggering, Diego and you made it back to the register without falling. However, it was quickly obvious that the remote was not there. \"Where were you... before this happened?\" Diego whispered. A stray thought had crossed the bridge between your two minds, and you knew that he was worried about his family seeing him act weird. Danny and his mother were still somewhere in the store, and he did not want to be seen talking to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I was just outside...</i>' you answered him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behind the tinted window...\" Diego whispered, finishing out loud what you were thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Yeah...</i>' You thought, a little concerned about how much you were both unintentionally sharing with each other. '<i>Let's check outside.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking more easily now, you and Diego moved toward the door and stepped outside. The bell, attached to the door, rang, but neither his brother or mother came to the front. Just outside, you noticed remote on the ground and someone sitting slouched against the wall, appearing to be asleep. \"That's my body.\" you say out loud. You and Diego kneeled next your body, and you grabbed the remote. '<i>Its a quick fix. I just need to press the Undo button.</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Are you sure this is going to work?</i>' Diego spoke through your linked minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Yeah.</i>' You thought just before pressing the undo button. Immediately, a light engulfed you and Diego. A moment later, you were suddenly sitting on the hard ground. You opened you eyes slowly, letting them adjust to the outside light. You raised both of your hands in front of you and flexed your fingers. Turning your head, you see Diego still kneeling beside you. </span></div></div>",

A quick zap and now the father was playing with his wife who was now a few years younger. She kept most of her body but now had gained a little bit of muscle and had her hair cut short. Mike saw her make a beautiful catch after her husband overthrew the ball. \"I wonder if that's her or her son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he saw 2 young couples having a picnic double date. One couple was a Caucasian male and an African-American female while the other was a Caucasian female and an African-American male. A second later only one couple remained- both were females with mixed ethnicity. \"I love you,baby...\"one of them said,shifting their body to reveal a large penis. The other girl blushed. \"Babe,you're making me hard...\" They then proceeded to kiss passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a mother who was struggling to put her baby to sleep while talking to a fellow mother who was trying to rein in her hyperactive child.They both looked exhausted from a lack of sleep. \"Maybe I can kill 2 birds with 1 stone.\" After a blue flash, the hyperactive child was gone and now the mother with the crying baby was bouncing around with seemingly endless amounts of energy. \"Karen,calm down! You need to be careful around the baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I'm just thinking about what we're gonna do! We're gonna go swimming and then shopping and then watching a movie and then...\" she continued while the other woman just shook her head and kissed her to shut her up. They then started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike stood up to leave the park but then he saw a sleazy 50 year old man walking his dog and staring at a hot jogger who was running through the park. \"Let's see,can I fuse people with animals?\" He aimed at the jogger first. \"Lets see if you still like her when she's furry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, at that moment...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly pocketed the remote in his bra before anyone could notice it. He looked round and still saw that old man staring at him. Mike started to get red with anger. He knew he had been given boobs and a large behind for a man but he hated it when people started staring at him. He whipped out the remote and zapped the man.

I HATE you!,\"she screamed as she stormed upstairs. Mike laughed and went to stroke their cat,Mocha,who purred with pleasure. \"Hi Mark!

He fed Kobe and went back upstairs to go to his room. On the way he passed his older sister Megan. She eyeballed him for a moment then quickly retreated back into her room. Mike had always suspected that his sister was jealous of him because he was, first of all, a boy and had larger DD cup boobs and a larger butt than her- all while being 2 years younger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike opened the door to his room- it was a messy wasteland, scattered with assorted fitness magazines and cans of Coca-Cola. He had posters of his favourite baseball players and his favourite rock artists plastered across his walls. He rapidly stripped himself of his workout clothes and sniffed them. \"Ugh!\" He chucked them into a heap on the floor and just sat on his bed thinking about the antics he'd gone through that day, smiling all the time.</span></div></div>",

As usual, the town square was pretty packed with your average pedestrians trying to get around. He knew that with the large amount of people that flocked there everyday, it would be easy to test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he'd start with something not many people would notice. 2 middle aged women walked chatting nonstop to each other. As it was a warm day, one woman- who was Caucasianand tanned with long,brunette hair- wore a stylish pair of sunglasses, a large beach hat and small heels. She wore a flashy red dress with glittery sequins that sparkles in the sunlight. Her friend was a lot more conservative with sandy blonde hair, glasses with a white polo shirt, casual jeans and black trainers. 'Well, here goes nothing...' said Mike as he pushed his finger on the fuse button. A blue flash of light suddenly blinded Mike! A few seconds later he saw the aftermath: a singular woman walked in place of the two. They had tanned skin and long-blonde hair. She was wearing the hat and sunglasses( in the style of the conservative woman's ) but now had a glittery red top leading to a small denim skirt and black trainers with a little bit of heel. She was still chatty but now she spoke to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bench Mike was going ecstatic- causing a few distasteful looks from passersby -but he didn't care. It'd worked! He really felt like he'd been given a great power BUUUUUUT he didn't want to take much responsibility, just yet. Over the next hour Mike experienced the thrill of fusing and modifying people whenever he liked by just picking the right parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 businessmen wearing suits and black suitcases, seemingly on the way to work walked past 2 young women who were scantily dressed to attract attention to themselves. A few seconds later, one of the businesswomen stopped and rifled through her suitcase. \"Omahgawd! I, like, totally left my makeup at home!\" She pouted towards her scantily dressed friend. \"Fine! But you gotta gimme it later! I've, like, got a meeting with Mr Bossy Boots and I'm, like, totes in for a promotion!\" They both giggled as they walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young homeless man sat on the street asking for pennies from people walking by. Everyone gave except from this snobbish, late 30-year-old woman. She wore large diamond earrings, a lavish fur coat and designer high heels. She scoffed at the man and belittled him for being 'street scum'. A second later the man was gone. Now a 25 year woman walked away. She still wore diamond earrings and designer high heels  but now wore an oversized jacket with exotic hair on the inside and wore drab ripped jeans. She walked up to another beggar on the street and gave a large wad of cash, no questions asked. The man quickly hugged her and ran off, probably towards his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the road a 15-year-old couple walked. The girl had red hair tied into a bun and was obviously pregnant, looking like she was about to burst while the boy with shaggy hair and a beaten up luffa jacket strolled nonchalantly next to her, lighting a cigarette and inhaling the fumes. \"Jerry you need to stop for the baby- it's harmful to them!\" The guy just smirked and said,\"I'll quit as soon as the baby comes,\" which angered the mother to be to no end. A blue flash and now walking by herself was a teenage mother to be with shaggy red hair tied onto a bun wearing a luffa jacket that barely covered her baby bump. She felt the cigarette in her mouth and put it out, disposing of it afterwards. \"I'm never gonna pick up one of those again for you, baby.\" She took a couple more steps forward but then suddenly doubled over right next to Mike.

He entered inside to see Jacob, a 5\u201911\u201d boy of a man, age 20, Jon\u2019s coworker. Jon himself was nowhere, even though he was usually working at this time on this day of the week. \u201cHey Mikey!

He should be back soon!\u201d \u201cOkay, is it okay if I wait here for him?\u201d Mike inquired. \u201cYeah, were really slow right now! Do whatever you want...so long as it doesn\u2019t mess with the displays.\u201d Mike figures that while he was waiting for Jon, he could try out the remote at least, to make sure it wasn\u2019t a waste of excitement.

Whenever she got angry, people just laughed at her and walked off. Last but not least Alexis tried skipping 4th period by hiding in the bathroom but then she suddenly went on her period. Jenna McFagan heard her inside the cubicle and joked about Alexis to the WHOLE school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about Jenna McFagan made Alexis angry.So angry in fact that she forgot to look where she was walking and tripped over something buried in the grass in front of her. \"This day keeps getting BETTER and BETTER,\" she mumbled to herself, sitting up in the grass.

He had a Barbie in his hand as well, and he abruptly noticed that it looked way too big. His fingers looked very petite as well, and when he looked down, he saw that he was wearing a pink t-shirt which retained the band logo his shirt originally had. He also wore a pink skirt, with his jeans beneath it. He wore a pair of pink flip-flops, and he saw his smaller toes. \"Oh no...\" Mike muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling for a mirror of some kind, Mike found a small toy cosmetic bag, and it contained a little compact mirror. Looking into it, Mike saw that he resembled himself when he was ten or eleven, but he had more feminine features. His dark brown hair was long and in pigtails, going to about halfway down his back. He'd always had a large nose, but now his nose was small and in the \"button\" shape. His eyes were larger, and his face had a rounder shape to it. He looked pretty feminine, but he could still feel his dick. However, there was a small sensitivity behind it, between his legs. He also felt his cellphone in his pocket, and found the remote sitting next to him. He quickly pocketed that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mike was taking this all in, a voice to his left called out, \"Everything okay, Mikayla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked toward the house, and saw a pair of women sitting on the porch, one of whom was looking in his direction. Judging by her button nose, Mike concluded that she must have been the mother of the girl he fused with. Unsure of what their current relationship was, Mike just said, \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled and asked, \"Are you admiring yourself again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gave a nervous laugh, and replied with \"Yep, you know me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed, and went back to chatting with her friend. Mike looked back at the mirror, and muttered, \"What the heck am I going to do now?\" His first instinct was to defuse. However, this would certainly cure his boredom, and he was curious about what his new life was like. He could also test out the remote some more, since he was honestly amazed by its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he decide on?</span></div></div>",

A flash released, Mike is now fused with the woman again. He feel the suddenly grow of height and body. Within a second, Mike estimated that he is now having the height of 5'0. He looked down to his chest and found out that he is now having the woman's B-cup breasts hanging in front of him with her bra covering up them nicely. Then his clothes are changing too, the pink t-shirt which retained the band logo his shirt originally had is now changed and fused with the pink skirt and jeans that he had wearing just now. He is now wearing a dress which is pink color with the band logo in front of the chest and flowering design with jean cloth for the lower half. It looks weird and he quickly walks into a room which seem like the woman's room for mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled up the dress and see that he is now wearing a cotton panties which having a teddy bear printed on it but it is black in color just like the boxer he is wearing a few minutes ago.

He looks more feminine now with the combination of the face of the little girl and her mom, his new hair flow down to his shoulder and the pigtail before had still remain. His hair color had changed brighter now into nearly brown. His hands and feet are bigger now but still too small compare to his old one. He is still wearing the pink flip flop as the mother didn't wear any shoes when the fuse begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Mike says for the first time after fused with the woman.

Mike giggled quietly as he noticed that there had been a small hiccup with the defusion:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman retained her cute button nose, beautiful smile and her youthful body. However, instead of wearing casual attire, she looked like she was going to a 10 year old's tea party with her frilly pink dress, pink and grey tights song with flip flops and painted toenails. Mike looked up at her face and saw that, while it was obviously carefully made up, her neutral makeup had been replaced by thick eyeliner, powdered cheeks and bright pink lipstick that complimented her peachy skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike laughed and motioned to turn around before he realised something that made him stop in his tracks. <i>'Giggled?'</i> he thought to himself. <i>'When have I ever GIGGLED before?!'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down begrudgingly, confirming that he was indeed still trapped in the body of the little girl. He blew a stray pigtail out of his face in frustration as he crossed his petite arms over his flat chest. \"Great...\" Mike mumbled sarcastically in his high pitched voice. He fished out the remote from his pocket and turned it over in his hands. <i>'No instructions for what to do if something like this happens...'</i> Staring intently at the back panel, Mike made out the words <i>'44 DOOLEY ROAD</i> and the start of what he thought was a name that was encrusted with orange rust. \"Dr B..? Dr R..?\" He looked at it closely but for some reason his eyes struggled to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this kid needs freakin' GLASSES, for God's sake. I can. I can't even tell what that says! I can probably find out at 44 Dooley Road, wherever the hell that is. This Dr B or R better be able to unfuse me- I am NOT going through puberty AGAIN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike took another look at the remote; exterior wise, the remote looked normal, maybe a little dings around the edges but nothing serious. \"I wonder if that was just a glitch,\" you whispered to yourself. At that moment, some unfortunate people came outside onto the porch and hugged the other woman that was lounging there. From Mine's viewpoint they were practically BEGGING to be fused. \"Why not? It's just to test it...\" Mike smiled deviously as he lined up the device at his oblivious targets.</span></div></div>",

He obviously didn't pay too much attention to his appearance, wearing a browning sleeveless vest, (accidentally) ripped jeans shorts that strained against his large rear and holed socks with sandals. He waved at Mike's 'mother' with his  podgy fingers, a band on his ring finger indicating that he was probably her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well I guess love really is BLIND,'</i> Mike thought as he looked at the slob that waddled over to scold his daughter for texting instead of greeting the woman on the porch.

She had blonde hair unlike her mother and sister that was pinned back by a pink hairband and wore buckets of makeup that made her look older than her actual age (17,18?). She wore an all pink ensemble that included a blouse, jumper, mini skirt and 3 inch heels. When her father came up to her she just scoffed and strutted off, making Mike hate her even before he knew her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just Mila.\" Mike turned to face his mother who wore her disappointment on her face clear as day. \"Is she always such a b... bad daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed deeply before she spoke. \"Don't worry your pretty little head Miky, it's just a phase she's going through, that's all.\" As she twisted one of Mike's pigtails in her hand, Mike wondered if she was trying to convince him or herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook this off and looked at the woman sitting on the patio. She looked about the same age as his 'mother' but instead of her body being pale and lithe like the mother's, hers was mocha coloured and skinny. She was about 5'0\" as well but she seemed to have a commanding presence that demanded attention from others, not just physically. Even though her appearance was fairly average with nothing really remarkable about her aesthetic looks, she showed off by casually opting to wear golden jewellery: golden bangles, necklace, a pair of golden hoop earrings with feathers at the bottom and even golden rimmed spectacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked back at the remote, deciding too...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is this some kind of prank from you?  I know we both are really into sci-fi but come on, you're pulling my leg Mike,\" said Jon, not believing what Mike was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest I haven't really tested it yet.  I found it yesterday and the intructions say it is for fusion of people, things, and other objects.  I was wanting to test it out with you to see if it actually works or if it is an elaborate prank by someone,\" said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his watch, Jon said, \"Well it is only 7:45, school doesn't actually offically start until 8 am.  Let's head over to the boy's bathroom and try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys quickly walked into the school and into the closest boys bathroom.  Looking around they saw that the bathroom was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mike, let's see if this thing actually works,\" said Jon, a hint of non-belief was heard in his tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here it goes,\" said Mike, pointing the remote at Jon and pressing the red button.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of bright white light, blinding both boys momentarily.  Blinking and rubbing his left eye for a moment, Mike took a second to allow his eye sight to readjust.  Then he opened his eyes again and saw that Jon wasn't standing in front of him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are we going to go to the bathroom or not Mike?\" said a voice to his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised that the male voice was so close to his right ear Mike pulled away and turned his head, knocking his nose into the side of the face of Jon.  Taking a moment to see what actually just happened, Mike realized that he was now fused together with his best friend Jon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, are you okay?\" said a frightened, but intrigued Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. why wouldn't I be?  We just need to go to the bathroom really bad.  I know you can feel it really bad too.  Can we just get going brother?  Class is about to start and we shouldn't be late to class,\" responded Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? You just called me 'brother'? Come on Jon stop kidding around, you find this weird that we are fused together like this right?\" said Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Mike? We've been 'fused' together since birth.  Remember dummy, we're Siamese twins.  We share the same body, although you control the left side of our body and I control the right side.  But we do share most everything,\" responded Jon, as if Mike was playing a prank on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when it hit Mike fully, he looked down and actually saw that they both were attached to the same body and that it looked his normal everyday 15 year old body, but his best buddy was attached to him at the shoulders.  Trying to move his right side Mike realized he couldn't, but once he tried to move his left arm and leg they immediately responded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gasped at the realization that his Fusion remote control actually worked.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike was not sure if he was more intrigued or frightened about the prospects of the fusion remote actually working. He and his best friend had always been close, but now they were literally inseparable. It was as if the remote had split them down the middle, and sewn their two halves together. Though, their clothes seemed to have become some combination of what they were originally wearing. Both of them had been wearing jeans, which did not change. But, they were now wearing a purple and black plaid shirt, a merge of Jon's plaid shirt and the purple one Mike had been wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions buzzed through his brain. Who made the remote? How did it work? \"Why are we only... halfway merged?\" Mike asked the last question aloud, rhetorically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Halfway merged?\" Jon gave him a questioning glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like why we were not merged all the way together into... one person?\" Mike's curiosity had gotten the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... you've taken the same biology classes I have dude.\" Jon looked at him in disbelief before rolling his eyes. \"I can't believe your wasting time with this prank or joke, or whatever this is. I don't want to go to English any more than you do, so I'll play along. You have to take the fall if we're late though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was unsure what his friend meant by that. \"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Jon sighed. He then made his best attempt at looking and sounding like some wise scholar or lecturer. \"Well... You know about the birds and bees, so I will gloss over that part of today's lesson. The most current theory is that twins form from the same zygote, a clump of cells, that divides into two embryos. Sometimes, that division happens too late, and siamese twins, or conjoined twins as they are also called, are the result. They are not the result of two zygotes merging together. Depending on how late the division is, the twins could be joined by a small band of flesh, or as in the case in front of you, they could literally share everything from their necks down.\" His voice then returned to normal, and he jokingly added, \"So because you wanted to split so late in our early years, I'm permanently stuck with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike rolled his eyes. \"Uh... thanks for the science lesson professor, but if that were true, then why don't we look alike.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me. You know that the doctors have been trying to figure that out since we popped out of the womb.\" Jon quickly replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was convinced that his friend actually believed they were born sharing a body. He knew his friend was not joking, not about that. The directions were at least somewhat accurate, as he remembered reading that only people holding the remote would be aware of any changes. But, he still did not understand why the remote seemed to only partially merge him and Jon together. The directions sounded as if the two people would be completely fused together, but clearly this was not the case. \"Look Jon, this is going to sound strange, but we are not conjoined twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Mike...\" Jon looked down at the floor, as if he was resourceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Mike asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom told me that I was adopted.\" Jon replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed, \"No, I am serious. The remote fused us together.\" He held the remote in front of them both. \"One moment, we were testing what the remote would do, and the next, it fused us together. I had thought it would make us... one person, I guess. But, this is apparently what it does; makes two people share one body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your starting to scare me now bro. Can you please drop this?\" Jon said, worry etched on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me. Hold onto the remote with me, and I'll defuse us.\" Mike said. After a few moments, Jon hesitantly grabbed a hold on the remote. A familiar white light engulfed them when Mike pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were separated and facing each other once again. \"Wow... I remember.\" Jon said as he let go of the remote. \"That is... trippy.\" He looked at both of his hands, as if surprised he could move them both. \"We have to try that again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Right now... but what about class?\" Mike questioned. English was not his favorite period of the day, but at the same time, he did not want to be marked as tardy, or absent. He remembered the few brief moments he spent as half of a conjoined twin pair. While they seemed to have one complete body, they had to share that one body. Their individuals heads were attached to the top of their joint shoulders, seemingly splitting their single body in half. Mike controlled the left half, and his friend controlled the right half. He was not eager in learning how to move with Jon in that shared body. He imagined them arguing in the bathroom, falling onto the germ-covered floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about class?\" Jon answered Mike's question with his own. After Mike stared at him expectantly, he continued, \"So we'll be a little late. Its not like you have perfect attendance.\" He brushed a few strands of his red hair away from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but my attendance record is far better.\" Mike argued. While he was occasional marked tardy, his red-head friend was often marked late, especially for their first period. His friend was no early riser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a compromise then?\" Jon smiled. Mike could see the gears working behind his friend's eyes. \"No one will know that something happened if they don't touch the remote, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question seemed rhetorical, so Mike did not answer, but his friend's logic seemed sound. Even though they were sharing a body, Jon had thought that they were born stuck together since he had not been touching the remote when it activated. When Mike used the remote to separate them, the ginger remembered the remote being used. His train of thought suddenly brought a question to mind. Did his friend still remember their conjoined twin life? He decided not to ask at that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon continued, \"Solution, we just need to both touch the remote when we use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That solves one problem.\" Mike conceded. \"But then we'll be sharing one body, a single body for the two of us...\" He paused to see if his friend would understand his concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the point?\" Jon asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed. \"Yeah, but then you will only be controlling our right half, while I will only be able to move our left half.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I hadn't really thought about that part.\" Jon frowned. He could tell that his friend was trying to figure out some solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his friend could state some answer, Mike interjected. \"Do you remember being a conjoined twin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-head's brows were pressed together in thought, but Mike's question distracted him. \"Not really, just bits and pieces. The remote seemed to wipe most of those memories away even though I pressed the button with you. What about you though? Do you have any memories of being my conjoined fraternal twin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook his head. \"Not a one.\" He realized that neither he nor his friend knew much about this device. In his mind, he reviewed what little he did know. It seemed to alter memories of those not physically touching it, like it tried to accommodate whatever fusion occurred. The individual or individuals involved in the fusion would seemingly not have to worry about being discovered. The de-fuse button seemed to undo all fusions and remove all memories associated with the merge, even if one of those people used the remote. Mike reasoned that it was some kind of built-in failsafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then wondered why the remote placed memories of being a conjoined twin into his friend's mind, and supposedly everyone else's minds. That did not seem like the best cover story. For one, he knew conjoined twins were always identical, so it was highly irregular to have two non-identical, not even related, people be conjoined twins. Second, he did not have any memories of being a conjoined twin, and all of the motor-muscle memory that went along with it. Mike thought that the 'back story' might change depending if one or both individuals were aware of the fusion. That made him curious enough of using the remote again, at least to just find that part out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we both stand by one of our desks; there will be less distance we need to cover that way. Even we should be able to coordinate enough to sit down.\" Jon spoke up, his face smiling like he'd just figured out how to solve a math problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Should work well enough.\" Mike nodded. He checked his watch. They had spent too much time talking. \"Class is about to start!\" He through his backpack on, and left the bathroom with his friend just behind him. He clutched the remote in one hand, as he walked into class. The late bell not having rung yet. Some of the class were finding their seats, while others were talking in small groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was about to put his bag near the front row, but he saw his friend making his way to the back. He sighed. Mike liked sitting near the front, but his friend always preferred the back. If they were going to fuse together during class, they both physically could not get what they wanted. Mike threw his bag over one shoulder and joined Jon in the back row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Jon whispered eagerly. He had one strap of his backpack through the opposite arm still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smiled, even though he was not able to sit where he had wanted. He figured that it was for the best to be in the back of the class for the first time they did this. \"Yeah, lets do this.\" He whispered back as he held the remote within reach of his friend. Jon wrapped his right hand around the remote and over Mike's left hand. The remote was pointed between them this time as Jon pressed the fuse button. There was a familiar flash of light that engulfed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Mike noticed was that his classmates seemed unfazed by the sudden bright light. Their conversations continued, uninterrupted. The second thing he noticed was that he was wearing the same purple-black plaid shirt from before, and that Jon's hand was still holding onto the remote, over his own. Mike turned toward the right to see his friend's smiling face beside his own. He could tell, by the look in his friend's eyes, that Jon was equally as astonished as he was. Jon did not have any new memories implanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is trippy.\" He whispered. His friend let go of the remote and stared at his hand, as if trying to see if it had changed. It was the same pasty-white that his friend always had. It contrasted Mike's tanned left hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike did not have time to really consider their two different skin tones last time. He reasoned that their bodies were now fused together, down the middle. Their own 'half' of the body was from their previously separate bodies. That revelation make Mike wonder what they looked like under their clothes, but since they were in class, it would have been frowned upon to take off their shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to shift his backpack off his shoulder, but quickly realized that his backpack was not his own. One strap was around his shoulder, while the other strap was around Jon's shoulder. \"Stop staring at your hand, and help me take our backpack off.\" He emphasized 'our' to grab his friend's attention. It took several moments to coordinate shifting the straps off, but they managed to place the backpack down by their desk. Unlike how their body appeared to be half and half, the bag was a composite of their previous separate ones, like the clothes they were wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnceremoniously, they half-fell into the chair of their desk. Jon had been right in suggesting to fuse together by their desk. It was surprisingly difficult coordinating their two separate sides, especially since neither had sensation of their opposite half. It was like they really were two half-bodies stitched together. Thankfully, no one seemed to notice them struggling. Mike carefully placed the remote in one of the side pockets, keeping it hidden from the class. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Mike closed up the side pouch of their backpack, an unfamiliar woman spoke, gaining the classes attention. \"Hi everyone, I am Ms. Wilson, your substitute teacher.\" To Mike, their substitute teacher seemed young, perhaps still her in graduate program. \"I will take roll, and then we will begin.\" The teacher carefully went down the list of names, surprisingly saying the uncommon surnames correctly. \"Hunter, Michael.\" she called his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Mike replied. The substitute teacher did not look up as she marked him present and continued down the list. Since his friend's name was not called before or right after his, he guessed that they were not considered conjoined twins in this version of reality. He wondered that since both himself and Jon were holding on the remote, the reality altering effect made their circumstance seem believable in another way. Though, he was not sure what that could have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then called his friend's name, \"Mills, Jonathan.\" Before the red-head could respond, the class giggled as if there was an inside joke. \"What is so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ms. Wilson...\" one of the girls, whom Mike knew as Stephanie, answered. \"Your new so you did not know, but Mr. Schmidt usually skips Jon's name if Mike is here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike could suddenly feel heat rising from Jonathan's cheeks. He knew his friend was just as embarrassed as he was, though his face did not show it nearly as much. He was unsure why everyone would think it was funny if Jon's name was called, but then Mike realized the obvious. If he was present, there was no way that his friend could not be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he do that?\" Ms. Wilson questioned. \"Where are Michael and Jonathan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael shared a knowing glance with Jonathan before they slowly stood up from their desk. \"Sorry Ms. Wilson. You probably didn't notice our condition... since we're in the back.\" Jon stated. His friend's voice seemed steady in spite of the red spread across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Ms. Wilson stared at the two of them. Mike knew that she wanted to ask them questions, which neither of them technically had answers for. Thankfully, she was professional enough to move on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Jon sat back down, keeping their heads low. \"Well that was embarrassing.\" Jon spoke just loud enough so that only Mike could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you have to admit that it was kinda funny.\" Mike whispered back. \"You can't be anywhere that I'm not. So, it would be ridiculous for the teacher to call your name if I was already here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay yeah, it was little funny.\" Jon whispered back, a faint smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you notice though... our last names weren't changed. Maybe we aren't twins now.\" Mike stated. He would have tried to talk further, but the teacher was beginning a review of the current book the class was reading. He needed to focus on the discussion to take notes, since his other half refused to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than halfway through the period, the substitute handed out a short worksheet. \"Alright everyone. Find a partner to work with this on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smiled at his friend. \"Guess you're my built-in partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man...\" Jon smirked. \"I wanted to sit with Stephanie. Sometimes you really just hold me back.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other class members paired off, the two of them began working on the handout, with Mike taking the notes. Just before the bell rang, the teacher asked for all of the worksheets to be turned back in, and dismissed them from class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since no one is the wiser about us... do you want to finish the day, stuck side-by-side?\" Jon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... PE is next. How are we going to participate?\" Mike questioned. He was not against trying to stick the day out as they were, but they had yet to try moving around in their joint body. </span></div></div>",

The next moment, Mike can see that Marisa had transform into a photosphere and flow into his body. The next second, his body had glowing up and starting to transform. Slowly, Mike had shrinking of height from his original to 5'5 as the average height between himself and Marisa. His dark short hair had grow longer into neck length and gaining Marisa's curly and soft tactual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had changed into the combination of himself and Marisa, his penis vanished from his groin surface and replaced with Marisa's labia. His balls had sucks into his body and stay at the place of where ovaries should be (Which means he still producing sperms). His ass grow wider a bit and his stomach move inner to give himself a slightly feminine curve. Both his hands and feet changed to be smaller and also his arms and legs to be slimmer and weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the end of the change, Mike gains Marisa's B-cup breasts on his newly hairless chest. Mike had lost all his body hair before the change proceed toward his clothes. His sneakers had merged with Marisa's heels which changed his sneakers to girly formed with 3 inch heels (Marisa is wearing a pair of black colored 3 inch heels). His jeans had changed to knee length jeans skirt after merging with Marisa's ankle length white skirt. His grey hoodie changed into a black buttons hoodie in the middle as it merged with Marisa's black blouse. Now Mike is wearing Marisa's black laced bra and panties instead of his old boxer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the glowing light gone, all his clothes changed to match his current body shape. As the merging complete, Mike found out that he is now standing in front of his classroom while Marisa's place is now empty. He smiled and walks toward Marisa's place and sit down. It is weird for himself to walk with heels and skirt, it is lucky for him that no one is noticing the merging process and think that he is normal like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mike settle down himself, his best friend, Jon comes into the classroom and found him. Jon looks at him and says, \"___, I need you to come help me with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Jon calling Mike?</span></div></div>",

Needless to say, he ends up getting into all kinds of crazy situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>How the Remote Works</b><br>\r\nThe Fuse button - fuses two people together<br>\r\nTo fuse two people together:<br>\r\n1. Select first target<br>\r\n2. Select second target<br>\r\n3. Press Fuse button<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe De-Fuse button - splits a fused person back into the original two people<br>\r\nHas no effect on normal people<br>\r\nTo de-fuse a fused person<br>\r\n1. Select target<br>\r\n2. Press De-Fuse button<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Reset button - undoes all fusions<br>\r\nOnly works once a day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the exception of the reset button, the remote only works on targets within visual range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote can also fuse people with inanimate objects and animals but this may cause unexpected results<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly people holding the remote are aware of changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This story stands on its own, but it is also the third part in a series of loosely related interactive stories that share the same universe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules and Stuff</b><br>\r\n1.<span class=\"clred\"> Please try to use good spelling and grammar</span>. If you make a few mistakes, don't worry I'll fix them.<br>\r\n2. <span class=\"clred\">Please write in the third person perspective and the past tense</span> for consistency's sake.<br>\r\n3. <span class=\"clred\">Please try to avoid adding one sentence chapters</span>. These are okay in the beginning to start the story, but once it's going these sorts of chapters are annoying.<br>\r\n4. Generic list of don'ts: don't kill characters, don't drastically change character's personalities, don't add additional buttons, stuff like that. Pretty easy.<br>\r\n5.
