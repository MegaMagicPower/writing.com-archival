You met many amazing heroic spirits who later joined you as servants, and corrected multiple singularities, getting closer to the goal of preventing the incineration of humanity of coming through. Throughout it all however, you have kept one thing secret... that being your foot fetish. You never had any chance to really indulge in it during your life before joining Chaldea, and even after that things have been so hectic that you weren't exactly able to do so. Nonetheless, constant influx of attractive female servants, some of which wore rather revealing footwear was certainly making you think about your secret more and more. Maybe you should tell someone before your fetish goes out of control and you lose focus during some important battle? Or maybe keep it a secret, as knowing certain servants, they would undoubtedly use it to tease you relentlessly if they found out... your thinking here however is interrupted by a sudden voice outside the door to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai, are you here?\" Asks familiar voice of your loyal kouhai Mashu Kyrielight<br>\r\n\"Yeah, did something happen?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, I was just checking because you weren't in cafeteria this morning.\" Mashu explained from behind the door, probably unsure if you were dressed already and wanting to avoid awkward situation<br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought it was still morning...\" You mumbled, after all you woke up only recently<br>\r\n\"It's already noon! But I guess it's understandable for you to sleep late after we came back from the singularity yesterday... anyway, Da Vinci called me to her workshop so I have to go. See you later, senpai!\" Said Mashu and you could hear her steps going away from your door afterwards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, sounds like it's about time you got up then. You prepare your usual uniform, and take a look at yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\nYou are...</span></div></div>",

As you were making your way there, you saw Mordred(<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/b4idQa1\">Pics just in case</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/b4idQa1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>) going in the same direction.<br>\r\n\"Hey Master! Going to the simulation room? I'm about to go there myself so feel free to come by, and see me kicking some ass! I'm gonna show you I'm better than that pathetic version of me you saw serving Lion King in that singularity once! It pisses me off I couldn't be there to beat some sense into my other self.\" The blonde tomboy knight said with her usual grin when she noticed you<br>\r\nDespite being known as the knight of betrayal, you didn't really consider Mordred untrustworthy, even if she was a bit hotheaded and short-tempered, you had no doubt about her being loyal to you as her master, even if she probably would have trouble admitting it out loud.<br>\r\nYou replied that you will think about coming to check on her training... <br>\r\n\"What, you got anything better to do?\" Mordred tried to sound annoyed, but there was also hint of disappointment in her tone<br>\r\n\"Well anyway, I better get my ass over there before someone takes my spot in the simulator! See ya Master!\" Mordred said before you could reply to her earlier question and quickly went ahead towards the simulation room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Mordred disappeared from your sight, you felt a presence appearing behind you.<br>\r\n\"Master! Have you seen a saber coming this way? I'm sure I saw one of them just now going in this direction!\" Said a familiar voice, quite obviously belonging to Mysterious Heroine X(<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/nPENTVm\">Pics just in case</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/nPENTVm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>)<br>\r\nShe presumably meant Mordred... for whatever reason Mysterious Heroine X had a big grudge against all saber class servants, especially ones with particular faces... similar to her own in fact. She certainly was a bit unpredictable and random one... but seemed to mean well despite that.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... no.\" You decided to lie, it wouldn't be good if MHX decided to start bothering Mordred all of a sudden, especially given her similarity to certain someone...<br>\r\n\"Damn, she must have realized I was there, at times like these I wish I had Presence Concealment skill like the Assassin class.\" The girl in a blue hat said with annoyance<br>\r\nShe technically was an assassin even if she didn't have that skill... but you didn't want to start an argument with her about that.<br>\r\n\"I will be on my way then! That saber couldn't have escaped far!\" Mysterious Heroine said as she ran off somewhere... perhaps following her and making sure she doesn't cause trouble would be a good idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment however you decided to just get on your way towards the simulator room, finally arriving to the door leading to it without further interruptions. Just as you were about to enter however...<br>\r\n\"\u00a1Hola! Are you going to the simulator Master?\" A cheerful energetic female voice sounded behind you, there was only one person it could belong to, and sure enough, once you turned around you saw Quetzalcoatl(<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/2G6wu4B\">Pics just in case</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/2G6wu4B\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>), the tall lucha-loving goddess herself.<br>\r\nDespite her goddess status she was probably one of the nicest servants in Chaldea... although she could be rather terrifying when angered, fortunately she wasn't usually angry at you.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, are you going there too?\" You asked<br>\r\n\"\u00a1Si! I need to keep up my lucha skills! Would you like to train with me master? It's always better to do it against a real opponent! Don't worry, big sis will take it easy on you, yes!\" The tall enthusiastic goddess said, and it didn't seem like she was going to give up easily...<br>\r\nYou remembered last time Quetzalcoatl got you to practice with her... your bones hurt for entire next week. On top of that during practice you were having hard time not staring at her open-toed shoes, which were always showing you the sexy long toes of the goddess adorned with green toenail polish... nonetheless it wasn't time to think about that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you could use Mordred's earlier request to watch her training to excuse yourself though? Eventually you could follow your earlier hunch about following Mysterious Heroine X from causing any trouble in Chaldea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly excusing yourself from the lucha training with this, you finally entered the Simulation Room, and asked the staff to let you join Mordred's simulation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself on a grassy field, a group of what seemed like barbarians of some sort running near your location. Looking at their destination you finally spotted the tomboyish knight herself, standing in her heavy armor with Clarent(Her sword) prepared.<br>\r\n\"Huh? So you decided to come and look after all, Master? Then watch how I shred those bastards into pieces now!\" She seemed to have noticed you, and while she didn't say it out loud, having you watch certainly seemed to get her fired up for the training some more as she ran in the midst of the enemies outnumbering her, and skillfully started to take them down one by one, their strikes barely making dents in her armor. Her fighting style while brutal and not exactly elegant, was certainly a perfect fit for her, as Mordred seemed to do great with it in chaos of the battle.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nTwo hours later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent quite a while watching Mordred train, sometimes helping her out with your skills to improve your teamwork during singularities. Finally both of you sat under a tree, wanting to rest.<br>\r\n\"Whew, I think I've beaten my record there today! Told ya I would kick some ass Master!\" Mordred said smugly right after sitting down, once she took her armor off, and revealed her casual outfit underneath(She can pretty much make her heavy armor appear at will for the battles)<br>\r\n\"Yeah, awesome job today, wouldn't want to be our enemies in the next singularity.\" Your replied, taking a seat nearby as well, even if you didn't fight directly it was still rather tiring for someone like you.<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah! They are gonna see what I can do when I'm not some Lion King's lapdog!\" She replied, clearly glad to hear your agreement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta remember next time to tell the guys here to set the weather to rain or something... this is just a simulation, but it's hot in here like in real damn summer! Not that it can hurt me as a servant, but it's still a pain to deal with!\" Mordred said, and all of a sudden started kicking off her boots! Your eyes suddenly became glued to the female knight's legs as one of the black short boots came off...<br>\r\nYou never seen Mordred's bare feet before, and certainly didn't expect her to care for them too much given her tomboyish attitude and aversion to being treated too girly. However to your surprise even despite that, her feet looked extremely pretty... although due to not wearing socks, it seemed like she got herself a bit sweaty, not that it bothered you as otherwise her feet seemed perfectly clean... with smooth soles, and dainty slender toes(Obviously unpainted) which Mordred was now spreading to enjoy the fresh air between them, unknowingly giving you a nice show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Master? Is there something on my feet? And don't you dare tell me it's rude to go barefoot like that or something, I worked my butt off and want to relax a bit.\" Said Mordred, as expected, rather clueless of the actual perverted reasons for your staring... as far as you know Mordred had no interest in romance or lewd stuff in her life(Presumably due to just like Artoria having to pretend to be a male throughout it), and that didn't change for her as a servant, so naturally she wouldn't know about such a thing as foot fetish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Mordred seems to be waiting for your answer... do you trust her to tell her about your foot fetish? Or is it better to come up with an excuse that might let you touch her feet for a bit?</span></div></div>",

My feet make you feel so good, right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unconsciously placed your hands on her feet. They were incredibly soft, like velvet robes.

I just hope this interactive won't be locked once my membership runs out... but anyway, here are some rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cred\">RULES</span></font></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">1. No male feet, I know FGO has plenty of husbandos too... but it's not really my thing. Astolfo(I mean he pretty much looks completely like a girl) and Chevalier d'Eon(Who just kinda can change gender at will) ARE EXCEPTIONS FROM THIS RULE.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">2. No single sentence chapters, I will be deleting those.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">3. I don't expect grammatical perfection, but if someone posts a wall of text without any commas or dots, it will be deleted too.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">4. Please try to keep everyone in-character. I noticed a lot of people, especially those into more harsh femdom, tend to write all female characters as the same sadistic bitch over and over...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">5. No extreme fetishes like scat, snuff, toilet stuff, and such.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">6. Avoid shrinking and giantess stuff, there's already dedicated FGO interactive for that on the site.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">7. Tickling is allowed, though focus on the feet please.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">8. Story is 18+ so feel free to go as lewd as you want(With exception of extreme stuff mentioned above of course...)! It doesn't have to be just about foot fetish and footjobs, normal sex, or a BJ is very much welcome too!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be all!<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><br>\r\nHave fun reading and writing!</font></div></td>",
