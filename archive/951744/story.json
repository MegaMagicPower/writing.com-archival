You decide to use it on your potted plants, since they weren't growing well. You walk down the street, but suddenly trip on a crack of the sidewalk. \"Oh, no!\" You cry as the bottle flies out of your hand and lands, breaking on top of a head of a passing boy wearing a bandana. The contents run down his face and clothes and he groans. He swears and starts to find something in his pocket to wipe off the formula, but then you see his body tremble and grow! At least 50 ft! You gape at his inhumanly size. Luckly, no one was outside, for it was too hot. The boy looks down at himself in shock, then sees you. He glares and raises his humongous sneaker, preparing to step on you. What do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let me help and if I can't get you back to normal size, you...can squish me.\" The boy stares hard at you, determing wheither or not to stomp on you. Then after awhile, he lowers his foot to the ground. \"If you screw up, even once, you're dead,\" the boy warns. You gulp. \"O.K.\" \"So, what do we do?\" he asks. \"First, we head to the Magic Shop to see if the shopkeeper has any size reducing formula.\" You start to walk, but after a few seconds, you turn around and see him standing there, studying you. \"Come on,\" you say.

Finally, you both reach the Magic Shop and you let out a startled cry. \"What's wrong?\" the boy asks. \"The Magic Shop is closed!\" you exclaim. You look up at the boy. You can't tell what his expression is, not because you couldn't see it, but because it's expressionless. \"I guess you can step on me now that I screwed up,\" you say, sadly. You close my eyes, ready to feel pain, but you don't. \"I'm not going to step on you,\" you hear him say. \"You're not?\" you ask, opening your eyes and looking up at him. \"No,\" he replies, calmly. \"We can try again tomorrow.\" \"Yeah,\" you say, relieved. \"But you need a place to stay until the magic shop opens and you can't go back home. Your parents would freak out!\" The boy just looks at you. \"But,\" you say, getting an idea. \"You can stay at my house. My dad has a huge shed that should be big enough for you to stay in for the night.\" \"I am not staying in a shed,\" the boy says. \"Where else are you gonna stay?\" you ask, exasperated. \"You can't hang around here and you can't go home. The ony choice is to come with me unless you want to be captured, called a freak, and be put in a zoo for freaks and weirdos and that wouldn't be good.\" The boy slightly chuckles. You realize how good he looks with a smile. \"So, are you coming with me or not?\" you ask. The boy nods. \"Yeah.\" You smile. \"Let's go!\" you start to walk again and the boy follows. \"By the way,\" you say. \"What's your name?\" \"Kouji,\" he simply states. \"I'm(your name),\" you say. \"I would shake your hand, but...you know.\" Kouji doesn't reply. By this time, night has fallen. You take a shortcut to avoid anybody that may be outside this time of night. Finally, you reach your dad's shed. You open the door and Kouji goes in and sits down. \"My dad is planning to put his old junk in here whenever he finishes working on the new table,\" you tell him. \"Hopefully, we can get you out of here before he or anybody else sees you. If you need anything, don't hesitiate to ask.\" You turn to leave, but Kouji stops you. \"What is it?\" you ask. \"Thanks,\" he says. \"For helping me.\" \"You're welcome,\" you reply, smiling warmly. \"Good night, Kouji.\" Then you shut the shed door.<br>\r\nThe night air is warm, so you don't have to worry about Kouji being cold.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shower quickly, get dressed, race out the back door to the shed, and open it. Kouji looks up and over at you. \"'Morning,\" you say, cheerily. \"How'd you sleep?\" \"Fine,\" he replies, followed by a yawn. \"We've got to get to the Magic Shop before anyone sees you,\" you say. \"Isn't it a little early to be going to the Shop?\" Kouji asks. \"The eariler, the better,\" you reply. \"Besides, the Magic Shop opens early on Saturday.\" Kouji doesn't move. \"Do you want to stay a giant forever?!\" you demand. Kouji shoots a glare in your direction, but gets up. You growl and head out the shed followed by Kouji, feet trembling the ground as he exits the shed. You both head back to the Magic Shop. Through the window, you can see the shopkeeper aranging a few items. You look up at Kouji. \"Stay out here,\" you tell him. \"I'm gonna go talk to the shopkeeper.\" \"What am I supposed to do if someone sees me?\" Kouji demands. \"It's early,\" you reply. \"I'm sure no one is up at this hour, but if you do see someone walk by, hide.\" \"Hide where, genius?\" he asks, sarcastically. \"Behind a building or something tall!\" you exclaim. \"Something that will hide you!\" Kouji stares at you as if you are crazy. \"Just stay here,\" you mutter and go into the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings as you enter. The shopkeeper looks up from placing tarot cards on a shelf. She's a young woman with long, brown hair tied into a ponytail and green eyes. \"Oh, hello, dear,\" she says, smiling cheerfully. \"Back so soon?\" You nod. \"Uh...you know that growth formula I bought from you yesterday that you said could make anything grow?\" \"Yes,\" the shopkeeper answers. \"You said you were going to use it on your plants. Are they growing well?\" \"Well...\" you say, pausing. \"It wasn't plants that I used it on...in fact, I didn't get a chance to use it at all.\" The shopkeeper looks at you confusingly. \"What are you saying?\" \"I'd rather show you instead of telling you,\" you reply. You walk to the door and look back. The woman eyes you suspiciously, but follows you outside. She looks around and her eyes stop on Kouji's big sneakers. Her eyes trail all the way up to his face and she gasps in horror. \"Oh, my! What happened?!\" You explain the what happen to her. \"Do you have any growth reducing formula that will shrink him down?\" \"I'm sorry, but I'm out,\" the woman says. \"You can either wait until the new shipment arrives the day after tomorrow or wait until growth formula wears off.\" \"The formula wears off?!\" You exclaim. \"Yes,\" the shopkeeper says. \"After about 24 hours, then he will shrink back down to his normal size. Did I forget to tell you? I'm so forgetful at times.\" She laughs. You want to strangle her so badly. Why didn't she tell you BEFORE you bought the stuff?! \"I can't wait until the day after tomorrow so, we'll wait until the stuff wears off,\" you say, sighing. \"Thank you for your help.\" You start to walk away and Kouji follows. \"Come back soon!\" you hear the woman call.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look up at him. \"Kouji?\" \"Huh?\" he says, snapping out of his daze. \"Oh, yeah.\" \"You should be happy,\" you say. \"I am,\" Kouji replies. \"I was just thinking.\" \"About what?\" you ask. \"It's not important,\" Kouji replies, wanting to drop the subject. You get ready to protest, but you then hear kids shouting. You race forward to see what the comotion is. Kids are playing soccer on the lower field. The ground trembles and you glimpse Kouji's sneakers beside you. You continue watching the game and after 5 minutes, a boy with a backwards hat and square goggles scores a goal. Kids on his team cheer, while the other team boos. The goggle boy slaps high-fives to his teammates and shakes hands with the other team. Then they go separate ways and the boy with the goggles heads your way. \"Oh, no!\" you exclaim. \"You gotta hide! Fast!\" \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Kouji says. \"Do you know what'll happen if people see you?!\" you cry. Kouji doesn't answer. He just watches the boy make his way up the small hill. When the boy reaches you both, he smiles at you, but it fades as he glimpses Kouji's big sneakers. He looks up and sees Kouji and gapes in horror. \"K---K---Kouji?!\" he says, shocked. \"Hey, Takuya,\" Kouji says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I promise.\" Kouji looks back at you. You see his eyes soften a little. After a few minutes, he closes his eyes and sighs. \"All right.

Soon, you all reach the cave and he puts you both down gently. \"Well, Kouji, this looks good enough for you to stay in,\" you say.\"For the time being.\" Kouji glares at you.

He sighs. \"Whatever.\" He sits down on the cave floor. \"Don't worry,\" Takuya says. \"You'll be back to your grumpy normal sized self again soon.\" Kouji shoot a glare in Takuya's direction.

Kouji had shrunk down to his regular size during the night. \"No!\" Zin exclaims. \"This isn't possible!\" Kouji smirks. \"How did you shrink down again?!\" Zin demands.  \"The magic growth formula wore off,\" Kouji replies. \"Magic Growth Formula?!\" Zin yells. He grabs Kouji by the collar of his windbreaker. \"Where did you get that magic growth formula from?!\" he demands. \"I didn't,\" Kouji replies. \"And I'm not telling you where.\" \"You'd better tell me, you little brat!\" Zin growls, tightening his grip on Kouji's windbreaker. Suddenly, they hear sounds of laughter, shouts, and cries of kids and adults. \"Looks like the tourists are here,\" Kouji says, still smirking. Zin gasps and lets go of Kouji's winbreaker. He runs to the gates. The crowd seems to be growing impatient. \"Uh, sorry folks, but the zoo's closed,\" Zin says, quickly. \"Your pamphlet doesn't say anything about closing on Saturday,\" a woman replies. \"National holiday today,\" Zin replies. \"There IS no national holiday today!\" a young boy shouts. \"I WANNA SEE THE BIG, BIG KID!!!\" a little girl screams. The tourists angrily yell at Zin. Beads of sweat run down his face. A fat man pushes through the crowd and rams the gates, breaking the lock. The other tourists bump into Zin, knocking him down. The step on him, rushing to Kouji's cage. When they get there, they let out horrifyed gasps. \"Hey!\" a little boy cries. \"He shrunk down!\" \"What is this?!\"  a man yells. \"Some kind of joke?!\" \"He's just an ordinary kid!\" another person cries. \"I demand a refund!\" a woman shouts. \"Sorry, no refunds,\" Zin says, already near Kouji's cage. In reply, some people rush to him and start beating him up. Others rush around, tearing up the zoo. One of the freaks had, somehow, grabbed the keys to all the cages. He unlocks the door to Kouji's cage. \"You'd better get out of here before the destroy the whole place,\" he tells him. Kouji nods. \"Thanks.\" He starts to walk off but the man stops him. \"You need a lift back to Shibuya?\" he asks, holding up a set of keys. \"They belong to Zin's car.\" Kouji smirks. \"Sure.\"  As the man and Kouji head to Zin's car, Zin happens to see them leave. \"Hey!\" Zin hollers. \"Come back here!\" \"SHUT UP!\" the fat man yells, yanking Zin up by the collar of his shirt and throwing a punch in his face.</span></div></div>",

For the past few days, you didn't eat or sleep. Your parents became worried, but you convinced them you were all right, but, truthfully, you're not. You're tearing up inside. You've fallen in love with him and want to be with him. Back in the car, the man turns a corner and Kouji sees you walking down the street. \"Can you pull over?\" he asks. \"Why?\" the freak man asks. Kouji gazes at you in reply. The man follows his gaze and not saying another word, pulls over, letting Kouji get out. \"Good Luck, kid,\" the man says. Kouji shuts the car door and nods. \"Thanks.\" The man then drives off and Kouji runs to catch up to you. By then, you had stopped walking. \"I'd give anything to have Kouji back,\" you say, aloud. \"That can be arranged,\" a voice says, behind you. Startled, you whirl around and see Kouji. \"Kouji?\" you ask, feeling tears forming in your eyes again. \"Is it really you?\" Kouji smiles and hold out his arms. You fall into them, sobbing. \"Shhh,\" Kouji hushes, rubbing your back. \"I'm here now.\" After a few minutes, you stop crying and look up at him. Kouji leans in and places his lips on yours. You get nervous, but you relax as Kouji rubs your back and deepens the kiss(He could sense you were nervous.). Finally, Kouji stops and looks at you. You gaze into his beautiful blue eyes; they're hypnotic. At, least that's how they seem to you. \"I love you,\" you say. \"I know, silly,\" Kouji replies. \"What happened?\" you ask. \"I mean, after Zin took you away.\" \"It's a long story,\" Kouji replies. \"Please tell me,\" you beg. \"Maybe later,\" Kouji replies. \"Right now, I just want to concentrate on us.\" You nod. Then the two of you head to your house. There, you introduce him to your parents, who take a liking to him right away. Kouji introduces you to his parents and they like you, but the main thing is that Kouji is back with you and you couldn't ask for more or be any happier.</span></div></div>",

They're just glad he's safe and sound. That night, Kouji goes to bed and, sometime during the night, he has a dream. In it, he sees himself taller than a skyscraper and stomping through the city of Shibuya, while people scream and run away, panicky. When the dream ended, he realizes that it's morning and notices that he's grown in size! In fact, his feet and legs were hanging over the bottom of the bed! 'Oh, no!' Kouji thinks. 'I'm slowly becoming a giant again!' Right then and there, he decides to go to the magic shop, but first he needed to get out his room and get cleaned up, so he gets out of bed and hits his head on the ceiling. He curses under his breath and makes his way to his bedroom door. Turning the handle, the door opens and nearly breaks. Kouji curses again and makes sure his parents didn't hear the noise. Luckily, they didn't. He sighs and makes his way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Takuya decide to see how Kouji's doing, so you both head over to his house(Takuya had shown you how to get there.). Before you could ring the doorbell, Kouji emerges in his clothes that don't fit him right. Mainly because they were too small for him. \"Oh, my, goodness!\" you exclaim. \"What happened?! Kouji explains to you what happened. \"I'm heading back to the magic shop and talk to the shopkeeper,\" he finishes. \"I'll come with you,\" you reply. \"Me, too,\" Takuya says. \"Okay,\" Kouji says. With that said, the three of you head to the magic shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the magic shop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you all arrived at the magic shop, Kouji tells you to go and get the shopkeeper and bring her outside. You go in and tell her what happened and quick as a wink, she races outside to see Kouji grow another 2 feet in size. \"See?\" you say to her. \"I see...\" the woman replies, surprised. \"I don't understand. This isn't supposed to happen.\" \"What do you mean?\" Kouji demands. \"Well,\" the woman begins. \"Usually, after a few days, the formula's supposed to wear off when exposed to humans, but I've never seen THIS happen before!\" \"Well, what are we gonna do?\" you ask. \"I'll call the company that I bought the magic growth formula from and ask where the shipment of reducing formula is,\" the shopkeeper replies. \"I think it's the only thing that can return him to normal size now. In the meantime, you try to keep your friend hidden from other people. Havoc might break loose if they see him.\" You thank her, nod, and then walk off with Takuya and Kouji following. Where do you three go from here?</span></div></div>",

You all sigh and sith down on the swing set, Kouji tries to sit down on a bench but it breaks under his weight.

The important thing is that you tried to help me, even if we both didn't succeed in the end. So, stop crying, O.K.?\" \"O.K.,\" you reply, sniffing. \"But what do we do now?\" Kouji, gently, places you on his shoulder and sighs. \"Let's just go somewhere to think of a new plan.\" Kouji starts to walk away from the shop.

Tomoki, worriedly, looks up at Izumi. He knows what her temper is like from spending time with her in the Digital World, so he tries not to make her mad.

Takuya swears. \"If I hadn't screwed up, you wouldn't have to work for that creep!\" \"It's not your fault, Takuya,\" Kouji says. \"So, what are you going to do?\" Izumi asks. \"Work for him, I guess,\" you reply. \"There has to be some way you can get out of this!\" Izumi exclaims. \"How?\" you ask. You try to think of something, but you get nothing. \"I've got it!\" Takuya exclaims, snapping his fingers. \"Why don't we offer him something he can't resist?\" \"Like what?\" you ask. \"Zin is a business man.

Takuya nods. \"They sell magic tricks, formulas, potions, and other stuff and want to run Zin's company out of business.\" \"This may work,\" you say. \"What do you think, Kouji?\" \"Hmm,\" Kouji says. \"It's the only thing we've got, so I guess we can give it a try.\" Takuya grins. \"Cool.

You couldn't go out the front door because fire is burning on the other side and you know to never escape from a burning room using the door. You prepare to open the window sil(sp?) but stop, realizing that it's hot. You cough again and drop to your knees. 'Won't someone help me?' you think, weakly. The smoke is smothering you and you don't think you'll last another minute, but then you hear glass breaking and someone lifting you up, gently. A few seconds later, you're outside and you notice that you're lying in the palm of someone's hand. Kouji! He puts you on the ground, gently, and you cough and take deep breaths of the cool, night air. \"Are you okay?\" he asks, tenderly. \"Yeah...\" you manage to choke out. \"Kouji, you have to save my mom and dad...\" \"I know,\" he says and stands up. He makes his way around the house, trying to find your parent's room, but smoke covers every inch of the house, making it impossible to see anyone. Suddenly, you hear the sound of fire engines and Kouji's footsteps, quickly, making their way towards the back of the house where you are. \"Come on, we have to get out of here,\" Kouji tells you. \"Why?!\" you demand. \"What about my mom and dad?! You can't leave them in there!\" \"There was too much smoke,\" he replies. \"I couldn't see anything. I'm sorry, but they may already be gone...\" \"No!\" you exclaim, tears running down your cheeks. \"They can't be gone! They're alive! They have to be!\" Kouji picks you up and tries to comfort you. He wanted to save your parents. He really did, but he REALLY, REALLY wanted to save YOU because whether you know it or not, you're precious to him. And if you died, then he wouldn't be able to live with himself. Yep, Kouji Minamoto loves you. A lot. And he would do anything for you. Even go to the ends of the earth and back. \"Hello?\" A voice calls. \"Anyone back here?\" \"Let's go,\" Kouji whispers and placing you in his pocket, he quickly takes off.</span></div></div>",

Two minutes later, he comes around to where you are, still in his PJs and wearing slippers. \"What's going on?\" he asks, noticing your worried look. \"My house caught on fire and I have no place to live...\" you reply, breaking into sobs. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, (your name),\" Takuya replies, sadly. \"But what caused the fire?\" \"We don't know,\" Kouji replies, seeing that you're too choked up to speak. \"All I know is that I happened to smell smoke and realized a house was on fire. I came outside and noticed that it was (your name)'s house, so I had to get her out before she sufficated.\" \"What about her parents?\" Takuya asks. \"Are they okay?\" Kouji closes his eyes and shakes his head, sadly. \"I couldn't save them...\" he replies, softly. \"I couldn't see inside the house. The smoke had covered everything by the time I rescued (your name).\" \"Oh...\" Takuya says, quietly. \"I see.\" \"Can she stay here with you?\" Kouji asks. \"It's not safe for her to roam the streets by herself.\" \"I'll have to tell my mom, but yeah,\" Takuya replies. \"But what about YOU? It's not exactly safe for you to roam the streets, either.\" \"I'll be fine,\" Kouji replies. \"I'm going home, anyway. I want to see my parents and let them know I'm okay. If I explain the situation, I'm sure they'll help me out. Besides, it's night and no one is out at this hour.\" \"True,\" Takuya says, agreeing. \"Well, I'll see you later, then.\" Kouji nods and kneels down to you. \"(your name)?\" You look up at him, tears streaming down your face. \"Yes?\" you ask. \"I want you to know that...I love you...and that everything will be okay,\" Kouji says. You look at him with wide eyes. \"You...love me?\" Kouji nods. \"Yes. Ever since we first met...There's something about you that makes you so attractive to me...I don't know what it is...\" \"Kouji...?\" you say. \"I love you, too...\" Kouji smiles. \"I'm glad.\" You nearly melt at the sight of his smile. It is so beautiful, just like him. From a short distance, Takuya sighs. \"Ah, love. Isn't it grand?\" Kouji, quickly stands up and turns his head away, blushing madly. \"Stop it, Takuya,\" he says, sounding agitated. \"Hey, I wasn't making fun of you,\" Takuya replies, in defense. \"I thought that was really sweet.\" \"Hmph,\" Kouji says. \"Well, I'm going to bed,\" Takuya says and yawns again. \"Come on, (your name).\" He starts to walk to the front of his house. You look back at Kouji and he gives you a little smile. \"Go,\" he whispers. You smile back and take off after Takuya before he left you.

Takuya had woken up his mom last night and told her the bad news and she, sleepily, agreed to let you live with them. Now, on your way to the bathroom, you begin to wonder who started the fire. Once inside the bathroom, you do your business, shower, wrap a towel around you, and go back to Takuya's room.  There, you, surprisingly, find some clean clothes sitting on Takuya's bed. 'Hmm...' you think. 'Mrs. Kanbara must've laid these here.' You try them on and they, surprisingly, fit you. Just then, Takuya walks in. \"Good morning!\" he says, cheerily. \"Morning,\" you reply. \"I see you found the clothes my mom laid on my bed,\" he says. \"Mrs. Minamoto brought them for you. She knew you needed clothes, so she brought them over. There are some more in the closet downstairs.\" \"I'll have to thank her later,\" you say. Takuya starts towards the door. \"Come on. Breakfast is ready.\" \"Okay,\" you reply and follow him out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Takuya, Mrs. Kanbara, and Shinya all talk and have a few good laughs. Mr. Kanbara left for work early, so he didn't have time to eat. After breakfast, you decide to go outside to play. Takuya joins you, suggesting that you, he, and Shinya go to the park. Nodding, the three of you(Mrs. Kanbara told Shinya to turn off the video games and go out to play.) head over to the park. There, you and Takuya decide to play soccer along with some other kids. Frankly, you didn't know how to play soccer, but seeing it in action on TV, it couldn't be that bad. The game ended up in a tie, but that's okay because you, Takuya, and the other kids have fun. By that time, it was close to lunch time. Saying good-bye to the kids, you, Takuya, and Shinya(He watched you guys play.) all head home, but on the way, you run into the last person you wanted to see...Zin. Along with his henchmen. What do you do now?</span></div></div>",

Zin hands you a rolled up newspaper in reply. You take it and gasp at the heading of the front cover, along with the photos of you and Kouji.:\"Abnormally large kid spotted\". \"You published the pictures before Kouji and I could give you an answer!\" you cry, accusingly. \"Yeah, so?\" Zin replies. \"It's offically over 72 hours and when I say I'm gonna do something, I always do it. Face it, kid. You lose. Now you and Kouji are gonna have to work for me.\" You drop to your knees, sobbing. \"Oh, come on, it's not as bad as you think it is,\" Zin says, smirking. \"I promise to go easy on you both.\" Takuya comforts you by rubbing your back. \"I'm sorry, (your name),\" he whispers in your ear. Sniffing, you stand up after a few moments. \"Okay, Zin. I'll work for you, but I don't know about Kouji.\" \"Where is he anyway?\" Zin demands. \"At home,\" you reply. \"He went home to see his mom and dad.\" \"So, is he still a giant?\" Zin asks. \"As far as I know, yes,\" you reply. Zin smirks. \"Excellent.\" You feel like you want to throw up, seeing that smirk and all. Frankly, it's making you sick. You sigh. \"I still wish I knew who set my house on fire.\" Zin grins, as if almost proudly. \"I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what?!\" you stammer, in shock. \"I set your house on fire,\" Zin repeats. \"But why?!\" you demand. \"To make your life miserable,\" he replies. \"I knew you had deep affection for Kouji ever since seeing you for the first time at 'Dead Man's Cave'...and it makes me sick to see you with someone you cherish dearly. To be honest, I grew up alone. No one liked me and thought I was too mean, but I'm not really mean. My father used to beat me and he was very strict. A little too strict, but whatever. Anyway, since I can't kill your boyfriend, I decided to kill the next thing: your parents. Plus, profits were running low and I needed extra cash, so by you working for me, you raise the money bar sky high.\" \"You demented scum bag!\" you exclaim. \"How could you?!\" Zin laughs. \"You can call me your father now, since I'm the one that'll be taking care of you!\" You growl and prepare to sock him, but his henchmen stop you. Zin turns to his car and opens the side door. \"Get in.\" Sighing defeatedly, you get into his car and one of his henchmen shuts the door. Takuya runs up to car and shouts: \"No, (your name)!\" You could only give a sad look as Zin gets into the car(along with the henchmen) and drive off. Takuya curses under his breath. \"What do we do now?\" Shinya asks, after the car turns a corner. \"Let's go tell mom,\" Takuya replies and with that, both he and Shinya run home.</span></div></div>",

You turn and see that stupid smirk on his face again. \"Well, well, well,\" he says, gloating. \"It's time. You and (your name) both have to work for me now.

His parents would immediately take you in once they knew you had no place to go. The problem now is...how in the heck is he going to break it to his parents that he's bigger than a house? How's he even going to live in one, for that matter? Kouji sighs and takes you out of his pocket. \"What's the matter?\" you ask, worriedly. \"I'm just thinking,\" Kouji simply states. \"About what?\" you ask. \"About how I'm going to tell my parents that I'm too big to fit inside my own house,\" he replies. \"I'm sure they'll understand,\" you say, reassuringly. \"I hope you're right,\" Kouji replies.

Kouji takes a deep breath before telling his mom the entire story. All the way up to the part where he saves you from the fire in your house.

Besides, we need to keep you hidden until we find a way to fix this problem.\" \"I've been able to stay hidden before,\" Kouji replies. \"I know, dear,\" she replies. \"But we can't risk you getting into trouble. If people saw you, then who knows what may happen.\" Kouji sighs. \"I'll go down to the shop and talk to the keeper,\" she goes on. \"We might be able to find a solution to this problem.\" \"I already talked to her and she told me that the new shipment of reducing formula hasn't came in yet,\" you say. \"And she said that we'd have to wait 24 hours before the growth formula wears off,\" Kouji adds. \"And it's been over 24 hours...\" \"Well, maybe the shipment's in now,\" Mrs. Minamoto says. \"I'll go to her shop later and find out.

Your eyes droop and soon you're asleep. \"I love you, (your name),\" Kouji murmurs before falling asleep himself.

Once she's ready, she heads there by walking because, for one thing, the car is gone. Mr. Minamoto needed it to go to work early. On the way, she sees a little boy selling newspapers. Deciding to find out what's going on in today's news, she buys one from him and unfolds it to read. The headline from an article, on the front page, catches her eye: \"Local residence spotted large boy near ignited house on 7th Street\". The article goes on to say that an old man had seen an abnormally large child wearing a bandana near the house that you lived in. And had seen him run off seconds after the fire department came. It also states that others have seen the boy and YOU before the fire, at the magic shop, park, and other places you've both been to. Near the end of the last paragraph is a phone number for anyone that may have seen the \"large giant\" and pictures are shown of you and Kouji are underneath the headline. Mrs. Minamoto gasps. 'Kouji! I've got to warn him!' Forgetting about her trip to the magic shop, she quickly runs home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you're just waking up. You realize a blanket's covering you and that Kouji's still sleeping. 'Mrs. Minamoto must've put this around me,' you think, yawning. You prepare to stand up, but suddenly hear footsteps. Rapid ones, as if someone was running. Seconds later, you see Mrs. Minamoto running quickly to the back yard, her expression frightened. \"Mrs. Minamoto!\" you call. \"What's wrong?\" The young woman runs up to you with a look of anxiety and nervousness. \"Kouji may be in more danger than ever!\" she exclaims, breathing hard. \"Why? What's wrong?\" you ask, trying to calm the woman down. She hands you the newspaper in reply and wakes up Kouji to tell him the awful news. You unfold it and see the headline on the front page. You go on to read the article, your eyes widening in horror. \"Oh, my Goodness!\" you exclaim. \"We've been spotted!!\" Wide awake now, Kouji swears under his breath. \"Zin... He must've did this...\" \"You're partly right, Kouji,\" you say, looking up at him. \"because the pictures he took of you and me are in here. But it says that OTHER PEOPLE have seen you, so that means you'll be in trouble, if we don't do something to shrink you back to your normal size.\" Mrs. Minamoto sits on the steps, weeping. You walk over to comfort her. Gritting his teeth in anger, Kouji stands up and prepares to go to Zin to pay him back what he did. \"Kouji, where are you going?!\" Mrs. Minamoto demands. \"I'm gonna to do what I should've done a long time ago!\" he replies, furious. He takes off in a dead run. \"Kouji!\" Mrs. Minamoto exclaims, frantically. \"I think I know where he may be heading,\" you say. \"Come, we'll call my friend and ask her to give us a ride there,\" she says. She quickly leads you into the house.</span></div></div>",

It hasn't even been 72 hours, for God's Sake, and the man still had the nerve to do what he had planned to do as if you never made that agreement!

Mrs. Kanbara had left Takuya's little brother, Shinya, in the hands of a trusting neighbor. She had planned on leaving Takuya with the neighbor, but he had insisted that he go(He had finally told her what was going on, the night before.), also.

I told you I was going to do it and I never back out of what I intend to do.\" Kouji growls. \"Not to mention,\" he goes on. \"you've got several witnesses stating that they've seen you and your girlfriend. The pictures are just proof that there's a giant in the city. You've even been mentioned on the news and the police have found evidence, that belongs to that girl, on the ground and your footprints. Face it, kid. You lose. You're going to either be hauled away to some lab for testing or killed. And in the meantime, I'll keep the girl and become richer than I am now. Now that her parents are gone...\" \" Are you saying YOU set the fire and killed her parents?!\" Kouji demanded. \"You catch on quick,\" Zin replies, smirking. \"Yes, I did. What are you gonna do about it?\" Kouji growls loudly and prepares to grab the evil man, but the guards surrounding him set the triggers to their guns and he stops, giving the man a really cold glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the others arrive and see Kouji surrounded by guards and Zin looking up at him, smirking. \"Kouji!\" you and Takuya cry in unison.

He pushes the gurards away in one swipe and runs to Zin and you, grabbing and pulling him away from you. You cough and take deep breathes. \"Leave her alone,\" Kouji demands, icily. \"Let me go, you freak,\" Zin said. \"Yeah, that's right. I called you a freak and that's what you are, to me and soon the whole world...\" \"What?!\" Kouji demands. \"What do you mean?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"As we speak, millions of people are going to be tuning in to see 'Kouji the Giant' on TV all over the country and world,\" Zin explains. \"Tough luck, kid. You're screwed. I've called every news and TV reporter in the book and they want to see you for themselves. Think I'm lying? Look down.\" Obeyingly, Kouji looks down to see a crowd of news reporters, camera men, police officers, and ordinary people looking up at him. He could hear shouts of \"That giant kid has that poor man hostage\", \"What do we do?\", and \"He's gonna come after us next!\" \"If I were you, I'd put me down,\" Zin says. Kouji puts him down and stands up, slowly. The chief officer turns on a megaphone and says into it: \"Son, we don't want to hurt you, but you have to agree to come with us, so put your hands in the air slowly!\" \"Sir, we don't have handcuffs big enough for him,\" an officer says. \"We're not arresting him,\" the chief replies. \"We're taking him some place special.\" Kouji sighs and places his hands into the air. Suddenly, a guard shoots a large dart, hitting him square in the back. Kouji screams and collapes, the earth shaking the crowd slightly. \"KOUJI!!!\" you, Takuya, and Mrs. Minamoto scream. Police officers shoo away the crowd of people and news reporters and camera men, while the guards tie him up with large ropes. What happens next?

They inject him with all sorts of stuff and run all sorts of diagnostics on him. After the testing, they ask Kouji thousands of questions, wanting to know how he got so big, among other things. When they finish, they place him in a large dome. They plan to send him to outer space to see how'd he react there and on Mars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear on the news that \"the giant\" will be sent to space and to Mars. Devistated, you start to cry. You don't want Kouji on Mars. As for Mrs. Minamoto, she's crying her eyes out and Mr. Minamoto is comforting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 month later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji is taken to the rocket ship. Scientists had to build one large enough for him to fit in. Everyone, but you, is gathered around it, to see Kouji sent off. A few minutes later, you get out your parents' car and join the crowd. Moments later, you see Kouji walking towards the rocket ship, the earth shaking slightly. You couldn't tell what his expression is, but from what you've learned about him, it's probably angry and sad. You watch as Kouji reaches the ship and prepares to board it. With each step he takes, you get nervous. You couldn't stand the thought of losing Kouji. Not to mention, he couldn't survive on Mars. Then it hits you. They wanted to KILL him, not to see if he could survive on Mars! Those scientists just told the reporters and people that, so they wouldn't get too worked up! They think he's a threat to your country and they knew NOBODY could survive on Mars, not even Kouji! \"STOP!!!\" you scream and push your way through the crowd. You could hear you mom call your name, but you ignored her. You had to save Kouji! One police officer stops you. \"No one is allowed passed this point.\"  You see scientists urging Kouji to board the ship. \"NO!!!\" you scream at them. \"Kouji is innocent! You're trying to KILL him!\" Mrs. Minamoto, her husband, and Kouji's friends gasp in shock. They realize you were right and begin to rush towards Kouji and the ship, but are stopped by the police. \"No, don't send my son into space!\" Mrs. Minamoto cries, frantically. \"You want to kill him!\" you repeat. \"You think he's a threat to everyone, so you decided to send him to Mars! You lied to to the town of Shibuya and us!\" A scientist walks up to you. \"Very clever, little girl,\" he says. \"So, you figured it out. Yes, I plan to send the giant to outer space because he IS a threat to everyone in the city, country, and world.\" \"But he's not a threat!\" you exclaim. \"He's just an ordinary kid, like me!\" The scientist and a few others laugh. \"Really...Ordinary? A 50 foot gigantic child is an ordinary kid, you say. Well, if you say so...\" He turns back to Kouji and orders him to get on board. That idiot! He didn't listen to a word you said! \"NO!\" you cry as Kouji boards the ship, angrily. He wants to squash all of the scientists, but they told him if he causes a threat, the police would shoot and kill him on the spot. You sigh. \"Well, then, if Kouji's going to Mars, the so am I.\" The crowd gasps, while your parents', Kouji's parents and Kouji's friends say \"WHAT?!\" Your mom pushes past the crowd, runs up to you, and smacks you. \"What are you thinking?! You can't go into space with that giant! I won't allow it!\" You hold your cheek, but don't cry. \"Mom, I made a commitment to help Kouji and I'm gonna do it. Besides, he's my friend and I love him. A lot. I've had to go through a lot to protect him and I'm gonna stay with him until the end. So, I'm sorry, but I have to go...\" You push past your mom and the officer. Suddenly, the officer and more policemen pull out their guns and prepare to shoot, but the chief of police stops them. \"Let her go,\" he says. \"It sounds to me like she's in love with the kid and wants to be with him and I respect that.\" \"What?!\" your mom cries in shock. \"But she's only 11 years old!\" \"So is Kouji, but you're treating him as if he's an animal!\" Mrs. Minamoto cries, angrily. \"All of you! How DARE you treat my only son like he's some kind of object! How would you like it if your children were in the same predicament?!\" The crowd remains silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the rocket ship...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji could hear his mom yelling at the people. He's never heard her so angry and hysterical before. Suddenly, the door opens and you crawl inside and onto his shoulder. \"(your name), what are you doing in here?!\" he demands in shock. \"I'm going with you,\" you reply. \"I can't stand the thought of losing you, so if you're going to die on Mars, then so will I.\" Kouji sniffs, almost crying. 'What a girl,' he thinks. 'Risking her life to be with me.' Then it hits him. 'She loves me beyond friendship!' \"(your name)\", thanks...\" Kouji says, smiling. \"For what?\" \"For helping me.\" \"Even though, we both failed in the end, I'm sure glad I met you, Kouji,\" you say, happily. Kouji sighs, happily as the door is shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the rocket ship blasts off and into space. You have to hang onto Kouji's windbreaker, so that you wouldn't fall off of his shoulder. After a few moments, the rumbling stops and you both start floating. Thus, starts your journey to Mars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And it only took a month. Once on Mars, the ship's door opens automatically and you prepare for the worst. \"Let me go outside first,\" you say. \"I'm the smallest.\" Kouji doesn't reply, but does let you get off first. Nervously, you climb down Kouji's shoulder and leave the ship. You sniff and realize you can breathe. 'Air!' you think. 'There's air here!' You look up at the sky, which is blue, just like Earth's. You look down again and see domes surrounding large cities and a train track connected in between. \"Is it safe to come out?\" Kouji calls from inside the ship. \"Kouji!\" you cry, happily. \"Come out! It's safe to breathe and there are cities out here! That means people live here!\" \"Huh?\" you hear Kouji say. You turn to see him stepping out of the ship and his eyes go wide. She's right! he realizes. Unfortunately, you were wrong about Mars. Mars DOES have air and cities...and, surprisingly, people, too. Mars has been keeping this a secret, for if people of Earth knew there was life on Mars, they'd try to go and do God knows what there. For the first time since the trip, Kouji smiles. Maybe life on Mars won't be so bad after all. </span></div></div>",

Enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kouji explore Mars and run into some human-like people, who, immediately, take a liking to you and Kouji. They take you both to an underground laboratory, after you explain the whole story to them, and get right to work on shrinking Kouji back down to his normal size. They quickly make up an chemical that would shrink Kouji back down to his regular size instantly. These people were also scientists, but unlike Earth's scientists, they were more advanced...and friendly. Kouji drinks the potion and is instantly back to his ordinary size. Overjoyed, you throw your arms around Kouji and hug him, grateful he's back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we stay here or go back home?\" you ask as you both explore one of the cities. \"I think we should stay here,\" Kouji replies. \"I don't want to go back because one: Zin is there and he might try to go after us. And two: Mars and the natives are very peaceful here.\" \"Yeah,\" you say. \"But what about our friends and families?\" Kouji sighs. \"I don't know. I know you miss your mom and dad and I miss my parents, but I can't risk going back there now. It's too dangerous.\" You nod. \"You're right.\" Your stomach growls and Kouji chuckles. \"I'm hungry,\" you say. Kouji looks around to see if there were any restaurants and surprisingly finds one. He grabs your hand and pulls you across the street. Before you could say anything, Kouji points to the sign of the restaurant. It's an international restauraunt. That means Mars has Earth food and food from all over the planet, even Japan. You brighten and run inside the restaurant, dragging Kouji with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kouji had eaten all of your favorite foods and they all tasted really good. Better than Earth's, surprisingly. You ask a waitress what the bill is and she says it's free of charge, seeing that you and Kouji had no money. You both grin, thank her, and leave the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom and dad invites Mr. and Mrs Minamoto, Mr. and Mrs. Kanbara, Takuya, his friends, Shinya, and Kouichi over to visit and for some support. Your mom and Mrs. Minamoto cry their eyes out. Takuya, furiously, stands up. \"I can't stand it! I'm going to Mars, too!\" Izumi, Takuya and Kouji's friend, looks at him with anger and tears in her eyes. \"And what?  Die like them?! Don't be stupid, Takuya!\" \"I'm NOT!\" Takuya argues. \"But I can't sit around here, moping! I'm going to 'Shibuya Laboratories' and demand that they send me to Mars, too! Besides, I'll be wearing a spacesuit, so don't worry.\" \"If Takky is going, then so am I,\" Takuya's friend, Junpei says. \"If we can survive the Digital World, then we can survive Mars.\" \"Junpei!\" Izumi cries, in shock. \"Not you too!\" \"I wanna go, too,\" A young boy names Tomoki says. \"Maybe there's life on Mars and Kouji and (your name) are alive.\" \"Tomoki, don't be silly,\" Your mom says. \"No one can survive Mars. It's a known fact.\" \"He could be right,\" Junpei says. \"I read an article about the possibility of life on Mars. Those people were very serious about it and they're trying to prove that there's life on Mars and other planets.\" \"Where'd you read that, in some kind of weirdo magazine?\" Izumi says, dryly. \"I don't believe there's life on Mars.\" Kouichi stands up and sighs. \"Junpei's story seems highly illogical, but it may be true. I mean, if there are magic potions that shrink and grow people and factories that make them here on Earth, then there has to be life on Mars.\" Izumi groans, loudly. \"Am I the only one thinking rationally around here?!\" Your mom and dad, Mr. and Mrs. Kanbara, Mr. and Mrs. Minamoto all laugh.  \"So, can we go?\" Takuya asks his mom and dad. Mr. Kanbara sighs. \"It's not a good idea, but I'll let you go under one condition...\" Mrs. Kanbara looks at him in shock as Takuya awaits his condition. \"You take your mother and I with you,\" he says, after a minute. Everyone looks at him, surprised. \"I have to go, too?\" Mrs. Kanbara demands, in shock. \"What about Shinya?\" \"He can come, too,\" Mr. Kanbara replies. \"It'll be fun. Like a family vacation. We haven't taken one since Takuya was little.\" \"YEAH!\" Shinya yells, excitedly.  Mrs. Kanbara sighs. \"I don't know...\" \"Come on, Mom!\" Takuya and Shinya cry in unison. \"Please?!\" Mrs. Kanbara sighs again. This time, defeatedly. \"Oh, all right!\" \"YES!\" Takuya cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it's settled. Takuya, Junpei(He had to ask his parents and they, surprisingly, let him go. The same with Tomoki's parents and Kouichi's mom.), Tomoki, Mr. and Mrs. Kanbara, Mr. and Mrs. Minamoto, Shinya, and Kouichi all decide to go to Mars together. Only Izumi doesn't participate. She thinks everyone is stupid for even going and she still believes that there's no life on Mars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt \"Shibuya Laboratories\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, but Izumi all head over to the laboratory. There, they demand to see the scientists that built the rocket ship that Kouji and you were in. The scientists come out and talk to them, but say no and usher them out the door. Just before the door slams shut, once scientist appears and orders them to stop. She's the head scientist of the laboratory and didn't agree to send Kouji to Mars. Mainly because she wasn't aware of it. But she does agree to build a ship big enough for your friends and your friends' parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 month later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocket ship is ready and everyone is packed and ready to go to Mars. The head scientist tells them to be careful and wishes them good luck. With that, they all start their journey to Mars.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wait until I tell my parents and Izumi chan!\" \"Don't bother,\" Takuya replies into his microphone. \"They wouldn't even believe you, but I wonder...\" He slowly takes off his helmet and gasps. \"There's air here!\" he exclaims. He puts his helmet back on to tell the others and they all pull off their helmets. \"You're right, Takuya,\" Tomoki says in awe. \"I can breathe.\" \"But why, though?\" Mr. Minamoto asks, skeptically. \"Maybe the natives here are more advanced than us,\" Mr. Kanbara replies. \"Okay,\" Takuya says. \"Let's go find Kouji and (your name). Since there's air here, then that means they must be alive.\" Everyone nods and begins walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with you and Kouji...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt starts to get dark. You and Kouji begin to look for a hotel...anything that could be called shelter. Eventually, you find a hotel. Relieved, you and Kouji head inside and talk to the manager, explaining your situation. With a sympathetic look, he books one room that you and Kouji have to share. Smiling, you thank the man and head up to your room with Kouji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone decides to go to a hotel and, surprisingly, finds the one you and Kouji are staying in. There, they're greeted by the manager. Mr. Minamoto books rooms for everyone using his credit card, in which the manager, astonishingly, takes. Then hands everyone their keys and heads upstairs to their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go down to the kitchen to see if you could get a snack. Room service on Mars is a lot slower than on Earth and you were very hungry. On the way, you, practically, bump into Takuya, who is also on his way to room service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takuya?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(your name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya hugs you and you hug him back. \"What are you doing here?\" you ask. \"My parents, Kouji's parents, Shinya, and my friends decided to come and find you guys,\" Takuya answers. \"We thought you were dead until we saw the cities.\" \"Oh, my goodness!\" you exclaim and hug him again. \"I'm so glad you're here!\" Takuya smiles and hugs you again. \"Me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Takuya get your room service, then head back to your rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kouji get up and meet Takuya, along with the others, downstairs for breakfast. Mrs. Minamoto, sees Kouji and, in shock, hugs him tightly, crying joyfully, grateful that he's alive and back to his normal size. You and the other smile, happy that Kouji is reunited with his family. Kouichi hugs his brother next. \"Ototo, I thought you had died...\" Tears wield up in his eyes. Kouji smiles. \"I'm okay, Ni-san.\" \"Who shrunk you back down to your normal size?\" Tomoki asks. \"Some scientists we ran into while exploring this place,\" Kouji answers. \"Yeah,\" you say. \"They're really nice and helped Kouji.\" \"Well, I'm just happy we found you,\" Mrs. Kanbara says, smiling. You nod, smiling also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you all decide to explore the city. Takuya and Shinya think Mars is cool and practically beg their parents to live there, but they say no because One: They have a home already and two: They're missing school. Later that day, they leave the city and go back to the ship. Everyone, but Mr. Kanbara gets on board. Why? Because he notices something was wrong with the ship. \"What's wrong, dear?\" Mrs. Kanbara asks. \"The main engine is busted,\" Mr. Kanbara replies. \"If we can't fix it, then we'll be stuck here on Mars.\" \"That's awful,\" Tomoki says, sadly. Mr. Minamoto climbs out of the rocket ship. \"I'll go get help.\" \"I'll come, too,\" Mr. Kanbara says and begins to walk towards the city they were in. Mr. Minamoto follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Kanbara and Mr. Minamoto both, fortunately, come back with help. They found a repairman, who can fix anything from a toaster to a car. The repairman looks at the rocket's engine, checking the compartment, along with other stuff. When he finishes, he turns to the two men. \"So, can you fix it?\" Mr. Kanbara asks. \"Yes, but I need to go and get the right tools and equipment for it,\" the repairman says. \"How long will that take?\" Mr. Minamoto asks. \"Oh, no more than an hour; hour and a half,\" the man replies. \"Okay, because we really need to get out of here,\" Mr. Kanbara says. \"You're from Earth, aren't you?\" the repairman asks. \"Yes,\" Mr. Minamoto replies. \"I figured that,\" the man says. \"You're the first humans ever to step foot on this planet.\" \"Cool!\" Takuya says, poking his head out to see what's going on. Mrs. Kanbara tells him to come back inside. The repairman laughs. \"Yes, sir. I tell you. We've never had visitors before. Guess it goes to show you that anything is possible. Well, better get the tools.\" He starts walking back to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe repairman comes back and gets right to work. He fixes the engine in practically no time. \"Wow, thanks,\" Mr. Kanbara says, surprised. \"You're welcome,\" the man says and puts away his tools. \"How much do we owe you?\" Mr. Minamoto asks, taking out his credit card. \"Ah, think nothing of it,\" the repairman replies. \"You're guests here, so it's free.\" Everyone cheers. Mr. Kanbara shakes the repairman's hand, joyfully. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone is seated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Kanbara is seated at the driver's seat, while everyone sits behind him. \"Fasten your seatbelts!\" he announces and turns on the engine. Instantly, the engine roars, loudly. Mr. Kanbara presses a button that moves the ship forward and into the air. You all then start your journey back home.</span></div></div>",

After 5 hours, you both reach the asteroid belt. Kouji holds you in his hands as the ship is bombarded with asteroids. Unfortunately, the rocket ship had no seats or seatbelts(Dumb, isn't it?), so you both are tossed to and fro inside the rocket. One asteroid collides with the ship, knocking it off course. The ship turns around and upside down and ends up flying in a totally different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tossing and turning stops, Kouji realizes that he and you are heading to another planet out of the solar system. He lets you go so you could see. \"This can't be Mars,\" you say, looking at the bluish green planet. \"It's not,\" Kouji replies. \"So, we're out of the solar system?\" you ask. \"I guess so,\" Kouji answers. \"I've never seen a planet like this before.\" Suddenly, the ship rumbles and Kouji grabs you and holds you in his hands again. The gravity of the planet is pulling the ship to it. Soon, the ship crashes onto the planet, throwing Kouji into a wall. He curses under his breath. He had hit his head when he banged into the wall. Kouji realizes that he's still holding you, so he puts you down, gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" you say in awe. From what you can see, the sky is green and the grass is blue. You both have landed in a field. You decide to get out and see if the planet had oxygen, so you press the button beside the door and the door opens. Kouji tries to stop you, for fear that the planet's atmosphere may not be breathable, but it's too late now. You're already walking down the steps of the ship. And you wish you hadn't because the air wasn't breathable. Gasping, you fall to the ground. Kouji could hear you gasping and comes outside to help, but starts gasping for air, too, and falls to the ground. 'Won't someone help me?!' you think, panicky. Suddenly, two figures come and put a helmet on your head. A helmet of oxygen. Relieved, you slowly take in the cool air. As for Kouji, he's still gasping for air and is nearly dead, but the two figures inject him with something to knock him out. You gasp from inside the helmet. 'It is all right,' a voice inside your mind tells you. 'We did that because we do not have a helmet large enough for him. Your friend is fine.' You look up and see one of the figures looking at you, realizing that he's the one that's talking to you, telepathically. The figure looks totally human, but had a strange mark on his forehead. The other figure is studying Kouji with some kind of gizmo. The first figure turns to you. 'We will take you back to our laboratory for testing. We want to know where you came from and do not worry. We will find a way to shrink Kouji back down.' You gasp again. How did he know Kouji wasn't really a giant?! And how did he know his name?! Before you could ask, the figure says, telepathically: 'I knew because I read your mind. Do not be afraid. We do not wish you any harm. Now, come with me.' He looks at his partner and nods to him. You stand up as the figure begins to walk away. You look at Kouji, fearfully. You didn't want to leave him alone with that guy. 'Do not worry,' he says to you. 'My partner will stay with him until help comes along. Since he is a giant, it will take a lot of people to lift him. We are taking him back to our laboratory.' 'Okay,' you think and start to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the laboratory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien tells you it's safe to take off your helmet. The laboratory is filled with oxygen. Sighing, you take off your helmet and see that he's right. You place the helmet on a desk and the human-like alien tells you to sit on one of those things you see in a doctor's office. Obeyingly, you do and the alien starts his testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien runs all sorts of tests on you. Some were scary, but he tells you not to be afraid and that it wouldn't hurt. Lastly, he injects you with some kind of chemical which would help you to breathe his kind of air. Later, Kouji is brought in by the alien's partner and others. Don't worry, though. He's large enough to fit inside the laboratory. The aliens run tests on Kouji and also inject him with the chemical that would let him breathe their kind of air. And soon, they mix some kind of chemical that returns Kouji to normal size. Happily, you hug him. Once he's awake, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kouji explore the planet. It's very weird, but very pretty. You run into all sorts of aliens. And all of them were really friendly. As they day goes by, though, you begin to miss Earth. And your mom and dad. \"We can't go back there now,\" Kouji tells you. \"The ship is trashed.\" You look down, sadly. Kouji tilts your head up, so that you're both looking eye-to-eye. \"Don't worry, (your name). Everything will be okay.\" You sniff and hug him, crying into his shoulder. Kouji hugs you back, shushing you. After your cry, Kouji decides to find a place to stay for the night. The planet doesn't exactly have hotels...or cities, so you both have to camp out. The next day, you run into the two alien scientists and you tell them that you want to go home. The aliens look at the ship and, unfortunately, tell you that they can't fix it. Now what do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as you are about to give up, a guy walks up to you. \"You're new here, aren't you?\" he asks. \"Yes,\" you say, suspiciously.\"Why do you ask?\" Even though, the natives were friendly, you couldn't risk anything on this planet. Who knows what may happen? The guy sighs in relief and places a hand on your shoulder. \"You don't know how lucky I am to see other humans! I've been trying to get off this planet for years!\" \"How long have you been here?\" you ask. \"About 10 years,\" the guy replies. \"I'm an astronaut from Earth. I crash landed onto this planet on my way to Mars. I was to be the first astronaut ever to land on the planet, but the asteroid belt had other plans. So, where are you kids headed?\" Kouji eyes the man suspiciously, as you give him your answer. \"Unfortunately, the natives here don't know how to fix a rocket,\" the man tells you. \"But I've been fixing up my ship, though, and it's almost finished. I'm good at fixin' stuff.\" You beam brightly. \"Can you give us a lift back to Earth?\" \"Sure can,\" the guy replies, grinning. \"Kouji, we're going to be going home soon!\" you cry, happily. Kouji doesn't reply. He still doesn't trust the guy, but that's Kouji for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, whose name is Michael, takes you and Kouji back to his ship. It's a large rocket, but not as big as the rocket you and Kouji were in. \"Yep,\" Michael says, proudly. \"I've been working on this baby for a long time and believe me, it wasn't easy. This planet hardly has the necessary materials to fix anything, but I found them.\" \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" you ask, trying to be helpful. Truthfully, the faster Michael is, the faster you could get off the planet. \"Nah,\" Michael replies. \"I can do it. Besides, I don't think you know anything about fixing rocket engines.\" \"Okay,\" you say and sit down on the ground to wait. Kouji leans up against the rocket and crosses his arms as the man prepares to continue working on his ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 4 hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's just about ready,\" Michael announces. \"Just have to tighten this screw here...\" Using a wrench he found in the rocket, he tightens up the screw. \"There. I'm finished.\" You are nearly asleep when he says the words. \"Huh? You're done?\" \"Yep,\" Michael replies, smiling. \"Finally.\" You cheer. Michael grins and goes into the rocket to put away the tools. You stand up as he pokes his head out, telling you and Kouji to come inside. You climb aboard, grateful, and Kouji follows, reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the ship, you see a few seats and the control board(You know. That thing with all of the buttons.). Michael sits up front with the control board and you and Kouji sit in the back.(I'm making this up as I go along. Bear with me.). \"Now, to test this baby,\" Michael says, pressing a button. Instantly, the engine starts up. \"Success!\" he exclaims, happily. You cheer again and Kouji, for the first time, smiles. \"Next stop: Earth!\" Michael exclaims, as the rocket starts to take off. Thus, you start your journey back to Earth.</span></div></div>",

At least you're going home. \"Hang on!\" Michael exclaims. \"I'm gonna see if I can dodge these asteroids!\" You grip the seat, tightly, as he turns the rocket full force around a huge asteroid. \"Whoa!\" \"Sorry,\" Michael says, as he dodges another asteroid. \"But these things are huge!\" He turns the rocket around another big asteroid. After nearly 20 minutes, you all pass the asteroid belt. You sigh in relief and sink in your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you all finally reach Earth. Michael's rocket ship is fast. Really fast. \"Boy, I'd never thought I'd be so happy to see this planet again!\" Michael cries, happily. \"Me, neither,\" you reply, agreeingly. Michael presses a button and unbuckles his seatbelt. Instantly, he starts to float. Your stomach growls. \"I'm hungry.\" \"I think I ate all of the food I had, but let me see,\" Michael says. He presses a button and, immediately, the food he has left, comes out. You unbuckle your seatbelt and float over towards the food and look at it. He has all sorts of goodies that make your mouth water. \"Take your pick,\" he says, grinning. You reach out and grab(your favorite candy) and open the package. Instantly, the candy starts to float out of the package. You grab it and take a bite out of it before it got away. Michael opens a bag of licorice and starts eating, also. You turn and float over to Kouji. \"Aren't you gonna eat something?\" \"I'm not hungry,\" he says. \"Are you sure?\" Michael asks, between bites. \"There's plenty of stuff here.\" \"I'm sure,\" Kouji replies. \"Okay, Kouji,\" you say and start floating around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've eaten all you can...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael puts away the rest of the food and floats over to his seat. He fastens his seatbelt and instructs you to do the same. Obeyingly, you do, content. Soon, Earth's gravity starts pulling the ship to it. \"Hold on!\" Michael exclaims, gripping the steering wheel(you know.), tightly. Faster and faster you're all pulled towards the Earth and soon, you land in the middle of an ocean. You look around and see nothing but water. \"Where are we?\" \"I think the 'Pacific Ocean',\" Michael answers. Suddenly, a boat appears. It's the Coast Guards and they pick you all up after seeing the rocket crash into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt NASA, U.S.A....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNASA's scientists were wondering where Michael was and were glad that he turned home safely after nearly 10 years. Michael explains the situation to them and the scientists were amazed by it, but wondered where he had found you and Kouji. You explain the entire situation to the scientists and Michael. The scientists were amazed and heard of the giant, who isn't a giant anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael takes you to his house, so that you could call your parents. He lives with his wife. Once he arrives home, his wife, immediately, hugs him, wondering where he had been for nearly 10 years. Michael explains the entire situation to her, then introduces you and Kouji. You and Kouji bow, politely. The woman laughs. She's not accustomed to Japanese trends. \"Sorry,\" you say. \"We're from Japan.\" \"Japan?\" the woman asks. \"Oh, my. Then you two are so far away from home.\" \"Yes,\" you say. \"May we use your phone?\" \"Of course, dear,\" the woman replies. \"The phone's over there, next to the kitchen door.\" She points to it. You thank her and walk over to it. Kouji follows. Picking up the reciever, you dial the international number, then your area code and number. After the first few rings, it's answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(your name)! Oh, my goodness! Where are you?! I thought you and Kouji had died on Mars!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Mom. I'm back on Earth in America. And me and Kouji didn't make it to Mars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean 'didn't make it'?! Where did you two end up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On another planet, but I'll explain later. Listen, I've gotta go. Kouji wants to call his parents. And don't worry. He's not gigantic anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, but I want you to call me later and explain where you've been. I've been worried sick about you! Your friend, Takuya, kept calling to see if you were back home. He's the only one that believed you didn't die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"Okay. Bye, Mom.\" You hang up and let Kouji use the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like something to drink?\" the woman asks you. \"Sure, thanks,\" you reply. The woman goes into the kitchen and pours you a glass of lemonade, then, taking your glass, you sit down on the couch. Slowly, you take a sip and overhear Kouji explaining to his parents what had happened. Michael comes back, dressed in some ordinary clothes, and sits down next to his wife on the couch. You all talk and she asks you what it's like in Japan. You tell her all about the traditions of Japan. You even teach her a few Japanese phrases. She laughs and tries them, but she can't pronounce them well. Michael tries them, and, surprisingly, says them almost like a native Japanese speaker. You laugh and tell him that that was really good. Kouji soon joins you on the couch and you all have a good time, chatting together. </span></div></div>",

Michael had booked two tickets to Japan using \"Expedia.com\"(Hey, he's an astronaut. I imagine he makes a lot of money.) and had let you both stay with him for awhile. Once you get home, your mom and dad hugs you tightly, refusing to let go. You explain the whole story to them and they were just grateful that you are okay. They didn't care that you didn't make it to Mars, but were really glad Michael was there to take you home. As for Kouji, his parents were really happy that he's alive and not a giant anymore. So is Takuya and his friends. Zin, though, won't be too happy. Ever since the incident, people have stopped buying the magic growth formula and Zin's losing money, big time. And what makes him really mad is the fact that Kouji's back on Earth and not dead on Mars. Yeah, he overheard from a kid that he was back. Zin decides to whip up his most strongest potion and use it on Kouji. The potion would make Kouji grow 10 times the size he was and stay that way, permanently. After the potion is made, he drops by Kouji's house to give it to him(He knows where he lives.), but he isn't there and Zin gives it to Kouji's father, stating that it's a gift to his son for returning back home, safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouji returns home and his father gives him the potion. Kouji thanks his father and goes upstairs to his room. Once upstairs, he throws away the potion, knowing it came from Zin. He'd had enough of being \"Kouji the Giant\" and didn't want to go through it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya, along with Izumi, Junpei, and Tomoki, come over to see how Kouji's doing. They're reall glad Kouji's not dead and back to his normal size. Suddenly, Tomoki notices the potion in the garbage can and picks it up. \"What's this, Kouji?\" \"Tomoki, NO!\" Kouji says and tries to grab it away from him, but Takuya gets to it first. \"Man, am I thirsty!\" Takuya says and opens the bottle to drink. Instantly, his body trembles and grows taller than the house(and breaking the roof.)! \"Uh...guys?\" Takuya asks, grinning sheepishly. \"Was this supposed to happen?\" Uh-oh. Looks like there's another giant in the city. What do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kouji nodded to your decesion but still felt unsure about you. \" Maybe we should sneak in the factory and snoop around.\" you suggested. \"No way, 'cause One: I'm way too big to even fit in the front door.\" he said but the real reason was he didn't want to risk losing you again.\" Then why don't we--\" you said up till you passed out and started head first towards the ground but luckily Kouji saw you and caught you in the palm of his hand.

He looks down at you, expectantly. \"Well?\" \"She offered me the potion, but I refused,\" you tell him. \"Why?\" Kouji demands. \"I just can't trust her,\" you reply. \"She probably knows Zin and if she does, then she's working for him.\" Kouji sighs. \"Kouji, I'm the one that made you this size, so I'm responsible for helping you and responsible for your safety,\" you say. \"I wouldn't be able to live with myself, if something were to happen to you.

You notice this and look up at Kouji, who is in deep thought. \"COOL!\" one kid's voice exclaims, startling Kouji. He looks down and sees the kids looking up at him. \"How did you get so big?\" another kid asks Kouji. \"I ate all of my vegetables like a good boy,\" Kouji replies and rolls his eyes at the lame lie. You snicker. One boy walks, slowly, and, curiously, up to Kouji. \"You're not gonna eat me, are you?\" he asks, shyly. \"No,\" Kouji replies. Then the kids start asking Kouji thousands of questions like: \"Can you beat up this bully that keeps picking on me?\" And \"Can you take me for a ride?\" Kouji looks at them, dumbfoundedly, and you step in. You decide to tell them the whole story of how Kouji got so big. When you finish, a few of the kids start jumping up and down, yelling excitedly: \"I wanna be a giant, too!\" The rest just stare at you and nod, mixed with confusion and surprise. You then tell the kids not to tell others(especially their parents) about Kouji being gigantic and the kids nod. Then they run off again. All, but a boy your age. He's curious and wants to know more about you and Kouji's situation. Kouji starts to say no, but you tell him that you need all the help you can get and decide to trust the boy. Kouji sighs, as the boy grins. \"My name's Danny,\" the boy replies. \"I'm (your name) and that's Kouji,\" you say, extending a hand to shake. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Likewise,\" Danny replies, shaking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Danny talk, getting to know each other and try to make up a new plan to shrink Kouji back down.

A bottle that looks almost like the bottles the magic growth forumula comes in. You take the bottle from them and walk up to Kouji. \"Here, Kouji.

When you get there, your dad is waiting for you on the steps of your house, looking furious. He didn't see Kouji because he ducks behind the house and heads back to the shed. On the way, he catches the conversation between you and your dad. \"Where have you been, young lady?!\" your dad scolds. \"You know you have chores to do!\" \" I forgot. I'm sorry, Dad,\" you say, trying to apologize. \"But...\" \"But nothing!\" your dad interrrupts. \"Go to your room! You're grounded for a month!\" \"What?!\" You look at him in shock. Feeling tears in your eyes, you race into the house and up to your room, slamming the bedroom door behind you. You throw yourself onto your bed and start to cry. Kouji had heard everything and it makes his heart break. Your dad shouldn't have been so harsh. After all, you are helping someone and that's doing something worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, your mom comes up to your room to tell you that dinner's ready, but you're not hungry. Your mom closes the door and doesn't put up a fuss. You get out of bed and go to the bathroom to take a shower. After your shower, you go back to your room and put on your nightgown and climb into bed. Kouji watches the whole thing by peering an eye through your window.(No, he's not having any perverted thoughts.). Luckily, you don't seem to notice. You settle under the covers and get ready to turn out the light, but soft tapping on your window makes you jump. You look out to see a familiar, blue eye looking at you. You throw back the covers and run to your window and open it. \"What is it, Kouji?\" you ask in a whisper. \"I know it's late and that you're grounded, but would you like to go accompany me on a stroll?\" he asks. \"But...\" you say, looking at your digital clock. \"It's 8:30 and my dad said he'd be up to check up on me later.\" \"You'll be back before your parents even notice you've left,\" Kouji replies. \"Well...\" you say. \"O.K.\" Kouji holds a hand to you and you climb into it. Placing you on his shoulder, he stands up, carefully and takes the shortcut, trying not to disturb your parents or other neighbors. You both chat as Kouji walks down the street. You both reach a flower field where Kouji picks out a(any wild flower you like) and gives it to you. \"Thank you,\" you say, smiling and putting the flower in your hair. \"You should smile more,\" Kouji says, out of the blue. \"Tears don't suit you.\" You blush as Kouji looks out at the stars and full moon. You follow his gaze and see a shooting star whiz across the sky. \"A shooting star!\" you exclaim. \"We have to make a wish!\" \"I don't need to,\" Kouji replies. \"But you can.\" \"You sure?\" you ask. Kouji nods. You close your eyes and make your wish. When you open them, you glance and see Kouji looking at you. You blush again and Kouji smirks. You love his smile even if he is smirking. Later, Kouji takes you back home just before your dad checks in on you. Your dad smiles, seeing your sleeping figure and shuts the door. Kouji watches, secretly. \"Oyasumi Nasai, (your name), \" Kouji whispers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly open your eyes and sit up. You smile, remembering the stroll you and Kouji had taken last night. Speaking of Kouji, you decide to check up on him. Even though you're grounded, your dad said you could go outside, but not go anywhere beyond the house. You head to the bathroom, do your business, then take off your clothes and shower. After your shower, you get dressed in your room. Slipping on your(whatever shoes you want to wear), you race down the stairs, out the door and around to the shed. You open the door, but you don't see him anywhere. \"Looking for me?\" a voice says behind you. Turning around, you see Kouji looking down at you. \"Kouji,\" you say. \"Yeah?\" he asks. \"Thanks for taking me on a stroll last night,\" you say. \"It made me feel better.\" Kouji nods. For the rest of the day, you and Kouji play together. At the end of the day, though, Kouji shrinks back to his normal size and you're both happy.  Later, Kouji goes back home. His parents had been worried sick about him and didn't put up a fuss when he finally came home. They had called the police, but for some weird reason, they couldn't find him because whenever they'd get to a place where Kouji had been, they'd get there too late, but found giant footprints on the ground. The rumor and tale that a giant had been in the city spreads across the city like a wildfire, but only you and Kouji know the truth and you both aren't saying anything.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You put down the book, pick up the reciever, and place it to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Kouji. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm calling to see if I can come over to watch movies with you since we can't see one together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I have to ask my parents first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they'll let me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, O.K. What time are you coming over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7:00 P.M. That O.K.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so. See you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang up the phone. Sighing, you exit your room and head downstairs. Your mom is in the kitchen, cooking dinner. \"I though I heard your phone ringing,\" she says. \"Who was it?\" \"It was Kouji,\" you reply.\"He called to see if he could come over to watch movies tomorrow. Can he?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not,\" she replies. \"What time is he coming?\" \"7:00, tomorrow night,\" you reply. \"Is that too late?\" \"No,\" your mom replies. \"In fact, you'll need somebody to keep you company tomorrow.\"  \"Why?\" you ask. \"Your father is taking me out to dinner,\" your mom replies. \"You're not gonna call a babysitter to watch me, are you?\" you ask. \"No,\" she replies. \"I trust you. Besides, Kouji seems like a nice boy. Now help me set the table. Your father will be home soon.\" You nod. \"O.K.\" You head over to the cubbard and take out a few plates and glasses and set them neatly on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you help your mom with some housework. You hate doing chores, but it beats being bored out your mind. Then you surf the Web and finish reading your favorite book. At 7:00, the doorbell rings and you go to the door and open it. Kouji stands on the other side, holding a bag and a bouquet of flowers.  \"Hi. You're right on time,\" you say. \"Who are the flowers for?\"  Kouji hands you the flowers in reply. \"Thanks,\" you say, smiling. \"But you didn't have to buy these.\" Kouji walks up to you. \"I wanted to,\" he whispers in your ear. You blush. \"Aren't you going to let me come in?\" Kouji asks, arching an eyebrow. \"Uh...yeah,\" you reply and step back so he could come in. Kouji smirks. Your mom comes to the door wearing a red dress, jewelry, and red high heel shoes. \"Hello, Kouji,\" she says. \"How are you?\" \"I'm fine, Mrs. (last name),\"  he replies. \"You look beautiful.\" \"Why, thank you, Kouji,\" your mom replies. \"I agree,\" a voice says behind your mom. It's your dad. He kisses her on the cheek. Your mom smiles.  \"Hello, Kouji,\" your dad greets. \"Hello, Mr.(last name),\" Kouji replies. \"We'd better get going,\" your mom says. \"Have fun, you two.\" She kisses you on the cheek and walks out the door, followed by your dad. You watch as your dad opens the car door for you mom. Then after she gets in, he shuts it and goes around to his side and gets in. He then starts the car and they drive off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut the door and turn to Kouji. \"What's in the bag?\" you ask. \"DVDs,\" Kouji simply states. \"But I thought we were watching movies on TV,\" you say. \"These movies are better,\" Kouji replies. \"O.K.,\" you say and lead Kouji to the living room. Kouji takes off his sneakers and places them on the rug by the door, follows you into the living room, and takes a seat on the couch.You place the flowers in a vase and sit next to Kouji.You look into the bag and pull out a DVD. \"Let's watch( the name of favorite movie) first,\" you say. \"Whatever,\" Kouji replies. You get up, walk over to your DVD player, and press a button.(I don't own a DVD player, so bear with me.) The compartment slides out and you put the DVD in and press \"PLAY\", then you take your place back at the couch. You get comfortable as the movie begins. During the movie, you start to get sleepy and your head leans against Kouji's shoulder. Kouji notices this and wraps an arm around your shoulder. You yawn and snuggle deeper into him. Kouji blushes madly. By the end of the movie, you are asleep. Kouji takes the remote and turns off the TV. He lays you down on the couch, takes off his windbreaker, and lays down beside you, wraping an arm around your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night, you wake up. Realizing how dark it is, you glance at the digital clock. Midnight. Suddenly, you feel arms dragging you back down to the couch and a blanket being pulled up to your shoulder. \"Kouji?\" you ask. \"Hmm?\" he replies. \"Did my parents come back?\" \"I guess so, \" Kouji replies, yawning. \"This blanket was here when I woke up.\" You nod and follow his yawn with your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you wake up, smelling breakfast. You notice that Kouji isn't beside you. Yawning, you pull back the blanket and get up. You shuffle to the kitchen see your mom cooking breakfast and Kouji eating breakfast. \"Good morning, dear,\" your mom says, cheerily. \"How'd you sleep?\" \"Very well,\" you reply, ploping into a chair across from Kouji. Your mom sits a glass of orange juice and a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, and pancakes with butter and syrup in front of you. \"Mom,\" you say, cutting your pancakes with your butterknife and fork. \"Yes, dear?\" your mom replies. \"Did you or dad cover us up with the blanket last night when you came back?\" \"I covered you up with a blanket,\" your mom replies. \"Why didn't you wake me up?\" you ask. \"Well, you both looked so peaceful, so I decided not to,\" your mom replies.  \"Oh,\" you reply.  You start to eat. \"I'm going shopping,\" your mom announces, picking up the car keys. \"Do you want me to bring you something back?\" \"No,\" you reply, quickly swallowing a mouthfull of pancakes. Your mom nods and walks out the kitchen door. You hear a whinning sound in the basement as you continue eating. It's your dad working on the table in the basement. Soon, you and Kouji finish eating and place your dirty dishes in the sink. \"I've gotta get cleaned up and dressed,\" you say. \"Same here,\" Kouji replies. \"But you didn't bring any extra clothes,\" you point out. \"My dad came by this morning and brought some,\" Kouji tells you. \"Oh,\" you reply and head up to your room. You take a shower, then head back to your room to get dressed. Kouji showers after you and gets dressed in the bathroom. For the rest of the day, you and Kouji talk, watch movies, and play outside. That night, Kouji gets ready to go home. You walk him to the door. \"I had fun today,\" you say. \"Yeah,\" Kouji replies. \"Well, see ya,\" you say. Kouji nods, suddenly looking into your eyes. \"What?\" you ask. Kouji doesn't reply. He just walks up to you and slowly places his lips on yours. You jump, startled at first, but Kouji calmed you down by rubbing your back. Nearly melting at how soft and warm his lips are, you wrap your arm around his back as Kouji deepens the kiss. Soon, he pulls away and you look down, sadly. Kouji lifts your face up to his and smiles. \"I'll see you later.\" \"Promise?\" you ask. \"Promise,\" Kouji replies, kissing you lightly. \"Aishiteru, (your name).\" With that, Kouji heads to his dad's car. \"Aishiteru, Kouji,\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit and note: For those of you that don't know, \"aishiteru\" means \"I love you\" in Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
