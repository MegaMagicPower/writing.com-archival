She liked the title, the description sounded interesting to her, and the picture of the main character on the front looked <i>just</i> like her. Emily bought the book, digging through her pocket for a quarter, and took it home to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Emily got back to her house, the thirteen year old snuggled up in a comfortable chair and opened the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first page was blank. Emily stared at the page in confusion. Her vision started to blur and warp, and the colors around her appeared to smear, so it was hard for her to see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer surroundings faded until all she could see was white. It took her a moment to realize she was looking at a wall.  When Emily looked around, she seemed to be in the same place. Emily was no longer holding the comic book, but she didn't notice. In fact, she had forgotten all about the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend walked into the room. The teenage girl in the doorway seemed surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharon? What are you doing at my house?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to help you with the you-know-what,\" Sharon, Emily's friend told her, \"And shouldn't you be downstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me with what?\" Emily asked, \"And we have a basement? I didn't know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your, um, practicing. At the Training Room, remember?\" Sharon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" Emily said as her mom entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Sharon agreed suddenly, winking at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat name will people keep calling Emily?</span></div></div>",

Her best friend wouldn't betray her, right? Sharon opened the cupboard with the cooking dishes and pie tins, and reached around the back corner to press a button. The fridge swung outwards, revealing a gaping black hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew that was there,\" Emily exclaimed in surprise. <br>\r\n\"You're joking, right? Seriously. You don't remember what happened Monday? I've been waiting all week to get back here.\" Sharon hurried down. \"You coming, Kate? I'm gonna shut the door as soon as you come.\"<br>\r\n\"My name isn't Kate. You must be mistaken.\" Emily tentatively approached the steps.<br>\r\n\"I think I'd know my best friend's name.

There was no arguing with Sharon. The steps were metal, impossible to walk quietly on. Soon she came to a point where the wall was replaced with metal bars. This place was designed for defense, Emily realized. The steps would allow you to hear intruders, and the metal bars made it easy for weapons to get in, but not out. At the bottom of the stairs there was what looked like a hand scanner.<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on,\" Sharon urged. \"It only works for you.\"<br>\r\nEmily put her hand on the scanner, and it flashed green in an instant. Sharon darted inside. The screen said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, user of the power [Emily's power]...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is her power?</span></div></div>",

Her short, red curls danced as she jangled her car keys and dashed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook Sharon's hand off her arm. Her friend had practically dug holes into her arm with her nails. Rubbing the tender spots with one hand, she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you saying about a training room\u2026?\" Emily trailed off when Sharon rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Breanne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Who?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>C'mon,</i> Breanne! I'm <i>not</i> in a joking mood. Dr. Dark is plotting to flunk <i>all</i> the seventh graders at Maple Middle School with his Stupid-Ray,\" She paused to push her glasses up her nose, \"You need to train so you can be ready for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Dark?\" Emily's voice came out a squeak. \"Who in the world is Dr. Dark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Duh,\"</i> Sharon rolled her eyes again, \"Your latest nemesis? The supervillain that only wants to utterly destroy you\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon crossed her arms over her chest and squinted at Emily's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you, Breanne? You know all about Dr. Dark. The two of you have been battling since second grade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with me? Well, for starters, my name isn't Breanne. It's <i>Emily</i>. Secondly,\" Emily held up two shaky fingers, \"I have <i>no</i> idea what you're talking about! Dr. Dark? Stupid-Rays? Battles? Is this some kind of joke? Is today April first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon's jaw dropped. \"You really don't know!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily hugged her arms to her chest. She was starting to feel cold and wondered if she was going crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Dr. Eraser give you amnesia again?\" Sharon accused as she flopped onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. <i>Eraser--</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Sharon bit her lip, \"You wouldn't remember if he had, anyway\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amnesia\u2026<i>again?</i>\" Emily hissed. \"You mean this isn't the first time my memory's been wiped?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Sharon said matter-of-factly. She waved a dismissive hand, \"This sort of thing happens <i>all</i> the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely,\" Emily grumbled. She sank onto the couch cushion next to her best friend and buried her face in  her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. How 'bout I sum up your life. Maybe something will spark your memory. At least, that's what worked last time,\" Sharon grinned. \"Well, that and a piece of your mom's famous apple pie. There was something magical about that crust\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily snapped her fingers in front of Sharon's glazed eyes. The teen startled and flushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Anyway, your name is Breanne Bryant. <i>Not</i> Emily,\" Sharon sniffed in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with the name Emily?\" Emily questioned, lifting her head from her hands, \"It's been my name for thirteen years and you never complained about it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it's <i>not</i> your name,\" Sharon repeated. \"Look, this'll be a lot easier if you just go with the flow, ok? Your name is Breanne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breanne\u2026\" The name tripped awkwardly over Emily's tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sharon continued, \"if Dr. Eraser erased your memory then this next one might be hard to believe but\u2026you've got superpowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne snorted, <i>\"Right!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously. You've had them since you were seven and since then you've defeated a <i>bunch</i> of super bad guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne lurched from the couch and began to pace back and forth across the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Dark? Dr. Eraser?\" Breanne lifted an eyebrow. \"They're bad guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Sharon nodded, \"You've foiled them both from taking over the world about three times, now. You've also stopped Dr. Storm, Dr. Critter, and Trashman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne paused her pacing and giggled, \"Are <i>all</i> the villains doctors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon rubbed her chin as she thought. \"All of 'em but Trashman, The Pig, and\u2026\" she frowned in concentration, \"Oh, yeah, Dr. Who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon grinned, \"Dr. Who is actually a good guy. He's helped us, on occasion\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And right now we're trying to defeat Dr. Dark\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Sharon gushed, \"You're catching on a lot faster than last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne cocked her head at her best friend, still not sure that what she was saying was real. It all felt like a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Breanna pursed her lips and raised an eyebrow, \"Superpowers, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't believe me, do you?\" Sharon pouted. \"C'mon down to the basement, Bree. Come see your training room and tell me I'm lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne felt a wriggle of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of superpowers do I have, Sharon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend grinned, \"Come find out\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---What are Breanne's superpowers?---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Breanne obediently squished herself in with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon grabbed a red metal clothes hanger and gave it to Breanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do with this?\" Breanne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang it back up,\" Sharon instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne raised her eyebrow, but silently hung the empty hanger back up. Just before Breanne did as she was told, Sharon closed the closet door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce hung back up, the red hanger turned purple and the back of the closet opened to reveal a spiral staircase. Breanne couldn't see anything past the first few stair steps because it was so dark down there. She even felt the coldness coming from downstairs, but even though she was cold, she felt comfortable and relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is a weird feeling,</i> Breanne thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Sharon called. Breanne hadn't noticed that her friend had already started walking down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne hurriedly followed Sharon, who was descending rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Breanne lowered her foot to the floor, her foot became almost numb from the cold, even though she was wearing shoes, before it suddenly warmed up along with the rest of her body. Before Breanne could lower her other foot, she suddenly moved in the blink of an eye across the room. Since she hadn't been on flat ground, Breanne fell on her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Breanne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it! Now let's see if you can do the other one,\" Sharon said. Then she called, \"Start training! Amnesia level!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to?\" Breanne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight. Me. Frostbite,\" said a mechanical voice from behind Breanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne spun around, her brown hair flying through the air as she did so. The metalic adult-sized robot was carrying a wooden staff in both of its human-like hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharon! Do we have a break-in?\" Breanne called nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is your training bot, level zero, which we installed after Dr. Eraser's second amnesia attack. Go ahead, fight it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know <i>how</i> to fight it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay how did you explain it to me before?\" Sharon muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal robot hadn't moved in the entire time it had been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight. Me. Frostbite,\" the robot repeated, spinning the wooden staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll fight!\" Breanne called. Then she mumbled, \"Just as soon as I learn how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to trigger the robot further because it started moving forward to Breanne. The robot kept moving to the young teen. Just as the spinning staff was a couple feet from Breanne's face, she crossed her arms over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the whirring from the staff ceased. Breanne opened her eyes and moved her arms. She saw the robot was frozen, the staff stuck to the bot's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Breanne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it! You found your other power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I am some sort of ice powered superhero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and teleportation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne concentrated, and found she could control where she teleported to pretty easily. However, in the two hours she practiced her two superpowers, she was still surprised by the sudden change of view each time she teleported. Breanne still wasn't sure whether or not she liked the tingle she felt through her arms and neck every time\u200b she made more ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne teleported across the room, then stretched her arms out, trying to freeze the level two robot she had graduated to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharon, why isn't it working?\" Breanne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. You told me once that right after teleporting and right before, you can't use your ice. There was some logic behind it, but I don't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Great</i>\" Breanne said, \"How long does it take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think somewhere around a minute,\" Sharon told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne was only able to freeze the robot one more time before lights started flashing red around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal?\" Breanne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon turned around and tapped a computer screen a couple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Dark is in the Science Museum,\" she exclaimed, \"He must be stealing a piece for the Stupid-Ray! You've got to get there and stop him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I haven't had much training. If he's really as smart as you say, I won't have a chance against him. I should train more first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this could be the last piece! You've got to go <i>now </i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Breanne go and try to stop Dr. Dark or stay and practice more?</span></div></div>",

She inspected a matching blue and white mask before frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon rolled her eyes, \"Haven't you seen <i>The Incredibles</i>? Capes are a hindrance. No capes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments Breanne changed from an average teen to Frostbite, superhero! She couldn't help but stop and admire herself in the mirror hanging on the bathroom wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\" Sharon pounded on the door. \"Dr. Dark could be escaping with the last piece of the Stupid-Ray at any moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne stepped out of the bathroom and curtsied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Sharon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As ready as I'll ever be\u2026\" Breanne mumbled, \"Where's the Science Museum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon shoved her glasses up a notch on her nose and glanced at her computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the corner of Clark and Kent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, Breanne closed her eyes and concentrated. When she opened them again, she was in front of the Science Museum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to procrastinate, she checked out the street. It looked vaguely familiar to the town she remembered, but with a few subtle differences. She chuckled at how <i>Stripes</i>, her favorite candy store, was painted like a candy cane instead of the lavender color that Mrs. Percy loved. And instead of a barber shop next to the bank, there was a video arcade. She didn't realize kids still spent quarters on those old games...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Bree!\" a voice hissed in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne startled and almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sharon?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Sharon sounded embarrassed, \"I forgot to mention the comms in your mask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would have been a good thing to know!\" Breanne scowled. \"You about gave me a heart attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\u2026So what's the holdup? You've been standing in front of the building for five minutes now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You timed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my job,\" Sharon laughed, \"to keep you on track, make sure you don't get killed, and send backup if needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Backup?\" Breanne perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need it,\" Sharon assured her, \"You've beat Dr. Dark before and you can do it again. So stop delaying and <i>do it</i> already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne sighed and adjusted her mask. \"Okay, okay\u2026I'm going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Breanne had teleported through the front door and in another second she found herself knocked off balance by a sticky web. Landing on her rear, Breanne stared at the web in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frostbite!\" a low, gravely voice hissed, \"So we meet again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne looked up to see a figure dressed in a flowing black robe. His head was completely hidden by a hood and one hand was clad in a dark glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S\u2026s\u2026spiderwebs?!\" Breanne stuttered, \"Your superpower is shooting <i>spiderwebs?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" Dr. Dark admitted. He cocked his head and his hood shifted with the movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been fighting Dr. Eraser again, haven't you?\" Dr. Dark laughed when Breanne clenched her teeth and glanced away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Breanne growled. She let her cold powers flood through her arms, freezing the web that was stuck to her. As soon as it was frozen she was able to smash it into tiny pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as much as I would like to <i>stick around</i> and play, I think it's time for me to go. I've got a Stupid-Ray to assemble, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw out a gloveless hand and web shot from his fingers. Breanne, anticipating the attack, teleported behind him. She held up a hand to freeze the doctor's feet in place, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't freeze after teleporting!\" Sharon hissed in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot!\" Breanne groaned. She tried to duck another stream of sticky web but it struck her arm. With another shot, Dr. Dark had her good and stuck to a stone pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the missing link!\" Dr. Dark chuckled, waving goodbye with a dinosaur tooth. \"Get it? Missing link? And we're in a Science Museum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilarious,\" Breanne snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree!\" the shout from Sharon made Breanne's ear ring, \"Catch him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanne thought for a moment. If she froze the web she could chase after Dr. Dark on foot\u2026but she might not be able to catch up to him. Or she could teleport out of the webbing and catch up to him right away\u2026but she'd temporarily lose her freezing ability. She bit her lip, uncertain as to what to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Emily cannot leave the comic book before the story is finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in the story, her friends still look like her friends and her mother still looks like her mother. The only differences between her in the story and her in real life is:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She's a superhero<br>\r\n2. Her name is different<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- All entries must be 13+ or lower -- E preferred<br>\r\n- Don't change the main character<br>\r\n- The character must have superpowers while  in the story<br>\r\n- No one-line chapters. Chapters that are 300 words or more will get 500 GPs<br>\r\n- The main characters cannot die<br>\r\n- No random chapters, or chapters that don't make sense<br>\r\n- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, please. I am not looking for perfection, but I don't want a piece that people can't understand or have a hard time reading.</td>",
