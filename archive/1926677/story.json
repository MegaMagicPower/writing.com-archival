Old plane parts, old clothes, old toys... everything was just trash that should have been tossed out ages ago.  But here he was trying to sort through it to find something, anything, worth keeping.  He had already chucked several boxes and sighed again as he realized he had nothing worth keeping still.  Though something in one old chest did catch his eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this...?\" he said softly, digging under some old navigation tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut came a yellowed map of a group of islands he had never seen before.  They looked close enough to fly to and back on a tank of fuel but he had been all over and had never seen anything out that way.  He scratched his head and took the map out, spreading it on his plane as he tried to figure out the coordinates.  Once he had figured out where they could be mathematically he checked his fuel, left a note saying he was going out exploring  for a few hours, and hopped into the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe propeller whirred and the engine roared as he started to take off, zipping into the sky and out toward those islands...</span></div></div>",

He had seen worse and wasn't too worried so he continued on, checking the map against what his instruments told him.  He was going in the right direction so there wasn't too much to worry about and he'd be there in no time!  The map said there was a treasure on one of the islands but wasn't really specific about what it was.  There was just some sort of X on a part of the island and a note about a big treasure.  Maybe if it was still there Baloo would be rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden flash of lightning illuminated the cockpit and thunder blared.  Baloo gulped and started to look for somewhere to land but all he saw was ocean.  He wasn't too worried yet but another flash went by.  More thunder boomed and Baloo knew he needed to land.  He swooped down to see if there was a spot to land when lightning suddenly hit his wing.  He yelped in fear and started going down, down, down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew he was facedown in something gritty and he was incredibly wet.  His eyes opened slowly, vision fuzzy, but he could tell it was still raining.  A crackling from behind him told him that the plane was likely destroyed and beyond repair.  He rolled over with a groan at the pain of having crashed and saw that the plane was indeed more mess than machine.  The engine had caught fire and one wing was charred where the lightning had hit.  Baloo just fell back into the sand and sighed.  Then...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly he could make out shapes that were moving slowly forward toward him. As they neared, he realized with a mix of shock and relief that it was a tribe of native men! As they approached, Baloo noticed that each of them were easily just as heavy as he was! However, these natives were a fair bit shorter than Baloo, causing their weight to make them appear much fatter than our ursine hero. Baloo attempted to call out, but his words were met with a sharp sting in his side. He looked down to see a bright red feather sticking out of his abdomen just before the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily, Baloo came to in what appeared to be a lush green jungle. He stared up at the canopy of trees swaying in the island breeze, a slight relaxing calm taking hold of him as he did. His reverie was interrupted by the realization that he was chained to a stone slab in the middle of several very wide huts. Suddenly he saw the corpulent island men from before return. The largest one, who was wearing a sort of headress and carrying a staff, approached Baloo. He began to speak very loudly to the rest of the crowd in a language that Baloo couldn't understand. As the man talked, periodically, almost in rhythm with what he was saying, he would belch or break wind. Baloo cringed, but he was intrigued. It almost seemed that passing of gas was part of these peoples' language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo was snapped out of his contemplation as the Chief poked him in the belly with his staff. The Chief began to make motions to the others. Motioning to his own torso and spreading his hands farther and farther apart. Baloo began to wonder what all of this meant. Soon, his thinking time was once again interreupted as several of the men began to poor a large bowl of liquid into Baloo's mouth! Surprised, he thrashed about, attempting to stop them, but the restraints did their job and Baloo was forced to swallow the concoction. Baloo could feel an uneasiness growing in his stomach.

As he recovered from swallowing the sudden liquid he noticed one of the men brought a book forward.  He opened it up to show some pictures drawn in a very colorful manner.  The first pages showed a flaming ball coming down from the sky on one page and the next had a group of fat natives dragging out something that looked quite a bit like himself.  The next few pages showed the figure in varying states of... growth.  Bigger and bigger he grew until the last set of drawings.  It was just one that ended up on both pages, showing the figure being rather content in his gigantic size with a huge, brown cloud forming behind him.  He also had become rather largely endowed with men all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who had brought the book forward pointed from the book to Baloo and he quickly caught on.  He gasped, realizing what this meant.  Soon he had paws all over his belly and sides as the men seemed to be testing him.  Baloo blushed and started to panic.  His plane was destroyed, he was chained up in a hut, no one knew where he was, and these men wanted to turn him into a massive beast of a man.

Everything was happening so fast, one minute he's flying his plane and the next he's tied up by a tribe of obese natives. Baloo had always loved his massive girth, he always dreamed of getting fatter. He looked at the picture of the enormously obese blob from the book, he wanted to be huge like that, Baloo couldn't contain his excitement. While the natives rubbed his big belly, Baloo shifted his weight to the side and ripped a monstrous fart that made his whole body jiggle and shook the ground beneath him. The natives stood in disbelief, all eyes fixed upon the huge bear who was starting to sweat. The chief waddled up to Baloo, his stomach hung down to almost his knees. Wearing only a headress of feathers and a loincloth that was mostly wedged up his huge ass, the chief inhaled deeply and slapped Baloo's belly with his own. He took off his headress and placed it carefully on Baloo's head, the tribe members all kneeled down and bowed their heads, their god of gluttony had arrived. Baloo had a whole village of people worshiping him, dedicated to making him as fat as possible and taking care of everything their god demands. Baloo was in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to start living the life of a God, his servants couldn't wait to fulfill his demands, the first of which was...</span></div></div>",

After some pantomiming eating food the men finally realized what it was Baloo wanted.  They hurried off to get him food while some men who he assumed to be guards undid the shackles now that he seemed to be willing to stay.  They got him extra pillows to set around him and prop him up on so he was extra comfortable.  Baloo wiggled his large butt and got in position for feeding.  Then the food started to stream in via huge baskets carried by multiple men and he began to eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a mere week of gorging on the food of the island Baloo had grown considerably.  His belly was much softer and rolled out toward his knees, his moobs had folded over onto his gut, and his butt had blimped into two, big, round smelly orbs.  His arms and legs were much softer and sagged more; his thighs now huge silos of flab.  Whatever this island had in its soil was causing the food to be extra fattening.  No wonder these natives were so fat.  But Baloo just smiled and ate more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo had managed to learn some of the language of the men and had managed to teach some a few English words.  Though he found their language quite fun as it involved belching and farting as part of it.  Far better and almost easier than English but it wasn't as practical since he was constantly so gassy now.  He did want to mistakenly say something wrong after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had finished another big bowl of the stuff he was first fed with.  The weird, thick, almost smoothie like food that he came to crave which was likely also having a hand in his growth.  \"URP!  BURRRP!  <b><i>BBBWWWWUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!</i></b>\" Baloo belched.  \"Ooough, feels good...  Mm... we got more of that stuff?\"</span></div></div>",

Over the next few days the increasingly growing bear sat content on his throne, dining on platters of exotic meat and rich, creamy chocolate with all the manners of a ravenous pig as his fellow obese subjects slowly set up a series of stalls, banners, flags and torches around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Prrrffffffffft~!* Mmmmm, this is the life, eh fellas? *Brrrrppbrpbrrrrrrrrrpt~!*\" Baloo asked as he playful shook his growing man-boobs, letting them slap against his doughy furry belly as he let his rear do the translating. The fat bear had soon grown accustomed to the tribe's gaseous-founded language; even if he wasn't a hundred percent sure what was being expelled at him, Baloo had taken a strange liking to the stench that permutated around them. \"What's with all the decorations though; is it my birthday or something?\" Waiting for a response before he remembered who he was talking to, Baloo with a struggle heaved himself slowly up and let his ass erupt his sentence for the next minute or so, his butt-sweat giving his dialect a somewhat naughty accent to the tribesmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smaller bear, perhaps a simple message boy, slowly lumbered up to Baloo and explained to him how before taking up the mantle of being their fat smelly god, he had to undergo his coronation. It involved a series of three trials, each representing a different quality of the previous incarnations of their god to prove he was the chosen one; the Test of Air, the Test of Hunger and the Test of Love. All three were music to Baloo's ears; just live up the slothful, hedonistic lifestyle these fat-lusting tribes people wanted out of him, and he was set for life. There was also a murmuring of a mighty rock which fell from the sky every year, yet by the time the boy had started to trumpet his way to that part of the story Baloo had already started to blissfully day dream. To top it all off, at the end of this festival Baloo was to treat everyone to a stunning display of disgusting gluttony as he was dunked into a large bath of the tribe's mystery goop and eat it in front of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnuggling his obese frame into his throne as he drifted off to sleep to the sound of his royal band of smelly butt trumpeters, Baloo dreamed of his big, foul-smelling future...</span></div></div>",

The entire tribe of fat men were there, dressed in their best loincloths. Banners depicting all kinds of food hung from all over the village. Baloo was feeling an incredible sense of pride at all this. It was about a month since the bear had landed on the island, and the month had been VERY good to him. Baloo had weighed about 350 pounds when he crashed, and, had a scale been readily accesible, it would have shown him to be a very large 750 pounds of bear blubber! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud fart echoed throughout the village. Everyone stopped and looked as the Elder motioned for everyone to gather around Baloo. A series of gaseous emissions informed Baloo that it was time for him to prove himself as their fat god. The first test would be the 'Test of Air.' Baloo started to wonder what exactly this meant. An answer came as the Elder began to describe the trial: (translated for your reading pleasure) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first test will be the Test of Air. Our god could produce so much wind himself that the trees themselves would bend to his air. You must do the same. Show us that you can create as much air as our god did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheer went up from the crowd as the Elder finished his speech. They all turned to Baloo, eager to see his feat of 'Air.' Baloo just stared back, confused by what they really meant by this. He thought it over for a while, but could come to no real conclusion. Soon, Baloo felt the familiar building of gas in his abdomen, but, realizing what he had to do, he didn't let it out. Instead he held it in with all his might. Baloo realized that to pass the trial he would have to let rip the most massive fart ever! So he held in his gas. With all his might he clamped his tail hole closed, the gas building inside him. Minutes turned to hours. Baloo began to wonder if he would be able to make it as his belly bulged out with the accumulated gas...</span></div></div>",

Baloo started to sweat and whimper as he fought the urge to fart and the tribesmen all started to crowd closer to the growing gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't... hold...\" Baloo grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly grew a little bit more as the gas inside him groaned loudly.  He clutched the sides of his gut and widened his stance.  The sweat started to mat his fur and his teeth were bared down hard.  He shut his eyes tightly and tried his best to not let it all go.  There was a moment of silence before Baloo realized he couldn't hold it anymore.  The men around him seemed to feel it too as they all started to step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gonna...\" was all Baloo could get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden burst from his furry rear end roared as the biggest fart he had ever let out started to rumble forth.  His fat rear started jiggling and shaking as he farted and he had to widen his stance a bit more in order to stay upright.  The rancid wind from his rear end flew forth and caused the trees behind him to rustle and bend while shrubs were stripped of leaves.  Rocks were tossed back and dust on the ground flew up into the cloud of fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter at least 5 minutes of full force farting, Baloo fell forward on to his gut, panting and out of breath.  Though as he lay on his gut he squeezed out more of the fart, making a somewhat \"smaller\" burst flow out.  The men around him cheered and ran up to him to pat his sides and help him back up onto his feet.  He had passed the trial and an enormous amount of gas so it was now time for the next one.</span></div></div>",

Baloo's eyes bugged out of his head when he saw what was ahead of him! The entire clearing was full of food! All kinds of odd and rare delicacies lie out in front of the big bear. Drool began to run down his muzzle as he looked around. It looked as if the men had harvested every bit of food on the island for him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elder looked back at Baloo. \"Eat!\" was all he said. Soon the smaller men began to chant the same word as well. \"EAT! EAT! EAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo looked out over the feast and began to dig into the nearest dish to him. It tasted even better than the rest of the food that he had been fed up to this point! He could scarcely shovel the food into his mouth fast enough! He gorged and gorged and gorged, his belly pushing out with all the food he was packing into it.

BURRRRRRP... it,\" he said before flopping onto his back and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grey belly rose up into the air and quivered as he breathed.  It rose and fell with each breath and was packed so tight that it wasn't as jiggly as usual.  Once again cheers arose and hands made their way to his belly where they rubbed and massaged it.  Baloo groaned happily and smiled wide as those hands started to massage and rub him.  He farted loudly again, lifting his leg up as he fired it out and shook the ground.  More loud belches rumbled from him as the food settled and he sighed happily, enjoying the feeling of the food finally going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You truly have admirable abilities! You have passed two of our trials. Last is the Trial of Love. When our first deity blessed us with his presence he was able to fill each of-age man with feelings of glorious pleasure. So great was his prowess that he could pleasure out entire tribe without releasing himself. And so you must do that too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo wasn't entirely certain as to what the Elder meant by this. Pleasure? How? Why? An answer came as Baloo felt something on the other side of his massive gut. Two of the tribesmen were lifting up his huge belly as a third was slowly backing up under it... Baloo moaned loudly as he suddenly felt his length slide into the tribesman's fat ass. The tribal began to moved back and forth, riding Baloo. Baloo realized that this was the test. He had to pleasure every man in the village without blowing his load... He realized this would be the hardest (pun intended) trial of them all...</span></div></div>",

Though despite how heavy his balls were getting he had to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ohhh,\" Baloo groaned as a particularly good rear end met his rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy rode slowly at first.  Then he picked up speed.  Then he shot his load into the puddle of other loads and stayed there for a moment.  Baloo thought he was going to blow right there but with a grunt and a clench he stayed put.  The guys holding the belly up let it drop, causing it to jiggle on top of his highly sensitive head.

Baloo just leaned back in a feeling of ecstasy, his vision going in and out as the pleasure slowly subsided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Baloo came around, the celebratory feast was well underway.

Baloo's already large form was swelling up with more and more fat, the taught belly softening into a jiggling mass.  His arms and legs grew flabby, his ass blimped out like fat filled balloons, and his face sunk into copious amounts of cheek and neck fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooough whoa...\" he said in his thicker, deeper, fat clogged voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo panted, his tongue lolling out as he felt his body swell and change rapidly.  He was sweating more now and could barely catch his breath but it just felt so good!  In minutes he was surrounded by a pool of his own rancid-yet-pleasant sweat and his jiggling belly was churning up gas like a storm.

That potion has given you all the strength of our god!\" the elder said as Baloo lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey bear grunted deeply and placed his paws on the ground.  He gave a push and rolled himself up, his giant belly rolling forward and wobbled like jello.  It made heavy sloshing noises and wet plops as it slapped against his giant thighs and the ground.  His heavy moobs flopped and rolled in waves as they landed on the gut.  Then with another grunt and some panting he rose up to his fat feet.  He felt all his fat sag in heavy rolls and felt and heard it slosh about on him.  Though he also noticed he was taller now too.  Likely to enhance his godliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew.  Not too easy but doable,\" he said, dripping sweat down his fur.  \"So... if I'm god now... what happened to the last guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder paused, \"Well, my lord.

His huge moobs rested on top of it and wobbled each time he shifted.  They were like giant water balloons filled with flab that supported his blubbery jowls.  His arms and legs were encased in rolls upon rolls of fat and he was clearly out of breath as he stepped closer.  His fur was drenched in sea water and sweat so he smelled terrible.  Plus when he jiggled his giant ass and ripped a rumbling fart that stink grew even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where ees this other god I heard-URRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP-about?!\" he bellowed thickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo...</span></div></div>",

It was fitting that the other 'god' that he had to fight was none other than his nemesis. Karnage looked around the village, seeking his rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeeeeellll???\" the giant orange being bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got yer other god right here!\" Baloo said, slowly lifting himself to his feet, his massive body wobbling and sloshing about. Huge beads of sweat began to drop from the bear as he rose, including less savory things falling from his rear as he finally reached a standing position (although to be honest it was difficult to tell as his belly nearly touched the ground in front of him and his mighty ass grazed the ground behind him). He looked at Karnage and lazily wiped the slobber from his face, the rancid smell of BO radiating from his exposed armpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh weel eef eet eesn't thee bloated buffoon bear, Baloo! Lookin more like thee plane than thee pilot theeese days, yes? But, how sad to have to cut your reign so short so soon! But I neeeed to get eeeven beeeger and the onleee way to do that would beee to deefeeat you, my ursine friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I have anything to say about it!\" Baloo said, taking a step toward his adversary, the ground shaking as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn outside observer, probably from very far outside, could observe the difference between the two giants: The gray blob on the left was slightly taller than the orange blob on the right, but the orange blob certainly had the advantage in girth. The two blobs slowly began to shift toward each other, eventually smacking into one another, causing the whole ground to shake and a massive, wet smacking sound to be heard all over the island. Trees were knocked over, and rocks turned as the two massive entities began to battle it out.</span></div></div>",

Karnage lost his balance and tumbled backward onto a small patch of jungle.  He crushed quite a few trees and bushes into the ground and caused quite the earthquake.  Some of the villagers fled to hide as the gods duked it out while they cheered on Baloo.  Though Karnage also growled and rolled onto his side as Baloo went to squash him flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey bear fell forward onto his gut, slamming down hard.  The sudden fall onto his belly forced out a roaring belch that uprooted some plants and splattered the area in his slobber.  Next to him Karnage's ass pushed against his side.  The big canine chuckled deeply and then blasted a powerful, rancid fart right onto Baloo.  The bear grunted and felt his fat jiggle from the force while the stink hit his nose.  He growled and rolled over too, pushing his own smelly butt against Karnage's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want... a fart...\" he grunted before farting thunderously on his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarnage yelped as the sudden fart hit him and he rolled over to avoid Baloo's gas.  But it was too late as the sudden burst caused him to get a bit dizzy.  He lay on his belly, groaning and trying to get up but Baloo's stink was horrible.  Though Baloo was getting tired and lay there on his side, losing his next chance.  He was panting and dripping sweat as Karnage got himself together and pushed himself up.  He took a couple quaking steps and then let himself fall right on top of Baloo, his mouth near Baloo's ear.  With a devious grin, Karnage let out a thick belch right into Baloo's exposed ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo yelped loudly from the belch and tried to push Karnage off.  Karnage just laughed and rested his weight on top of Baloo.  He could win this just by laying down!  Of course, Baloo wasn't going to go down that easily.  He growled deeply and used all of his strength to roll Karnage off and then kept rolling himself until he was on top of the canine.  Then as they were face to face he belched loudly right at Karnage.  Slobber covered Karnage's face, blinding him temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got up from Karnage and stepped back a few feet.  As Karnage wiped the slobber from his face he could feel the ground shaking immensely.  When he got his sight back he saw a mass of grey blubber wobbling toward him like a freight train.  Before he could escape, Baloo launched himself and slammed his two tons down on top of his nemesis.  The canine farted deeply from the pressure and instantly passed out.  Baloo had won!</span></div></div>",

He breathed heavily for about 10 minutes before finally letting out a loud belch, realizing his victory. Baloo began to wonder what to do with the massive canine before him, but he suddenly was overcome with a powerful urge, as if someone was controlling him remotely, or rather strongly suggesting to him what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo approached Karnage's huge belly and began to push. At first his hands just sank into the massive collection of flab, but eventually he managed to start rolling the passed out pirate captain over. With the crushing of a few more trees, the huge orange beast was suddenly on his massive belly, his huge doughy ass and massive tail now sticking up into the air. A foul stench wafted from the area, but somehow it didn't smell bad to Baloo. It smelled almost enticing. Slowly the giant bear began to lumber toward his opponent's rear, rolls shaking wildly in both animals. Karnage came to just in time to feel a massive weight on his bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuhhh....ahhh...what eees...goeeeng on?!\" Karnage sputtered out, absolutely confused at what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers watched as Baloo lifted his titanic belly onto the butt shelf of the defeated god. Slowly trudging forward, Baloo followed what the invisible voice was telling him and suddenly stuffed his now massive cock into Karnage's hole. The latter shouted out in what was at first a cry of pain, but slowly simmered down into a feeling of great pleasure. Baloo began to rock back and forth, ramming his fat rod into Karnage's sweat-slicked ass. The ground began to shake as so much fat undulated before the inhabitants of the island. Both gods were moaning in pleasure, in addition to letting out the occasional belch, and the constant heavy breathing. Both were growing incredibly sweaty, the air becoming heavy laden with moisture. Drool ran from their mouths in thick rivulets as the banging continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a deep roar echoed from Baloo as he finally reached orgasm, spewing a massive load into his rival. Karnage could only moan as his entire body filled with a warm feeling that didn't seem to be going away. Baloo just felt something odd, though not unexpected as the unseen influence continued to power him. He could feel his cock becoming much heavier it seemed. The villagers watched in awe as a strange thing occurred. The orange god's fur was slowly disappearing, pink skin showing through. Karnage began to feel even stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what...eees...happeneeng to meee... I..I can't feeeel my legs aneemore...\" he said, struggling to move. The reality was, that Karnage's legs had already disappeared, merging with the rest of his body. His fur continued to fall out as his skin became marked with veins. As the change continued, first his arms disappeared and then slowly, his already round head became even moreso. Karnage's cries became more and more distressed as time went on until, finally, instead of words, hot sum spewed forth from his mouth. And with the change was complete, Karnage was entirely defeated and Baloo now had a massive new cock. As the cum finally stopped flowing, some of Karnage's mass migrated to join the rest of Baloo's blubber, but his manhood was still a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Baloo's cum soaked into the ground, suddenly fruit trees and bushes began to grow, all bearing strange new fruits. The villagers gathered around there giant god, bowing before him. </span></div></div>",
