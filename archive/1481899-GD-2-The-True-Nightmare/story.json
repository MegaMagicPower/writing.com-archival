            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tale began when Jak, 14 at the time, had a dream. His crush was a girl named Jasmine, who was 15 at the time. He dreamed that she was a 50 foot giantess. It all started when Jak's house was destroyed. Jasmine was being chased by Nostory. Nostory, who had claimed to be a Deamon, who are beings of darkness, who all have traits of beast, like claws or talons. He was trying to kill Jasmine. Jasmine didn't know why he was after her. Soon they met up with a new Deamon. The Deamon was a good one. His name was Shadow. Shadow ended up helping Jak and Jasmine get away from Nostory. Soon after, Shadow had tiped off to Jasmine that she had powers to grow herself. This only made Jasmine more curious of how she ended up as a 50 foot giant. She hoped that she would learn more during their journey. Soon when they were adventuring, they met up with a woman named Kate Berlin. Kate is a part of a group called L.O.R. which is called the League of Rebels. The organization is a group that is determined to get rid of the Deamon race. Kate explained that someone of L.O.R would be able to explain her powers. They met a man named Lucius, he was a old man who was a leader of one of many L.O.R. outposts. He was going to tell Heroes about the Prophecy. Then, Nostory attacked the compound. The book containing the Prophecy was lost. Our Heroes was able to win against Nostory and they locked him up. Soon after, Nostory escaped and kidnapped Kate and Shadow along with a new ally. The ally was Seth, another Deamon that was a 2nd hand man to Nostory. Jak and Jasmine set out to set out to save them. On their way, they stopped to the L.O.R. Outpost, and asked for directions to Nostory's Lair. Lucius had found the Prophecy. Here is the chapter for it.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"It is said,\" Lucius began to read the prophecy, \"Than many centuries ago, when the Lord created Mankind, he also created two sentinel beings to live along side them. One race, the Angels, was an almost female race led by the Angel Goddess, Gabriel. The Angels were pure beings of light that bared wings on their backs and, somehow, processed the power to change size by will, but that ability is usually only limited to 10 feet tall. The only Angel whose power of growth is unlimited is Gabriel herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius continued. \"The Daemons were under the leadership of the Daemon God, Lucifer. All three races lived in harmony at first. But Lucifer was power-hungry and wanted to rule everything. Thus, came forth was the great war between Gabriel and her angels, who fought to defend the Humans, and the Daemons led by Lucifer. The war was long and bloody, as there were casualties on both sides. The Great War would have been decided by the battle between Gabriel and Lucifer. Gabriel herself fought gracefully and magnificence, but Lucifer was devious, dishonest and a damn-right cheats. He used his Daemon hoard to attack Gabriel on all sides while he attacked her in the confusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As her last resort, Gabriel had no choice, but to use all her power to create an alternate realm and send Lucifer and all the Daemons in there, separate from mankind forever. This however, cost Gabriel her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great Lord created this Prophecy with his own will and gave the copies to the few High-Angels on this planet while he took the remaining angels to the cosmos with him. He also gave a warning that the Gods Gabriel and Lucifer will be reincarnated, and then the Great War will resume once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens then put two and two together. First, he said that only the High-Angels on Earth had the only copies of the Prophecy, and the fact that Lucius has one. \"Wait! You're a...\" Jasmine started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say that Angels were an almost female race.\" Lucius stated out, then golden, birdlike wings appeared on his back. \"I'm one of the few male Angels and also a High-Angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains why you don't like Shadow that much,\" Jak said to Lucius. \"Now, for the Reincarnation of Lucifer, I'd put all my money on that it's Nostory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Jasmine started to say, \"If there's a reincarnation of Gabriel, and she has an unlimited growth rate, then that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Lucius responded...<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nJasmine is the reincarnation of Goddess Gabriel. And soon, they were on their way to Nostory's Lair. They saved Shadow and Kate and soon continued their journey. After many encounters, including a near-death battle with Nostory and Seth, the Heroes soon found out that Nostory was working on a portal to the real world. He told them that the world they were in now existed thousands of years ago. It became separated from reality. And Nostory would be betting to destroy the real world. Jak was captured by Seth, and the Heroes came to save him. Nostory made a deal with Kate to have a truce for a 1 year. Nostory wanted this, because he needed to enter the real world in a year. Soon, Jak and Jasmine entered the portal, and the dream Jasmine's memories went into the real Jasmine's memories. And Jasmine told Jak this. Soon they started dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's continue the epic story, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\nIf you have no idea of what this chapter means, read the first adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td width=\"55\">\u00a0</td><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"63\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a style=\"padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\" target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1384374-The-Goddess-and-The-Dreamer\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/icon-5000.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"30\" height=\"25\" valign=\"middle\" align=\"center\"></a></td><td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\" style=\"padding-left:15px;color:#000000;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1384374-The-Goddess-and-The-Dreamer\" target=\"_top\" class=\"blue2roll\" style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:1.3em\">The Goddess and The Dreamer</a>\u00a0<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1384374-The-Goddess-and-The-Dreamer\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> (<a class=\"blue2roll\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools.php?action=pop_rhelp&amp;crating=30',%20'crhelp30',%20'500',%20'350');\">13+</a>)<br>14-year-old Jak has a dream about his crush.

At that moment, his eyes widened as Jasmine herself came in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  Jasmine did not know what had happened, it happpened too quickly for her to comprehend.

She felt helpless, without her ability to grow she was just a normal girl, albeit still a goddess. \" My,my, feeling little are we?\" Nostory said, it took Jasmine awhile to recognise Nostory as a 19 year boy. \" So what have you been up to?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Nostory did not respond but ordered Maroni's men to take her away. \" See if you can do something simple.\" he said under his breath while they dragged her away.

Yasmin was causing collateral damage throughout downtown Los Angeles. People were running, driving, whatever they could do to get away from the horror that was happening to this great city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin proceeded to step on people, turning them into a bloody stain on her purple filp-flops, and with every step she took, the earth was shaking. She stood at a 100 foot height, and while she was being destructive, many would admit she is beautiful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" Jak said. \"I really don't like this plan. She is having a bit <b>TOO</b> much fun, destroying, eating, and it's just crazy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jak,\" Shadow said. \"You don't have to worry about a thing, me and Jasmine are nearby. You just need to lead her out to the woods, so her and Jasmine can brawl it out where no one gets hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you won't get violated. I promise....\" Jasmine was reassuring Jak. \"However, if she does, I might have to throw her out of the city myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jas,\" Jak said. \"I know you won't let it happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Jak ran out into the chaos that was happening. Shadow went the take his place, and Jasmine just waited to get her chance to beat up the girl who sexually harassed her boyfriend. Jak was trying to think of a way to Yasmin's attention. He didn't want to risk becoming a blood stain or worse eaten. Yasmin was looking down, and paying attention to each person she plucked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, let's see.\" Yasmin said. \"I think I'll grab a few quick snacks. You seem tasty to eat, let's see...you could do. And- aww....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were multiple young kids running away and crying. The girl was beautiful, but they didn't want to be eaten. Yasmin didn't eat the little kids, she had some sympathy for them, but she proceeded to crush some cars, and continue her path of destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was going to try and climb her....although that wouldn't be needed as he was scooped up with a few other people....</span></div></div>",

Jasmine wrapped her right arm around Yasmin's neck, and then started to deliver a few blows to her head. And for a minute, it looked like Jasmine was going to win this showdown with ease. Yasmin then used her strength to flip her clone over and grabbed her right arm, and started to lock it between her legs; Jasmine felt the pain as she slightly screamed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jasmine wasn't giving up, She ended up uprooting a tree with her left arm, and started to hit Yasmin in the face with it. Yasmin only squeezed tighter, and Jasmine was wondering why she kept going...then a memory popped in her head. And Jasmine instead started to hit Yasmin's legs instead, and her lock started to loosen up a bit. Jasmine reached over to her exposed right leg and bit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWWWW\" Yasmin said, \"That's not even fair!!!\" She rolled away from Jasmine and clutched her leg, and the bite mark that Jasmine ended up leaving there...There was also blood coming out of the marks. Jasmine then grabbed the tree and started to hit Yasmin's leg more, to add insult to injury. Yasmine then shot a energy blast at the tree and it immediately caught on fire. Jasmine threw the tree into a river nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's right arm wasn't broken, but Yasmine's leg hold did a number on it. It felt almost lifeless and plus she favors using it. Nonetheless, Jasmine was going on fighting through the pain, and shot a few energy blasts at Yasmine's leg. It became clear that Jasmine and Yasmin were working on each other injuries, and as Yasmine stood up, she had a limp, and one can guess Jasmine took a bite outta crime....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the two girls were not going to back down...nothing could stop them. This was a rivalry for the ages, The Reincarnation of Goddess Gabriel, and her clone, who was almost identical to her in everyday, except in behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jasmine said, \"You're not too bad. You got some wrestling skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do too,\" Yasmin said. \"I see your arm is kinda busted there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your leg doesn't look too good either...\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen both girls punched each other in the face at the same time. And both girls were knocked back to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's vision started to give in on her, but she had to finish the job...and that was to knockout Yasmin. She stood up stumbled a bit, dazed and confused. Yasmin was struggling to get up. and she was clutching her left leg. Jasmine eventually got to her, and before Yasmin could react, Jasmine bent down, and delivered a strong right punch to her face. Yasmin was knocked out. Jasmine then lifted her self up...The battle was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin shrunk back down to her standard height of 5'3. Jasmine picked up her small clone, and shrunk to 50 feet, to find her way to the Deathray, and quickly, because she was on her way to passing out due to exhaustion. </span></div></div>",

She picked him up, and sat him in her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so hot when you're a giant sexy giant.\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute when you are blushing and little and cute.\" Jasmine patted her boyfriend's head. \"Jak, Jak,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Jas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake upppppp. Time to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was poking her boyfriend, seeing that he was dreaming. \"Jak! It's time to continue our goal to find Nostory. And we get to interrogate that wanna-be slut that is my evil twin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw mannnnn.\" Jak woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine sat him down in her lap as she sat up. \"What's wrong babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I was dreaming about you, and I was getting to the best part...\" Jak said. \"But it's fine. You're already big and hot in real life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine blushed as she put Jak in her cleavage, and they headed to the kitchen to eat breakfast.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was trying to figure why and how Jak was the key to the worlds being one again. He then remember something that Lucius told him before they came to Earth....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A year ago, in <i>That World...</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak could be more than the dreamer who knows our world....\" Lucius said. \"Jak has a special power inside him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A power?\" Shadow said. \"But how? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once before,\" Lucius said. \"There was a man that was bestowed great powers...those powers were used to protect the planet. Where they come from however, is a mystery. They are called the Omega Bloodline powers....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omega Bloodline?\" Shadow said. \"Isn't that a legend? To this very day still? No one has ever discovered it or came within reach of finding out the mystery behind it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct...\" Lucius said. \"All the details were that, 'Thou dreamer with pure heart and kindness shall be chosen to undertake an Omega power; that shall be used to rid the earth of scared and unimaginable evil.' That could very well match Jak, as he did dream our world up, and now it is reality once again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Shadow said. \"You think Jak will be that guy? I mean he has great courage, no doubt, but I can't see him as the fighting type...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak fights for what is right, and he's willing to do anything to help his friends.\" Lucius said. \"If the legend is true, then Jak will step into that role, of being the one who is given those powers. No one will ever know what was the Omega Bloodline was like in the past...but in the nearby future, Jak could be the one to show that amazing power...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Shadow said. \"Should I tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Lucius said. \"The time will come where you'll reveal this to him, Shadow. Possibly when he is coming of age, around 17 or 18 years old...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Understood.\" Shadow said. \"Well Lucius...I guess this it then. Good luck...I know you'll be watching us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. It is time for me and the remaining High Angels to take our place back into the heavens...\" Lucius said. \"We will keep an eye out for you, along with Kate, Jak, and Jasmine. Good luck to you Shadow. And I'm proud that you realize that this is for a greater good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\" Shadow said. \"Knowing that Nostory wants to have power...it isn't right. I'll do my best. Farewell Lucius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back to the present.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well. he's 15 now...\" Shadow said. \"Two years isn't much to wait for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine, with Jak, who was in her cleavage, walked past Shadow's computer room....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this day started...\" Shadow said. </span></div></div>",

Jak was still a little groggy, but would eventually get it out of his system. Kate was busy making breakfast for the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, you two.\" Kate said, greeting them with a smile. \"Sleep well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I had Jak come into my room with me.\" Jasmine said. \"I felt a lot better with my Luigi-Boogums by my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak simply yawned. \"It was nice. Just glad that she was able to rest up after that horrible battle with Yasmin. Kate you should have seen her, she was extremely gassed and-\" Jasmine then gave Jak a little glare, and he got the hint right away. \"She's the best girlfriend ever and I'm sure she'd destroy Yasmin ten times over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then smiled and gave her boyfriend a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak, you're so sweet.\" Kate said. \"Well guys, we have to discuss your schedules, we don't want this ruining your lives...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schedules?\" Jak said. \"What do you- Oh....that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Jasmine exclaimed. \"We still are in high school...this isn't a dream anymore.\" Jasmine then sat Jak on the table and started to close her eyes and think...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak paced back and forth and started to think as well. This was a hard situation for the couple, as Jasmine was already a cheerleader for their high school, and as for Jak, he was planning to join more clubs/organizations, in order to at least be more active during his high school years. Jasmine, also thought about other events, such as homecoming, dances, pretty much anything that the school does to try and make the year exciting outside of the work. Natually, the 16 year old goddess wanted to spend time with her boyfriend during these events...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea!' Jasmine said, getting up from the table, and then power walking to the back of the Deathray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jas!\" Jak immediately realized what Jasmine was going to do. \"Don't do it yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate turned off the stove, and quickly dashed after Jasmine. Meanwhile Jak just stood on the table...realizing that he had to stay put until someone came and got him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine ran into the holding cell block of the Deathray and Shadow quickly teleported in front of Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Jasmine said, with a little anger in her voice. \"Let me crush her, that's one threat we can get rid of! She would make things more difficult. I feel like it wouldn't be the last time she tries to pull a twin switch again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Shadow explained. \"We need to get information from her, in order to prevent Nostory and Seth from doing more damage to the world. We can't kill her yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then sighed, and then said, \"Ok fine...I understand. But we were having a conversation about our lives outside of this. Me and Jak still have to go through high school and things. I mean, don't get me wrong, I enjoy preventing evil and being a goddess, but I do want to be a normal teenager...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate finally caught up to Jasmine. \"Oh. You've already stopped her. I was worried there for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just upset is all.\" Shadow said. \"For the time being, I have a idea to propose to you two. I've already thought ahead of all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you being mindful and planning ahead.\" Kate said. \"That's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow slightly blushed. \"Let's talk about this over breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was sitting, and just looking up at the ceiling. The smell of the food hovered over him, and his stomach was growling. Luckily, he wouldn't have to wait any longer, as Shadow, Kate, and Jasmine entered the kitchen. Kate started to gather plates to serve food, and Shadow and Jasmine took their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak,\" Shadow said. \"Morning. I think you already know what we'll be discussing as we eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Jak said. \"How would we handle school and other things, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" Shadow continued. \"Now, here's my proposal. Jasmine, you're a cheerleader. Which means you'll be partaking in sports to cheer your team on right?\" Jasmine nodded. \"And Jak, will you be trying to participate in anything outside of school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak had three things in mind. He wanted to join the football team, international club, and the school newspaper. However, he felt like he also had a commitment to helping the cause of preventing the world's end from Nostory and Shadow. He quickly settled on one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joining the football team.\" Jak said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!\" Jasmine said. \"I don't want you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jak said, knowing his girlfriend was going to flip out. \"You don't want me to get hurt, or injured. But I feel like this will toughen me up. It'll be ok. You'll be at the home games and you'll see what happens. And plus if I workout with team, I'll look even cuter when I'm shrunk....you'd have a slightly bulker Luigi-Boogums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine laughed, and then accepted it. \"Ok then. I believe in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then. It's settled. You guys will be able to enjoy those things, and we'll give you guys breaks on your dances, and such.\" Shadow said. \"I think you'll guys will be able to balance these things well. Me and Kate will be able to handle minor occurrences. Our first goal for us, is to take out most of the deamons as they enter this world. We want make it to where it's mainly Me, Seth, and Nostory as the three. Of course, as much as the worlds are becoming one again, we want to prevent the environment from overtaking this world. We want to keep the earth's current environment the same. Kate will explain the rest to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate then served plates, and continued where Shadow left off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sure Nostory and Seth want to twist this to be like the world you guys saw back in the dream...so we're going to have to force it to where those elements won't exist. As for L.O.R....they're working on being on another world where they don't have to inhabit earth. Lucius is currently not with us because of that reason, but we will see him as we going though this...but the eradication of the deamons is the important thing, then preventing the worlds from completely merging. And lastly...stopping Seth and Nostory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Jak looked at each other, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in.\" Jak said. \"Sounds like a win-win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saving the world, and being normal high school kids,\" Jasmine smiled. \"I think this will be an interesting high school life to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then grew her boyfriend back to his 5'7 height, so that he could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" Shadow said. \"Glad to hear you guys are committed into this thing.\"</span></div></div>",

He feared that his girlfriend might be talking to his parents...who knew about Jasmine, as they found her to be a great person. But he was worried that he might be grounded upon returning to his house. \"It's my fault. I was distracting him...sorry.\" Jasmine continued the conversation with Jak's mother. A little chit chat later, he was handed the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom.\" Jak said, eating his breakfast. \"I'm sorry I didn't call you guys right away. Forgive me, it won't happen again...Yes, I was with Jasmine. We crashed at a friends, he didn't want to drive us home at the moment, and we decided to stay the night.

Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd that go?\" Jasmine said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They let me off the hook this time.\" Jak said. \"They said, 'when your 18, we won't worry as much, but you're still a kid.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now for my parents...\" Jasmine said. \"Daddy might be upset at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.

Jak has been taking great care of me. Of course. Can Jak come over? He can? Thanks Dad, I'll see you soon. Love you too.

It's Sunday and we could watch football all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak's eyes widened. \"REALLY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm...\" Jasmine said, her eyes staring into Jak's eyes. \"Of course, there will a catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I know what it is...\" Jak smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate started to engage the Deathray's engines, and Shadow started up the nav system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, we're taking you guys back home...It's important that you guys be available at all times.\" Shadow said. \"We'll be able to travel at light speeds between places, so don't worry about distance.

Jak repacked all his things, and Jasmine did the same. However, they were aware of the crazy stress that was going to be upon them. Not being able to experience their high school lives to the fullest, they understood the sacrifice that had to be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak knew that this would be an interesting four years of high school, but this'll be some quick growing up. Not that it bothered him.

Jak would at least by her side, so it would be easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Jasmine came back into the ship's main navigator hub. Kate was at the helm of the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ready to go home?\" Kate said.  \"Just put in your addresses and we'll take off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Jak said. \"Here...we are....and as for Jasmine's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Jasmine said, blushing said. \"You remember my address? By heart?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else would I have sent those Valentine Day flowers?\" Jak said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled and kissed her boyfriend on the cheek. Shadow soon entered, but as a lean muscular male human. He had the appearance with brown hair, and blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay at one of the hotels.\" Shadow said, \"I'll blend in, and luckily, I was able to get the currency used here in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get money?\" Jak asked, curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember those thugs who attacked you guys? I tracked a few of them down last night, and got some infomation on the guy Maroni and Nostory.\" Shadow explained. \"Apparently, they confirmed that they were working for Seth and Nostory, and in exchange for their services, Maroni may become trouble. Nostory may try to make one of them into a higher up. I wouldn't doubt if we see a human-deamon hybrid. We need to stop the merging of the worlds...and I believe Nostory will try to unleash the entire deamon horde onto earth....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta stop that from happening.\" Jak said. \"Is there anyway we can try to stop them from getting to earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to travel back to the other reality to do that.\" Shadow said. \"I imagine that Nostory will do that at the end. But you're right Jak, we can't wait for them to get here, they'll decimate this world easily. For now...just get home and focus on school. We'll be in contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate punched in the coordinates to get Jak and Jasmine home. \"Get strapped in you two. Shadow, I'll be back before tonight. You best not get into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done. I'll continue to piece together clues of what we know so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kate, Jak, and Jasmine went on, as the Deathray went into cloaked mode. Shadow traveled to a nearby hotel in downtown LA. But not before being followed silently by one of Maroni's thugs. He didn't see where the Deathray was headed, but saw Shadow and assumed he was Jak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report back to the Boss.\" a voice said. \"We know the location of one of the kids.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shadow looked outside his window, seeing the streets, seeing people going about their business. 'Those people, it's a shame they don't know what danger they are in.' Shadow closed his hotel window, and continued to do his research of the Omega Legend. 'Lucius said that Jak is that dreamer who'll bring peace to the world once again. Makes sense, as he did bring the worlds back together.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door. Shadow quickly shapeshifted into a human and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Shadow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room Service.\" an gruff Italian voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it, but I didn't request it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's free food sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i><b>SAID</b></i> no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need to inspect the room, Jak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So they're here for the kids...' Shadow said. 'Maybe if I play this the right way, they'll lead right me to Nostory and Seth.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Come in.\" Shadow said, opening the door. Two men, dressed in all black rushed in the room. One of them tackled Shadow, but swiftly, the deamon headbutted the man knocking him out, and got up. The other man, who had shades on, shot a assault rifle at Shadow, but the bullets had no effect. Shadow moved at a quick speed, disarming the man with the gun, and dismantled the gun quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, he never said that this kid had powers!\" the man with shades said, trying to make a run for it. Shadow quickly shut the door and held the man against a wall, then reverting back to his Deamon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're one of the-\" the man was shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I'm a deamon like Nostory and Seth.\" Shadow said. \"I'm not the boy your looking for. But maybe you can help me find the two I mentioned just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling you anything - <b>ack!</b>\" The thug was getting choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want to see what's life like without lungs, I suggest you talk quickly.\" Shadow said, showing his free hand and it was flowing with dark energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Ok! Our operations are nearby in an warehouse, near an alley! You can find the other two demons or whatever the hell you guys are!\" The thug said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else you can tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are planning to reshape the world or something, saying that the earth will be different when we take over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Shadow said, then punching the thug in the head, knocking him out, and tossing him along with the other thug. \"Ok, now I know where to find those two. But they want to change the world forever. Not good. I need to alert Kate. We can't allow the earth's appearance to change...our main goal right now is to take down the last of  deamons and to prevent that full on change of merging...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow quickly tied up the gangsters, waiting until night to sit them out on a corner where two cops would pick them up.
