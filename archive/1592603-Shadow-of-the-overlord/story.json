The skin of a titan takes on the properties of different materials depending on their birthplace, parents and upbringing. Vagruel's skin is grey and rock like. No one knows what his face looks like since he almost always wears his custom forged suit of armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Many years ago, the titan race was numerous. They were calm and hard to anger creatures, leading a nomadic lifestyle, offering help to any other races they met on their travels. They were gentle giants in every sense of the world, there were of course exceptions, but none of them deviated as much as Vagruel did. He despised the fact that his brethren wasted their time helping weaker and vulnerable creatures. As his discontent grew more and more with every passing day, he eventually got enough and in the middle of the night he ran away from his clan's camp. From that point onward he used his size and strength to subjugate countless villages, towns and even castles. When he amassed a large enough army, he ordered every other titan to be killed, so that no one could truly challenge his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon: Morgenstern - a gigantic, 2 ton spiked mace, far too big and heavy for a normal human to lift. It's heavy blows make a mockery out of even the heaviest of armors. Vagruel swings it around with the same ease a human swings a toothpick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmor: Plate of the Fallen - A dark, ebony armor with an overall dark and menacing appearance. It also features several other spikes protruding from various parts of the body as well as six large horn-like spikes on the very top of the helmet, resembling a crown of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills: As per usual for high level overlords, Vagruel has 5 abilities, 1 passive and 4 active<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassive: Power of the Titans - His Titan heritage gives Vagruel enhanced strengthen and vulnerability<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActive 1: Crush - His basic attack. A Slow but devastating swing of his mace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActive 2: Ground pound - Vagruel hits the earth h with his mace sending out shock waves that deal low damage and have the chance to stun enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActive 3: Wrath of the Titans - Upon use, Vagruel heals a quarter of his health and gains a strength boost for a short period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimate: Overpower - Vagruel's sheer size and appearance are enough to strike fear in the hearts of even the mightiest adventurers. When using this ability, weaker creatures have the chance to submit totally to his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Like all Titans he is incapable of using magic. While his armor is unbreakable, it is vulnerable to magic and curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Empire: Several Towns and Castles under his control. Countless subjugated humans, all too afraid to betray him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Bases:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordheim - A gigantic, gothic castle, build specifically to accommodate Vagruel's size. Just as menacing and evil looking as it's overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope's End - a fortress carved into the side of a Volcano. With decorative lakes of lava flowing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you choose as a starting base?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With blue eyes and long, flowing, black hair. Clad only in a fur loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Huboria is an arid desert continent that Cragrig hails from. The young barbarian inherited the throne from his father, by killing him in a duel in accordance to Huborian tradition. Cragrig was much more ambitious and power hungry than his father ever was, quickly conquering all neighboring tribes. Now that his continet stands united under his rule, Cragrig has his eyes set on the fertile soil and rich cities of neighbouring lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon: The SkullCracker - A Double bladed, war axe, passed down from generations of Huborian rulers. It is enchanted with the strength of all of it's previous users, making its blows much more vicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmor: Bare Chest - As per Huborian tradition, all self respecting warriors must not wear anything to protect themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills: As per usual for high level overlords, Cragrig has 5 abilities, 1 passive and 4 active<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassive: Last Stand - The closer Cragrig is to death the stronger his attacks are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActive 1: Chop - His basic attack. A fast and powerful swing of his axe, best used against unarmored or lightly armored opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActive 2: Axe throw - Cragrig throws his axe at an enemy, after which he can use the weapon's arcane powers to call it back to his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActive 3: Barbaric Bellow - Cragrig lets out a Barbaric roar, scaring and lowering the power of enemies with low courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimate: Berserk - For a short time Cragrig gains increased damage and heals based on the damage he deals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Despite being a barbarian, Cragrig follows a code of honor. He punishes the cowardly and treacherous but he prizes and respects bravery and loyalty, regardless of if the person in question has the strength to back up his heroism<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Empire: Every kingdom in the desert land of Huboria. Hundreds of fearless, hardened warriors with undying loyalty to their king<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Bases:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stronghold. - A giant, well defended fortress carved into the side of a mountain. It is located deep within the Huborian wasteland<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFort Unguska. - A camp on the edge of the Huborian lands. Comfortably close to raid able kingdoms. While not well defended, there is an ancient statue in the middle know as the \"Warlord's Monument\" which significantly boost the morale of any Huborian soldiers residing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Base do you choose?</span></div></div>",

Oh, no ma'am. It should only be a few more minutes though.\" You sigh and cross your arms, you really don't want to have to wait for the food to cook, but it seems like you'll just have to wait. You stand there for about 5 seconds before you can't stand it any longer. \"Agh! This is so boring! I need something to do!\" General Mindlock turns a burger and listens to it sizzle as you glare at it, willing it to cook faster. \"Yes, it won't be long now. You should probably go for a swim, from what I hear the water is nice and cool. You'll have to wait an hour after you eat if you don't do it now, so why not?\" He had a point...</span></div></div>",

She seems to show up and disappear randomly which really annoys the people who work with her. Dispite being a minion for an evil overlord she would never do anything bad personaly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearence: She has long blonde hair with pink high-lites. She also has blue eyes and often wears something in her hair(mostly ribbons). She never wears her minion helmet because it would mess up her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilites: She is so cute and innocent that no one could stay mad at her for more then a minute. She can also cook and sew. (She once made sweaters for everyone on christmas.They were awful looking and a little itchy, but no one could bear to say anything bad about them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey may help you or they may hinder you. These are all the other major characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Ervai: He is your greatest foe and is always trying to find some way to put a stop to your evil plans. He is not above breaking the law as long as it would help him defeat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearence: He is tall, loud, and imposing. He has brown hair and wears an eye-patch.

He also commands an entire army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe president: He is the president of the world government and leader of the free world. He is kind, but also amazingly stupid and immature.

It also has a grow feature that can make things grow up to five times its normal size. The target can remain shrunk( or grown) for a maximum time of one hour. Uses AA batteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe C.L.A.W.: The C.L.A.W. is a metalic claw-shaped glove that can be worn on a hand or even a paw or tentacle. It is strong and sharp enough to cut through steel and can shoot lightning when it is fully charged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInformer: A small gadget that looks like a high-tech wrist watch. It displays info on anything you would want or need to know about. It also has a handy scan feature that can be used to give you infomation on anything it scans. All this and it can access the internet too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet boots: Let's face it, jetpacks are cool, but they are also clunky, heavy, and way too hard to control. Why risk being more easily injured when you could have everything a jetpack has in a smaller, sleeker package. These boots can do anything your old jetpack could do, only better and safer. Plus it runs on recycleable fuel cells that don't pollute the air like a jetpack would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaser gun: It shoots lasers and its a gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil cane: What looks like a harmless(yet awesome) cane is really one of your most powerful wepions. It can be wielded like a sword or...well, thats pretty much it...but it is really cool looking and indestructable to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinister cape: It looks like an ordinary cape...because it IS an ordinary cape! Mwa ha ha ha...oh, and its fireproof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mindmaster: A remote control that can take control of anyone within 10 feet of you. Its effects last for 5 minutes at a time before needing to be recharged. If a mind controled person leaves its 10 feet radius at any time the effects wear off and the person is returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally stylish goggles: They do nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuriken gun: Admit it, you've always wanted one of these. In addition to normal shuriken it can also shoot elemental shuriken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVehicles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShow off all your cool vehicles to your enimies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight specter: The night specter is your all-perpose personal jet. Armed with wepions and gadgets galore it has enough power to knock most other aircraft right out of the sky. Its also really cool looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoom buggy: An all-terrian armored buggy that is equiped with several wepions and can also transform into a boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellishcopter: A fierce and intimidating battle helicopter that has duel machine guns, a long-range flamethrower, missle launchers, a mini-nuke, and cupholders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe T.A.N.K: The T.A.N.K. is just like any normal tank...except ten times stronger and able to float on water. It is also faster then a normal tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoadripper: You know that really cool motorcycle from Ghostrider? This is basicly the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You have complete control of the overlord, including their appearance, gender, and powers. Heck, they don't even have to be human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Mild cursing is fine. No F bombs, S bombs, or slurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. This story is mainly adventure/comedy. How much of each is up to you though, the story can be dead serious with few funny moments, or a grand comedy that can't take itself seriously for a minute.
