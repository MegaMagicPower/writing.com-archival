Kyra found herself relocated right outside the boundary of the castle where she usually lived in, but now, she was outside in the cold, fresh air, shrouded by the blanket of darkness that the heavens gave. A myriad of stars glittered above, but it was the half-lit moon that shined down its majestic white light on the village below. She wrapped her arms around herself, trying to warm up a bit as she was wearing the same clothes right after she came out of the bathtub. A white, long-sleeved, fur-coated bathrobe around her entire body, secured by a single cloth-made belt tied around her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered gingerly down the road in her white, fuzzy slippers. Nearly everyone was inside their homes at this time, but there were still lights behind the windows. Her long, dark, freshly-combed hair wavered with the gentle night breeze as she observed the neighboring structures around her. Deep down, she knew this was wrong and would be against her family's will, but that also made it exciting. Keeping secrets and wandering the in dark, not knowing what would happen, the princess already felt the thrill of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, let's find a more adventurous place to explore. Where should she head towards?    </span></div></div>",

So, just thinking of the excitement and fear that she will experience powered up her legs to head over in that direction. Several kilometers south, the princess at last found herself surrounded by trees that hid within the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously pacing herself to avoid tripping over roots or bumping into trunks, Kyra felt her heart pumping and beating, and she truly felt like an adventurer by the time she knew for certain that she was lost.

It became hard to tell, but she believed she was still heading in the general direction of the possible trail she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d glimpsed, although now all Kyra could see were trunks, limbs, branches and vines of what seemed like an increasingly thick area of growth all around her.  It was hard to tell where she really was going, as she was forced to make so many choices to go around obstacles like spiderwebs, thorns, and dank pools of water amidst the thickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She began to fear she was really in some serious trouble when she attempted to retrace her steps away from what appeared to be a serpent moving in a branch ahead (or so it appeared, though it might have been a sentient vine for all Kyra could see of it), only to discover her previous route throttled with thorny vines.  Now, her only way away from the slithering danger ahead would force her to crawl under low laying branches on her hands and knees!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thought that she might have gotten herself into some trouble from which she might not easily be extricated, if she were ever found at all, began to seriously come up for consideration, and Kyra became increasingly distressed, even as she daintily attempted to scoot and crawl and sneak through ever-tightening limbs and branches, until she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even say for certain where the ground itself now lay.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now genuinely alarmed and nearly tearing up at her circumstances, Kyra was crawling on her belly when she began to first feel a snag back around her lower robe.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, what now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, fussed Kyra, as she attempted to yank the robe seam free from whatever it had snagged on, only to seemingly have it pulled even further off of her, so that it is down around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Kyra cried out, as she again feels her robe tugged down and off her.  She is now so tangled up in the vines and branches that each of her limbs feels caught in random directions, but Kyra manages to look far enough over her shoulder to see a giant, glittering monster moth winning the tug-of-war for her precious robe, which it was even now devouring with an almost insect-like glee.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive that back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Kyra screams at the huge moth, even managing to kick her leg free of the entrapping vines and swipe at the moth.  However, all this manages to do is jostle some of the moth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glitter all over Kyra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body from above, before the beast flies off into the dark with her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, her sudden movement seems to cause the vines to tighten all around Kyra, even tighter than before, and she finds herself in quite a fix, in only her dainties and slippers now, trapped in a preposterous prone position inside a veritable cluster of vines.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh dear!  Someone, please help me!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in quite a fix!   Hello?  Anyo-nghggh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and poor Princess Kyra suddenly finds a slender tendril of vine tightening around her neck when she makes any sounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon becomes apparent to Kyra that as long as she remains still and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to call out to anyone, the vines slightly loosen their grip, but as soon as she struggles or makes any sounds with her mouth, she feels the strangle of the vine, almost as if it is warning her.  </div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Obviously, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suspect that his majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own daughter might herself be in the service of an enemy state; but I need to know if you are perhaps unwittingly in league with agents of hostile intent, and thus I intend on discovering anyone involved in your attempt to leave the palace grounds, my lady.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that you know that, due to your position in the kingdom, there are certain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6methods which we will refrain from applying in your case.  However, I intend to nonetheless make you tell me everything you know, dear pretty little Kyra.  There are other, time-honored methods that leave no permanent mark on a body, but have their own subtle effect on the spirit.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need for the King to know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found you just yet, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been dying to show you how powerless even you are while I carefully make my plans to assume power.   And when the King is finally gone, I'll make you my little slut slave and parade you around for all to degrade and debase.  Ha! Ha! Ha!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to know that, until that fateful day, we are always watching you, and that you can never escape\", the evil vizier informs the horrified princess.  </div></span></div></div>",

For the longest of time, she could sense the corrupted nature of this man, but now he had just openly admitted having plans to take over the king\u2019s position and stated to turn her into his \u2018little slut slave\u2019. Kyra\u2019s face was reddened from her position. Her white bathrobe was no longer covering her body; her pearl-colored bra and lingerie were all that\u2019s left on her. She was kneeling within a bird cage, one large enough for someone of her size to just barely squeeze inside. Straight vertical metal bars encircled her, all of which converging to the center like a dome. Her arms were raised over her head, wrists cuffed in manacles that were chained to the hook hanging off the center point of the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cage hung off a strong wire that wrapped around a pulley system attached the ceiling. What lies below was a calm pool of water of unknown depths. <br>\r\n\u201cYou! Release me this instance! How dare you confine me in a cage and expose my body like so?\u201d Kyra growled at her how she was being treated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what? No one knows you\u2019re here. If anyone asks, I could easily tell them that you went missing just like you intended to. No one is going to rescue you. You\u2019re just a spoiled, pampered girl whose only usefulness is her physical appeal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fiend! Do seriously think you can get away with this within my own castle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s put that to the test, shall we?\u201d The vizier stood right outside of her cage and reached his arms in between the bars. The brunette lurched back in terror as his hands grabbed the straps of her bra before ripping them off her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra gasped as her sacred breasts were now fully exposed, seen for the first time by someone other than herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vizier tossed the item of clothing into the pool of water as the cloth darkened as it soaked in the water before slowly drowning. He then began groping her breasts with his bare hands, \u201cOh look! I am groping the princess\u2019 breasts, and there\u2019s nothing she can do about it. How does it feel to be so powerless, my dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! You dare defile my body?\u201d Kyra gritted her teeth. These violating hands then pinched and pulled on her nipples, causing her to cry out in pain, \u201cAHHH!\u201d She arched her back and shifted forward as they were pulled and held in place. Her eyes squeeze out a teardrop at the sheer humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think this is defilement, then you\u2019ve seen nothing yet. You\u2019re far too pure in both mind and body to understand what true defilement is.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, her writhing motions only serve to sink her inches lower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra now clutches to a surprisingly slippery tree-root, and decides that it would be better to make her way home barefoot from this little misadventure outside the comfortable confines of the palace rather than be swallowed up and lost to all forever in this warm, muddy grave in the midst of the old misty forest, \u201cLooks like I\u2019d better pull myself out without my comfy goosefeather-lined slippers, decides the pampered princess as she tries to pull herself out of the suddenly stiffening goop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming genuinely worried now, Kyra begins to shiver and hiccups out a plaintive, \u201cH-Hello!

The chilliness and eerie animal noises had set the mood just perfect. Several kilometers away from home, Kyra had walked longer than she could ever recall, and fatigue rushed into her legs. From here, there were quite a few farmlands on either side of the pathway of dense dirt, and since she needed a place to rest, Kyra thought about asking one of these farmers who may be kind enough to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the front door, she then clasped her hands while patiently waiting for a response. Footsteps from the other side could be heard as someone approached closer towards the entrance. The knob turned and the wooden door swung open inwards, revealing an average-built man with some defined muscles in his arms that were trained from daily chores. A small glimmer of light shined out from the fire subtlety dancing over the pile of woods, showing some of the physical features of the guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening sir,\" the girl bowed her head forth out of respect. Her gentle tone carried on to ask a favor, \"Would you be able to spare some space just for tonight? I won't take up much room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmer stepped aside before gesturing her to come in, \"Sure thing, I'll think of somewhere for you to stay.\" And as he watched the child stepping into the light, his eyes gave a small hint of surprise by how attractive she truly was. For her to be wearing a bath robe and slippers, he dared not ask the exact detail of what happened to her. Something deep within him stirred, a yearning perhaps. No, it was much stronger than that; it was lust. In just an hour or so, everyone would be ready to retire and go straight to bed. Nighttime, one can do many things in stealth; the setting was perfect. His family did not know about the guest yet, but maybe, just maybe he should keep it a secret. Let's not bother them about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes glared towards the youth kneeling in front of the fireplace with the palm of her open hands catching the warmth from the flames.

Betty, the farmer's wife, and his sons came into the main hall and stared at the girl who turned her head when she heard them approach her. A hardly audible sigh emerged from the farmer's throat. There was no escape from the other family members with a beautiful girl in this crammed place. Mother and boys were in totally different states of mind. \"Who's she?\" his wife demanded to know, displeased with the sight of a beautiful and much younger girl who had the farmers' full attention. \"Make her go away\" she ordered. She remembered numerous encounters between her husband, whom she blamed for this miserable farm, and the village girls. But the curious boys raced ahead to stand next to the teenage princess. The farmer cleared his throat. \"She does not seem to know where to go tonight. Look at her. She's not one of the others.

Shadows were cast behind her, dimly revealing the internal wooden structure and possession in this root cellar. After the long walk to get this far from home, she believed a well-deserved rest was at hand. Raising her arms upwards, she stretched while yawning, an normally impolite gesture around others but when alone, manners weren't necessary. Speaking of manners, someone or something suddenly grasped around her wrists, tugging her up to her feet with a powerful pulling force from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess gave a short shrieked by the unexpected circumstances that came without warning. Her head gazed upwards towards the ceiling where a sophisticated network of vines grew upon the surface, but now those same green vines had came to life, now coiling and slithering down her arms to get a stronger possession over her. Using her very weight to pull down, the girl resisted, trying to pull herself free from this moving plant, \"What is this? How could this be possible?\" Being the fit and slender girl as she was, she was too light to offer much downward force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, a pair of vines coiled around her bare thighs, constricting her upper legs before heaving them off the ground entirely. Kyra felt her body being raised even higher with her arms fully stretched up as her legs thighs were suddenly raised up parallel to the floor. The vines had no trouble supporting her weight, but just to make her more helpless, another pair of vines wrapped around her ankles from above, pulling her legs outwards. The princess was now suspended in the air, forced to the do a split with her natural flexibility.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching her teeth, she struggled against these confinements, \"Let go of me!\" Just when the idea of screaming for help came to her mind, she opened her mouth, only to have her voice muffled by a thick vine wrap over her mouth and around her head. \"Mmm! MMMMM!\" Her teeth were forced to bite into the green surface of the plant that gagged her mouth. More and more vines approached her from behind and side, proceeding to unwrap their present to see the gift inside. Two of them slipped from the heels, stroking upwards across her soles before knocking the slippers off her small silky feet. Another one slipped beneath the knot around her waist, pulled the strip of fabric off as it falls to the floor. The girl's bathrobe loosened revealing her midriff, bra, and underwear. Kyra could do nothing but watch as all of this happen to her helpless body. Heartbeat pounded faster in fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet, belly, and armpits were quickly exposed and assaulted in an unwanted, playful manner, being stroked and probed relentlessly and mercilessly. \"HMMMM! HMM! MMM!\" Laughter spewed out, but the gag blocked the sound from reaching too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

At most, the two of them exchanged names. Her host went by the name of Borin, a fellow farmer in these parts of the land. Kyra gave out her name but hid the fact of her status as a princess for obvious reasons. A single yawn from her mouth became the signal for the grown up to start guiding her to a place to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a barn outside you could sleep in. There's lots of hay you could use as a bed,\" the brown-haired man stepped out of the house, leading his guest back into the cold outside. A blanket was folded up in his arms before handing it to Kyra to help her stay warm for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess wasn't too disappointed to sleeping in such a place. Ever since she left home, her mind was well aware that there wouldn't be a bed conveniently for her to sleep each night. She was thankful enough to at least have a roof over her head, \"Thank you very much. I wish I can repay you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll let you know if can help me with something, but for now, make yourself comfortable,\" said the older one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of large wooden doors opened outwards on its hinges, and within were loose piles of hay on each side. Wooden pillars and beams supported the structure from above, and there were even some farming tools settling near the walls. The girl sauntered inside, exploring the interiors some more as Borin carried a portable lamp to illuminate the dark room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you need anything else,\" said the host as he stepped outside, closing the large doors but not completely shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on a pile of hay, Kyra lied flat on her back with a blanket covering her body. Everything was dark and cozy, so falling asleep didn't seem to be a problem. Still, her mind was storming with thoughts on what just happened this night, but soon, the teenage girl fell into a deep slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Borin was in an interesting position, especially with his guest revealing her name. How naive of her because with that kind of beauty about her, anyone with a brain would suspect her as a princess. Kyra? Pfft, just how many Kyras could there possibly be? It had to be her! What in the world was someone as wealthy and fine such as her doing in the region where lower-class workers dwell in? Whatever the case, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Ropes, pulleys, tools, and equipment, being a farmer gave him plenty of options to mess with the girl's body. It wasn't even midnight yet, and he had until sunrise to have his fun before his family wakes up by the rooster's call. That was plenty of time for him. He would lose some sleep, but this wasn't something he would pass up. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About an hour after they separated Borin sneaked out of the house. He paused some time for his eyes to adjust to the dark and went to the door of the barn. He knew it would make noise when he pushed it open properly. But the princess had locked the door. Also the shutters at the windows on the ground floor were closed. He went around the barn, climbed the ladder to the little open window in the first floor and squeezed through. He moved carefully to the edge of the gallery and peeked down. Resting in the corner on a small haystack was the princess, covered by a woolen blanked.  Very carefully Borin climbed down the ladder to the floor of the barn. He tiptoed to a long series of shelves and picked some of the items he considered best for the original assault. It took a few minutes to form the thin leather ropes from older whips into the intended shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith utmost care he approached the sleeping princess. She was lying on her side, fully dressed, albeit now barefoot, with her arms serving as a makeshift pillow. First he went to her feet, which he stuck into two adjacent prepared slopes on a longer leather line, painfully avoiding to touch her feet, and tightened the slopes. Then he tried to repeat this exercise with her hands, which was more difficult. Once in the process, she shifted her head, making him pause and hold his breath. Finally, also the hands were tied in two slopes. Borin pulled a woolen cloth from his bag, it in his hand, and squeezed her side hard. Her eyes went wide open and her mouth opened for a cry. Just then he stuffed the cloth into her mouth. Surprised, she tried to fend it off with her hands, but it took some seconds for her to find out that she could not move them separately. Princess Kyra was in a state of confusion between shock and anger. How dared anyone, let alone this lower class farmpersion, treat her like this. He would certainly let her go immediately and express his excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried the thrashing and grunting girl to a larger block of straw, which he pushed with his body to the place where it should be. Placing her backwards on the straw block, he pulled the leather line tied to her hands, and tied it quickly to the metal foot of one of his farm tools, which would be much too heavy for her to pull away. Princess Kyra turned her body in force. She made a full turn to the edge of the block and would have hit the ground quite heavily, had she not been able at the last instant to bring her legs and butt down first. Nevertheless her behind got a good knocking from the barn floor. Turning around the farmer shook his head and smiled. Such resistance was fine for him. He would challenge her for more. Grabbing her around her body, which made her make some muffled noise the farmer could not understand, he put her again on the block. Quickly he grabbed her feet. From the central beam under the roof of the barn a number of ropes were dangling, usually used to fix wet gear to dry in the barn. He wrapped the leather rope through one of those rings and fixed it. Princess Kyra now rested with her head, backside and butt on the straw block, while her legs were rising in a 45 degree angle towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to resist Borin gave her feet a quick tickle on the soles and instep, making her back lift from the straw. He was satisfied that the muffled shrieks of laughter would not penetrate the air to the residential block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Borin shook his head. Like his captive, he was having a hard time believing this was really happening. He was a grizzled man, hardened by a life of toil that was only barely rewarded. How many harvests had he lost in total, he wondered, to the tax-men of the king? His mind wandered to his youth, when a dashing nobleman had passed by the fam, and seeing Borin's then-young-and-pretty wife, ordered his men to carry her off with them; days later, he found her disheveled and barefoot in the woods, still lashed to a tree, her ankles raw from the ropes tied tightly around them, holding them at just the right height for the noble and his men to play with them. He'd done nothing then--what could he do? Vengeance was out of the question--like the rest of the peasants, Borin knew it was his role in life to survive, and if that meant the nobles did as they pleased, so it was to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, he had the most jaw-droppingly beautiful princess in generations squirming helplessly in front of him. Her royal hair, so smooth and shiny, was splayed across his straw. Her lithe, taut, teenage body writhed furiously; her long, bare legs dangling in front of him. Best of all, her delicate, perfect feet now struggled in vain, trying to work their way out of his leather bonds. Gods, and what feet they were! So soft and smooth, they seemed to have never been walked on. Creamy-white arches, gently-pink heels and toes; supple and young and gorgeous. Borin's wife was old now, alternately bony and fat in all the wrong places. Even the harlots in the village tavern were impossible to compare to Kyra. He'd never imagined such a lovely creature, and her gentle, friendly demeanor during their first meeting only inflamed his lusts further. The girl had no right to be so pure, so pretty, so sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out to her feet. Kyra had ceased trying to wiggle them free, and was now trying to pull her knees towards her chest and then kick out violently. He'd pulled the leather rope fairly taut, so her kicks were small and relatively harmless, but it was an enjoyable enough sign of her defiance. She continued shouting angrily into her filthy gag. Her voice, even when afraid and furious, was truly lovely. He hated the girl's perfection so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze when his rough, callused fingers wrapped around her tiny teen foot. He laid a torn, jagged set of fingernails against her tender sole, and she remained frozen, her eyes now locked on his. She shook her head slowly, her anger subsumed by a sudden fear. <br>\r\n\"I see you'e a ticklish girl,\" Borin said. \"So you know what it means when my fingers are like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for a moment, his eyes feasting on her absolutely perfect feet. Then he looked back at her. \"That was a question. I expect an answer.\"<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Kyra made the slightest, smallest nod.<br>\r\n\"Good! That's good. Good girl. When I ask a question, I expect an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorin's heart was pounding in his chest. He couldn't help himself--he so desperately wanted to rake his filthy nails down the princess' lovely little feet. It was an opportunity that was rarer than once in a lifetime. He couldn't stop savoring the imminence of her torture, and he loved the look of fear in the girl's bright, frightened eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what's going to happen?\" he asked. Again, after a long moment, Kyra nodded, still trembling. <br>\r\n\"You know once I stop, it might be quite a while until I stop,\" Borin added, leaning in close to Kyra's foot. Her soles were so soft, so supple, so tender in his hand--the bounty of youth mixed with the payoff of privilege. A sudden desire raced through him, and the burly farmer leaned close to Kyra's tied feet. His mouth opened, and his tongue emerged, inching closer and closer to her soles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra scowled and let out a muffled shriek of rage. The moment she'd been waiting for had come. At once, she pulled her feet away from his grip what little bit she could, and then with all the force in her legs kicked out. The slim teen was far from a mule, but it was still the best kick she could muster, and it landed square on Borin's nose. If her heel had been less soft, or her legs less willowy, or her bindings less restrictive, it probably would have caused extreme pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was a tightly-tied, wispy sixteen-year-old girl. He recoiled from the blow, saw a moment of stars, and then was himself again. Kyra had followed the kick with a renewed effort to escape, but to no avail. A moment later, the angry farmer was hauling her back onto the bale of hay. <br>\r\n\"How dare you!\" Kyra sputtered, spitting the gag from her mouth enough to speak. \"I'll never give in to your evil! I won't so much as smirk--\" she was saying, as Borin shoved the gag back in place and tied it again around her head.  He stormed back to where her feet were still suspended in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good move, but a damn stupid one!\" he steamed, though on the inside, he was pleased. Her defiance only further inflamed him. \"And you'll more than giggle, girl. You'll laugh until you die!\" <br>\r\nThere <i>were</i> stories of monsters that kidnapped young girls and subjected them to that very fate, but of course Borin had no intention of truly hurting the young princess. But he did plan on using her well, and even as she shouted another muffled protest into her gag, he seized her slender ankles and began scratching her bare soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra inhaled sharply as the sensation reached her, but pressed her eyes shut. The girl was determined not to give the filthy farmer the pleasure of seeing her laugh--it was repulsive enough he was touching her royal person, and her bare feet at that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorin let out a low groan as he raked the tips of his nails over her beautiful feet. She wasn't laughing, but he could tell from the way she curled and flexed her toes and tried to pull her feet away that she was feeling the effects of the tickle torture. She was definitely a ticklish young girl--he didn't even know about the witch's curse, which amplified the effect even more! He switched from his random attack and put all five nails against the top of her feet, then slo-o-o-owly dragged them down her soles, from toes to heel. Kyra pulled as hard as she could, raising her back totally free of the hay bale and letting a faint 'eep!' out of her pretty lips as Borin did so. Naturally, he repeated the move a second time, slower, and then repeated it in reverse. Each time, Kyra let out a faintly louder sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl,\" Borin purred. \"Let it out. You can even beg, if you want. Beg me to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra shook her head furiously.<br>\r\n\"Your choice, girly-girl,\" the farmer replied, and he raked down her soles again, then back up them, and then down yet again, with no pause for the girl to catch a breath. She was now rolling from side to side on the hay bale, her teeth clenched firmly around the cloth gag, the picture of determined resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Borin used just his index and pointer fingers, wiggling them against the soft skin just under her cute bubble toes. He kept it up until she was panting and her eyes shot open, and in between gasps the teen let out a few unwilling moans that were so torturously close to being giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is,\" Borin boasted. \"Let it out, girl! Let it out!\" And he dug in even harder, now adding in his thumbs which he used to tickle her delicate arches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnn!\" Kyra cried. \"Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!\" The whine was pained and low and desperate. She was breaking, and all the kicks she managed did nothing to slow Borin. <br>\r\n\"I've got very strong hands. All the fieldwork,\" he explained, keeping the tickle going ceaselessly. \"You might as well just take a real breathe and start begging now. I'll be merciful then, really!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Kyra cried out, thrashing her head from side to side violently. The gag had fallen aside again, but Borin was okay with that. He expected to hear her beg anyhow. <br>\r\n\"I'll never give in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all at once, Borin set in with all five fingers, each worming against their own specific part of the princess' teenage feet, and the girl's cry of surprise broke into a ceaseless string of tortured laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! That's it!\" Borin cried out victoriously, watching the beautiful princess thrash from side to side, barefoot and helpless against his torture. It was the crowning moment of his entire life so far. Her laughter was as sweet and innocent as the rest of her, he noticed with glee. He stopped and watched the girl continue to wiggle and shiver as the sensation continued to echo through her tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the pile of tools he'd collected earlier and picked up a stiff brush. He carried it to Kyra's head. <br>\r\n\"That's just my welcome. You've got such wonderful little feet. I've never even heard of anything like it. Don't worry, I plan on keeping my hands on them as much as possible. But there are other...options. See this, girl?\" he asked, lifting the brush. \"We use it to clean the horses. The quills are mighty tough. I've always been curious \" He lifted the gag and shoved it back into her mouth. \"For this, I can't risk you waking the wife,\" he explained, and slowly stalked back to the girl's struggling feet, smiling mockingly. Internally, Kyra was already wincing. The young princess was so furious and yet very frightened. She didn't know how she was going to get out of this--she only knew she had to keep fighting until she saw a chance to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorin lifted the brush and set it against Kyra's delicate teenaged soles. The farmer and the girl locked eyes, and</span></div></div>",

Images ran through his mind of his wife peering in the barn door just in time to see him raking at Kyra's young soles. He'd never, ever hear the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuffed the gag deeper into Kyra's mouth and snarled into her ear while she gagged. \"Not a word, girl! Not so much as a hiss! If my wife finds you, I swear on all the spirits I'll call you a witch and say you enchanted me. My wife won't believe it, but that won't stop her from having you burned at the stake. She's a jealous woman and whatever pain she'll inflict on me will be damnably worse for a thing like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe straightened and raced from the barn. <br>\r\n\"Over here, over here, woman,\" he called, and the sounds of voices began to sink away from the barn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone and still tied, Kyra was unsure what to do. She was alone, and for the moment, the attack on her feet had stopped. She wasn't sure if Borin was likely to return, or if his suspicious wife would drag him back to the farmhouse. Should she make a noise and risk the woman's possible fury? Kyra was certain about one thing: the gag in her mouth had to go. It was vile; filthier than any cloth she'd ever been near. She chewed and spat and worked the cloth again out of her mouth. At least Borin was no trained bandit, she thought. Accentuate the positive! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she continued to wiggle her wrists. Borin had clearly been careful when he bound her, and the knots were practiced and tight. Kyra's only hope lay in her thin frame--she twisted and pulled and turned her wrists, struggling to slide them out of the ropework. <br>\r\n\"Stay calm,\" she whispered to herself. \"You don't know how long you have. He could be back. He might not. Just stay calm and be careful. You can do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra meant what she said. She'd never yet, in her young life, found a problem she couldn't solve. She was pretty, funny, charming, intelligent, energetic, and if all else failed, wealthy. Now, though, she had to rely on her exceptional agility and flexibility. <br>\r\n\"This might hurt,\" she grumbled, once her hand was in position. With a great tug, she pulled her fingers through the somewhat-loosened binding. <br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she cried, using her free, if somewhat sore, hand to attack the loop around her other wrist. Within a minute, her arms were free and she shoved the gag away from her body entirely. Now she lay on a bale of hay, her feet still tightly looped in leather above her, annoyingly hard to reach. By performing the most awkward sit-up of her life, she could reach her ankles, but Borin's knots were out of reach. The best Kyra could do was attempt to pull at the bindings and make them looser. Again, her tiny feet were crucial to her escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was making good headway when a noise outside the barn sent her heart racing. <br>\r\n\"Almost, almost,\" Borin's voice announced. \"I'm just to check the harness for a moment, and I'll be right in. Yes, yes. No, just a moment. No, I don't look sweaty. It was just some heavy lifting, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go time,\" Kyra said, trying to keep from whimpering. Whatever Borin had planned for his 'moment,' she wanted no part of it. Time was running out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Borin stepped into the barn.

The loops he'd tied were shockingly tight, however, and the supple leather was far harder to slip free of than dry and dusty hemp. The princess tried to unravel the knots, and while the girl did have capable fingers, she couldn't reach far enough, long enough, to make any headway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" She whimpered, kicking helplessly against the bindings. Her feet were still tingling from Borin's merciless tickling, and she didn't think she'd have any better chance at escape than now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was still kicking and mewling furiously when the farmer returned, a smug smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a fiery girl!\" he said, slapping away her barrage of meager punches and seizing up her slender arms. He twisted slightly, sending a shock of pain up Kyra's arms. She let out a yelp and froze--no man had ever caused her physical pain before, not intentionally. Her luminous eyes met his and she realized just how much power the man had over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Borin said. \"One twist and I could snap your delicate little arms like a twig. Two twigs. Maybe I will. After all, it makes you no less beautiful if your arms are broken. Those precious little feet of yours would still be all mine.\" He dragged her arms back over her head and tied them once more to the old anvil, this time pulling the loops tighter. Now, the girl could only barely wiggle her body from side to side. Borin even pulled the knots around her ankles tight again, scratching a finger down her tender soles again and prompting Kyra to let out a surprised giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a bad thing to try,\" he chided, dragging yet another finger down her other soft sole. \"How should I punish you, do you think? Because you're so pretty, I'll let you choose. They're all going to be endless fun for me, I promise.\" Again, Borin ran a hungry eye down the beautiful girl's captive body, stretched out and exposed before him. \"You know, for such a skinny young girl, you do have an amazing rack,\" he announced, admiring the gentle curves of her perky, firm breasts, protected from his gaze by only a thin layer of fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's proposal one. We see again just how much you'll laugh and beg for mercy,\" Borin announced. He looked longingly at her squirming teenage feet. \"I undo your gag, and put this brush to these gentle little feetsies of yours. I'll keep going until you tell me to stop, and then I will stop, as per your order!\" Kyra narrowed her gaze, waiting for his terms. Borin grinned wickedly. \"But when you do, I take off that robe and get to see all the bounty of your youth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra shuddered in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never let a monster like you touch me so,\" she growled bravely, but her eyes belied her fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you will. I can't wait! But there's another option. Instead of a brush, I gag you up nice and tight, pull up a chair, and you give me a footjob.\" He waited for Kyra's reaction of horror, and when it didn't come, he added. \"That means I wrap your girly feet around my man member, and you rub it nice and smooth with those soft little soles until I coat them in slavery-sauce. Then, you lick them nice and clean for me. Once you do that, I take you out and set you free. This way, we both win. It's not like my wife would let me keep you. I might even toss in a few coins to help you out if you do a good enough job.  Sound fair?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra was horrified at both options. She longed to be free from this wretched madman, but how could a princess be expected to pay such a humiliating price?</span></div></div>",

Kyra found herself bound in a kneeling posture, with her head trapped at the neck in the sort of stocks the farmer would keep his pigs in when they feed from the trough.  Another bolt of lightning and thunder strikes outside, even as the farmer suddenly causes Kyra to clamp down on a wooden bit gag with leather strands he ties tight behind her neck.  Now, Kyra is helpless, with her arms bound off away from her shoulders to the sides of the trough, and her legs spread and bent so that her feet are on display, along with her arched back and precious bottom bobbing around she is quite the helpless sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cD\u00e2\u0080\u0099you know why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing this to you, girl?

However, what you are probably unaware of, is that those commoners you blithely interact with on your little forays are often rounded up, and brought to your Majesties dread torture dungeons, where they are tormented in ways that cause them to lose their minds, though their bodies rarely bear any marks.  My own blessed Danika played with you last year when you managed to briefly escape from your own birthday parade through the town.  When your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dungeon fiends were done with my daughter, she was a babbling, shivering, shuddering mess.

Following the figure riding the broom in the sky above, Kyra followed on foot until she reached the hideout located at the base of a mountain. Once she stepped inside, the room was empty. The walls were completely circular as if inside a giant tree trunk. Shelves full of books, tables full of liquid-containing tubes, and the floor was covered up by a pattern with intricate designs. The witch immediately came back and spotted the intruder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got some nerve to be spying on me, child!\" a harsh tone erupted out. Thrusting out a palm out, she gestured her hand to point up, and suddenly, the princess levitated off the ground. The girl's slippers naturally fell off during her ascension, and her wrists and ankles were trapped by a glowing yellow ring, hindering her movements at those four joints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misbehaving girls should be taught a lesson,\" said the witch as she fanned out her hand, manifesting two disembodied floating white glove-wearing hands in midair. They floated towards the girl's small tender feet before the fingers wiggled against the soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh dear! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! That tickles! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\" Kyra giggled and squirmed, futilely resisting the magic that trapped her in place. This unusual punishment was harmless, but it became more and more unbearable the longer it went. Nothing like this had ever happened at home; no one had ever treated a princess quite like this. At first, she accepted this punishment, believing it was well deserved for spying on the witch. It was entirely her fault after all, but after two minutes of laughing with her face turning red, this was becoming intolerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Please... He-ha-ha-ha-ha! I beg of you... Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Stop this- he-he-he-he-ha-ha-ha-ha! I'm so sorry-ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older one glared sadistically towards the princess's pleading; it was enjoyable. To watch the person you're jealous of to be tortured like this gave her a sense of empowerment. After another two minutes passed by while she stood by watching it all, she released the magic that bounded the royal figure, \"Alright, that's enough for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra lied on her back against the floor, panting and gasping for air. Her eyes noticed four doors extruding from the circular wall around her, unsure the meaning behind it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choose one of the doors. If you pass the trial, you may leave. If you don't want to take the trial, that's fine with me; it just means you'll get tickled again in a much crueler manner,\" the witch explained what shall happen next, and it was now up to Kyra to decide her fate. </span></div></div>",

Whatever it meant, the entire point of accepting the witch's deal beforehand had been to explore the outside world, and it seemed like there would be an adventure of its own behind each of these four doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Kyra stepped up to the furthest door to her left and turned the knob. Meanwhile, the witch behind her let out a devious smirk, knowing full well what will be installed for her behind the first door. Stepping forth, there appeared to be only darkness down a long hallway with another door on the other end. Suddenly, the door behind her closed on its own with the clicking of locks sounding out. From this point on, there was no turning back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just her slippers playing tricks on the nerves of her recently tortured feet, but the floor felt awfully spongy and soft. About halfway across, this trial seemed to be fairly straightforward so far, but then her legs suddenly froze. She tried to lift up her feet, but it was as if they were glued onto the floor. A sinking sensation was felt as if standing over quicksand. Immediately, Kyra slipped out of her shoes, immediately feeling and hearing a squelching sensation on her bare feet. It was wet and sticky as if stepping on the slime of snails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to march forth, something wrapped around her wrists and ankles on both sides. Whatever grasped onto her had the same squishy texture as the floor, and the girl pulled and tugged her limbs away, futilely trying to free herself. Suddenly, the appendages raised her arms up above her head, causing a reflexively shriek out of her. Her hands clenched into fists, rotating her wrists and tugging down with all her weight, but it was of no use. Much to her surprise, her ankles were lifted upwards while her upper body sharply dropped backwards, resulting her to be in a suspended handstand position, hanging upside down. Her hands were still out out stretched, barely over the floor but her wrists were still caught under these slimy appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah... what's going on?\" the princess felt gravity flipped over as she continued to squirm her way out. Suddenly, lights emitting from the ceiling came on, revealing the true appearance of her situation. Her eyes widened to see the pink flesh-like substance coating the floor and walls; it was as if she was inside the stomach of a monster. Several tentacle-like appendages slithered down her legs and up her arms, coiling tighter each time she tried to resist. </span></div></div>",

She jumped a bit as the door slammed shut behind her, even if she had expected it. The princess then began to walk down the stone hall, which was covered in an old but fancy soft red rug and lit by torch sconces in the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso lining the walls were numerous ebony coffins with fanged skulls embossed in the front. Kyra gasped when she saw the morbid boxes, and tiptoed lightly down the room, afraid of what might come out. The door on the other side was barely visible, it was so far away. As she was squinting, she stopped looking where she was walking and smacked her toe on a displaced stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww! Ouchouchouch-\" Kyra then remembered where she was and stopped her outburst, but it was too late. Each coffin lid fell to the floor with a resounding thud, and figures began to shamble out. She gasped when she saw <i>things</i> shambling from the coffins. As they got closer she saw what the creatures were: moaning, shambling zombies! Their flesh was grey and they walked unsteadily, but their something stirred in their dull blue eyes when they saw supple young Kyra. The creatures all looked as if they used to be female, but no humanity was left in their dead eyes beyond pure lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParalyzed in fear, Kyra couldn't bring herself to move as the horrendous things walked towards her with slight smiles on their pale dead faces. The closest one reached forward with long, sharp fingernails and lightly scraped them over her ribs. \"Eek!\" Kyra squealed, and pulled away from the zombie. The quick tickle jolted her out of her fear and she sprinted down the long corridor. The zombies shambled after her, moaning with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To make matter worse, Mr. Wuggles had positioned himself atop her belly, and was busily running his soft paws along her sides, up and down her body, sending Kyra into a tickling conniption as even more animated toys and objects joined in the festivities, finding places to poke and prod along her young, delicate body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From myths and legends that she have read as a little girl, there had been countless of great heroes that took on challenging trials much like the one the witch will be giving her. There were four doors to choose from, but that wasn't quite true. If she was clever, there was technically a fifth door, and that was the door that she entered in as well as being her only true exit. Perhaps this was a test of cleverness because any ordinary frightened girl would be too worried in picking the right door out of the four, but for the princess, the answer was obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Kyra pointed her finger towards the exit, \"I pick that one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go ahead, step through that door,\" the witch grinned victoriously. In truth, no matter which door was picked, her naughty little intruder shall be punished one way or another. Ever since she laid a curse upon the princess, that royal, attractive body was destined to be sex toy. The plan worked better than expected if Kyra was now going to be one of her own slave of entertainment. After all, that was exactly what that chosen door meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe runaway princess swung open the door, expecting to see the outside world on the other side, but to her astonishment, there was a long hallway with a bright light on the other end. Taking a few steps in, the door behind her closed shut automatically and vanished, leaving nothing but a stone wall. Nervous and scared, her heart began pounding, but she wasn't disappointed. This was an adventure for her. Never had she ever encountered the act of magic so close up before. Gingerly, the barefooted young lady stepped towards the light while gazing her eyes side to side. On both side of her, there were prison cells all lined up with strange creatures trapped inside. Eyes gawked at the human, and immediately, all of them thrashed around behind their barred doors. Each monstrous freaks had a sudden yearn for the girl which is all part of the curse laid upon the princess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit scared by the sudden chaotic response from these mutants, Kyra sprinted until she exit out through the opening, and then a barred gate dropped down, ceiling another possible exit for her. After she stepped into the light, there was an audience all around her in this massive Colosseum where all the wealthy noblemen seemed to have gathered in the ascending seats that sloped upwards the further back one sat. The entire structure had a circular base with the spectators watching the young brunette at 360 degrees all around. The girl walked nervously towards the open vastness before her, a large circular field that must be nearly a kilometer in diameter with the sand-colored ground being solid and rough as if walking upon sandpaper. Above her was a dome-shaped ceiling with windows decorated above, sending down sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra was utterly dumbfounded; it was as if she was transported to an entirely different country. On the exact opposite side of her, there was another opening with a shadowy creatures stepping through the darkness within. Whatever it was, the silhouette didn't appear like a human. The entire setup around her began to worry for her own safety. This reminded her of a fighting arena where warriors fought against each other, but to make it worse, it appeared like her opponents were going to be one of those monsters that she saw locked up behind bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be a mistake. There was no way she could beat a monster. She had no training or experience in combat, and if by some miracle, a weapon was given to her, she would still have no clue on how to utilize it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" the witch's voice roared throughout the stadium, yet not a single turning head managed to spot where the mastermind was located. The voice seemed to be projected out of thin air. \"Welcome to the first match of the day. Today, we have a special challenger who will face off with one of the many creatures around the world. On one side, we have a lovely girl in the white bathrobe who a princess of her homeland with a body that tantalizes everyone who meets their eyes on her. And, on the other side, we have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what sort of creature stepped out to face the inexperienced, naive princess?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c\u2026 an Arachman, a species that dwell in caves and cavern,\u201d the witch introduced to the six-armed, bipedal monster that stepped into the light. Black-skinned, long, slender arms branched out of a single pair of shoulder sockets. It had two pairs of sinister red eyes, but the main core of his body appeared very human-like. As soon as the multi-eyed freak caught sight of his opponent, a sudden yearning feeling took control of his body. Immediately, the Arachman appeared to be chewing bubble gum in his mouth as it leaped ten meters into the air before shooting a spreading strand of black web towards the ceiling. With its six arms, it climbed quickly towards the upper surface before clinging onto the ceiling like an actual spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra had her eyes locked up at the creature that agilely reached the incredibly high ceiling, unsure what to do next. The red-eyed freak seemed to be observing its prey, wondering what the fragile-looking girl was capable of. In order to test out its foe, the Arachman shot out a strand of black web towards the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily, the princess widened her eyes and ran linearly in a random direction, evading the sticky strand that linked between the ground and the ceiling, revealing the incredible length and strength that these webs were capable of. Soon, Kyra was getting the gist of her opponent. If she so much as touches the web, she was doomed. Now that the Arachman determined the general speed of its prey, it dropped down from above, hanging from a strand of web as it bungee jumped right above the brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn\u2019t even look at her opponent, simply running for her life. However, all of sudden, several pairs of hands grabbed her from behind, gripping her by the waist and hooking her beneath the armpits. In incredible speed, the Arachman carried and lifted the girl off the ground, climbing up its strand of web with the remaining pair of arms. Kyra kicked her legs initially before remaining obediently still when the height from the ground exceeded her comfort zone. Even if she escaped, a fall from this height would kill her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two \u2018combatants\u2019 reached the very peak and center of the dome-shaped ceiling. Clinging onto the surface, the Arachman spit out webs to link between the center point of the ceiling to the princess\u2019s bounded wrists. Letting go of its prey, the princess dropped down a few meters as her weight pulled down the strand of web. The sudden drop caused her to yelp, but then, she remained fearfully silent, gazing the sheer distance from the floor below. Suspended a hundred meters above, Kyra hung there with her wrists bounded above her head, trapped in that terrifying spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender creature pushed off with its hind legs as if to pounce on the girl from above. The Arachman clung onto the victim from behind. A pair of arms grabbed onto the web, and a pair of legs wrapped around the princess\u2019s waist with the feet coiling further around her inner thighs, dangerously close to her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra felt her opponent hugging her from behind at her blind-spot and panicked when the additional weight caused them to stretch the web even more, dropping another few meters down. Creepy black arms slid across her body with hands converging to her front. She was utterly helpless and defenseless when the upper pair of hands gripped onto the cloth of her bathrobe, slowly pulling the overlapping cloth at her chest outwards. A gasp escaped out of her, \u201cW-what a-re you doing?\u201d She began to writhe with her hands clenching into fists. The audience paid even closer attention at the wench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the lower pair of hands went to untie the white fabric belt which was what secured the bathrobe in place. The Arachman tugged onto the belt and tossed it away, revealing a gap of skin at the centerline of the girl\u2019s body. A desperate look grew on Kyra\u2019s face, \u201cY-you don\u2019t understand! I\u2019m not wearing anything beneath it!\u201d Just to confirm her words, the upper pair of arms violently pulled the robe outwards, revealing the pearl-colored bra that kept her shapely breasts in place along with her tender, healthy midriff. Even her pearl-colored underwear was shown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn uproar of encouragement sounded from the audience, cheering for the wonderful spectacle that was presented to them. Ravenous, hungry eyes gawked at the princess\u2019s body with perverted minds fantasizing in keeping such a girl to themselves. <br>\r\nKyra\u2019s eyes widened fearfully when the hands slipped behind her back, undoing the clips that held her bra in place, \u201cW-wait a minute! Y-you can\u2019t! D-d-don\u2019t do that!\u201d Before her eyes, another important piece of cloth was tossed aside as her well-developed breasts were openly presented to public eyes. Just as she was about to scream, her mouth was suddenly invaded with a kiss, \u201cMMMM?\u201d The Arachman\u2019s upper hands groped the pair of breasts as the lower hands slipped beneath the girl\u2019s underwear, thrusting several fingers into her genital. At the very least, the princess tried to squeeze her legs together, but the creature that was piggybacking on her used its legs to separate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was humiliating. Not only was her body being sexually abused and shown to thousands of witnesses but her first kiss was now stolen. But can this really be caused a kiss? Her lips were never touched; it was the inside of her mouth that was being tainted with sticky black webbings. By the time the Arachmon retreated its head, Kyra was gagged, unable to make a verbal noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMM! MM! MMHH! MMMM! Mmmhhh!\u201d She continued on resisting by tensing up her body, mentally rebelling against the inappropriate and unforgiveable activities that this monster was doing. Her eyebrows furrowed, giving a look of hatred, but there was a simple way to fix that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arachaman\u2019s third pair of arms went over and to tickle the girl\u2019s exposed armpits. With her hanging in such a manner, these lovely, smooth, tender, pits were just begging to be stroked upon repeatedly. The massage on her breasts suddenly became a tickle assault, stroking rapidly across her soft pair of round bundles of nerves with her nipples being given special treatment. The hands that were busy at her crotch moved out of her underwear and began to tickle her midriff, sides, and bellybutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra lost her freedom to give a disapproving face and was reluctant to give a happy look through mumbling laughter. She even lost her freedom to tense up her body as her ultra-ticklish skin forced her muscles to flinch and twist chaotically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up to breath in crisp sea air was a pleasant surprise for Kyra. The young princess opened her eyes- then immediately closed them as she looked into the early morning sunrise. Dawn painted the waves in a shimmering dazzle of white, yellow and orange and bathed the rock she lay upon in an orange-hued glow. She pushed herself into a sitting position to better take in her surroundings. Her rock was the single blemish on a watery ocean. Measuring roughly thirty by twenty feet it was jutted, uneven and angled but not sharp. It rose out of the sea like a mountain at both ends but, here in the middle, it wasn't that far above the water level. In fact the easy side sloped gently in the water like a beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen questions were swirling around her head- two of them were more important. <i>How did I get her? And where is my robe?</i> It wasn't cold, but Kyra couldn't help but shiver at her suddenly-discovered exposure- naked except for her barely there, pearl colored underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She spun round to see the other girl, her flowing red hair burning in sunrise, half in, half out the water behind her, her hands pressing down on the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake!\" The girl beamed as Kyra wondered how to react. She looked Kyra's age- maybe younger by a year. The skin on her skinny body was pale in sharp contrast to her frizzy hair. Her only clothing was what looked like a cloth strip around her breasts- excluding her bracelet and seashell necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Kyra struggled for words. \"Where am I? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on Skipper's Rock.\" The girl replied as if it should mean something to Kyra. \"And my name is Marishka.\" She paused before adding, \"What's your name, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyra.\" Wait- 'human? ' \"What are you?\" She asked the redhead. In response Marishka smiled and raised a green scaly tail out of the water. A mermaid? That explained a bit. \"Did you save me last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Marishka nodded. \"Me and Mom. Well- adopted Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned the water beneath Marishka stirred. The young mermaid had no time to react as black tentacles wrapped around her arms and held them in place. Behind her what initially looked like a plump old woman in a black corset rose out of the water. But as the water subsided it became clear that the tentacles and her 'corset' were the same texture. That was simply the divide between human and octopus- a combination Kyra recognized as a Sea Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Sweetie.\" The Sea Witch grinned as Marishka struggled helplessly against the tentacles that held her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom.\" The wriggling mermaid giggled nervously. Her mother wore a soft smile as she held Marishka delicately in her tentacles. Without another word the Sea Witch extended her pudgy hands and spread her fingers over Marishka's ribs. The little mermaid giggled and squirmed as the tickling began- affectionate strokes and wriggles from mother to daughter. Kyra looked on in half-fascination and half- something else as Marishka laughed and squealed unable to escape her mother's affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mohohom!\" Marishka giggled as arms replaced tentacles and held her arms up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sweetie?\" Whatever Marishka was going to say was lost as tentacles slithered ticklish paths over her naked midriff to exposed armpits. A few moments of tickling passed before the Sea witch lifted the mermaid clear of the water to cradle her in her lap. Arms held high a tentacle lay upon her vertically and the suckers began rasping causing Marishka to scream and writhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mohohohom! The girhirl froho-?\" The rest was lost in laughter. Kyra couldn't help but giggle at Marishka's predicament. Which immediately drew the Sea Witches attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my dear. You're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I was trying to tell you.\" A giggling Marishka panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't sure if you'd wake up my dear. But now you have...</span></div></div>",

Kyra was submerged from waist down with her arms restrained over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a minute,\" the girl grew hesitant while blushing from being exposed.

TeeHeeHee!  I command you!  HeeHee!  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for tickling, and refuse to share in these antics.  Pleaaase!  No!  AhhHaaHaa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the harpy has landed directly straddling poor frightened Kyra, causing the boat to rock as she glares down with red, hungry eyes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me the gown!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, shrieks the horrible harpy from her beaklike craw, and Kyra timidly and shakily scrambles out of her gown for the monster who has her pinned below her in the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hugging her arms around her chest and knees tightly together, Kyra squirms on her back towards the bow of the boat while the evil harpy flings her gown behind her toward the stern with her beaklike mouth, then eyes Kyra malevolently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, row for me!  Krawk! Do it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dislike you and ask you for a final time to leave my boat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, pleads Kyra, unaccustomed to taking orders from anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give the orders here, bitch!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re my slave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, screams the evil harpy as she reaches out with her wings and again proceeds to tickle torment Kyra with their feathery tips.  Now that Kyra is clothed only in her fancy pearl colored bra and panties, she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hide her exposed tender body from the maddening tickling, and she squirms and giggles around, trapped on her own baot by this wicked creature, squawking with horrid laughter at her reactions to her teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, the beast again pinions the poor princess below her on the dinghy, and proceeds to tickle the frantic princess so that she is crying and screaming and laughing and shuddering and kicking all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of tickling, the overwrought princess faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Awakening later, she finds herself sitting and facing the stern of the boat.  The old harpy woman sits facing the bow of the boat, staring at Kyra, and she then realizes her legs are tied straight out from her on the boat seating, and her arms are tied to the emergency oars!  Her precious, delicate princess feet that have only ever felt tended lawns and soft, luxurious carpeting are facing the harpy, and Kyra is struck with fear at her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve awakened, slave!  Now ROW!  ROW, I say!  ROW!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and she begins teasing the pretty feet of the princess, driving her crazy with her struggles to escape, which the harpy has rigged so that her reflexive movements will power the rowing of the boat!  All Kyra can do is laugh and squirm around, bound to the seat as she is, and through the evil genius of the harpy, her struggles carry them along now on the still seas under increasingly darkening skies, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Monster Seas never stay this calm for long, and I want to bring you back to my nest to meet my children!  ROW, bitch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All poor spastically shrieking Kyra could manage was a constant stream of her delightful, girlish laughter and tears, made all the sweeter for the monster by her sheer innocence and purity.  The harpy viewed Kyra as nothing more than a prize she could use to slave for her, and she delighted in tickling the near-naked princess, who was utterly frantic for some kind of relief from this cruel treatment.  The more she squirmed, the more she rowed, and the birdmonster made sure that they made good time traveling by the sole power of Kyra's ultra-ticklish feet!  The pace and journey left the princess totally exhausted and still quaking with shivers when they arrived at her forlorn, craggy islet near a whole series of other islands of various sizes and shapes..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kyra was practically passed-out again, and it felt as if she was being lifted up and away from the dinghy, now docked at the tiny islet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awakens, Kyra finds herself:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Carrying the human girl with her, the winged woman prepared to properly discipline her into a good little slave. During the boat ride, Kyra had shown to have manners and morals ingrained into her, possessing a typical social mindset with other humans. All these pathetic traits were in the way, so after some special training, she shall become more submissive to her fate. The princess didn't have to like it; she simply had to be obedient. Ah, but not too obedient; that wouldn't be fun. Some rebellious nature could provide some entertainment once in a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon her ginormous nest that was situated at the cliff were her beloved little children, chirping excitedly for her return. A cube-shaped metal cage, designed for prisoners and captives was dragged out and placed at the center of the nest in order to draw all the attention. The barred door slid open, and the mother harpy laid the unconscious princess down before preparing the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a some time passed by, Kyra opened her eyes halfway before giving a more vigilant expression when she realized the change of scenery. She found herself already in a standing position with her arms raised over her head as if to touch the night sky; her wrists and tied together by a brown rope that was looped over one of the many bars of metal. The cage that she was imprisoned in was composed entirely of metal bars lining up in series from all sides except the floor which felt like hay. Each exhale had her breath made visible in the frigid air. Her exposed body shivered involuntarily by the chilly air. A pearl-colored bra and underwear was all the clothing left on her, clearly unsuited for such an environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moonlight offered a bit of vision in the darkness. Moving shadowy figures wandered around her, each of them shrieking eagerly when the girl woken up. A sharp cry sounded out followed by a mischievous snicker by the shrouded figure with the ghastly left eye, \"Awaken, have you? My children will have lots of fun with you, my slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Untie me this instant,\" the princess struggled to have her wrists break free, \"what is it that you want from me?\" Her gown was already taken away; she had nothing left to give away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, bitch!\" the harpy in charge unlocked the door, letting one of her children to step inside the cage. </span></div></div>",

A particularly brightly lit house drew her attention. It seemed to be full of loud music, people shouting, singing and laughing all over the place. It would be great to just be able to enter and have some fun among the crowd while being monitored by guards or mentors. Princess Kyra closed the distance to the front door but almost jumped when the door flung open and a few men left the place, visibly intoxicated but in a very good mood. They stared at her for some uncomfortably long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing danger, Kyra turned on the spot and fled. Initially the men followed but they were unable to run more than a few steps before they stumbled and fell to the ground, cursing and laughing. The shocked princess took a turn into a particularly dark side road without bothering what might happen there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stood there, panting and looking back towards the street corner, she saw someone enter the lane with a brisk step. Kyra pressed herself to the wall of a house. But she was out of luck. When the man approached her he quickly placed his hand over her mouth and held a knife menacingly close to her face. Princess Kyra froze. It only became clear to her at this moment that her visit to town might cause much more trouble for her than she could handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the other man arrived. They quickly tied Kyra's writs and ankles, replacing the hand with a piece of cloth fixed by a scarf over her mouth. She was placed into a potato bag.

She tried to move but her wrists were tied behind her back. Here ankles were locked into metal cuffs fixed to chains from the wall. It was still dark outside, she thought, although she clearly heard noise from farm animals amid some male voices. It took some seconds before she found out that the blindfold over her eyes kept her in darkness. She briefly tried to push the blindfold against the straw, but it was too painful for her delicate skin. Should she tell that she was awake? What would be her fate? She scolded herself about being so careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile she heard some chains rattling and female voices coming to life. Was she not alone? That was great. She whispered and got groaning responses from two other girls. From their basic language she deducted that they were peasant girls who yesterday sold their farm goods at the market but were abducted in town. Gwen and Marie were their names. Conversation did not proceed further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPounding footsteps came closer to the building. A door swung open and those feet stepped into the room. \"Haha, that looks like a good catch. No injuries\" The male voice came closer to the place where the girls rested, making them retreat against the wall. \"Those two are average. We will sell them quickly. But this one here...\" Kyra felt a hand touch her thigh and almost jumped. \"She is different. Soft skin, very jumpy. Certainly not had a lot of experience.\" He took one of her arms and touched her hand. \"See. No sign of physical work. Upper trade class, I would say. She will fetch a heap.

Her heart pounded quickly along with her breath. She felt herself being lowered down on top of a flat wooden surface. Several hands began grabbing her at several places at once that she couldn't tell what they were doing to her. It felt as if each of her ankle were grabbed by a pair of hands, preventing her from kicking. She was forcefully rolled over to her side where the ropes that tied her wrists were loosened and removed, but her hands didn't have a second to be free as they were each clung onto by a someone's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of hands pressed down on her shoulders, forcing her still as she lied nervously on her back.

Each time the cranking sounded out, her limbs were forcefully pulled upon more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra tugged back, trying to keep her limbs as close to the core of her body as possible, but each crank resulted them to be yanked further and further away. She was back lying flat on the surface, with her arms and legs stretched outwards to point that her body appeared like the letter 'X'. The very last crank made sure that she was as stretched out as far as possible before it locked in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release me, this instance!

What was she supposed to drink? What did they mean by entertaining her for some hours? She had never been taught or told that there was such a test to prove that one is a princess.

Initially, she refused to gulp it down, relying on her nose to breathe. It wasn\u2019t long until a finger on either side pressed the sides of her nose, pinching her nostrils shut. Unable to breathe, the girl panicked and thrashed around with what little range of motion her joints could make use of. Ten seconds later, she was desperate for air and reluctantly gulped down the fluids, offering her a burning taste that she had never experienced before. She was afraid what they were forcing her to drink, but she consumed the liquid nevertheless. The seemingly never ending steam of fluid flowing into her mouth made her worried as to when it would stop, but after several swallows, the funnel was emptied, granting her access to air. After a few seconds of resting with her breasts rising and falling, another volume of wine was poured down the funnel, forcing the princess to continue drinking if she wishes to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next five minutes, Kyra was forced to drink more than she has ever had in such a short duration of time. It didn\u2019t stop until the entire large can of wine was emptied. Her body started to feel oddly warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did these men do next to entertain her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since it was late at night, most of the townsfolk had gone to bed, so Kyra wandered into one of the few places that was still open.  It was a quaint little tavern, full of adorable, drunk villagers with their faces covered in scars and scowls.  Of course, after they saw the attractive young princess step inside, their scowls turning into smiles.  A more experienced woman might have called them leers, but it was all the same to Kyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, welcome!\" the portly innkeeper said warmly.  He was a bald man with a rotund figure, but he seemed friendly enough.  Another might consider him too friendly as he led her into his establishment, his hand a bit too low on her shapely hip.  \"Come in, warm yourself up, have a drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra smiled and looked around.  She had never been in a tavern before, but she had heard stories about them.  She couldn't remember how many times a group of adventurers met in a tavern and went off and \u2026 adventured.  She was never sure what an adventure was, exactly, but often it involved a dragon or a princess or a princess held captive by a dragon.  In any case, it seemed like good fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure she was dressed for visiting a tavern in a white fluffy bathrobe and white slippers, but judging by the looks of the other inhabitants, no one disapproved of her attire, so she made sure that the cloth belt was tied firmly around her waist and sat down at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, a drink?\"  Her father had always been strict about her and alcohol \u2026 but he wasn't here with her.  \"I'll have a glass of wine, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barkeep poured her a glass of something red and tart, and she smiled to herself as she sipped it.  She realized that she was in the place were adventures usually began, and hers was just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next in Princess Kyra's Ticklish Rape Adventure?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyra was halfway finished with her glass of wine when she saw a group of people enter the tavern.  The first was a large man with a mop of black hair and a heroic chin, wearing chainmail and a sword on his back.  The second was a beautiful woman in an elegant red gown with bright red hair, carrying a staff.  The third was another woman with her black hair in a long ponytail wearing a cloak over tight leather with a dagger at the belt tied around her shapely hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were, Kyra realized, <i>adventurers</i>, just like in the stories!  It was all the princess could do to keep from squealing in delight.  She picked up her drink and made her way through the crowd to where the three adventurers sat.  Along the way, one stranger's hand brushed against her bum and another man stumbled and groped her breasts for balance, but she was sure those were just innocent accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" she said, trying, and failing, to keep the eagerness out of her voice.  \"Are you three adventurers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them, even the women, stared at the neckline of her robe, which had fallen open, exposing much of her fair, round breasts and nearly went down to her navel.  She adjusted her robe, blushing and asked again.  \"You know, wandering heroes and the like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man cleared his throat and glanced at his two companions.  \"You could \u2026 you could call us that, yes.  Why?  Do you have a quest for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quest?  Oh, no, I just love adventurers.\"  The man grinned at that, and she continued.  \"Let me see, you must be the fighter in the group, and you're the mage, which would make you the thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thief?\" the woman in the cloak and leather repeated.  \"I'm no thief!  I'm a rogue.  I haven't stolen a copper since I got here, and you can't prove otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, miss, I didn't mean to imply anything.\"  Kyra couldn't believe herself.  She hadn't been with these people for two minutes, and she had already embarrassed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the rouge continued, \"if I wanted to, I could steal lots of things, like this.\"  She held up the cloth belt that <i>had</i> been tied around Kyra's waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess looked down and saw that her robe had fallen open even more than it had before, nearly exposing her nipples and showing off her panties and inner thighs entirely.  The mage smirked and the fighter laughed out loud as Kyra's face turned red and she closed her robe again.  That was the second time she had embarrassed herself in as many seconds, and the night was still young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize again for any offense, good rogue,\" Kyra said.  \"Could I have the belt back, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue shook her head.  \"No, this is payment for your drink, unless you were planning on buying it with all the gold you don't have in your pockets.  Of course, a pretty girl like you, the barkeep might have settled your debt by having you dance naked on the tables tell everyone went to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was \u2026 that was a good point.  Kyra hadn't brought any money with her.  As a princess, she had never needed any, but unless she wanted to announce her station to everyone she met, she was going to need to be more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind Viss,\" the fighter said.  \"Come, sit down and drink with us.  My name is Jorgan, and the mage is Silys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you,\" Kyra said, sitting down carefully, and she meant it.  Despite the exposure, she had always wanted to meet a group of adventurers.  \"My name is Kyra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have a quest, Kyra,\" the mage, Silys asked, \"what is this about?  Do you wish to join our party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra's eyes grew wide.  \"You're throwing a party?\"  And they were inviting her?  Best day ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViss rolled her eyes.  \"No, we <i>are</i> a party.  That's what you call a group of adventurers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Right.\"  Idiot.  \"Um, I'd loved to, but I don't know what good I'd be in a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViss shrugged.  \"Clerics are best farthest from danger anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleric?  What makes you think I'm a cleric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're clearly dressed in the white robe of the goddess Tickla,\" Silys said.  \"Though I can understand why you wouldn't want to draw attention to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thought she was a priestess?  \"Well, I mean, I know how to pray, but I wouldn't call myself an actual priestess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorgen shrugged.  \"So you're level one.  Everyone starts somewhere.  What's your WIS at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wis?\" Kyra asked.  \"I've been, um, whizzing my whole life, though I don't know what that\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!  You'll be a full fledged cleric in no time.  You look like your STR is pretty low, no offense, but you clearly maxed out your CHR, and I would love to test out your DEX, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't.  \"Um, thank you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorgen slammed his mug on the table.  \"Then that settles it!  Welcome to the party, Kyra, priestess of Tickla!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra smiled, hoping that she wasn't blaspheming a goddess she honestly hadn't even heard of.  \"That's great!  Thank you very much for inviting me.  So, um, what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the four of them worked out the sleeping arrangements, and Kyra had a choice to make.  Either she could try to squeeze in with Silys and Viss in their small room and their smaller bed, or she could double with Jorgen.  That wouldn't nearly be appropriate, but the fighter seemed like a perfect gentlemen to her, and they were all in the same party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she decide?</span></div></div>",

Dwelling within the largest castle, Kyra had lived a very sheltered life, and her position as a princess had her grew up in a wealthy environment, nurtured with the best of care from everyone in her family. As far as her memories takes her back, she had always yearned to go on an adventure. Stories of legends and myths along with rumors had made the world such a fascinating place that was not even fully explored. She was 16 years old, and she wanted to explore the outside world with her own two curious eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery few had witnessed the presence of Kyra, but those who did would spread the rumors of how beautiful she was. Pretty, cute, adorable, kind, and polite, there had been many boys who aspire to become her prince. The stories of her had made one particular witch very jealous. No one knew the witch's name, but her reputation was notoriously well known. Many have searched out of their ways to find her while others would stay away from her. Legends claimed that the witch would grant a wish in exchange for something else, whereas the cost will forever be a mystery until you accept the deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, the witch had paid a visit to the princess' room, uninvited. Awoken from her sleep, Kyra heard the sweet yet poisonous words from the figure in the shadow, luring her in on the deal to go out on an adventure. The witch's magic shall help her escape from the highly-guarded castle. The guards had always been the main reason why the girl could never run away from home, but this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the naive little girl accepted the deal. A contract had been set, and the witch's plot to feed her jealousy towards this princess had now begun. What the foolish little girl did not know was that the witch's magic had made every conscious being that she come across to lust over her curvaceous figure as well as an intense yearning to tickle her sensitive, untouched and untainted body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her wish finally coming true, Kyra absconded from her home to venture out into the unknown world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nRated 18+ content is allowed! <br>\r\nNo ending of chapters!</td>",
