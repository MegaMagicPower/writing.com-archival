She literally stuffing herself with every kind of dish imaginable, hoping that the empty feeling will go away, because of her fear of becoming overweight, she's not planning on digesting any of this food. After that, she burps loudly, \"Whew! Pardon me! That feels so much better!\" she said, then she starts swelling up. She ran her hand accross her bloating belly. \"...uh-oh...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was expanding, \"I think I went a little bit overboard on all that food...plus, I feel another big one coming up...\" she exclaimed. She feels my stomach, and boy is it expanding! Juices felt sloshing all over her body. \"Ugh...my aching stomach...I better sit down and rest for a bit...\" said Penny. She sat and moan from on top of my large stomach. \"That's better...oh man, that food's really taking a toll on my stomach...\" Her stomach feels plump. She looked like she's pregnant. \"ugh...my poor tummy...this belly-ache is getting a lot worse...\" Her stomach begins to swell up more, and it gets worse. \"uuuuugggghhh...ohhh, my stomach feels a lot worse...and now I...I...\" Penny's stomach bloat and gurgle, and let's out a big burp, \"BBUUUUURRRRRPP!!!!\" Penny starts to feel better now, her stomach is so big. \"Excuse me!\" said Penny. But then releases a fart, \"Eh heh heh...sorry...\" Even though she's a bit of a lightweight, she's been holding that one in for a while now, must've been all those burgers she ate. \"BUURRRPP!!!!! Excuse me. Well...it was a lot better than some of the sushi i've had. Besides, a girl's gotta eat.\" said Penny.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sees Baylie MacArthur and her girlfriends from Crystal Prep Academy washing her car and listening to music on her phone. After she walked away from Baylie's house, she has an strange feeling, her stomach gurgled loudly. \"Oh my...\" said Penny nervously. She felt so embarrassed and she blushed, she walked back to her house. In her house, Penny ate everything that her cousin gave her at her bake sale, by literally stuffing herself with every kind of dish imaginable, she hopes that the empty feeling will go away. Then she walked upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room, she looked in the mirror and she felt a little bit overboard on all that food she ate. \"Uh-oh...what's happening to me?\" she said. Penny stopped as she felt a familiar feeling. Her belly gurgled loudly. She could feel a burp coming on, and a big fart. \"Ugh...my poor belly...this belly-ache is getting a lot worse.\" Penny said Penny starts bloating, on the verge of farting. \"*breathing heavily* Ohhh, my stomach feels a lot worse...and now I...I...\" She felt that she was pregnant and about to have a baby. \"There's a baby in there, and it wants to be born.\" When she tries soothing herself, Penny apologizes to herself for lying, and then releases a burp and a fart. \"BUURRRPP!!!!!!\" But that's just the beginning, She started bloating again, and worse, she unleashed a wet, bassy fart that stunk up the entire room. Penny thinks that her farting is over, till it keeps on going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny felt better after that explosion, but then, she has diarrhea and rushes off for the bathroom. When she went to the bathroom, she unleashed it. Her bathroom is now polluted. \"Excuse me! That was huge problem.\" said Penny. Penny learned that, she thought she could live forever, she wound up living for it, for the rest of her life. \"That's better...oh man, that really taking a toll on my stomach.\" said Penny.</span></div></div>",

We went over this about a hundred times. I'm fine. Besides I need to do it anyway sooner or later. It could take years before I can find something as good if this. Besides you don't live that far away. A half hour drive. perhaps forty minutes. If I have problems I'll call you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will be fine honey. Come on she's twenty. She's old enough for it.\" Her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm just worried. It's a big step for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle looked outside. Today was the day. Finally she was out of house. Time to life on rooms. She loved her parents but she was twenty. It was time to leave the nest. She was also glad she was on her own now. Now she could make her own decisions and do a bit what she wanted. Of course she could't really ignore her parents. If they thought she was horrible at cleaning she would clean her house better or more often or at least clean when they would come.<br>\r\nShe admit it had come a bit sudden. Sure her mom told her more then a year ago about going on rooms. But finding something was hard but her mother told she would look and a few weeks ago she suddenly said she found something. To be honest Belle even forget they had that talk until her mother told the news. She needed to make a fast decision but finally said yes. She was glad she did. She had her own bathroom and kitchen. She heard many times you had to share that with about four or more other people. Not she. She had her own room all for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle honey please promise me you eat healthy.\" Her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle squinted with her eyes. Her father was never fine with her weight. Fine she knew she was overweight but she did't saw any problem with that. She even liked it and was proud at how fat she was. Besides she would't call herself obese. She did't even reached the two hundred pounds. However she was planning to reach it and go way further then that. But her father never liked that. Her mother did't really minded that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about my weight again is't it. You know it's also mom's fault. She cooks way too good. That's one of the reasons why you married her right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the reason but I must admit I loved her cooking also. But I was't talking about her. But you are already overweight. I just hope you eat healthy so you don't gain any more weight. You don't want to become any fatter do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Belle sighed. She never told her father she liked it or wanted to get fatter since she knew he could't deal with it. Her weight was't only thanks to her mothers cooking even while she often took a second and some times even a third course it was also part for her chocolate addiction. She could't remember when she tasted her first bite of chocolate but she knew that after her first bite she was sold. She loved chocolate. She could eat huge amounts of it. Chocolate was never safe in their house. While Belle was't a mean girl but she just could't help herself around chocolate. Her biggest weakness. The sweet brown goodness. Food for the gods. At least she thought of it that way. It did't matter to her if it was pure, milk, white, filled or with nuts she loved it all and ate it all. Her favorite food was chocolate fondue but the only ate it at her birthday. Her parents did't really saw it like dinner but for Belle's birthday they did wanna make a exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Tiffany all right with me leaving?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was Belle's little sister and she looked up to her big, sweet sister. Belle was her roll model so it was no wonder her sister was also very chubby with a big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she was a bit upset but when I told her she could have your room she calmed down. But I'm sure she will miss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle could''t wait. All her stuff was already there. But yesterday her parents decide to have a nice supper to celebrate she went living on her own and after that she decide to sleep one last night in her parents house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right we're here.\" Her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess this is goodbye.\" Belle said. \"I visit you guys in the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to come home just call. All right honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will mom. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked inside and fast ran upstairs to the second floor where her room was and walked into her own room. A kitchen open to a living room with a small table with some chairs, A couch with a corner in it and a T.V. A Bookcase and in the other room her bed and clothing closet. <br>\r\nShe first went to the fridge which she in the secret stuffed with chocolate and took a box of Godiva chocolates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to relax with Mister T.V and a old friend chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also wondered who lived further in the house. She knew there were at least four other people who lived here but she decided to meet them later.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened the door and blinked a few times. <br>\r\nBefore her were standing four obese girls. The first one was tanned. A color like coffee with milk, Her hair was dark brown. She smiled and pushed her big belly that was clearly poked out from under her shirt, out a bit to show of her belly button ring. She seemed to be around the same weight as Belle. Maybe a few pounds more.<br>\r\nAfter her was standing another girl. She was kind of pale and looked even paler thanks to her black hair, Barrett, skirt and shirt that also did't cover her belly. She seemed to be even fatter then the tanned girl and smiled on a shy way. She had a French look but that could also be because of her Barrett.<br>\r\nThen she saw a redhead. She had dark red hair and was kind of pale. Her face, arms, legs and her big belly that was also clearly visible were covered with freckles. Belle thought she must be around 300 pounds. She blinked and smiled happy.<br>\r\nThere was another girl standing behind the other three. But you could't miss her. She had a black skin and hair and wore it in a ponytail. But she was way fatter then the others. Belle knew for sure she was over 350 pounds. Her shirt just covered her boobs but was hardly big enough to cover her belly. But she looked and carried her weight very confident. <br>\r\nBelle must admit she was a bit jealous. She always liked being fat and wanted to get fatter. All these girls were so much fatter and looked so good. Looking at how good those girls looked made her desire to gain weight even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" The tanned girl said. \"We wanted to meet you. My name is Regina. That lovely French girl is Monique. The redhead is Penny and that black girl there is Ginger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... hi. My name is Belle.\" Belle said and looked at them like a hypnotized bunny. \"Belle Godiva.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Godiva?\" Regina asked. \"Is't that that woman that drove naked on a horse through the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I... I always thought it was... the name... of... a chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's also true. But according to the story, lady Godiva was married to a mean count who asked way too much money from his people. She wanted him to stop doing that. He said he would only do that if she would ride naked through the city on a horse. She did it and the count kept his word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was your ancestor.\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my ancestor... was riding naked on a horse... through the city?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle had eaten more then enough Godiva chocolates to remember the drawing. Before she never put to much attention to the drawing and more attention to eating the chocolate. But now she thought about it it really did look a lot like a naked woman on a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it was your ancestor, she was good woman who did it to help people. So that's not so bad.\" Regina said. \"But enough about naked people. Do you invite us in or do we need to keep talking here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh of course. Come in.\" Belle said and did a step aside so the four girl could come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls walked inside and went sitting on the couch. Belle boiled some water for tea and put a bowl with cookies on table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice that you came to live here. This apartment was empty for way too long.\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we had that tanned girl.\" Ginger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. That girl was so sensitive. First she wanted to go home, then stay and then go home again.\"Regina said. \"Well she did't fit in here. But you fit in  a lot better. You have also a big belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like being fat and i want to get fatter.\" Belle said and slapped her hands for her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle wondered how she could have been so stupid. She barely knew this girls an she told them her deepest secret. She looked at them and turned pale. She wondered how they would react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear that. You're part of the group!\" Ginger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Which group?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you like being fat and want to get fatter.\"Penny said. \"Well me too. I also like being fat and want to become fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like me.\" Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Ginger said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And ere too.\" Monique said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle noticed Monique did't speak out the H. Probably because she was French and French did't use the H.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow... well that's a... a surprise. But I'm so glad I met some girls who think like me.\" Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy you came to live here Belle.\" Penny said. \"We were afraid we would get a toothpick girl here that eats nothing then salad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny, I and Ginger know each other since kindergarten.\" Regina said. \"We met Monique during high school. When we were looking for rooms we thought about how nice it would be if we could live in the same neighborhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our parents know how good friends we were.\" Penny continued. \"And with some help, and a lot of luck we were able to all four live here. But we were with four. Now with you the group is complete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle looked at the other four girls. She just moved over here and it seemed she now already found four good friends..               </span></div></div>",

Monique is the hapless romantic of the group and has a lovely French accent to compliment her \"curvacious\" appeal. Not only that, but she is a wonderful gourmet and can cook up delicious delicacies (which is why she's such a little creampuff herself). However, her choice of perfumes tend to keep people at a distance some of the time. Nevertheless, she's still quite the charmer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow that we're done with that, what story are we going to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly the sun was rising. It was a beautiful sight. Too bad most people were still asleep not seeing this beautiful sight. Most were still deep in bed since it was the first day of vacation. Young kids got all ready out bed and were in their pajama's watching morning cartoons. Slowly everyone woke up.<br>\r\nAlso Regina. Well she woke up and turned around trying to fall asleep again what did't really worked. She just kept her eyes closed and staid in bed. She knew she could be pretty lazy sometimes. Especially in the morning she was't very active. She rolled a bit around in bed hoping she could fall asleep again. But after she woke up it was hard to fall asleep again. Finally she opened her eyes and yawned. She put her hands under her head and looked at the sealing.<br>\r\nShe did't really wanted to get out of bed. But there was one thing that would force her down. Her hunger. She softly stroke her big gut. It was pretty big. She planned to make it bigger. She liked being fat. She was not alone. her best friends also liked it. All of them were pretty fat and all of them liked it. <br>\r\nSlowly she threw her blanket of. Since it was pretty hot past night she slept naked. She saw herself in the mirror from her clothing closet. She was happy it was pretty big or else she probably would't be able to see her entire body. She looked at her body and most say she thought she looked pretty good. She was tanned, like a coffee with milk color with dark brown hair. Chubby arms, big thighs, but the biggest was her huge round belly. She smiled admiring her puffy, bowl cheeks. She also adored her belly button. She had a huge collection of them and liked it to show that. <br>\r\nShe fast picked a dark red short sleeved shirt. It was warm enough for it, and some gray shorts. She noticed her bra was getting tight. She wondered if her bra shrunk, she gained fat on her back or her breasts got bigger. She knew what she wanted it to be. <br>\r\nShe tied her shoes and ran downstairs. Her mother and siblings were already in the kitchen. Regina must admit she was pretty happy with her family. Her mother was also pretty fat. She looked smiling at her mother's big pregnant belly. Yeah her mother was pregnant from her fourth child. She was fat but lately she watched her diet a bit so her baby would be healthy. She lost some weight but Regina knew that after her sister was born her mother would soon get the weight back on. Her mother hated to diet. She rather experiment with food and enjoy  a good meal. She also was a great cook. She only did this for the best of her child. Well it was just until her sister was born and it would be so far after about a month or so. Then she would have another little sister. Well she did't knew for sure it was a sister. But as far if she knew only girls were born in her family. Her mother also had two sisters and her grandmother also had four sisters. She was convinced that this would also be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Regina.\" Her mother said cheerful. \"How are you honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine mom. Thanks for asking. But I'm pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then how about I make a big omelet for you with five eggs with sea food in it. Also some bacon and six toasts with chocolate spread. and five croissants with butter, some sausages and a piece of leftover pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would like that but make it seven eggs and eight toasts also eight croissants and some extra sausages. I'm a growing girl after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want honey. Go sit at the table while I start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina's sibling were already at the table. Both girls and both also pretty fat. One was12 and her other 8. Both were just as tanned as her but her and the same colored hair. But her oldest sister (Terri) wore it lose, and it was way longer then hers. Almost till her hips and her youngest sister (Skipper) wore it in two pigtails. Both were busy eating. Most girls in their family were fat. She liked that both her sisters were fat and her mother liked it too.<br>\r\nWith being 21 it was a big difference of age with her sisters. her mother was pretty young when she got her. She was't planning at getting pregnant at that age but she got pregnant and decided to keep it. But she waited some time before she got her other kids. Regina need to wait 9 years for that. She spend her first nine years of her life without a sibling. She was happy she found some friends in the meantime. Else she would have been really lonely.<br>\r\nShe went sitting on a chair. She noticed her but was hanging over the edge of the chair but did't cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it with the baby?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean my champion kickboxing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be happy! Then you and dad don't have to work anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you want to do today? Do you have any plans.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The she headed to the bus stop and got onto the bus.Her stomach gurgled a bit, she wasn't gassy yet as the food hadn't completely worked its way through her. She sighed sadly, she loved to fart for a quick laugh.

Normally, she knew exactly what to say, but she didn't hold back and said exactly what she thought, even if it was sometimes a bit mean towards somebody. She has a big (sometimes too big) mouth, but at least she was honest to others. But now she still looked at the boy like a hypnotized bunny. She got a feeling, like two pieces clicked together. She still held the hand of the boy.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but I would like to have my hand back.\"<br>\r\nIt took sometime before Regina's brain understood what he asked. Then, she quickly let go of his hand.<br>\r\n\"Can I sit here?\" He asked polite pointing against the seat across her.<br>\r\nRegina got herself under enough control to nod slowly and looked at the boy. She\u2019d never seen any boy like him. In 21 years she had met enough boys. In elementary school, she hung out with a lot of boys, since boys liked it that a girl could fart so loudly then. However, they were just friends. At high school, she also talked with some boys. Of course, she also sometimes saw a boy she thought looked handsome, but it was nothing compared to what she felt now. She never really had a relationship and wasn't really sure what to do. Normally, she knew exactly what to say and now at an important moment she couldn't say a word.<br>\r\n\"Do I have something on my shirt?\" He asked friendly.<br>\r\n\"Eh... no.\" Regina managed to say.<br>\r\n\"Then why are looking at me?\" He asked still friendly like he was just curious.<br>\r\n\"Eh, I haven't seen you before. Are you new here?\" She asked and wanted to hit herself afterward. What a stupid question. Hundreds of people used the bus every day. She didn't know all those people. To be honest, she hardly knew any people on the bus. Perhaps that old lady that lived at the end of the street and a girl from school.<br>\r\n\"I am new here. I just moved. My name is Marcus Smith. May I know your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh... of course. My name... Eh what's my name again.\" She hoped he didn't think she was a idiot that didn't know her own name.<br>\r\n\"My name is eh... Barriga. Regina Barriga.\" She managed to say and smiled.<br>\r\n\"What a nice name.\" He said politely. \"It suits you. Do you also have a nickname?\"<br>\r\nRegina looked a bit nervous at the boy. He seemed really nice and friendly. She did have a nickname but she wasn't sure if she wanted to tell him that. Normally, she used that nickname around her friends, but she didn\u2019t want to start this introduction with a lie.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have one. My friends call me \u2018hot and spicy gut\u2019, since I like hot and spicy food. I love food.\"<br>\r\n\"I can see that. Happy too. I hate girls who diet. Say Regina... I planned to look around in the mall, but I've never been to the mall here, so do you mind going with me? Perhaps you can show me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina suddenly felt like she was on fire.

The mall seemed to have everything, video arcades, movie theaters, skating rinks, clothing stores, and more food courts than they could count. Soon, they stopped at the middle of the mall, at the fountain.<br>\r\n\"This place is huge\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n\"You could get lost pretty easily\" Regina said \"The fountain is in the exact center of the mall, so it's a good place.\"<br>\r\nMarcus turned to look at the fountain.

She could feel a fart coming on, and a big one at that. <br>\r\n\u201cOh great\" she thought \"Why now?\"<br>\r\nAt any other time she'd have blown her booty as loudly as she could, the louder the better.

Nothing\u2019s wrong.\" Regina said, holding her fart in.<br>\r\n\"So, this is the center of the mall?\u201d Marcus asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's how I find my way around here. When I was here for the first two times on my own I also got lost, but I found my way back thanks to that fountain. I also got lost once when I was five, but that's a different story.\"<br>\r\n\"So what's your favorite store?\" He asked.<br>\r\nRegina needed to think a bit about this. Most girls of her age would say: Clothing store. But she wasn't very fond of the clothing stores here. They didn't have many clothes in her size and the ones they had were so terrible she would rather go naked. If she wanted nice clothes she needed to go to a big size store and that was a lot further. She also liked the music store. She loved rock bands, especially ones made by cool girls. She also went to the toy store sometimes for a present for her sisters. But lately they\u2019ve started to lose their interest in toys. She thought about all of the other stores for a second and finally mumbled: \"I guess the food court. I always get something to eat when I'm here.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then, how about showing me some more stores here.\"<br>\r\nRegina didn't know if it was because of the wish that Marcus made, but both had a good time. Regina showed him all stores. Some they went in and some they walked by. Marcus was kind and calm but then Regina felt another thing in her belly. It rumbled loudly.<br>\r\n\"So it sounds like you're hungry. Am I allowed to take you to one of the fast food courts to buy you a lunch?\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's really nice, but I normally eat a lot. Are you sure you want to pay for it.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. My family and I are... kind of rich. I'm sure I can afford it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then if you say so.\"<br>\r\nThe nearest fast food court was McDonalds.<br>\r\n\"So what would you like?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n\"Well I\u2019ll take... six big mac menus, two with a strawberry milkshake, two with a vanilla shake and two with a chocolate shake and... what the heck. I\u2019ll also have three dozen of chicken mc nuggets.\"<br>\r\nMarcus gave their order and even while the man looked a bit disturbed at their order he handed it to them and Marcus paid without complaining. But when Regina sat down, she again felt a heat come over her belly. Before she could stand up, she let out a loud fart. So loud that even people outside the McDonalds could hear it. Regina blushed and looked at Marcus.<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was a big one. That's kind of cool.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, really? You don't mind me farting like that?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not at all. I kind of like it.\"<br>\r\nRegina sighed, relieved and smiled at Marcus.<br>\r\n\"Look who we have here. I should have known it when I heard such a fart!\" A mean voice said.<br>\r\n\"Hello, Daisy.\" Regina said, bored.<br>\r\nDaisy and Regina knew each other since they were toddlers and never got along, and while they grew older that only got worse. With Regina's increasing weight (and that of her friends) while Daisy was slender, she always teased them for it.<br>\r\n\"See you're getting even fatter.\" Then she saw Marcus. \"And who is this?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Marcus. I just moved over here.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Well how about I show you around. Introduce you to all the cool people.\"<br>\r\n\"I already am showing him around.\" Regina said angry.<br>\r\n\"Who would want to go with a farting lard ball like you when they can have such a beauty like me? Just look at you. How can you stand that gut? So what do you say? Let\u2019s lose the fat ass and come with me.\"<br>\r\n\"What? No way. I like her.\" Marcus said. \"You call yourself a beauty. Come on, you look like a skeleton with fuzzy hair. How could I be attracted to that? Oh and I like the real stuff, not silicone tits.\"<br>\r\nDaisy's mouth fell open. She wasn't used to rejections. Boys didn't reject her, she rejected boys. At high school, she was known like the school slut and had done it with almost any boy. At least the ones that were cool in her eyes. But now the coolest boy she\u2019d ever seen rejected her, called her ugly, and liked a fatso like Regina. She stormed out, angry and humiliated.<br>\r\n\"You really meant that?\" Regina asked.<br>\r\n\"I did. Do you remember? I said I hate girls who diet. Well, I forgot to tell you that I like fat girls, and I like it to see fat girls gain.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'll do that.\" Regina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina proceeded to call her friends and tell them to come to the mall to meet Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are they coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They'll be here in 8 minutes.\" Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. That should be just enough time to finish your food.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina looked at her meal and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, Marcus, I\u2019ve put away twice as much food in half the time.\u201d She boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see you prove it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d Regina agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.5 minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina rubbed her engorged stomach as it began the process of digesting her fast food feast. Marcus just stared at her with a slacked jaw. The girl noticed this and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you don\u2019t see this every day.\u201d Regina said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but it was interesting to see.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI aim to please.\u201d Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re pretty accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina\u2019s cheeks turned a shade of red not dissimilar to that of her shirt. Then, she felt another grumble from within her belly. It was loud enough to be heard by everyone in the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you still hungry?\u201d Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got to fart.\u201d Regina corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, do it. I already said that I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this one feels bigger than the last one. You might not be able to handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Marcus assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Regina decided to just let it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*FFFFFFFAAAAAARRRRRTTTTTTT!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina\u2019s butt blast vibrated her seat as well as Marcus\u2019s, and it was noxious enough to drive out the other diners and even the workers. After 10 seconds, it ceased and Regina sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh. That felt fantastic. How did you like that, Marcus?\u201d Regina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina looked out one of the windows and saw her friends walking into the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, girls.\u201d Regina called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Regina.\u201d They greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my new friend, Marcus. Marcus, these are my best friends: Penny McBelcher, Belle Godiva, Monique LeBouffe, Ginger Gluttonson, and Bella Button.\u201d Regina introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus and the girls exchanged greetings and handshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that the pleasantries out of the way, anyone hungry?\u201d Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, Belle, Monique, Ginger, Bella, and Regina raised their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but we should go somewhere else. The workers are all gone.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would make them leave?\u201d Ginger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI farted for 10  seconds and that cleared out the restaurant, except for Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Regina just ripped one for 10 seconds and you didn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we had to build up a tolerance to it first.\u201d Bella added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it just doesn\u2019t affect me.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhere should we go, then?\u201d Monique asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to go\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Around him were six fat girls, a few of them were even morbidly obese. He was in heaven. He must admit that he liked Regina the most but he also wanted to know the others. <br>\r\nHe was happy his family was so rich. His teenage sister spends about $1000 a week on clothes. His parents thought that it was only fair that he got the same amount of money as his sister, but he didn\u2019t use all of his. Sure, sometimes a CD or DVD. Sometimes some new clothes or shoes, but he saved most of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Marcus! Let's go!\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are best friends?\" Marcus asked while they walked through the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I\u2019ve known Penny and Ginger since kindergarten.\" Regina said. \"Monique... we met her about 2 years ago or something during high school... but she fit right in our group. Belle came a few months before Bella and as for Bella... we\u2019ve known her for about... what is it? Two months I believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. It\u2019s hard to say, since some months have thirty day and others have thirty-one days. February even has twenty-eight days.\" Bella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you think?\" Penny said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get used to Bella.\" Regina said. \"Because she also has a problem with gas (giggle).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think of Burger king?\" Ginger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll others agreed and they all walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you all want?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Wait for a second? You're not planning to pay for all of us... are you?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought so. I wanted to meet you so Regina invited you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't do that. Does he know how much we can eat?\" Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knows.\" Regina said rubbing her hands over her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I can afford it.\" Marcus said, thinking about all of the thousands of dollars he saved up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I mean we eat... well a lot.\" Ginger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, can I take your orders?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll six girls were surprised, but said what they wanted. No matter what or how much they asked he stayed calm. He wrote up the entire order on a piece of paper, and went in line. In the meantime, the girls found a place to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, where did you find him Regina? He's perfect.\" Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally. He\u2019s my dream boy.\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hands off. He's mine.\" Regina said. \"Only I can say that about him. But you're right, he's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what's so funny...\" Penny said. \"It looked like he liked us. Especially you Regina, but it seemed like he also enjoyed our company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Ie also wasn't so negative about ow much we eat. Ie even paid for all of our food.\" Monique said still not able to say the letter H thanks to her French background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't like girls who diet.\" Regina said with a smile \"He likes girls with some meat on their bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have more than enough of that.\" Bella said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really like him.\" Regina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Marcus walked back to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're busy with the food, so it's going to take some time to make it all, but since they can't make it all at once, they will bring out the first part of the order in a few minutes and the second part of the order later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we\u2019ve heard that more often than not.\" Ginger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Marcus, you have no problem with farts.\" Penny said. \"But how is that with belching?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest... I find them very amusing, especially the big loud ones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smiled. Penny perhaps was the belching queen, but she was the belching princess, and she was proud of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should hear Penny. She can burp the entire alphabet.\" Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impressive.\" Marcus said and smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My full name is Marcus Smith and I\u2019m 20 years old. I live in a mansion on the north side of Mantaville with my parents, Frank and Angela, and my younger sister, Rebecca.\u201d Marcus explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute. You live in a mansion? If you\u2019re that loaded, then why would you hang out in the suburbs?\u201d Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just felt like seeing something normal for a change. I\u2019m pretty casual about being rich. Now, can you tell me about yourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllow me to introduce us. We\u2019re the Gluttoon Girls, a group of overweight cheerleaders who love eating. All of us except for Bella live in the same apartment.\u201d Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I\u2019m Ginger Gluttonson, the leader. I\u2019m 21 years old, 360 lbs, and African-American. I come from Houston, Texas, and am called \"Little Miss Prime Rib\", because my favorite foods are ham and steak.\u201d Ginger started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Penny McBelcher, the \u201csecond in command\u201d. I\u2019m 21 years old, 300 lbs, and Irish-American. I was born in Dublin, Ireland and am called the \"Irish Porker\".\u201d Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Monique Le Bouffe. I\u2019m 21 years old, 245 lbs, and French. I\u2019m called the \u201cBlimpette\u201d and am a flirtatious gourmet. My body odor wards off cute boys, so I\u2019ve gotten a part-time job at a perfume store in the mall, but the perfumes that I use make me smell even worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou smell fine to me.\u201d Marcus complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonique blushed and looked away, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m Belle Godiva. I\u2019m 20 years old, 190 lbs, and German-American. I\u2019m from Hersey, Pennsylvania and am dubbed the \"Sweet Chocoholic\" because I love chocolate. I also have a chubby little sister named Tiffany who looks up to me.\u201d Belle explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must have a good role model.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee, hee, hee, you\u2019re sweet, Marcus. You\u2019re almost as sweet as chocolate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know who I am, Marcus. I\u2019m 21 years old, 196 lbs, and Latin-American. I am from San Diego, California, a lover of sea food, and moved back in with my parents. I have two younger sisters, Terri, 12 and Skipper, 8, with one on the way.\u201d Regina stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it that they\u2019re both bloated bundles of joy.\u201d Marcus commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! They\u2019re both pretty annoying, but they\u2019re also very nice.\u201d Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019m Bella Button. I\u2019m 19 years old, and British-American. I was born in Great Britain, am called \"Skunk-Butt\" by the others, and originally 325 lbs, but after joining the Gluttoons, I ballooned up to 360 lbs. My favorite foods are burgers and burritos, my hobbies are playing video games and cooking, and I too have a job in the mall, but at an ice cream parlor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anyone else in your group?\u201d Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes there is.\u201d A voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to the entrance and saw a dark-skinned woman with brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha!\u201d Bella exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, gang. I got stuck in traffic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a seat and looked at Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see Regina was right about you being attractive.\u201d Samantha remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Marcus Smith.\u201d He said extending a hand to which Samantha shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Samantha Bellen, and I\u2019ve heard about you through my dad. Therefore, it\u2019s only fair that I tell you a few things about me. I\u2019m 20 years old, 260 lbs. and have an ex-boyfriend who gave the nickname, \"Belly Buster\", which the others now use. My favorite food is beef fried rice and my dad owns a chocolate factory, so I don\u2019t have to work.\u201d Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that we know more about each other, let\u2019s eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea, Belle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first part of their order arrived. Immediately, seven pairs of chubby hand grabbed the food. Marcus must admit that he was a bit surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I could lose a hand in there.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were too busy pigging out to notice. They were all busy stuffing food in their hungry mouths. He enjoyed seeing them enjoy their food. Their pink cheeks were chewing non-stop. They all wanted to have food, but at the same time they were friends of each other. However, every one of them was fat and wanted to get fatter. <br>\r\nEspecially Belle, who was fat but between the others, she was a light weight. With all her 190 pounds, she still weighed less than all the others, but she would do her best to change that. <br>\r\nGinger was also busy eating since she wanted to stay the leader. With her 360 pounds, she was the fattest of the group, but Bella also reached 360 pounds, so Ginger wanted to make sure she was the fattest, no matter if she liked Bella or not.<br>\r\nBella knew that she was, with her 360 pounds, the fattest together with Ginger, but she didn't really mind it so much. Sure, she did want to gain, but she wasn't really bothered that Ginger had the same weight. She didn't care if Ginger weighed less or more or the same like her. Too bad Ginger didn\u2019t know that. <br>\r\nAll girls were having some food in each of their chubby hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so good!\" Penny said with full mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for paying for us.\" Regina said between two bites and kissed him on his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh. It looks like someone is in love.\" Bella said teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I am?\" Regina asked snappish. \"He's perfect. I don't think I can ever get a better boyfriend then him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella hoped that Regina wasn't too mad. She didn't want to hurt her friend\u2019s feelings. She was just teasing a bit.<br>\r\nRegina decided not to go any further. She was way too happy. She never had a boyfriend. She really liked him. She wanted a boyfriend for a long time, but most boys weren't attracted to a fat, farting girl. She hated it that she was the girl without a boyfriend. She was old enough to have a boyfriend and she was also old enough to have sex. She heard so many times other girls and boys brag about with who, or many they had done it, and about losing their virginity or doing fun stuff at parties. But now finally she could perhaps get some experience in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus thought it was wiser not to get some food himself. He wasn't that hungry anyway. Besides he enjoyed seeing those girls eat themselves fatter. He did have some girlfriends in the past in his old neighborhood but not one girl that wanted to gain, at least not on purpose. Sure there were enough girls who were fat, but one wanted to lose weight and did it. Others wanted to lose weight but never succeeded in it. Some were ashamed about it or used it like some kind of power of corruption, a bit like a wrecking ball, unable to stop. Other girls were blind to their weight gain. Some knew it and accepted it, but weren't happy about it. However, not one was what he wanted. What he wanted was a girl that wanted to get fatter, a girl that wanted to gain, a girl that liked stepping on the scale. Not to see how much she lost, but how much she gained. A girl that didn't eat to live but lived to eat. It seemed like he moved to the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You really don't mind paying for all of us do you?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not. I just hope it's enough. I wouldn't want you to be hungry.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you made the order before our belly buster came in, so I think...\" Penny started but was cut off by a kick from Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina looked angry at Penny. Marcus had been nice enough to pay for all their food and now she tried to let him order even more. But Marcus understood Penny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. That was stupid of me. What do you want... Samantha... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Samantha said with a smile while she gave Marcus her order. Marcus walked away for the new order while a new plate of food was set on their table. But when Marcus got back the entire plate was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will bring it soon.\" Marcus said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to cost him a lot.\" Belle whispered to Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I feel a bit guilty.\" Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he didn't complain. He also said he lived in a mansion, so his parents are probably kind of... well... rich, so he can get enough money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Belle. That does make me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those words, both girls continued to pig out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes, Samantha\u2019s order arrived and the girls all snatched something. Belle got the Angus Steakhouse Burger, a burger with a large, square shaped Angus beef patty and BK Burger Shots, burgers with an eight shaped patty that were served on a pair of co-joined buns and designed to be torn into two smaller sandwiches. Samantha swiped the twelve-piece BK Chicken Fries, breaded and fried chicken strips, and the Chick'n Crisp sandwich, a small fried chicken sandwich that consisted of a chicken patty, lettuce and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. Monique took two BK Stackers. One was a hamburger, consisting of two 2 oz grilled beef patties, sesame seed bun, King Sauce, iceberg lettuce, onions, pickles and cheese and another was a cheeseburger with four 1.7 oz grilled beef patties, cheese, bacon, and Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun. Penny grabbed the BK Big Fish sandwich and eight piece BK Chicken Nuggets, small, thin pieces of formed, white meat chicken, breaded and lightly spiced. Bella put her hand on the Rodeo Cheeseburger, consisting of a burger patty, cheese, three onion rings, and barbecue sauce served on a sesame-seed bun and the BK Broiler, a burger served on a Whopper bun with mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato. Ginger nabbed the Original Chicken Sandwich, which consists of a breaded, deep-fried white-meat chicken patty with mayonnaise and lettuce on a sesame seed sub-style bun, the Philly chicken sandwich, which had cheese, peppers and onions, and the Angry Chicken Sandwich, which was served with pepper jack cheese, bacon, \"Angry\" sauce,  jalape\u00f1o slices, mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato. Regina got the iconic Whopper, a burger consisting of three flame grilled quarter-pound beef patties, sesame seed bun, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, sliced onion, cheese, bacon, mustard, guacamole, jalape\u00f1o peppers, BBQ sauce and salsa, and the Chicken Whopper, a sandwich that featured a whole 4.7 oz (130 g) chicken breast filet, mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato on a sesame seed roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny bit into her fish sandwich first, emitting a pleasured moan afterward. Monique\u2019s mouth bulged with King Sauce and Stacker sauce as she stuffed as much of both sandwiches inside of it as possible. Ginger\u2019s eyes wet slightly when she ingested part of her pepper filled Philly chicken sandwich. Belle was busy scarfing down one of her burger shots, not even bothering to rip it apart first. Samantha stuck half of the chicken fries and strips into her mouth, coating her fingers in saliva in the process. Regina swallowed some of her whopper, feeling the salsa and guacamole greet her awaiting taste buds. Bella\u2019s mouth wet as she savored the onion rings on her Rodeo Cheeseburger. Marcus felt like he was in heaven, watching the girls engage in the most unapologetic display of gluttony that he had ever seen. It was official, moving to this town was the best thing that could have happened to him. For the next few minutes, the girls continued to plow through their meals, getting crumbs and sauce all over their clothes while doing so. Penny paused in the middle of her food binge to slurp down about half of her large Pepsi. Feeling her belly swell as the reactions between the carbonated beverage and her fish sandwich within built up bubbles of gas, Penny smiled and forced them through her throat and out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*BBBBUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor four long seconds, Penny\u2019s enormous eructation flew across the air, creating an atmosphere of pure stink around the group.  Its volume drowned out the conversations of any costumers who hadn\u2019t already abandoned the restaurant following the girls\u2019 feast and the smell actually killed a few flies that roamed the Burger King garbage cans.  After it ceased, Penny fanned the air around her, sporting a satisfied smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, excuse me!\u201d Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls barely paid the belch any attention, having become accustomed to Penny\u2019s famed gas blasts. Marcus on the other hand, stared in awe. Sure, he\u2019d heard Regina break wind, twice, but Penny\u2019s belch was just on a whole other level. Penny smirked at the sight of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you know why I asked you about your opinion on burping, Marcus.\u201d She stated sultry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina also noticed his bewildered expression, but also something else. Gazing lower, she spotted a tight bulge in his pants and her pupils dilated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus! Do you have an erection?!\u201d She asked, though had a good idea of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped him out of his stare and he looked at his pants, now understanding the question. Apparently, he was more interested in the burp than he thought. Marcus blushed wildly as he tried to give a response to his girlfriend while frequently tripping over his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Regina. I guess I just didn\u2019t know how\u2026 much I liked burps is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latina\u2019s eyes widened after hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you really do have a burp fetish.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus just nodded. Regina had to think about this. He did say that he enjoyed loud belches so she should have considered something like this happening. On the other hand, she didn\u2019t want him to possibly go for Penny because of her \u2018talent\u2019. This gave Regina an idea. She grabbed her large soda cup full of coke, took of the lid, and chugged it down until not even ice remained. Then she shook her gut violently, hoping to speed up the process of forming gas bubbles inside, and let them rush out of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*BBBBBEELLLLLLLCCHHHH!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina\u2019s lips flapped like bacon strips as she emitted an astounding three-second behemoth that was nearly as loud as Penny\u2019s. It began as a low growl, then quickly ascended to a fierce roar. As it was going on, its stench was fogging up the already repulsive-smelling air around them, being superior to the stink of Penny\u2019s burp. It even caused some of the diners still in the restaurant to faint. After Regina\u2019s beastly belch had concluded, she was met with shocked looks from everyone at the table. A few moments of silence passed before someone spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegina, are you challenging me to a belching contest?\u201d Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina\u2019s eyes narrowed and she grew a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, if my Marcus loves burps so much, than I should show him a good time by beating you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny understood the reason for her actions and smirked too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I accept it and I\u2019ll enjoy putting you in your place.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Gluttoons gasped. Someone challenging Penny to a burping contest was like a wolf challenging the alpha male to a fight for leadership. The two felt the table to get more food and drink and when it arrived, they demolished it. Marcus leaned in toward the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, they\u2019ve done this before?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and the last time they did, it went on for an hour.\u201d Monique explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus\u2019 eyes widened after hearing that. Regardless of who wins, this would be interesting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I always come on the last place.\" Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably because you're such a lightweight.\" Ginger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle was't what anyone would call a lightweight. But compared to Ginger's huge body Belle really was a lightweight. Belle did't even put 200 pounds on the scale (but she was aiming for it) while Ginger put the scale  at 360 pounds. Belle knew very well she was the light weight of the group. All other were heavier then her. However she did her best to become fatter. But she never was able to win a belching or farting contest. It was't that she did't won... but she came always on the last place. That irritated her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sit this one out too.\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too.\" Bella said. \"I'm still busy eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Ginger added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess  I can better sit is one out too.\" Monique said with her french accent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we can be the judges.\" Ginger said with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Of course why not. But girls we need to be fair. All right!\" Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina was a bit nervous. It was't the first time she was in a belching contest with Penny. She also competed against Penny in a eating contest and many times in a farting contest. Penny always won the eating contest but she never was able to beat Regina in a farting contest. But burping was Penny's biggest talent. Penny's nickname was Irish porker but she was also named the belching queen. But Regina was also very good at burping. Penny was better but Regina always end up second. She called herself the burping princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, I get some soda for the both of you!\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Penny said. \"Soda always makes me burp very good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Belle said and bend over too Regina. \"Are you really gonna go true with this. Is this really such a big deal for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Well normally not, but this time... it is.\" Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because of Marcus, is't it?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I really like him. Not just like him but like like him. You understand?\" Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. You love him. Not like like him. That's what we said in elementary school. We're older now. But can you beat Penny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I can try. Right. I don't think I can beat Penny. But I got to try. After all I got a lot better at burping. Maybe I beat her this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to burst your bubble but I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled confident. She did't worried. Burping was her biggest talent. It was time to put Regina back to her spot. Under her. Regina might be better at farting but she was the best at belching.<br>\r\nMarcus returned with two drinks. He put on down for each glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then.\"Belle said. \"On your marks get set GO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls put their lips on their drinks an took a few sips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was the first and let out a: \"BUUUUURRRRRP!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Regina fast followed wit a: \"BUUUUURRRRRP!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe that was a tie.\" Belle said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that.\" Bella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well their drinks are't empty!\" Ginger said  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain both girls took even more sips then before. Bot opened their mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina was first this time: \"BUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!!!!!! Ha! try to do better then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Penny answered before... \"BUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which on was louder?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to say. I believe it was again a tie.\" Ginger mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well their not done. I think their's enough left for one more time.\" Monique said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina drank as fast if she could and opened her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny smiled and opened her mouth. But the she saw how worried, and sad Regina looked. She realized how much Regina liked this guy.               </span></div></div>",

Marcus had been nice enough to pay for not only her food but also the food for all her friends. He did that without complaining but they ate a lot. But no matter how much they ordered, he paid for them without complaining. Even while it was a lot. They should be thankful he bought so much food for them already.

But I don't have anymore money with me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we ate more then enough from your money.\" Ginger said who needed two chairs for her huge ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger was very fat but also very wide. Regina wondered how heavy Ginger really was. She said 360 but she said that a lot of pounds before too. She thought that the reason for that was the scale at her house did't went higher the 360.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway thanks a lot for buying lunch for us.\" Belle said sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah really thank you.\" All other girls added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure.

Can you give me a ride Penny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood up said goodbye and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really nice what you did for Regina.\" Belle said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well. She liked that boy so much. I would be bit mean to beat her in front of a boy she likes who also likes burps. I can find my own boyfriend. Once. I hope. By the way, those contests are just for fun.

Regina\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, but she quickly return the favor, moaning in delight as she finally had her first kiss! Both closed their eyes, allowing themselves to be enveloped by the boiling passion coursing through them. Mark wrapped his left arm around her neck, squishing and groping the thick coating of fat that layered it. Regina responded by pulling the boy in closer and smacking his ass. Marcus flinched at this, letting Regina take the lead, and she was willing to play rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up from her seat, actually lifting her boyfriend off of the floor, and swayed back and forth. Regina blushed as she could feel his penis stiffen like an icicle, jutting into her still caved in navel. Marcus cooed, too aroused by the feeling of being in physical contact with the spicy Latina\u2019s titanic tummy to be embarrassed.  Regina figured that he was sexually pleased now, she might as well go further. The girl shook her stomach in every direction that she could in an attempt to simulate a vibrator. Judging by Marcus\u2019s sex-starved groans, it appeared to be doing the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy.\u201d She thought. \u201cNow, for your reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young adult broke off the kiss, finding it unnecessary given her next plan. Marcus was nearly snapped out of his lustful daze, until he felt a massive weight come down on him. It smelt like literal shit. Clearly, he was wedged in his recent lover\u2019s gluteus maximus. That, or he was in heaven after asphyxiating during the kiss from lack of oxygen. To him, both fates were synonymous.  Meanwhile, Regina was take deep, powerful breaths, as if she were about to give birth, but instead of a bouncing baby, it would be a fantastic fart. She carefully pooled all of her energy into her anus, trying to somehow speed up the digestion process so that her last feast would shift into a rancid gas. It took all of her strength to keep that stink bomb from detonating prematurely; over two decades of experience were finally about to amount to something more than cheap entertainment. It would help Regina feel things that she couldn\u2019t imagine before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smiled like a dumbass, eagerly awaiting the good karma that would bless him for the good things that he\u2019d done today. Then, he thought about how it already happened. Flashbacks shot through his mind; Images of meeting Regina and her friends and of them eating and gassing up two different restaurants magnified the excited feeling that his libido was experiencing. The mere thought of what was in store for him was enough to make him blow up prior to intentions and it was all he could do to keep the adhesive ivory liquid from flooding the floor. In hindsight, a public restaurant wasn\u2019t the best venue to participate in such a kinky pastime. Then again, they were literally the only people in the restaurant now, as the staff couldn\u2019t take the Gluttoons\u2019 combined corrosive gas, so it might not be that embarrassing. Regardless, the boy was not taking to the long charge-up time very well at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrgh!\u201d Mark screamed internally. \u201cThe suspense was horrendous. Just get to the main event already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Regina felt her plump rump reach the limit of what it could contain. Without putting any rational thought into her actions, she pushed out something utterly disgusting.</span></div></div>",

If there would be any flowers they would drop dead. Regina could't help herself and started to laugh and stood up. giving Marcus a chance to escape. He ran out. <br>\r\nLucky there was some space between two sets of doors. Both air locked. Simply because to keep the smell of the food in. Now it also helped against Rgina's fart. Marcus waited outside and A few moments later Regina walked out with a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Marcus said. \"That was fun. The smell was horrible. But men. That was the loudest fart I ever heard. I swear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Don't light a match in there or it will explode. Say... wanna come over to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.

My mother is pregnant from my third sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do you know that it's gonna be a girl? If it is't born yet?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. Only girls are born in my family. My grandma only had sisters. So did my mom, so did I. So why would this be a girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think 50% chance.\" Marcus mumbled. \"But I guess we'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We will. Oh there's the bus.\" Regina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Regina this was a terrific day. She met a nice boy that seemed to like her and her farts. He also liked her belly and her friends and she had a huge meal without having to pay and fun with her friends. She won the burping contest from Penny for the very first time (however she knew she might be less lucky the next burping contest) and now this cool boy went home with her. She could't think of anything that could ruin this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is my home.\" Regina said later. My room is upstairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She opened the door and saw her sisters on the floor. Surrounded by empty boxes, bags and wrappers. Both sisters looked at the other with bloated swollen bellies and their bowl pink cheeks stretched to the maximum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on here?\" Regina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipper tried to say something but her mouth was too full. She the picked a huge pile of white stuff out of her mouth.  \"Well we first had a contest see who could eat the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a tie.\" Terri mumbled angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri would't have mind it if she would have a tie against Regina or a twin sister (if she would have one) but she hated to have a tie with a sister that was four years younger then her. On top of all that, since her sister was younger and shorter then her her fat had less room to spread so she looked even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then we have a contest who can stuff the most marshmallows in her mouth.\" Skipper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far I have won!\" Skipper yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only had one more.\" Terri said. \"I can still fit one more in my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it then!\" Skipper yelled and put the marshmallows back in her mouth so did Terri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smiled. Skipper was maybe the youngest but really a little piggy. She had a huge appetite and could eat as much and sometimes even more then her older sister. Terri hated that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lets go to my room.\"     </span></div></div>",

She reached for his hand and pulled him forward so they could walk together. She noted how rough and calloused his palm felt, and blushed at the strength of his grip. She glanced up at his face, there was a tinge of red across it. He was blushing. She watched his eyes dart over and back, following his path of vision until she realized what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stealing glances at the plush, tanned, jiggling globes of her basketball sized booty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any other time, she'd be furious. She'd have punched him in the belly, in the nose, in the mouth. She'd have made him sorry he looked at her, she'd have made him sorry he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead.....she blushed even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't feel the least bit angry....she felt....flattered. She...enjoyed the fact that Marcus was trying to check her out without getting caught. Especially considering the back end blowouts she's was capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed silent for about ten minutes until Marcus spoke up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" he began \"How far are we from your house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just around the corner\" Regina said her stomach giving off a familiar rumble \"Hold it in\" she thought \"Just want until you get to the bathroom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked up to the house and Regina opened to door to find that....</span></div></div>",

I'm bored st...\" Skipper said while she walked over to the front door, but stopped talking when she saw Marcus and looked confused at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this cute young girl?\" Marcus asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little sister, Skipper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have more siblings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have two: Skipper and Terri. Both younger than me. Skipper is the youngest. Our sister Terri is 12.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have three siblings.\" Skipper said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, twerp. Fine my mother is pregnant from her fourth child. So I'm going to get another sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can also be a brother.\" Skipper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been over this a few times. Mommy only had sisters, just like grandma. We are all girls. I think it's almost impossible this is going to be a boy. I told you that already, a few times. Now try to remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it can also be a boy. Mom told me so. But that doesn't matter really. Who is that boy you have with you? I don't remember him. So who is he? Tell me! Tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! This is Marcus. He is new here in the neighborhood. I met him at the bus and showed him around and I invited him over. Now we're going to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to play with you. Terri is gone and I'm all alone.\" Skipper pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, okay.\" Regina said trying to cheer her sister up, but Skipper still pouted. \"You know what. If you leave us alone for some time, you may borrow one of my Disney movies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any Disney movie?\" Skipper asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long if you're not too young for it. Apart from that, yeah. Any.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina and Skipper were both great fans of Disney movies. Regina had a whole collection of them and Skipper loved it when she was allowed to watch one of them. She ran as fast as a girl of her size could to Regina's room. She looked a bit through the movies and picked out \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\". After that, she ran downstairs to watch it so Regina knew Skipper would be occupied for at least one hour. More if she also watched the trailers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was my sister. She's pretty nice, but still a little kid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I think she going to become a beautiful girl when she grows up.\" Marcus said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I think she's going to look a lot like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smiled and blushed, but this was all a bit new for her. Marcus was the first boyfriend she ever had. It seemed like most boys weren't interested at a fat, tanned, farting girl. However, she thought, she looked pretty good, but most boys thought otherwise, except Marcus. It also seemed he liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is my room.\" Regina said and blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" Marcus asked suddenly pointing at a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina looked at it. It was a picture of her and her best friends last summer. They were all in tight bikinis. No wonder since all girls were very fat and all of them liked it and all of the wanted to get fatter. That was probably also why they were best friends. Around her friends she could just be herself. At the picture were...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Regina didn\u2019t have to try hard to push out her fart since she had a lot of experience doing so. After it ended five seconds later, she sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh.

Now this would all be over thanks to one of her farts. Why? So much for the wish about having a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say I like it. I thought it was pretty funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina put on big eyes. She was convinced that Marcus would be negative about her farting, but he seemed to like it. She looked at him wondering if he mend what he said. He smiled friendly at her. She felt how her face slowly got his normal color again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like it. You did't thought it was... well... disgusting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I think it was disgusting? Do you think it's disgusting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... but most girls at school think it's disgusting. *sigh* But you really like it?\" Regina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You did't have to go the restroom for me. Does that farts of you happen more often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It's my biggest talent... or problem... or whatever. Well that and eating. I love eating. Well you could of course see that already.\" She said and slapped her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I missed the fart but perhaps I can see the eating. This mall had a lot of fast food places. So I can buy a lunch for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna ask me out. Believe me, you don't want that. It will drain your wallet. I... well I eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Really believe me. I'm kind of... well rich. I have more then enough money.\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Well I guess since you invited me and know that I eat a lot it would be impolite to refuse your offer.\" Regina said with a wide smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's go. Do you have a favorite place for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. It is't far from here. It's called: Sea world. It serves well... anything that comes from the sea. So mainly fish and other sea food, and of course my delicious lobster. Oh I love that so much. Well I like sea food anyway but lobster is my favorite. Look here it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went in and Marcus blinked a few times. The windows were made of blue glass so inside everything looked a bit blue. The walls were decorated with drawings of fish, sunken ships, waving water plants and other stuff you expected to find at the bottom of the sea. The boss also made a play land with a big ship in it. When Regina was little she always loved it to play in there.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. The boss of this place really put a lot of effort in it. It looks good now for the food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went sitting at a table.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",
