            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adam was sitting at the back of his middle school classroom, admiring the girl of his dreams - Katie. She was an athletic champion, a teacher's pet, and a total knockout bombshell beauty. And, what was more, she was single. But she'd never be interested in an average boy with few talents like Alex, especially since she rejected every single boy on the football team who asked to date her. As the final school bell rang, Alex packed up his school bag and quietly walked out, hoping not to draw any attention from bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was crying in the elementary school changing rooms when the bell rang. He'd been the last pick of both sides in dodge ball due to his being extremely uncoordinated and weak. He mostly had to sit in the corner again while all his classmates had fun, which annoyed him. He wished he could be strong! But he was nothing - not good at school, or sports; condemned to mediocrity just like his brother Adam. Ben couldn't wait until he could drop out of school so he could just play video games or something - anything to escape the terrible reality he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping away his tears, he eventually made it out to meet his younger brother Cody, who was waiting by the gate for him.<br>\r\n\"You had a tough day too, bro?\" asked Cody, who had a huge black eye from being punched in the face during lunchtime.<br>\r\n\"Just like everyday\" replied Ben.<br>\r\n\"Hey twerps\" said Will, a classmate of Cody \"Move out of the way will you, people who matter are coming through.\"<br>\r\nBen and Cody stood aside reluctantly, but Will pushed them anyway, sending them flying into a brick wall and collapse on top of each other on the ground.<br>\r\nImmediately, Adam came running up. \"Hey, that wasn't very nice! Don't treat my little brothers that way!\" he called.<br>\r\nIn response, Will punched him in the gut. Hard.<br>\r\n\"I'll do whatever I want\" bragged Will while Adam fell on top of his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Adam could see Katie talking with two of her friends.<br>\r\n\"Hey, isn't that the creepy boy who always sits in the back of your class?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard he's always watching you like a creep\"<br>\r\n\"What a loser, he just got beat up by a nine-year-old\"<br>\r\n\"That whole family are losers, better just avoid them\"<br>\r\nListening to her friends' advice, Katie turned away while Adam lay there, heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the father to the three boys, David, arrived in a cheap old car to pick them up.<br>\r\n\"Come on kids, hop in!\" he called. He didn't comment on how they were all battered and broken on the ground - that was how they usually were after school.<br>\r\nAt the same time, a limousine arrived to pick up Will.<br>\r\n\"Stupid executive vice president\" murmured David \"That idiot keeps making my life a living hell at work!\"<br>\r\nAdam, dragging himself to the car, was more focused on the cute little pink import that had arrived to pick up Katie.<br>\r\nDavid pinched his oldest son until his pupils were no longer love-heart shaped. \"No time for fantasizing, just get your seatbelt on! Traffic is appalling today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, the family of four arrived at the caravan park they called home. The caravan trailer they owned had only two beds, so Ben and Cody had to share, while Adam had his own bed and David slept on the floor. David usually made enough money for food, but there wasn't much for anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way inside, suddenly, an old woman came out of a nearby caravan. The caravan had just parked there but was quite large, with a gypsy-style design. On seeing Cody, the bruised little boy with a huge black eye, she suddenly recoiled in shock.<br>\r\n\"You ... you are the chosen one\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n\"Uhm - what?\" asked Cody.<br>\r\nDavid turned his little head away. \"Let's just go inside, we don't want any trouble\" he insisted.<br>\r\nThe boys hurried in, while the old woman was left standing outside looking very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came inside, David hit his head on the top of the door. Ben quickly rushed over with some bandages and began tending to his injury, while Adam helped Cody with his black eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think something good might ever happen in our family?\" sighed Ben \"Maybe we could win lotto or something.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't really afford a ticket\" said David \"Ever since your mother died, that's when it all started.\"<br>\r\nAll of the boys looked down to the far side of the caravan, where a big photograph of their mother hung.<br>\r\n\"Cancer is brutal, of course\" continued David \"And you know we've never been in the same financial situation since we took on all that debt to fund her cancer treatments. But in the end, nothing helped.\"<br>\r\nCody sighed. He wished there was something he could do, but like the rest of the family, he didn't know what.</span></div></div>",

Wake up!\" said Cody, shaking David roughly.<br>\r\nDavid turned over on the floor. \"Five more minutes please\" he groaned.<br>\r\nCody frowned. \"Stop being tired\" he commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, all tiredness left David and he sat right up. \"That was weird\" he said \"Uh - what's the matter Cody?\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, so last night there was this huge choir of angels and I became God and gained unlimited power and basically I control the universe now and forever!\" said Cody excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Uh - ok\" replied David, not believing a word Cody was saying.<br>\r\nCody was already moving on to wake up Adam, and David was surprised Ben wasn't already awake with all the noise Cody was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Adam had a very similar, disbelieving reaction, David stood up. \"Alright, uh, new God, I guess I'd better make us some breakfast so you can power up for school and won't be hurt too much when they punch you today.\"<br>\r\nCody rolled his eyes. \"No, dad, I'll get us some breakfast! I'm God now after all.\" And with a flourish, a delicious banquet suddenly appeared stacked on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God - bacon and eggs!?\" said Ben, suddenly sitting up \"I haven't had those since mum died!\"<br>\r\n\"French toast!\" cheered Adam \"My absolute favorite!\"<br>\r\n\"A sweet bowl of plain rolled oats with a tiny pinch of brown sugar!\" said David, who for some reason loved that particular breakfast \"How ... how did you do that? We can't afford this kind of breakfast food.\"<br>\r\n\"All food belongs to me, since I'm God\" explained Cody \"Eat all you want, as all those plates will refill themselves anyway as you eat them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody watched with satisfaction as his father and two brothers hungrily devoured their food. As they did so, the magical food healed them of all their injuries from the previous day. Soon he joined them, eating some of his never-ending supply of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so good!\" said Ben with his mouth full.<br>\r\n\"It's like Christmas come early\" affirmed David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had all eaten a complete breakfast, Cody waved his hands again and all the food disappeared.<br>\r\n\"Now, it's time to get dressed\" he said with a smile \"So, David, how about a new suit for the office.\"<br>\r\n\"But I can't afford a suit\" replied David \"I usually just wear a nice shirt and whatever trousers I can find.\"<br>\r\n\"After all our family has been through, I think you deserve something nice\" said Cody.<br>\r\nSuddenly, David's nightgown morphed into a custom-tailored formal business suit with a stunning red tie. Immediately he felt washed, smelled fresh and looked like a million bucks.<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is incredible!\" he cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for us\" said Cody to his brothers \"Let's have some new school uniforms that aren't tattered old hand-me-downs!\"<br>\r\nJust then, the three boys found their clothes switched with brand new uniforms, which were a huge improvement on what they had before. Likewise, Adam and Ben found themselves feeling refreshed, washed and ready for the day. Even Ben's messy hair was combed.<br>\r\n\"Wow!\"<br>\r\n\"You're amazing bro!\"<br>\r\nThe entire family hugged. David couldn't believe it - it seemed finally, his family's bad luck had turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at the time!\" said David, noticing his microwave clock \"We'd better get going if we don't want to be late. All the congestion lately is super annoying.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can fix that\" said Cody, and with another small flourish, the clock rewound itself. The rest of the family watched in awe as the sun went down a little more in the sky. \"Now, we should probably also get a new house.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean we won't have to share a bed anymore?\" said Ben.<br>\r\n\"Yeah - you're finally getting your own bed\" confirmed Cody.<br>\r\nBen's eyes watered. \"You're the best\" was all he could say, before bursting into a torrent of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the caravan disappeared from the park. Outside, on the steps of a gypsy caravan, an old woman smoked a pipe and smiled knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in an affluent neighborhood near the school, where Will and Katie both also lived, two huge mansions moved aside to make way for a new, enormous mansion that grew out of the ground. Gardens reshaped themselves to accommodate the new property, which despite the wealth of the area, immediately put all the other houses to shame with its grandiose opulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our new home!\" said Cody as the four appeared in the atrium of the giant property, staring at a giant sculpture and water feature worthy of the finest craftspeople.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter David, Alex and Ben were done marveling with their jaws close to the floor, all three went running around exploring like little ants. David felt like a kid again, discovering magnificent room after magnificent room, all furnished with the finest chattels available anywhere on Earth. It was unlike anything he had ever seen - even in his wildest imaginings had he ever contemplated such decadence. Clearly, God had spared no expense in ensuring his family would live in luxury, and David shuddered to think of how many billions this property was worth. Even the beautiful suburb out of the window seemed like a slum in comparison to how marvelous this place was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeee!\" squealed Ben as he flew from an epic indoor slide into a giant ball pit.<br>\r\n\"This is amazing\" said Adam from out of a virtual reality chamber.<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" said Ben as he hit a strike on the indoor bowling alley.<br>\r\n\"Best house ever!\" said Adam as he swum through a lake of solid gold in the treasure room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they all had a chance to explore their new home, all three made their ways back to the atrium and threw themselves at Cody's feet, worshiping him.<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, get up\" chuckled Cody \"You're my family. This isn't even the least I can do - I still have so many blessings that I need to give you all!\"<br>\r\nEveryone in his family did so, but Cody saw they were crying - not tears of sadness, but tears of joy. David was so proud of his young son, becoming God and acting so kindly towards them, even though all he had ever known were the strong bullying the weak. At last, it seemed, the fortunes of his family had turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, David's mind wandered to his deceased wife. It was strange, in a way, to see this fortune return, when he was so sure it was a curse brought about by his wife's absence from his life. He made a mental note to pay her grave site a visit later in the day to tell her of what happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, I guess it must really be time to head off now\" said David after a moment's reflection \"Have you all packed your schoolbags?\"<br>\r\nCody clicked his fingers and fully-packed schoolbags appeared on each of the young boys' backs. \"Oh, and dad, you don't need to drive us anymore\" he added.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked David.<br>\r\n\"I'll just teleport us!\" said Cody excitedly \"Adam, you want to go to your class first?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Adam, and instantly found himself standing outside of his classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey Adam cutie\" said a young-looking supermodel with huge breasts, wearing nothing but lingerie, beckoning him into the class.<br>\r\n\"Uh ... who are you?\" he asked awkwardly as he came in.<br>\r\n\"Your new teacher\" explained the woman \"Oh, and most of your classmates have been replaced by cute girls your age. Everyone, actually, except for...\"<br>\r\n\"Hi\" said a sweet voice behind him, covering his eyes with her hands \"Guess who?\"<br>\r\n\"Katie?!\" Adam almost spat into her hand in shock.<br>\r\nKatie giggled and spun him around, while Adam quickly moved his hands down to cover his raging erection, which somehow seemed much bigger than it had ever been before. Giving him a wry smile, Katie began unbuttoning her shirt with one hand, while reaching down to push his hands away, and leaning in for a very aggressive kiss.<br>\r\nAdam's new teacher laughed and cheered as she watched the R-rated action unfold. \"Yeah! You go girl! Ride that stud like the stallion he is! Woo!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Cody!\" screamed Adam as he lost his virginity to the girl of his dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cody tapped Ben on the shoulder at home. \"So, you might feel a little different when you get teleported, ok?\" he said to his older brother.<br>\r\n\"That's cool Cody, everything you do seems to be awesome\" said the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Ben knew, he was growing! Only it wasn't so much a growth in height, but in muscle. His school uniform struggled to contain him as layer after layer of thick muscles were packed on his young body, until he felt as strong as an Olympian god. His shirt buttons tore around his enormous pecs, a chiseled six-pack was clearly visible beneath the remains of his shirt, and his pants were torn around his gigantic quads, leaving the boy looking like he had transformed into some sort of Hulk. Before Ben had any chance to be astonished by his awesome transformation, however, he found himself outside his classroom, now wearing a larger uniform that was better suited to his new, athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, he felt a tiny worthless speck bump into him. It was Will, Cody's classmate who had pushed them the previous day. Will fell down in Ben's shadow, with a look of pure horror on his face.<br>\r\n\"B ... b ... Ben??\" he stuttered quietly.<br>\r\n\"Will\" snarled Ben \"Looks like all your friends just ran away.\"<br>\r\nWill looked beside him, and saw everyone else had fled the scene in a hurry. Ben smiled, knowing that Cody had made him into the toughest kid in the school now.<br>\r\n\"Please\" begged Will as he gazed upon the new and improved Ben \"I'll do anything, just don't hurt AARRRGGH!\"<br>\r\nBen punched Will so hard it made a loud boom echo around the school. The wall at the far side of the hall was indented with Will's body shape, but Ben wasn't done. Before Will could fall to the ground, Ben picked him up and tossed him like a javelin through a window. Crash! Glass went everywhere, as Ben now took the one-sided fight outside and kicked Will into the air repeatedly, juggling him as though he were a soccer ball at his feet. Will could barely catch a breath as Ben threw him to the ground like a professional wrestler, before proceeding to pull all of his hair out.<br>\r\n\"You like this? You like it when a bigger kid picks on you?\" said Ben, enraged.<br>\r\n\"No! Please! Have mercy! I'll never do it again!\" pleaded Will as Ben choked him with his powerful foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Will found himself healed. His hair grew back instantly. All the property damage was reversed. Time around both boys seemed to go backwards, to after school the previous day. Ben and Will seemed to be like ghosts, watching as the final school bell rang. Will could only watch in horror as he saw himself haughtily approach the two down-on-their-luck little children by the school gate, rudely pushing them aside.<br>\r\nWill immediately broke down in tears. \"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Please don't kill me! I didn't mean to ... I just ... I thought you didn't matter because you didn't have any friends in the school\" cried Will, as he found himself strangely compelled to speak honestly \"From now on I promise to be a good boy and never hurt anyone again!\"<br>\r\nTime went the other way again, and the two boys found themselves on the school courtyard, with Will whimpering on the ground.<br>\r\nBen offered him his hand. \"Friends?\" asked Ben with a warm smile.<br>\r\nWill looked up, crying. \"After all that?\" he asked \"All that I've done to you, and you still want to be f... friends?\"<br>\r\n\"The old Will did all those things to me\" explained Ben \"But not anymore. Now you're a brand new Will, and I want you to be my first friend in this school.\"<br>\r\nWill took Ben's hand, still crying. \"It's an honor\" he said, as he came up to his feet.<br>\r\nAs the two new friends headed for class, Ben muttered: \"Thanks Cody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, David had just seen his two eldest sons disappear and had no idea what they were doing.<br>\r\n\"You ready for work?\" asked Cody.<br>\r\n\"Sure am\" said David, as he suddenly found himself at his desk at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" called his boss from his office \"Pack up your things! The CEO wants to talk with you!\"<br>\r\nDavid shuddered. This had to be serious - usually the human resources team handled ordinary dismissals. The CEO rarely seemed to do any work at all, in fact, and was only paid a huge salary while workers like David made him richer.<br>\r\nAs David walked into the office, he was astonished that it was almost as rich and glamorous as his own house. There were curtains inlaid with diamonds and gold, fountains of champagne and sweet classical music everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David\" said the CEO \"It is about time that I retired. I have decided to make you my replacement.\"<br>\r\nDavid just sat there in shock, although at this stage, given that his son was literally God, it didn't seem quite as surprising anymore.<br>\r\n\"You don't really need to do any work, just sit behind the desk while the office workers make you richer\" explained the CEO \"The only condition of your employment is that the executive vice president is fired. I don't know why, but for some reason when I woke up this morning I just had this feeling like it was the right thing to do.\"<br>\r\n\"I accept your offer\" replied David, shrugging.<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" called the CEO, clapping his hands and then shaking David's \"I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\nWith that, the CEO left while David was jubilant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Cody!\" he screamed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody smiled as he teleported to his own classroom. As he entered, he was satisfied to find Will grovelling at his feet, but other than that nothing was out of the ordinary for him. He was still just a scrawny little kid - except that nobody in the class knew he had God powers. Everyone just thought it was lucky Ben had a huge growth spurt and all the males except Adam in the middle school left town while a huge number of cute girls moved in. But Cody liked it that way - not drawing any attention to the fact he was God. As the school bell rang to begin the day, he sat at his usual desk and, apart from Will, everyone gave him cold shoulders like usual. But that was alright - he didn't want to make his grand reveal yet.</span></div></div>",

Besides, the cake looked like it wasn't even big enough to feed all the guests anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven, who was the older brother at 14, decided to help the younger brother out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dave. Don't worry, little bro. Maybe we'll get you a chocolate cake when we take you out to dinner tonight!\" Steven said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then walked over the table where the rectangular pineapple cake was sitting neatly on the dish, ready to be served. He stared at the cake, feeling sorry for his little bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he was overcome by an odd feeling. Something deep inside of him told him, that he had the ability to help his little brother out. All he had to do was just imagine what he wanted to change, and reality would be altered in an instant. It was as if some amazing power within him had suddenly been awakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh... Wouldn't it be nice of the pineapple cake would just transform into a chocolate cake... And perhaps grow to twice the size as well?\" Steven thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven stared at the cake intently, and imagined the yellow-colored cake morph into a bigger version of itself, filled with dark brown chocolate and covered with chocolate frosting instead of lemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the small cake grew before his eyes, eclipsing the baking sheet that it rested on. The larger cake now became darker in color as the yellow lemon filling morphed into dark brown chocolate. The outer layer of the cake transformed into smooth, chocolate brown frosting, which had the words \"Happy Birthday David\" engraved on it in yellow frosting letters. Twelve candles stood on top of the large, dark cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Chocolate cake!\" David cheered, as he walked by the table. \"Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I told you mom would fix it!\" Steven replied quickly, not quite knowing how to explain the sudden transformation to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his brother walked off to greet his friends, Steven just stood there, realizing that he just changed the cake from lemon to chocolate by just thinking it. Did he gain some sort of incredible power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With some brief concentration causing a slight frown he was the cleanest he had ever been in his life and then with another thought his clothes were fresh and being worn once again. The young teen opened his eyes and stared at himself in wonder, his heart pounding with excitement at his power. He could do anything! His mind started to wander, exploring darker and thrilling possibilities, his cock hardening in his clean shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven shook himself from his reverie, smiling. Not yet. First he had to give David his birthday present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven made his way back downstairs, following the sound of chatter and conversation. He found his mother in the kitchen, with her sister Aunt Nancy, preparing some food. Then, as the sound of excited talking and shouting grew louder, he found David with his friends and sisters in the living room, playing video games. As he looked around he saw there was David, his best friends from school Jack and Laura, his sisters Sara and Julie and their nine-year old cousin Colin. David was watching four of the others play, seemingly taking a break in one of the armchairs as they chatted and laughed. With his heart beating so hard he thought it would burst from his chest, his pulse roaring in his ears with anticipation, Steven concentrated and focused his power on his younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, Colin, keep going!\" David leaned forward and high-fived his younger cousin, sitting on the floor near his armchair, as he managed to stay on top in the video game. The younger boy's cheeks flushed slightly with pride as Laura clapped him on the shoulder too. Colin was quite shy and always looked up to David, almost idolising him. He was a good influence on him and they were quite close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly David flinched as he felt his genitals tingle, a pleasant warm feeling washing over his crotch. He shifted in the armchair, his cheeks blushing slightly as his eyes flicked to the others. His older sister, Sara, was next to him on a sofa, while Julie was on the floor on the opposite side, playing the game with Colin, Laura and Jack. All were focused on the television for the moment. His hands tightened on the armrests as the pleasant tingling grew more intense and he loosed a light gasp as his arousal began to build, his cock starting to grow hard and flex against his underwear. His eyes became lidded as the warm tingling started to wash over his whole body in waves, his chest heaving as he started to pant while his shorts started to tent as his dick swelled into a full erection, twitching against his restrictive underpants. His tongue lolled out of his mouth as sweat prickled across his bare skin. His penis was the hardest it had ever been in his life, throbbing and oozing precum with a need that David had never felt before, as the sensation enveloped his entire shaft. His hips started to twitch upward in response as it felt like something incredibly warm and wet was massaging his cock, flooding his mind with intense, electric bolts of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David? W-what's wrong?\" Sara stammered quietly as she looked over to see David slumped low in the chair, a clear bulge in his pants and his crotch twitching upward at regular intervals, sweat shining on his face and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes slowly moved to meet hers, his older sister captivated by the sight. He groaned quietly as the sensation grew even more intense and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...<b>ungh</b>...dunno,\" he gasped, his head falling back. \"Feels...really...good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" Sara breathed, unable to look away as her face flushed and her pulse increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven watched the scene unfold from the doorway, his own cock rock hard and his lungs heaving, as he channelled his power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He's going to cum loads,\"</i> Steven decided, caught up in the intense moment. <i>\"More than anyone has ever cum before.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could feel some sort of release rapidly approaching, not quite sure what to expect. He had never fully masturbated before, only making his cock hard, but he knew this was going to be intense. The twitching of his hips started to become smooth gyrations, his pelvis rocking back and forth in the seat, his hands gripping the armrests so tightly that his knuckled were white. Then it crested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Aaaaaaarrgh!</b>\" David's eyes snapped open and his mouth fell open to loose a loud groan as he climaxed, his crotch thrusting upward as his cock erupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pre-teen felt great thick ropes of cum burst from his penis, roaring up his shaft to flood his underwear. Every thrust of his hips came with a fresh burst of thick, potent cum, the stream never-ending. The groan had drawn all the attention in the room to him and the kids stared, mostly open-mouthed, at the sight of David humping the air and the audible, muffled sound of fluid shooting from his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...not...s-stopping...<b>hnnngh</b>!\" David moaned as he felt the cum flowing down his cock and pooling around his balls, more and more ejaculating from his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had cum so much that his underwear was soaked, while a wet stain had rapidly spread from the tip of his shaft to cover most of his crotch. Some of the semen oozed out of his shorts, dripping thickly to the seat of the armchair, while thicker and thicker streams started running down his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ooorgh</b>...y-yeah...m-more...\" David groaned, almost catatonic with ecstasy, sweat pouring down his face and soaking his shirt as he kept cumming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely had the energy to thrust anymore so his crotch just twitched, the same volume of semen spilling forth every time. He had climaxed for several straight minutes, the brightly-white, potent liquid now staining a large part of the seat of the armchair, his shorts almost entirely soaked while small streams of it ran all the way down to his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven finally released the climax and David slumped completely, eyes closed as he practically fell asleep. Steven's own eyes were lidded and his cock was twitching against his underwear as he rode the ecstasy. His eyes moved to the other kids and he licked his lips as he prepared to use his power once more.</span></div></div>",

Jack was also 12 years old and was an avid gamer and computer nerd, just like Steven\u2019s little brother. In fact, Jack came over and hung out with David quite often. Unfortunately, David and Jack also got bullied quite a bit for being nerds, and with Jack wearing glasses and loving science and computers, that didn\u2019t help his nerdy reputation much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut David absolutely loved the computer gaming and graphics programming book that Jack gave him and they spent ten minutes browsing through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t bring the book to school, bro\u2026\u201d Jack said quietly. \u201cAll the jocks are gonna slam us for bringing it in and for making us out for being computer geeks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026 They already know us as geeks\u2026\u201d David grinned. \u201cWe just need to figure out how we can stop the morons from picking on us all the time!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and David sat down and played their games and Jack was the one who totally looked at his buddy in complete awe when David burst out in the biggest orgasm ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang Dave! What the hell happened to you, bro?\u201d Jack giggled. \u201cYou just orgasmed all over the couch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was looking on and pondered their previous conversation about David and Jack getting bullied all the time and came upon a solution to that problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 They\u2019re both nerds\u2026 But if one of them were a little more buff, then the jocks would leave them alone! Ahha! Jack needs to grow some muscle!\u201d Steven thought to himself. \u201cI want Jack\u2019s muscles to inflate like balloons until he\u2019s way stronger than all the jocks at his school!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was suddenly overcome by an intense tingling as he sat on the couch next to David. His chest began to bulge and his shoulders began to widen instantly, growing wider and deeper. He immediately grew a V-taper and his abdominal muscles became very defined, morphing into an impressive six-pack on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026.\u201d Jack moaned softly, as his body continued to expand, ripping out of his t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps ballooned into huge spheres of rock-hard muscles, completely covered in veins, and even his forearms bulged into thick pythons of muscle power that rivaled those of Popeye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh man\u2026. What the heck?\u201d Jack groaned as he felt his strength increase everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calves inflated into soccer balls of power, hard as steel and pulsing with power, which his quads grew so wide that they stuck out from the side of his torso. His quads were layered with powerful cords of muscle as well, making his legs feel like rocket boosters of strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Jack shouted, as he stood up, showing off his Herculean body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, his torn shirt and shorts morphed into new, blue-and-white Lycra training suit, which stretched from above his knees to his shoulders like a wrestling singlet, showing off all his muscles. His old shoes changed into the latest LeBron basketball shoes, giving him a total look of a jock who spent all his free time lifting weights in the gym!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jack could say anything, one of the other mothers of the kids came over, holding a glass jar of sauce in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack! I can\u2019t open up this new jar of dressing! You\u2019re such a strong boy! Could you open it for me, please?\u201d the lady said as she handed the muscle boy the unopened jar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure, Miss Jane!\u201d Jack smiled as he held the jar in his left hand while he grabbed the cap with his right hand and gave it a firm twist, causing the cap to come off with a loud POP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, sweetheart! That\u2019s why we need a muscle kid around like you!\u201d Miss Jane said, as she accepted the opened jar from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren then walked up to him and gently rubbed his biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Hercules! Please set next to me\u2026\u201d she smiled, as she sat down on the couch next to David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 uhh, sure\u2026\u201d Jack said, still shy as always, as he carefully sat down next to her. None of the girls had ever noticed him before when he was a scrawny boy but now that he was a muscle dude, everybody notices him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven just grinned at the results of his handiwork. David got his present in the form of an orgasm and Jack became a junior bodybuilder. Now they can go to school without getting bullied. So, what would Steven do next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, he closed his eyes and silently wished for his 12-year-old brother David to suddenly have the urge to look him up. About ten seconds had passed and there was a soft knocking on the bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteve? Are you alright?\u201d David asked. \u201cPeople are starting to arrive for the party!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Come on in, little bro!\u201d Steven shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened the door and closed it again after he walked in, finding Steven laying on his bed. Steven just looked at his brother with a smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s it feel to be twelve-years-old, little bro?\u201d Steven asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, about the same. I mean, I\u2019m no bigger or taller or anything. I\u2019m in middle school so I\u2019m still getting picked on by the bigger kids so nothing has changed except for my age\u2026\u201d David sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 Well I just want to make sure I give you a nice birthday present, little bro!\u201d Steven grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?

His ordinary sandals morphed into the newest Air Jordan basketball shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext, I want you to look like a total jock, little bro!\u201d Steven laughed. \u201cYou won\u2019t get bullied at school ever again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid suddenly felt a tingling all over his body, especially in all his muscles. Then, every muscle in his body began to inflate like helium balloon! His chest ballooned into nice, bulging pectorals. His biceps enlarged into big, strong muscles on his arms. Mighty washboard abdominal muscles formed below his bulging pecs. David\u2019s shoulders grew wider as lats stretched out underneath. His back grew into a huge slab of muscle as well while his calves inflated into soccer balls and his quads ballooned into huge pillars of rock-hard vein-covered muscle above his knees. David had suddenly transformed into a young junior bodybuilder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Holy smoke!\u201d David smiled as he looked down at his incredibly well-defined body. \u201cI\u2019m totally buff now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking awesome, little bro!

Steven just smiled as he looked at his muscle-boy little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle stud!\u201d he grinned. He wondered what to do next\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven felt a little weird about using his new powers on someone related to him, at least for now, and decided that going outside the house would be the best place to start. At first he got up and started walking to the door, but then he thought, \u201cWait a minute, why not just teleport myself outside! I am a god after all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, he did so. He also simultaneously made himself invisible so that no one would be freaked out by his sudden appearance out of thin air. As he looked around the neighborhood, he thought that, while it might be interesting to just give people random orgasms for no reason, it would be better to make them orgasm by giving them their innermost desires, their biggest turn-ons. And he could always reverse things afterwards if needed, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he decided who to start with, he looked at the houses on either side of his own. The neighbors to the left were a single dad and a teenage son. The dad was always away at work, leaving the son, Brandon, on his own most of the time. Brandon was a sophomore at Stephen\u2019s high school, average height and build with medium-length brown. He had a few close friends but kept quiet most of the time. Using his godly omniscience, Stephen looked into Brandon\u2019s heart, finding that Brandon was secretly closeted and hadn\u2019t come out to anyone, not his family or his friends. He also had a crush on about ten guys at school, including each of his close friends. His deepest, biggest sexual fantasy was to be the center of an orgy with each of these crushes, all of them focusing on pleasuring him. It would be interesting to fulfill this desire, Stephen thought, especially since all but one of the guys Brandon crushed on were straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulling it over, he turned to the house on the right. A Korean-American family of five lived there: Mr. and Mrs. Kim and two daughters (Allison, a college senior, and Michelle, who was in Stephen\u2019s class), but as Stephen explored the family\u2019s thoughts, he settled on the youngest son, Alex. Alex was 12-years old, with shaggy black hair and glasses, on the short side for his age and skinny as a twig. He had played with Stephen\u2019s brother David when they were younger, but in the past few years had become more isolated. He was really into monster movies and anime, especially episodes where the characters had superpowers or would grow into giants. When Stephen probed deeper, he was amused to find that as Alex had recently begun to explore his sexual desires and fantasies, he imagined himself to grow bigger than the rest of his family, bigger than his house and all the other kids at school, bigger than the city \u2014 even beyond that, as big as he could imagine. Stephen supposed this made sense in a way, and granting Alex\u2019s deepest desires could prove messy, but it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for an omnipotent god like himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen took a few minutes to consider the two subjects he had so far examined, or wondered if he should expand his search, before finally deciding to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Stephen decided on his target, he blinked and found himself in Alex's bedroom, still invisible. The boy was alone in the house as his parents had gone to one of Michelle's Cheerleading competitions, and he was sitting at his computer in a white undershirt and pair of boxer-briefs. Much to Stephen's amusement, he saw that Alex was watching a Godzilla movie, and seemed to be getting really into it. Now would be the perfect time to give him what he always wanted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt the weird yet familiar feeling inside his gut as he watched Godzilla step out into the city for what was probably close to the hundredth time by now. Closing his eyes, he started to imagine what it would be like if he were that height, the streets of a crowded city at his feet, able to do whatever he wanted. It was a thought that never failed to arouse his young mind, and as had become usual, he began to squeeze the tightening bulge that had formed in his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute or two for him to realize that the tightening of his clothes wasn't just centralized to his groin. The bottom of his shirt seemed to be not quite reaching the top of his underwear anymore, and more of his thighs were beginning to show. At first, he chuckled, thinking his fantasy was getting the better of him for a moment, but as the seconds passed the feeling didn't go away, instead becoming more and more prominent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to his feet, Alex ran over to the door of his room where he had been marking his height progress over the last couple of years, waiting for that promised growth spurt that he had begun to think would never come. His jaw dropped as he saw that the most recent mark, made only a week ago at a height that he had later measured of just over four and a half feet, was now below his chin. \"No way!\" he exclaimed, realizing that he now must be over five feet tall. \"Yesss! I'm no longer the smallest one in my class!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to step over to his dresser to grab the pencil and make another mark, but after he had taken only one step, he stopped, feeling a sudden light-headedness come on. As he reached out to try and steady himself against the wall, his muscles all started to ache at once, and a deep pressure welled up in his gut, a thousand times more intense than anything he felt when he was watching monster movies. \"W-what's happening?\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, he saw his room seem to shrink before his eyes. His shirt and underwear tugged against his skin before beginning to make a loud ripping sound, and his feet slid against the carpet as they spread further apart. After a few seconds, the intense feeling was over, and Alex took a deep breath, trying to figure out what had just happened. As he looked forward, though, he realized that his eyes were now level with the top of the door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Alex said under his breath, \"I must be seven feet tall!\" His voice was louder than he expected, but still sounded the same, and he felt lucky that he was home alone right now. Looking down at his enlarged body, he saw that his shirt was now in tatters, and his underwear was more like briefs that were several sizes too small, barely containing his now-raging hard-on. He took a few steps, delighted at the loud thumping sound his feet now made when they hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind raced with so many thoughts. How did this happen? Is he dreaming? Why did his glasses grow with him while the rest of his clothes didn't? Pushing all of those thoughts out of his mind, however, Alex decided to accept this lifelong fantasy while he could. He began to move to his desk chair, before laughing as he realized he was now too big for it. Sitting instead on the edge of his bed, he spread his feet out, amazed at the fact that they now nearly reached the wall whereas a few minutes ago they couldn't even reach the floor. After getting comfortable, he gave his bulge a good squeeze, trying to decide if now would be a good time to indulge himself. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The combination of the squeeze of his bulge and the overall giddiness he felt at his new height was too much to resist. Alex tried to pull down the waistband of his boxer-briefs, which only caused the elastic waistband to finally give and rip down the sides. His already rock-hard cock sprung out and nearly hit his stomach, and Alex let out a small gasp when he saw the length of it. Even compared to the overall growth he had experienced, his member had received an even greater dose, now almost twice as long as his hand from palm to fingertip and thick enough around that he couldn't grip it entirely with one hand. His balls, too, had swelled in size, now reaching halfway down his thigh. He had already watched a few porn videos on the internet, and his package dwarfed the size of even the largest one he had ever seen there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clenched his fingers around the sensitive shaft and began stroking it, leaning back and closing his eyes while he did so. In his mind he could see the faces of the other students at school-- heck, even his teachers-- looking up at him in awe, dwindling further and further away as he towered over everybody. \"Sooo biiiig,\" he moaned, biting his lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued, he felt a tingling sensation build in his muscles, and the now-familiar light-headedness return. When he opened his eyes again, he realized his head was now inches from the ceiling, even from his seat on the bed. \"I-I'm still growing??\" he exclaimed, as his feet made a loud THUNK sound against the wall. He tried scooting back on the bed and leaning further back to give himself more room, but his body only took that as a cue to enlarge even faster, and within a few seconds, Alex found himself with his back against one wall, his head hitting the ceiling, and the tips of his toes able to touch the opposing wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time, his bed had started to groan under the sudden increase of weight it was forced to bear, and as Alex tried to shift his weight one more time to make room for his expanding form, it suddenly collapsed with a loud CRASH sound, the wooden frame and box-springs splintering apart, leaving on the ground the mattress, which Alex's backside now covered nearly half of. This caused Alex to fall back against the wall slightly, the force of his shoulder blades leaving dents in the drywall. His feet now were pressed firm against the wall, causing him to bend his knees, knocking over the framed posters on the opposite wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnng... don't stop.\" Alex's booming voice filled the house, and he continued to beat off, somewhat amazed that he hadn't climaxed already. Of course, everything that had happened in the last few minutes was amazing, even more erotic than he could ever have imagined. He was already bigger than anyone alive, and he was running out of space in his room -- but he wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen, still invisible and now floating outside the house, was reading Alex's thoughts and emotions the whole time, and was loving this little experiment of his. And so, he decided to continue to fulfill the boy's desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, Alex's growth kicked into overdrive, and his body expanded outward in every direction. His feet kicked through the walls out into the open, his back pushed into the hall, while his head burst through the ceiling into the attic. Eventually, the floor below him couldn't withstand the immense pressure and gave in, but the sheer force of his growth seemed to blunt the impact of the fall, and besides he was big enough now that the distance of falling one story was barely noticeable. Pipes and wiring were torn up like tinker toys and furniture was crushed and swept aside by the smooth olive skin that encroached upon their space. His glasses, each lens now the size of old satellite dishes, flew off in the cacophony of the house collapsing, but Alex just continued to work his shaft, completely overcome with the lust he was feeling for the scenario he had always dreamed of but never imagined happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, for some reason, he wasn't getting close to any kind of release. And, as the dust settled, he realized that his body now filled up the entire space where his house used to be. He slowly brought his fist to a halt, his heart still beating like mad. Reaching out and picking up his glasses, he put them on and looked around in stunned awe at just what he had become. Slowly rising to his feet, brushing off the bits of roof shingles and brick that were still on top of him, he realized that the surrounding houses didn't even come up to his hips. \"I must be forty, fifty feet tall!\" he exclaimed with a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome neighbors had already taken note of the giant naked Asian boy that had appeared in their midst, and he heard a few screams, which only made him think more of the monster movies he loved so much. He tried to decide just what to do with his new size; there were cars and houses he could stomp, people he could terrorize -- and, of course, he still had the biggest hard-on of his life to deal with. So many choices...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately there were a few problems and sacrifices that arose from your chosen course, though you had expected them to occur. In retrospect, there were better courses to pick from than Bachelor of Theatre but you had natural talent, so why not use it. Sure there weren't as many job opportunities as other fields and because of your course most people assumed you were gay, ruining any hope you had of getting a girlfriend, but that didn't matter. You're family was fairly well off so your parents agreed to buy you a small flat in a city that had a magnificent theatre, though it wasn't as active anymore you had plans to change that and revitalise the old building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell down onto your lounge, sighing heavily after finally unpacking the last box. The flat may not have been the largest to exist but it was perfect for you, the dinning room and lounge room were all in the same room and there was a small room attached that held the kitchen. Other than the bathroom there were three other rooms, one you made into your bedroom and one into your office. You weren't sure yet what the third room would turn into so for now it was empty.<br>\r\nCRASH!! CLAP!!<br>\r\nYou jolt awake at the booming sound of thunder, you must have fallen asleep on the couch. You look outside, it wasn't raining, there was only lightning. You're then drawn to the rumbling coming from your stomach, you hadn't eaten since lunch on the train while you were traveling down here and you hadn't had the chance to buy any food either. You took one more look outside and decided that going outside wouldn't be too bad, you were pretty sure you saw a Burger King close to your apartment so you grabbed your coat and wallet before exiting the flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it was fine going there and you were able to eat a filling meal, but by the time you exited the fast food restaurant it was pouring rain and still flashing lightning. You had to quickly run down the path to get to your apartment as quickly as possible. As you were running you noticed a strange sound, it was a baby crying. You stopped and looked around the area. Sure enough you find a baby boy wrapped in a blue blanket. You couldn't believe it, who would leave a baby on the street in a thunder storm? It was barbaric!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how you ended up with a baby boy in your apartment. You couldn't just leave him there so you brought him into your apartment for the night. After giving him a bath to make sure he wouldn't catch a cold you wrap him up in the blanket before placing him to sleep next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you get woken up.</span></div></div>",

You groan as you slowly come to consciousness.<br>\r\n\"Daddy,\" you hear an unfamiliar voice call, you're confused by the voice and sit up to see what's up. \"Daddy, me made stinky.\" You couldn't believe your eyes, the baby boy you took in the night before was now about three years old and kneeling on your bed, it was definitely the same boy, that almost white blond hair and golden eyes were unlike anything you had ever seen.<br>\r\n\"Wait...how?\" you ask. Your nose picks up a foul smell as you register what the boy had said to you. You pick him up and pull back the waistband of his blue diaper to confirm that he did indeed have an accident. You lay him down on your bed and un-tape his diaper. After cleaning his bottom with a wet cloth you go to your draws to see if you have anything you can use for a makeshift diaper only to find a similar blue diaper to the one the boy was wearing on the floor. You slide it under the boy and apply rash cream to his privates before diapering him up, since you didn't have any diaper cream.<br>\r\n\"Tank wo Daddy,\" the boy replied in a cute and seemingly melodic voice. You weren't sure what to do with him, he clearly wasn't normal, when you found him on the street he was about three months old, now he was three years old. Against your better judgement you decided that bringing him to an orphanage wouldn't be the best decision, he had already seemed to grow attached to you so you didn't think it would be fair on him to just abandon him. But then there was the problem of you not having any clue on how to raise a child, you had so many questions, like if you should potty train the kid now or wait till he turned four or five? Was he old enough to eat normal food or did you have give him baby food? Was it socially acceptable to spank him if he did the wrong thing? You decide to think about all that later and focus on the problems as they occurred, and the first problem was an empty tummy. <br>\r\n\"Well, if you're going to be Daddy's little boy I need you to grow big and strong so let's go eat er...\" You realised that you needed to give the kid a name. \"Zac, yeah, what do you think of that name buddy?\" The toddler giggles and nods at the name you gave him. You smile and go out to get something to eat at Burger King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you eat you decide that if you're going to be raising a kid you need to buy a few things. The first thing you need is some clothes for him, since all he had was a diaper. You buy him two pairs of jeans and some shorts as well as a few shirts with pictures of superheroes like Spiderman and Kid Flash and digimon. You also found the same types of diapers so you bought a packet of them as well as diapering supplies and luckily for you they were on sale so you got everything for a discount. After your little shopping spree you returned home to pack everything away, sure you would need to buy baby furniture later but for now you were kind of tight for money and the kid could always sleep with you, you did have a double bed after all. Zac was watching kiddie shows on the TV as you were ordering food to be delivered to you. You didn't have any internet set up yet so you didn't know any places to order food from but thankfully you were able to use the free wi-fi at Burger King to find the phone number of the grocery store and was currently ordering all the food you would need for the first few weeks.<br>\r\n\"Daddy,\" Zac tried to get your attention after you had hung up. You turn to him and smile.<br>\r\n\"Yes Zac, is everything ok?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Me want dwink,\" Zac informed. You move over to him and pick him up.<br>\r\n\"Is water ok?\" you ask the toddler, who nods in response. You move him over to the sink where you fill a small cup with water and hand it to him. As you do you are made aware of an unpleasant smell coming from him. As he's drinking his water you check the inside of his diaper and sure enough, it's messy. \"After your drink I think someone needs to change.\" When Zac is done you place the cup on the bench and bring him into the bedroom. You lay him down and tell him not to move as you grab the supplies, you walk into the kitchen and return to the bedroom to find that Zac is now five years old and...</span></div></div>",

You pause and look at him for a moment, he was completely naked besides the diaper and his hair and eyes hadn't changed from when he was a baby, but you couldn't shake off this feeling like you recognised him from somewhere, but that couldn't be possible, his golden eyes were too unique, you didn't even think humans could have eyes that colour and his hair was unlike any natural colour you had seen before in a child. You ignore the feeling as just your imagination and leave Zac alone to get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" Zac called up to you as he entered the lounge room. \"Can we go to the park and play?\"<br>\r\n\"The groceries will be here soon so we have to stay here for now Zac,\" you reply. \"How about we play a game inside?\" Zac's face lights up, he didn't really care if he got to go to the park or not he just wanted to play with you.<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's play a sea game!\" Zac suggests. He jumps up onto the couch. \"This is my boat and I'm the Captain! You can be a sea monster!\" You chuckle before going down on all fours to simulate being in the sea. The game continues for a while with Zac jumping from couch to couch to avoid the sea monster when you manage to grab him mid jump. You lay him on the ground and start tickling him mercilessly. The boy laughs uncontrollably until... </span></div></div>",

Your thoughts are interrupted by the doorbell ringing.

The happy, blond boy just looks around quietly for a few moments as you slowly walk your way over to the ice cream store, which is just a few blocks away. By now, you can see the place off in the distance. <br>\r\n\u201cDaddy? Are we there yet?\u201d Zac asks impatiently. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, Zac! I\u2019m walking as fast as I can! See that white building over there?\u201d you say while pointing at a small while building in front of you. <br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d he replies while sitting on your shoulders. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the ice cream place! That\u2019s where we\u2019re going! We\u2019ll be there in a few minutes!\u201d you explain. <br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 I can get us there faster, daddy!\u201d he says. <br>\r\nYou ignore what he says while you keep on walking straight forward until you suddenly, in a blink of an eye, find yourself standing right before the entrance to the ice cream store!<br>\r\n\u201cHey! We\u2026 We\u2019re\u2026 We\u2019re here already!\u201d you exclaim.<br>\r\nYou also notice that Zac is no longer sitting on your shoulders. Instead, a slightly taller, older boy is standing in front of you with a smile on is face. <br>\r\n\u201cI told you I was going to get us over here faster, daddy!\u201d an older Zac says, standing in front of you. He still has the same golden eyes and bright, blond hair, but he looks bigger, taller, more muscular and his voice is just a little deeper. He looks like an eight-year-old boy now! He suddenly aged from 5 to 8 years old in a matter of minutes! You just stare at him for a few moments. How did you get from the other end of the street to the ice cream store so fast? Did Zac teleport you? And, did he just age by three years? <br>\r\n\u201cCome on, daddy! Let\u2019s go inside!\u201d Zac grins as he pulls on your arm before he quickly lets go. <br>\r\nYou are about to walk into the ice cream store when suddenly the glass door of the store swings open on its own, like magic. You feel your feet rise and you float a few inches above the ground, in the vertical position, and your body hovers over to the front counter before you gently land with your feet on the ground before the cash register. Nobody seems to notice anything unusual at all. Zac walks from the door to where you\u2019re standing with a big smile on his face. <br>\r\n\u201cZac\u2026 Which flavor ice cream do you want, champ?\u201d you ask him. <br>\r\n\u201cVanilla!\u201d the kid blurts out. <br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 Can\u2026 Can I have two vanilla ice cream cones?\u201d you ask the man behind the counter. <br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026 That will be four Dollars and eighty cents!\u201d the man replies. <br>\r\nYou are about to put your hand in your pocket to look for your wallet when money suddenly appears in the palm of your hand. You quickly count the Dollar bills and the coins, and you realize that you have exactly $4.80 in your hand. How did that happen? <br>\r\nThe man hands you the two ice cream cones and you happily hand one of them to Zac, who was patiently waiting for his treat. You greet the man behind the counter as the two of you walk out of the store. <br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026 We better hurry\u2026. I think it\u2019s going to rain soon\u2026\u201d you say to Zac as you look up at the cloudy, dark sky. \u201cWe need to get home!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, daddy!\u201d Zac says calmly. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you!\u201d <br>\r\nJust as you\u2019re about to pick up the pace and walk home quickly, you find yourself standing in your living room with Zac sitting on the couch, happily licking his vanilla ice cream. <br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 What\u2026 How\u2026 How did we get home so fast?\u201d you stutter as you realize that Zac had done it again! In a split-second, Zac had teleported you and him back to the apartment!<br>\r\n\u201cI made us come back home before the rain, daddy! That\u2019s all!\u201d Zac grinned like it was completely normal for young boys to teleport everywhere. \u201cI can send you places, daddy! It\u2019s easy!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 You can s-s-send me places?\u201d you stammer, not knowing what this kid means by that. <br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! Like, I can put you in the kitchen\u2026.\u201d Zac stated out loud. <br>\r\nSuddenly, in a flash, you\u2019re standing in the kitchen, next to the fridge, with your ice cream cone in your hand. You still hear Zac taking from the living room. <br>\r\n\u201cI can send you to the bathroom!\u201d<br>\r\nThere, he did it again! In a blink of an eye, you\u2019re in the bathroom which was next to the bathroom. You find yourself standing in front of the sink and staring at the mirror whole holding your ice cream cone. <br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit\u2026\u201d you whisper to yourself. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd, I can put you in the bedroom!\u201d Zac commands.<br>\r\nYou\u2019re now standing before your bed in the small bedroom, just as Zac ordered. <br>\r\n\u201cNow, I want you back over here, right before me, daddy!\u201d the boy commands. <br>\r\nInstantly, you\u2019re standing in front of the couch in the living room, facing the happy boy who has finished his ice cream cone. He licks his fingers clean and then he opens his mouth and lets out a deep yawn. <br>\r\n\u201cAwwww\u2026. I\u2019m sleepy. Let\u2019s take a nap, daddy\u2026.\u201d Zac suggests. <br>\r\nBefore you can say anything, both of you are back in the bedroom. This time, however, Zac is wearing shorts and a t-shirt and you\u2019re just wearing your bathrobe. You are floating in mid-air above the bed, looking down at Zac, who is pulling the covers and the bed sheets out of the way for you. <br>\r\n\u201cCome sleep next to me, daddy!\u201d he says.<br>\r\nYour body slowly lowers to the bed and your bathrobe instantly disappears. You look over and you see it hanging from the wall in the bathroom. <br>\r\nYou turn to your side and Zac cuddles up against you. Within minutes, the boy has dozed off. You hold on to him and you look him over. You have never seen a kid who is so special, so gentle, so loving\u2026 He almost seems angelic. You only wonder about these strange powers of his. You wonder what else he can do? You finally fall asleep after a few minutes only to discover that Zac had grown a bit more when you wake up a few hours later\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, and from the ground as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert looked out of his window as he rested his elbow on his writing desk and gazed down into the gorge. The view from up here was truly breath-taking, but he'd lived here for almost seven years now, ever since his 'big break' happened and he ran screaming from Fame. Now, with this little 'shack' (OK, mini mansion was closer. Very expensive and well fitted, just small), a good satellite internet connection and a computer he could send his novels to his agent remotely and not need to see anyone. Ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first wake up call after he'd got his 'big break' had been his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few grand... you can spare it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had gone down hill from there. His family relations hit rock bottom on pretty much the third day after the first royalty check arrived, and his attempts to meet people to talk to outside his family got even nastier. His books since then had taken a slightly darker tone, definite works on the nature of the human condition... ie selfish and greedy. He had made a conscious effort to lift the tone in his works as even he had thought 'Darkness Conquers' had been over the top, but in the six years since then his works had gone from strength to strength. He very occasionally agreed to a web conference call, and once an online connection to a TV chat show. Other than that he was here, with the mountain, trees and his shack, and that was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back he looked across the garden, the thin stretch of green along the cliff edge, and smiled. He'd known nothing of gardening when he'd set this place up and had to rely on airlifts or donkey trains to bring in supplies. It had taken quite a while to get good at it, but the soil here was very rich. Now he barely needed anything. He even had a little workshop to fix mechanical things (as much as his limited technical experience could deal with) and also had about five backups of anything he needed that he couldn't fix down in the basement... including his computers; desktops and laptops. He still occasionally got a helicopter landing supplies, but generally it was about once a year. He could just about put up with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crunch Herbert fell over backwards in his chair, his heart beating like a drum! What the hell? The front door? Wait, he didn't have a knocker on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakily got to his feet and managed to calm down, though he was still nervous as he approached the door. Flinging it wide he found... nothing. Just his garden, the helipad and the path down the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you my Father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert jerked, glancing down and seeing a pink baby laying naked on his doorstep, no swaddling, no cradle, nothing. Just a baby! He blinked and stared at the infant for several seconds. It was obviously a girl, and clean and seemed healthy, but was unusually still and calm looking for such a young one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said are you my Father?\" the baby said clearly, in a rather cultured feminine tone. That sounded like an adult British woman but it was the baby, he saw her lips move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... me? What?\" he said articulately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl frowned and crossed her tiny arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I get it wrong? I'm sorry, I thought I'd worked out English well enough.\" Suddenly a melodious operatic voice rang in his mind, complete with trumpets and a choir backing; \"HOW IS THIS, BETTER?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" Herbert said, and fainted.</span></div></div>",

Since he'd nearly reached the end of 'Crossing Delta' he'd been doing a lot of late nights. Even out here by himself he tended to get antsy when a book was nearly done. Just have to reach the ending!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning he sat up and pondered. Normally he wore his silk pajama bottoms in bed. Tops too if it was cold enough. Now he was naked. Why was he naked? Maybe he'd really zonked out last night. He chuckled as he remembered a dream of a little baby talking to him with a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, people really do need a lot of rest don't they.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert froze. Yup, 'That' British accent! Slowly he turned his head to the sound of the voice and saw a naked toddler leaning up against his bedside table, maybe three years old at a guess. She turned to him and smiled. The expression looked... mature somehow, as did her posture, despite her young body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should I do first Father... oh, wait should I use the colloquialism 'Daddy'? That seems more appropriate doesn't it. Alright. Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert blinked at the girl and stared for several seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, I checked. You CAN understand me. Can we perhaps skip the awkward bit and just get around to 'Father/Daughter'... er, things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... were a baby.\" he managed, feeling his head whirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm? Oh age. Yes terribly inconveniant, but I feel I should at least experience childhood, but the normal process is so tediously slow I sped things up a bit. Mummy was terribly surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mummy?\" Herbert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe I went from zygote to newborn in about four hours. Oh, don't worry, I made sure it was completely painless for her. She did make a fuss when I came out though. Tisk, she really wasn't appropriate. Thus I came here. Now Daddy, what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... \" Herbert's mind spins in dozens of different directions at once, quite a few of them rather scary directions, warranting an 18 label for horrorific or gorey content. Who is this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, my name. I did ponder just picking one at random, but it hardly seemed appropriate. Perhaps you could do the honors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't said that aloud... had he? Shaking his head he actually thought on the girl's name. It seemed the only sane part of this whole mess. A name, a nice normal, ordinary name. Definitely needs to be ordinary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jillian?\" He said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Thank you very much Daddy.

I hardly think isolating myself from everyone would help me in any kind of social development and the results from mismanaged development are too dire to consider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert blinked and looked around his little 'shack'. Out in the middle of nowhere. Alone. Oooh the irony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay. I was really meaning that people in general are not able to talk as young as you... let alone change how fast they age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd, I supposed I was a reasonable sample of the rest of humanity. I'm not? Well that explains why the species has survived for as long as it has. Really, the sort of things I can accomplish combined with any kind of malice aforethought doesn't bare thinking of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.\" For a moment Herbert thinks of asking what Jill IS capable of... and thinks better of it. Probably he'd just faint again if she told him. \"Well, why don't you tell me everything you've experienced so far, so I can judge what I need to tell you to fill you in?\" he says, sitting on the side of the bed near her, trying ably to ignore his nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, logical! Very well Daddy, I will elucidate.\"</span></div></div>",

It's rather an odd sensation when there is so little of you there to begin with, but also rather peaceful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She was aware almost as soon as she was fertilized!' Herbert thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What is fertilized?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you read my mind?\" Herbert retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never knowingly poke into your mind unless I thought it warranted. Unfortunately when you think words strongly in your head I cannot avoid 'hearing' them. You shout them rather loudly. I apologize if this is inconvenient.\" Herbert sighed and nodded for her to continue. Probably just have to be careful what I think of then. \"Obviously.\" Jill answered his unspoken comment with a smile. \"Now, where was I? Ah yes, could you explain what you meant by 'fertilized'? I gather you understand how I came to exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well... new people come into being by... a meeting of genetic material, that... combines into a new person. That way the new person is not just a copy of the parent, it's a random mix of both parents and is truly an individual.\" Wait, was he talking like Professor Langstrom from his 'Explorer' Trilogy? Oh please don't start with a German accent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is an accent important for a scientist? Oh sorry, perhaps I'd better leave your unspoken comments unanswered for the time being, unless it's important.\" Jill said sitting down on his stool. \"That explains quite a few things actually, especially why there are both Mother and Father required for a child. That did have me rather confused at first. Admittedly That was while I was still in Mother's womb and at the time hadn't worked out how to see outside yet. She indicated that there had been a Father, but she had 'Booted him out like the worthless shit he was'. I believe the event she was referring to had just occurred prior to my existence beginning. Is this related?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert nodded, trying not to think too loud. Oh god! Birds and Bees talk with a young Goddess! Either he had kept his inner 'voice' down successfully or she was being polite as she didn't respond to that 'comment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes it is. This is a rather awkward topic, mainly due to... well, emotional connections for people in general.\" he pondered how to say this. \"It's.. rather a private thing between two people....\" he said, blushing and trying frantically not to think of... certain things... too vividly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian looked at him with a perplexed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe that we are considered 'two people' by most definitions Daddy?

But you are obviously embarrassed. Perhaps we should discuss it later.\" Suddenly she shot up, swelling and growing in less than a second and... he gazed at a vision in pink curves. His mouth fell open, literally, as he gazed at the girl before him. She looked... maybe late teens, about five foot tall but absolutely perfectly proportioned... perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, by your gaze I gather you prefer me looking like this?

She glanced down at the dangling protruberances. \"These have something to do with it as well? The younger ages do not seem to have them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tricky... they aren't directly related... as is.\" he says, staring frankly at the beautiful orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Jill said smiling. \"I think you are very attractive too. Though I am unsure if one part of your anatomy is particularly attractive on it's own, per se.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks.\" he answers, blushing harder now. \"I meant they are more of an... attractant? Poor choice of words... Men are wired to find... breasts... very erotic and enticing. When a woman has a child they swell with milk as well, so the child can drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I remember this. Mother tried to do that to me when I was born. At the time I thought she was trying to smother me. Perhaps I misjudged her. Then again her later comment 'of Get out you hellspawned demon' was not particularly designed to inspire trust between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... well as they are now they mainly are used... to attract men.\" he says, staring at them still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, they do seem to be rather effective at this.\" Jill says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Herbert mumbles, and manages to lift his gaze to her eyes. But her face is pretty awe inspiring too! \"I admit seeing you suddenly like this is... entoxicating. I'll get over it.\" Maybe, he adds silently to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't mind, it's rather nice to see you appreciate me. I just thought you had drifted from the subject at hand.

Was I wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, you weren't wrong.\" He managed \"OK, demonstration... right... Well, fertilization requires an egg, that the woman provides, and a quantity of sperm, which the man provides. Once delivered the sperm swim blindly upwards till some hit the egg and one enters and merges genetically with it. That is what forms the zygote that you... were when you first remembered things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sounds reasonable, but how do I extract the requisite supply of sperm from you Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sentence is just so wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought my English was perfect! I will endeavor to be more precise in my diction!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... it.. um..oh this is awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill leans over you a bit more, her knee resting on the bed on the other side of you, a thigh touching your hip. She leans down and strokes your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that. As you said, words are tricky. Continue with the demonstration and I doubt we will need too many. Sometimes visual and tactile aids make any verbal cues irrelevant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert blinks at the naked woman above him and sighs. This isn't something that he's going to get out of... and frankly now he doesn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then demonstrate how to fertilize me please Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up on words he places his hands on her hips and gently slides her to be more positioned centrally over his waist, kneeling astride him, her face smiling down at him calmly. Pulling gently on her sides he guides her to lay ontop of him, their hips level. She wriggles her legs till she is comfortable... he certainly is now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm going to do this, better do it right!\" He mutters. Jill beams and nods, then she raises an eyebrow as he pulls her face slowly towards him. \"Just try to mimic what I do, OK Jill?\" She nods again and he stretches up and their lips meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently he opens his mouth and she does likewise, he twist to one side and... she goes the same way. Rather than break the kiss he thinks. Go the other way Jill! The corners of her mouth lift in a smile and she now mirrors his movements, their lips crossing nicely, and he gently slides his tongue into her mouth. After a brief hesitation she does likewise and the two of them kiss hard, feeling her body press nicely against his, heating Herbert up more than the kiss is. Her nipples press against his hairy chest and he feels her breasts rolling against him as she twists a little with the kiss. Finally she breaks, her tongue spilling from his mouth as she pulls back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" She gasps, breathing hard. \"Oh your right, that did feel good, and my breasts rolling against you did make things so much better. Though actually I think it was a lot of contact points that made things feel good, not just the breasts.\" She pauses for a moment and looks perplexed. \"Though I'm not sure I see any cross genetic fertilization from saliva transfer, as enjoyable as that was. How does this work and how reliable is it. Should be try again perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert blinks and wonders how to explain the difference between a kiss and sex?</span></div></div>",

The first time it gets... broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ungh!* So this is sex and other was a kiss?\" she says, then seems to concentrate and he feels a little tingle against his shaft inside her \"OK, the vaginal passage is repaired, but I left the barrier out. Is there any other pain involved in this?\" she says with an anxious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was planning on leading into this, which usually gives a girl some lubrication. You see there are glands that secrete a liquid that makes it easier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that's what those things do!\" she says brightly, and suddenly Herbert feels a literal gush against his cock. \"There, NOW we're ready!\" and she starts to buck against him.

It's, different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert is about to try to explain that this is nothing yet, but she picks up the pace before he even has the thought formed and instead he just goes with the sensations, hands instinctively cupping her rear and helping with the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jill!\" He groans, then pushes his head down to her bucking breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Indescribable!\" Then she sees where he's buried his head. \"Ha, you really do like these new breasts don't you! Ooooh, the twists are exquisite!\" she says, gryrating her hips as she pumps against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his gaze up, he watches her face while she slides up and down, her fingers pressing into his back and against his rear.

Wait a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looks pained for a moment as you jerk against her bruised hip, then she peers into your eyes apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't help it. You do shout rather a lot when you don't talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" she can't be meaning she reads minds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but normally I don't. It's not polite... unless it's REALLY important. But I'm afraid when you think hard like that I just can't help hearing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink hard? Oh, thinking to myself like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, exactly. Sorry, it's just too loud to tune out. Um, you're not going to go to sleep again are you? It's just, if you do it now... I... don't think I'd like the sensations of falling from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should put you down then.\" Herbert says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'd rather you didn't. I really like this. Mommy tried to do this too, but she was screaming in her head the whole time, and whenever I answered her she started shouting over the top of whatever I said. I think that was when I decided to leave really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert has a god-like little naked girl, curled in his arms. Probably something definitely Freudian there... best think of something else. Hmm, like maybe getting clothes on! It's cold in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can fix that. Is that why you where those things? Silly.\" Suddenly the room gets brighter slightly. \"There you go, didn't want to do too much so went for a small fix. Should heat up in a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning Herbert looks out the window. Is it really lighter out? Wait, the sun, is it... BIGGER?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh of course not! enlarging the sun would take a lot of alteration in the laws of physics.\" Oh that's a relief! She has some limits at least! \"Well, no, I just thought it was best to start small. So I just moved Earth closer to the sun. The room will heat up nicely soon.\"</span></div></div>",

It was long, hard work, but you finally had your oown apartment where you could start your own life. You name is Shane, you are 18 years old and you have two brothers, Shaun and Sam, who are identical to you in almost every way. The only major difference between the three of you is the fact that you are gay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust recently you decided to move awayfrom home to start an art career. You picked up a decent apartment in the center of town near your close friend, Olive, and finally finished unpacking. Money was still tight, but luckily Olive's dad hired you to work at his diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a knock on the door. \"Hello?~ Shane? I brought a little moving in present for you!\" Olive walked in holding a full length mirror. Her long black hair bounced as she walked in. She was a pretty girl of about 17. You've known her since you were in diapers. She has always been your closest friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to do that. You and you dad have already done so much for me. Heck, if it wasn't for him I'd be bankrupt. No one is buying my work.\" \"Its really nothing Shane. We got you this mirror because one, I saw you didn't have one yet, and two, not you can do self portraits. Don't give up hope yet! Life is hard, but how much fun would it be if it were easy?\" Olive smiled. \"Yeah, I suppose you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out and embraced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember,\" she whispered in your ear, \"Even when we are as down on our luck as we can possibly get, we still have hope. Hope for a brighter tomorrow.\" She started to walk towards the door. \"See you in the morning!\"Olive left and gently closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice mirror. Let's see...I'll nput it here I think.\" You looked into it. It was a nice antique mirror done in a renaissance flair. You saw your handsome face, deep blue eyes, and curly brown hair reflected back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh,\" you sigh as you look at your reflection, \"I wish something would come along to help improve my life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, a strong thunderstorm blew through town. Around 12 you heard a horrible bang at your balcony door. You dashed out of bed to see what it was, and found a small bundle laying at your feet. \"That's odd. Some blankets must've gotten loose. What else could've reached me here on the third floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the bundle inside and uwrapped it. Inside was... A BABY?! A small baby boy layed wrapped in blankets. You became frightened. How could a baby just fly in the storm? Who were his parents?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby yawned and looked at you endearingly. Then he began... changing? It seemed as if he were slowly aging before your eyes. As he aged, clothes appeared on his body. He wore a white hoodie and black jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he finished aging, he looked about the same age as you. Ne stood at 6'3'' tall, and had a very impressive physique. He had snow white hair and golden eyes. He was absolutely beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you and...</span></div></div>",

Not only did you find a little baby on your balcony during a severe thunderstorm in the middle of the night, but you saw the little toddler transform into a hulking teenage boy before your very eyes! Within moments, the baby aged into a tall, muscular eighteen-year-old Adonis, standing six-foot-three-inches tall, with white hair and golden eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, you thought that you were dreaming. You had to pinch yourself. This just couldn\u2019t be real! Babies don\u2019t just grow up into big dudes in a matter of seconds, right? You closed your eyes and opened them again. Yes, the big guy was still standing before you, looking around the balcony with a confused expression on his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 H-h-hi\u2026\u201d you stutter. What else could you say to a guy, who had just grown up from being a baby just a few moments ago? Does he speak? Can he understand you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, who was wearing black jeans and a white hoodie with long sleeves and white tennis shoes, slowly walked up to you. First, you took a step back. Of course. Who was this guy? But, you realize that he had an innocent look on his face, like\u2026 a little child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was close enough, he extended his right hand, like a baby would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out, and his fingers touched your forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you felt something enter your mind. You felt something take the contents of all your mind, your emotions, your memory, and download it in an instant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy retracted his hand and smiled back at you. It was as if he had suddenly caught up on everything, thanks to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Shane!\u201d he said in a friendly voice. \u201cI guess you\u2019re my dad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped wide open. It could almost drop to the floor if it could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Say what? What? Who?... Who are you?\u201d you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have come to bless you! I was created to help you!\u201d he replied. \u201cThe only thing you must give me is\u2026 a name\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA name? I need to give you a name?\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! My purpose is to improve your life! I will be helping and giving to you. So, please give me a name?\u201d the boy asked you again. \u201cYou wished me into existence so you get to name me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re totally floored now. Here is this tall, hunky kid standing before you, who promises to improve your life. He calls you his father and asks you to give him a name! Again, it all seems like a dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhmm\u2026 Well\u2026 I think you look like an angel\u2026\u201d you say quietly. \u201cSo, how about I call you\u2026 Michael?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy just stares at you with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I\u2019ll be Michael from now on! Thanks, dad!\u201d he cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm\u2026 Michael\u2026\u201d you whisper to him, as you get closer, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me \u2018dad\u2019\u2026 Just call me \u2018Shane\u2019, okay? We\u2019re about the same age\u2026 Or\u2026 We look the same age! You\u2019re even taller than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Michael replies like he\u2019s almost disappointed. \u201cI can fix that! I can make myself a little shorter so that you\u2019ll be taller than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d you say, looking up to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can make you taller, or I can make myself a little shorter!\u201d he just replied like it was easy to change his size at will. Of course, you had never heard of anything that absurd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I kinda like having someone in the house who is tall\u2026 Since I just moved in and I\u2019ll be needing help unpacking all my stuff\u2026\u201d I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had you finished saying those words or you witnessed another miracle: Michael started to grow again! This time, he grew another six inches taller, until he reached the amazing height of six-foot-nine-inches tall! He was now nine inches taller than you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 What the heck? How\u2026 How did you do that?\u201d you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy!\u201d Michael shrugged. He still looked the same, but taller. Miraculously, his clothes had grown with his body. \u201cI can do anything! I can change anything, anyone, anywhere I want to! I have divine powers!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded pretty incredible. But, I had already seen him do two things which were completely amazing! It was becoming harder not to believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Well\u2026 Okay\u2026\u201d you wonder out loud as you turn around and look out over the messy apartment with boxes stacked all over the place. \u201cCould you\u2026 Could you help me unpack all my things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d he cheered. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then casually wandered into the messy living room. He was surrounded by boxes which were stacked everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he just waved his hand, and the empty bookcase in the living room was suddenly filled with books, which were neatly stacked up in rows on all the empty shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael glanced at the large glass cabinet and waved his hand again, and instantly, the cabinet was filled up with pictures, candles, books, CD\u2019s and your stereo system, all connected and hooked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael turned around and looked at the kitchen, where all the kitchen cabinet doors were open with all the empty cabinets exposed. He snapped his fingers, and all the drawers, cabinets and closets were filled with pots, pans, food items, silverware, plates, and groceries. The fridge was also completely stocked up, as well as the pantry. In the meantime, the boxes in the living room were standing there, completely empty. Michael had spared Shane countless hours of work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Michael wandered into your bedroom. He snapped his fingers and your clothes, your computer, your books and your wardrobe were all unpacked and neatly stored away in the desk and in the storage closet. Your bed was made and the computer was hooked up and connected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d you gasped out loud. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding about this\u2026 This power of yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, all the boxes were empty and taken apart and folded while all your things were unpacked and put away. Michael had done all the work for you while you didn\u2019t have to lift a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael\u2026 I\u2026 Uhh\u2026 Thanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to walk up to the hulking boy and embrace him when there was a knock on the door\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, you were attracted to Michael, but something didn't feel right about it yet. You looked over and saw Michael blushing as well, only a touch redder than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just kidding!\" Olive laughed as she threw herself out on the couch. \"But, seriously though. Who's this? Cousin or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...I think he's my son...\" \"Ha...what?! He's, like, the same age as you! Plus you're gay! Unless you were knocking up girls as a toddler I doubt it. Besides, the orphanages don't let you adopt till you're 21.\" Olive looked at you confused. \"Well...\" You started, but Michael interjected. \"Here, let me explain, Olive of apartment 26 D, North Broad street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael began telling Olive the story of how he blew onto your balcony in the storm and took on the older form because he saw that it was what you desired. His voice ws sweet like honey, and sounded melodic even though he wasn't singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's about it. Other than that I have no idea why Im here or really what else Im supposed to do.\"\"Hey, hey. Im not getting all this but I guess it makes sense. Shane was starting to really get down on his luck, y' know? He wasn't finding any guy that was right for him, his art carreer wasn't taking off, hell, even this apartment ain't perfect! But a nice guy like him doesn't deserve to always finish last, so Im glad God blew a child in through his window and blessed him with divine powers. Hell! You're a regular God Child, eh?\" Olive nudged his shoulder and Michael laughed. \"Maybe, just maybe, you can turn his life around. Anyways, I have to go or I'll be late for work. And, Michael?\" She stood on her tiptoes and whispered something into his ear. He blushed bright red and nodded quickly. Olive giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya, Shane! Take care of him, Michael. He's like a brother to me. Lord knows that I've already lost one. I don't want to loose another.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was worried that she either wouldn't believe us or that she would freak out and run ofg. You really are persuasive!\" You said, amazed. \"A little power use here and there can change anyone's perspective.\" Michael flashed a beautiful smile. \"What did she tell you there, right before she left?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael blushed again. Damn was he bashful. \"I think...you'll find out when the time is right, Shane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, let's see.

You don\u2019t need any money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael laid several drawings, paintings and sketches that he liked the best on the counter. Then, he just waved his hand over them, and the drawings were instantly framed! When they were all set in nice frames, he turned to face the barren wall, he snapped his fingers, and all the drawings were neatly hung from the wall, all at the exact same height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d you gasp out loud.

He\u2019s always smiling back at you. You begin to wonder what he would look like if he were to take his shirt off. He\u2019s so big and tall, you long to see his muscles. Deep down, you begin to like this kid\u2026 a lot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026 I\u2019m getting sleepy\u2026 Wanna turn in for a few hours?\u201d you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Let\u2019s get some rest!\u201d he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can turn around and walk into the bedroom, Michael just snaps his fingers and instantly you find yourself standing in the bedroom! You teleported!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! How did you do that? How\u2026 How did I get in the bedroom?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy!\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI send you anywhere I want, just by thinking of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at the small single bed. You suddenly realize that the bed is too small for the two of you. But Michael walks towards it, and the bed suddenly doubles in size, right before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael is suddenly bare-chested. And it is a sight to behold. His big, bulging pectorals are sticking out from his massive chest. He has large biceps, washboard abdominal muscles, thick, bulging quads and large, hard calves sticking out from the back of his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl in bed and Michael quietly follows you. Before you know it, two large hands grab your torso and pull you towards his big, muscular frame. Then, he gently kisses you on your lips and forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep well, daddy!\u201d he whispers. He still talks like a little boy who is trapped in the body of a big guy. Then his big, long muscular arms wrap around your torso and chest, pressing you against his big, rock-hard body. He closes his eyes and dozes off. You do the same, which is easy, knowing that you\u2019re sleeping in the arms of an angel. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stop and let out a gasp as you exit the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou previously small apartment was now the penthouse. Everything had changed to high quality, top end furniture and appliances. It was decorated beautifully just in your style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" Michael asked as he walked out of the new kitchen. \"Like it?! I LOVE it! You got everything perfect, just as I had dreamt it would all look!\" Michael smiled and blushed a little. \"I know. I saw your dream last night. I wanted to help out. Come on, I have one more surprise in store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael put his hands over your eyes and guided you throught the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...open them.\" You opened your eyes to a beautiful art studio with brand new expensive supplies and a view of the city from a large window. You started to tear up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..what's wrong?!\" Michael said, alarmed, \"Did I not get it right?\" \"No..\" you said, tears streaming down your face, \"The opposite. Its perfect! More perfect than I could have ever imagined!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. there's no use having a new studio without painting something.\" Michael said, walking in front of the eisel, \"Why don't you paint something?\" \"Uh...sure. What to paint though?.. Ahh! How about you, Michael?\" \"What? Me? Ok!\" Michael walked over to a grwat position where you got a good view of him, framed by the golden morning sun. Suddenly, you got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...uhh...could you, maybe...uhh..take off your shirt?\" You blush just thinking about it. \"Sure Shane!\" Michael quickly removed his shirt, showing you the gloriousness that was his perfect body. You started to sweat a little. 'Easy Shane. Easy. Maybe later. When he's cofortable with it.' You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor then next three hours you worked as hard as you could on Michael's portrait, trying to capture his perfection as well as you possibly could. At noon that day, hot and covered in paint, you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" you sigh happily. \"Let me see!\" Michael happily ran over. \"...I love it! Its awesome!\" Michael gave you a huge hug, pressing you against his warm, strong chest. You looked over your painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had painted Michael standing in a heroic position framed by the sun with two feathery white angel wings in his back. In all honesty, you really had captured him perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should sell it! You could make a fortune!\" Michael said, excited. \"I don't know. I really like it and I don't want to give it up.\" \"No worries! I'll just copy it then!\" Michael concentrated on the photo, and suddenly, an exact copy appeared in his hands. \"There. Now you have two! You go sell that one, and I shall stay here and set this one up! Oh, and I've also set up a booth for you right outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked outside to see that Michael was right. He had in fact set up a small, woiden booth for you. It had a small display eisel and counter with a comfortable stool. You sat down and set up shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Olive's dad came by. \"Hello there, Shane! Nice day isn't it? Hey! You've started selling your work! I'm proud of you! Let's see here... Wow! This is really good...\" His face suddenly turned serious. \"That looks just like Mikey.\" He said somberly. \"It's actually a painting of my friend, Michael. You know him?\" \"These cant be te same two people, Shane. But this person you drew, aside from the white hair and gold eyes, looks just like Mickey. My son who tragically passed away when Olive was just a baby. She never knew him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive's father began to cry. Then, he stood up straight and regained his demeanor. \"It's a very fine painting, Shane. I truly love it. I'll give you $1,000 for it.\" You jaw dropped. \"R...really?,\" \"Yes. I'll send the check to you tomorrow. Thank you.\" Olive's dad took the painting. \"Thank you so much, sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile excited that you sold a painting, new questions arose in your head. Michael was an angel. Is it possible that he and Mikey are the same person? And still, why did he come to you?</span></div></div>",

A few further thoughts confirmed that I could use my hair as though each individual strand were an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like in my dreams, I was tall, and sported a number of additions to the usual human form on my 10' frame. \"This is amazing!\" I said as I unfurled the ten long tongues I'd dreamed of having, confirming that I could speak even with all of them extended fully. I retracted two of them, but the other eight moved down my body, one to my bald pussy, one spiraling around the erect 4' dick that came practically to my mouth, reaching its base and massive ball sac, the organ itself passing between the six breasts I sported on my torso that put prize-winning watermelons to shame, each of which had its nipple being pleasured by another tongue. As my arousal grew, I retracted all my tongues and sent my hands flying to pick up where they'd left off. Pairs of pairs of seven-fingered hands--each arm split at the elbow into two forearms--cupped each breast, played with each nipple, jacked my penis in four places along its length, cupped my balls, played with my clit and fingered my vagina. I'd completely forgotten about Dawn, but I couldn't help myself--I was just too horny. My other sixteen arms--I had thirty pairs in total--roamed around my body, appreciating the hard muscle I had, the large butt, the completely smooth skin, and then I came to a massive orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it,\" said Dawn from behind me as I recovered, \"that you appreciate your new body. Good. Just so you know, nobody will find it at all strange. In fact, here's the life you would have had if this is the body into which you grew.\" New memories flooded my mind, revealing a life not much different from my original one. \"And yes, as you may have guessed from those memories, you have all those superpowers as well. Flight, invulnerability, superstrength, superspeed, super-senses, X-ray vision, temperature manipulation, panoramic vision, telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, weather and geological manipulation, and invisibility. You can also pass through solid objects and split yourself into multiple bodies, and you won't suffer any ill effects from exposure to extreme conditions--heat, cold, pressure, gravitational forces, hard vacuum, or any such things. You can also function at peak condition for as long as you want, even using your superpowers the whole time, without sustenance or sleep. You don't even need to breathe. As for the magnitude of your abilities, your speed is enough to visit every single cubic attometre in the universe a googolplex to the googolplex to the googolplex times in the time it takes to blink your eyes, your teleportation can take you to all those points that many times over again in the same span, you can see, hear and smell the entire universe at once, you can read, manipulate and completely control any mind in the universe, even all of them--save mine--at once, you can alter temperature, weather and geological processes anywhere in the universe, you can create as many bodies for yourself as you want, nothing except me can harm you, and you're strong enough that a ball the mass of the universe would feel far, far lighter to you now than a feather did to you before, though you can control your strength minutely. But always remember that you're only the second-most powerful being in the universe.\" With that, she hopped off the bed, and while, a bit frightened, I tried to escape, I found myself unable to do anything as she walked toward me and pinched me hard. I yelped. \"Just remember: I can do anything I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then why give me all this, if there's no difference for you between this and the way I was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because an all-powerful being like me shouldn't call anyone even remotely 'normal' Mommy, and I liked your fantasy. Oh, yes, you can make any clothing and accessories you want appear on your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cock now hung down, flaccid at two and a half feet. Just like in my dreams, I was able to tuck it inside my vagina painlessly, my balls retracting into my crotch. Then I envisioned my clothing and saw it appear: three red latex bandeau bras for my huge tits, a black latex miniskirt, leather boots with a six-inch heel coming up to my skirt, fingerless elbow-length gloves on each forearm, a diamond-studded choker, diamond earrings and a gold ring on each of my seven hundred and twenty fingers, each containing a beautiful gem. I had no make-up, as it would spoil my natural--well, supernatural--beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that you're pleased with your new body, Mommy,\" and I silenced the small mental protest that said that this was wrong, it was unnatural, \"what do you want to do today?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now I know you got your heart broken by whats-her-name, but don't you worry, because I'll never leave your side, my love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that you jump up and exclaim \"Now wait just a minute! Are you spying on me! How do you know about all that crap, anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha answered with a smile, \"I'm a goddess, Jameson! I came into your life as that cute little abandoned baby that you took in last night. I took its form to see if there was a man worthy of my presence, and you're the lucky guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJameson's eyes at first went wide. He hadn't thought of the baby girl he from yesterday since he gently put her in the other bedroom in his apartment. He scurried off to see the toddler, but there was no sign of her anywhere. He started thinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you're a Goddess, right? So prove it. Let's see what you can do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", replied Samantha \"what do you wish me to do?\" </span></div></div>",

Dirty clothes, towels, books, and boxes liter the floor, mostly on one side of the room next to your step-brother's bed, but you notice that some of it is starting to encroach on your territory. \"Ryan?\" you ask, not getting a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight ahead, you notice that your step-brother Ryan is playing some sort of video game, and has his headphones covering his ears. Your first instinct is to say screw it and deal with it later, but you decide that you have to put your foot down on this sooner or later. You walk up behind Ryan and tap him on the shoulder. Not getting a response, you sigh in frustration, and then reach over and grab the headphones, forcing them down to his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up at you, a hint of an annoyed expression on his face. \"What do you want, Patrick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, could you please clean up in here at some point today?\" You gesture around at the room, hoping you're getting your frustration across. \"Your mess is starting to spill over into my side of the room. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight scowl comes to his lips, and he blows his hair out of his face. \"Okay, okay. I'll get on it. Soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"Can you do it now, please? I need to use the floor to start doing crunches, and there's not enough clean space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls his eyes. \"Fine. Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say, turning around and heading back to the kitchen, hoping that he's sincere. As you grab a glass and fill it with water, though, you think that maybe he'd have a little more follow through if you help him a little, at least this once. Not to do the whole thing, now, but maybe showing a gesture of goodwill -- maybe that'll do a bit to help smooth out your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking up your mind, you finish the glass and then put it in the sink. As you walk back down the hallway to the room, you call out, \"Ryan, tell you what. I'll help you clean if you promise that-- Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stunned reaction is due to the fact that when you enter back into the room, it is spotless. Ryan's junk is all off the floor, his bed is neatly made (matching yours now), and even the desk and tables look like they've been cleaned down. You spin around, looking for signs of everything having been stuffed into a closet or something, but all the clothes are neatly put away, the books are on the shelves (alphabetized even!) -- it's practically perfect. And in the middle of it all is Ryan, still with his headphones around his neck, still sitting at the desk, but now facing the room, with a look of confusion and amazement on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you do that?\" you ask. \"I was only gone for a minute and you cleaned up the entire room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -- I don't know!\" Ryan looks up at you with wide eyes. \"I\u2026 I guess I just looked around, wishing the room would be clean without me having to do anything, and\u2026 it just happened! It instantly became clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrow your eyes, trying to process this. \"What, like a genie granted your wish or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\u2026 I dunno.\" Ryan scratches his head. \"I didn't even say anything out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, you think to yourself. Could this be true? Maybe you should test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ryan,\" you say, trying to think carefully of what you should have him do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try something here.

I wished that, too,\u201d says Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t left \u2018cause I wanna find out what you dipshits want. What\u2019s with the wishing? Am I part of some stupid roleplaying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really need to say \u2018em out loud, but I wish your boobs were a lot bigger,\u201d Ryan says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine lets out an exasperated sigh. \u201cSo you\u2019re such a nerd that you don\u2019t even talk to me the first month you live here, and now you decide you\u2019re a perv? I think you need --\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happens to look down, and sees what you and Ryan saw while she was yelling at him, that her flat chest had quickly swelled outward, to the extent that it looks like she\u2019s carrying a couple of overripe melons under her hooded sweatshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw drops. She tentatively brings her hands up and feels them through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that?\u201d asks Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I --\u201c Katherine has moved her hands away, but she\u2019s still looking down at her drastically enlarged protrusions, a slightly pained look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, let me change your bra,\u201d says Ryan, and your sister\u2019s expression almost immediately becomes less pained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow -- how --\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. All of a sudden, I can wish for things and they come true,\u201d Ryan says, answering her incomplete question. \u201cI wished this room was clean, I gave your brother some serious muscles, so I brought you in for some more tests. Obviously, I can do boobs and bras, but I wonder if I can go further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re suddenly a bit worried. \u201cWait a minute -- how much further?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan grins. \u201cI want to see if I can change reality. Let\u2019s see -- oh, Katherine, I didn\u2019t just <i>decide</i> I was a perv, by the way. And I wish...\u201d</span></div></div>",

You kiss her deeply and she responds. You wrap your arms around her and press your hardening cock against her groin. You feel those massive tits rub against your chest.<br>\r\nYou slip out of your jeans as you continue to kiss. Katie pulls back only to remove her top and bra in one smooth movement. She is so wonderful and graceful, you think as you gaze upon her beauty.<br>\r\nYou take off your shirt as she slides out of her pants and panties.<br>\r\nAs soon as you are both naked, you resume kissing. Your hands gently fondling her breasts as her fingers masterfully play with your dick, making harder and harder because it is Katie, your super-sexy sister touching you. For a second, you think you have a girlfriend, but you realize there has only been Katie. There has never been any other romantic interest in your life but Katie. Living under the same roof with someone so beautiful and sexy, it\u2019s perfectly okay to not look for love anywhere else. It\u2019s perfectly natural to your way of thinking now.<br>\r\nYou begin sucking on Katie\u2019s nipples, just the way she likes. She lets out a pleasure moan. She drops to her knees and kisses your rigid cock. Two, three kisses and a quick lick along the shaft and you know she\u2019s ready.<br>\r\nShe lays back and spreads her legs wide, welcoming you as if you\u2019ve done this so many times before. Although this is the first time, you two are going to have sex, you feel like you\u2019ve done this dozens of times before. You both feel that everything is normal and makes sense.<br>\r\nYou thrust your cock into her warm, west pussy. You can feel her grip your cock with her pussy muscles like she never wants to you let out of her. Your brain is on fire with lust. Lust for your sister. She may be your sister but she is a beautiful, sexy, wonderful girl who is irresistible. You realize that there is nothing wrong with the passion for feel for Katie. There would be something wrong with you if you didn\u2019t.<br>\r\nYou start pounding away. Katie is in ecstasy.<br>\r\n\u201cFuck me! Fuck me!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When your mother first told you that your family would be hosting a foreign exchange student for a semester, you didn't think that it'd be anything special, and you certainly weren't wild about sharing your room with somebody for five months. But that all changed when you first laid eyes on your new roommate. Though at fourteen he was two years younger than you, Brandon had a calm, confident demeanor that you were instantly attracted to, not to mention a slender, athletic body. Being in more advanced classes back home in Taiwan, the school decided to have him mirror your schedule, and you became fast friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past four and a half months have flown by, and the attraction you had when you first met him has now blown into an all-out crush. You've been hesitant to try and see if Brandon reciprocates your feelings, not sure if the flirtiness you detect from him is sincere or just a cultural difference. But now it's the weekend before Brandon has to return home, and you realize that it'd eat at you forever if you didn't at least try to see how he felt about it too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, your parents were called away to attend to an emergency with your mother's aunt up in New Jersey, which meant that you and Brandon had the house alone to yourself. Well, almost alone. Sure, your twelve-year-old brother Skylar was still here, but he kept mostly to himself, staying in his bedroom on the computer with the door closed, so except for meals it would be like he wasn't even there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched your parents' car back out of the driveway and head off to the airport, your heart started to beat a little faster. This was it, you realized. You had promised yourself to talk to Brandon tonight about this, and it did no good to put it off any longer. You walked into the living room, where Brandon was sitting on the sofa, watching television, and you sat down on next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gone?\" he asked, gesturing towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you nodded. \"Here begins the best weekend of lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon chuckled at you and shook his head. \"The way you're talking, Taylor, I would almost think you had something big planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up, smiling softly, and you for a moment you suspected that he somehow knew what you wanted to talk to him about. \"Well, its not really something planned... it's ... more like something I ... I guess that I...\" Geez, why did the words suddenly become so difficult to say, you thought. \"...I wanted to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Brandon's eyes widened a little but the smile remained on his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You had thought out and practiced what you were going to say in this situation for the past two days, but all of that seemed to have disappeared from your mind now. \"I guess... we've known each other for a few months now. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly five months, Taylor. That's why I'm leaving next week, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks began to get red a little, but you swallowed and continued. \"Exactly. And I think we've become really close friends since then. Wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor...\" The few seconds it took Brandon to pause and gather his thoughts seemed to stretch on for hours. \"I would say that you're my closest friend. Closer than anyone I've ever met before, even back home. I feel like... I can be myself around you, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime suddenly caught back up with you, and your head began to pound. \"Wow...\" You couldn't find anything else to say; you were so overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...\" Brandon continued, placing his hand on your shoulder, \"I have something I want to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You didn't mean for your question to sound so startled, but this definitely wasn't something you had planned for. \"I mean, go ahead. Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stared at you for a moment. \"There's no one else that knows what I'm about to say, Taylor. Not even my family or friends back at home. That's how much I'm trusting you with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind swirled with the possibilities of what he could be about to say. Was it possible that he had picked up on your attraction and was about to tell you what you had been going to tell him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might be hard to believe,\" he said, \"but I promise you it's true, and I'll be able to prove it. But, Taylor...\" Brandon closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. \"I'm a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked. \"A god?\" The words didn't even make sense in your ears, at least at first. It was so counter to anything you had been expecting. And it really didn't make any sense at all. \"You mean... Wait, what DO you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood up, walking towards the window. \"I mean I have divine powers. I can... control things, and change things. Hear people's thoughts. Really, I can do pretty much whatever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. No, stunned was too weak a word for how you were feeling. You were flabbergasted. Floored. Completely and utterly confused and thrown for a loop. None of those cliches seemed to even come close to how you felt. What Brandon had said was preposterous, you knew. But yet, you had come to know him as one of the most honest people you had ever met, and the way he said it seemed so sincere... What if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second.\" Something he had said just clicked with you. \"You can hear people's thoughts?\" You began to think that maybe you weren't so wrong when you thought he might have known what you were about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Taylor.\" Brandon turned around and faced you again. \"And, yes, you were right. I knew you were about to tell me that you were hoping that we could become more than just friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazement, horror, and disbelief all filled your head at once. \"But... But...\" You suddenly realized the implications of what he had said. If he could hear your thoughts... then there had definitely been some thoughts he would've picked up over the past five months... thoughts concerning the more...physical nature of your attraction to him...that you would rather him not to know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Brandon shook his head. \"Don't worry about that kidna thing, Taylor. Believe me, I got used to the idea long ago that what goes on in people's heads is far less controlled than what they say and how they behave. And besides, I kinda like the idea of you thinking that way about me. I guess you could say that I'm flattered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Well, you were definitely in a way different topic than you were expecting to be discussing before. One that seemed way beyond belief. But, you thought, you might as well go with it. \"So wait, does that mean... that you feel the same... way about me that I feel about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's smile faded just slightly. \"That's the issue, I guess.\" He sat down next to you again, placing his hand on your knee, which sent a shiver down your spine. \"I mean, I'm omnipotent, omniscient, can snap my fingers and cause the whole world to change if I want... but I can't make up my mind on how to feel about this... about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You weren't quite sure how to take that, but it didn't sound entirely good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your fear, Brandon looked up at you and leaned in a little closer. \"Don't get me wrong, Taylor. I think you're hot, and I would love to try to see where we would go if we took our relationship to the next level. And, with my powers, the whole 'long-distance' thing wouldn't really be that much of a factor. But I'm worried that my... my powers, my nature, whatever... would get in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart had resumed its attempts to break through your chest, pounding faster than you had ever felt it pound before. He said he thought you were hot! He felt the same way about you! At least... part of him did. \"Well,\" you started, \"that sounds like a legitimate concern. But... well, maybe we could use this weekend as kind of a ... trial period, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trial period?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...\" you said, pausing to gather your thoughts. The idea of dating a god was a little intimidating, yes, but also exciting. \"We could just kinda see how it goes over the next two and a half days. You know, play around with each other, maybe even have a little fun with your powers, whatever. And then we can talk again on Sunday before my parents get home. If either of us feel that it wouldn't work out long-term, then we'd agree to stay good friends. But, if we both like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice trailed off, and you saw the corners of Brandon's lips turn upwards. \"I suppose that's fair. Besides,\" his voice lowered as he leaned in closer, and you felt his warm breath against your ear. \"There's so many things I've wanted to do with you over the past five months, that it's been killing me not to try them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, Brandon wrapped his arms around you and brought his lips up to yours, and the two of you kissed. Surprised at first, your lust quickly kicked in and you return the kiss back with as much intensity as you can muster.  All time seemed to have stopped as you make out with him; as amazing as you had imagined this moment would be, it actually happening was infinitely more exhilarating. You almost wished that your life would stop right there, on the highest note you could ever imagine happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, or so, Brandon pulled back, your saliva still moist on his lips. Grinning, he wiped them dry with his wrist. \"I think our trial is off to a good start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled and nodded. \"Whatever happens over the rest of the weekend, it will all be worth it for that moment alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stared into each other's eyes. \"Well,\" Brandon finally says after a long silence, \"I got to do one of the things I wanted to do. What do you want to do next, Taylor?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll be back in a few hours. See ya guys later!\" Finally, he ran out the door and he was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared at Brandon in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. That was easy!

Just surprise me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I know!\" he responded with a grin on his face. \"I like it where my friends are big and strong, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big and strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with that I mean, tall and muscular!\" he clarified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you can change the way people look?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just giggled. It was clear that you still didn't quite get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a god, Taylor. That means I can do anything! I can change anything about anyone I want! I can also make anything or anyone do whatever I tell them to! I'm in complete control of everything! So, stand up!\" Brandon ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and you quietly stand before him as he remains seated on the couch in front of you. He's very comfortable and relaxed. You're starting to feel a little nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your calves flex, both of them, at the same time. You find yourself standing on your toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! W-w-what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm showing you how I can make you do stuff\" he says calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, your calves make you hop into the air, several times in a row, landing on the balls of your feet before you hop again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon! Stop!... Make... me... stop!\" you shout between hops as you hop around in one spot before the couch without being able to control your legs. You hop seven times before Brandon makes you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... So, you can control my body?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Not only can I control it, I can also move it! Look!\" Brandon chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you m--?\" you started to ask when you suddenly realized you were no longer standing in the living room anymore, but in your bedroom! You looked around, and you recognized your dresser, your posters, your bed and your desk. But wait, weren't you just standing in the living room, talking to Brandon just now? Then it dawned on you that Brandon made you teleport!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to walk out of the bedroom when your surroundings changed again! You almost walked right into the fridge, which was in the kitchen! How did you go from the bedroom to the kitchen in an instant? Then you realized that you never walked down the hall from your bedroom past the bathroom through the living room into the kitchen, rather, Brandon just teleported you again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you find yourself standing in front of Brandon in the living room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, I'm gonna teleport you any place and any time I want!\" he grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... That is amazing!\" you just gasp. The extent of his powers is just now starting to settle in with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about the big and tall thing I mentioned earlier...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you were overcome by a tingling sensation in every muscle in your body! You have to close your eyes because it hurts like crazy! You don't know what's happening to you but you feel your muscles growing bigger and harder and heavier, all at once! Your legs and arms are growing longer at the same time as well, causing a bone-cracking sound to come from deep within you. After about thirty seconds, the growth spurt stops and you open your eyes. A large mirror hangs on the wall in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back is the reflection of a boy with your face but with a body you have never seen before. As you rub your hands over your chest and arms, you realize how much your pectorals and your biceps have grow! You look like a young gymnast! You have six-pack abs and your legs are totally ripped with thick cords and layers of muscle all over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow! I'm all buff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Brandon says as he stands up and walks over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away you notice that he seems shorter by four or five inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you a few inches taller as well!\" he explained to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww dude, thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use your muscular arms to pull him towards you and to give him a firm hug followed by a kiss...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trust me, okay?\u201d he replied confidently. \u201cI will NEVER leave you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut left it with that. You just didn\u2019t feel like talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents finally said goodbye to Brandon and you gave him a big, firm hug. But, that was when you burst out into tears. You were sobbing as Brandon turned around and walked through the security checkpoint and waved at you once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaylor, who don\u2019t you go into the restroom and wash your face, son?\u201d your mother had said, since your face was all covered in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it, mom\u2026\u201d you sob. \u201cI may never see him again\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will talk to him online, honey!\u201d she says, trying desperately to cheer you up. \u201cNow, go freshen up so we can go home!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mom\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel terrible down and depressed, like you have just lost your best friend. You feel lonely and miserable as you walk into the men\u2019s bathroom. You stop in front of the sink and you examine yourself in front of the large mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn on the water and splash water all over your face before drying yourself off with a paper towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you walk over to the sink and examine your reflection in the mirror one last time. You can\u2019t help but shed one more tear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a familiar voice which sends a shiver up your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Taylor, will you stop crying?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from VERY close. In fact, you felt your lips move! You let out a loud gasp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whirl around and look around the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re the only one there. All the stalls are empty and the doors are all open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon? Where\u2026 Where are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here, Taylor\u2026\u201d Brandon\u2019s voice spoke again, coming from your own lips! \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t leave you but you didn\u2019t believe me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at your reflection with your jaw wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 What\u2026. Are you inside of me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a god, Taylor! I can be several places at the same time. So, I\u2019m sharing your body with you on a permanent basis. So, the answer to your question is: Yes. You have two identities from now on: Brandon and Taylor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!? So\u2026 This is awesome!\u201d you cheer. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re still here, then!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell DUH, smart guy!\u201d Brandon spoke. \u201cLet\u2019s go back and see your mom and dad!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and dash out of the bathroom and race towards your parents who are waiting by the baggage claim area so they can walk back to the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there you guys are!\u201d your mother grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Brandon and Taylor!\u201d your dad says to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to your dad and you look shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!

Brandon may have left physically but he\u2019s still with you in spirit! In fact, he\u2019s living right inside of your own body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb in the back seat of the SUB and strap on the seatbelt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh by the way\u2026.\u201d Brandon speaks up. \u201cI still got my divine powers\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just grin.

There was not even a shopping mall in the town - just a few small offices, some shops and a few public amenities. Since your father was a sales agent for agricultural products, apparently the company wanted him closer to their top clients with his new job title. But that also meant he'd be away from home more often. Your mum had found a job at the local supermarket as some kind of middle manager. Which meant that most of the unpacking of the household items was left up to you ... it was fortunate, even, that your mum had today off work to help you. The house you were moving into was larger than your old apartment, but it felt uncomfortable and cold. Most of all, you feared not seeing your friends from your old school again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud knock at your front door.<br>\r\n\"Can you get that?\" your mum called.<br>\r\n\"I was going to anyway\" you said, a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding outside was an absurdly beautiful girl of about your age. She had long blonde hair and a flawless, beaming face that caught you very much off guard. She was wearing a green t-shirt with \"School Is Cool\" printed on it, and carrying a white paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there\" she said, grinning happily \"My name's Maddy. I live in that house with the red roof next door.\"<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you replied shyly, shifting your legs to disguise the rapidly growing, embarrassing erection in your shorts.<br>\r\n\"I just thought I'd bring over some cookies as a welcome gift\" Maddy continued, holding out the paper bag \"Care to try one?\"<br>\r\n\"S... sure\" you stuttered, bringing your hand into the bag and pulling out a chocolate chip - your favorite flavor. Slowly you brought the cookie to your mouth and took a bite.<br>\r\n\"Hey, these are delicious!\" you said \"Where'd you buy these?\"<br>\r\n\"I baked them myself\" replied Maddy.<br>\r\n\"Can I please have another one?\" you asked greedily.<br>\r\n\"Of course! The whole bag is for you.\" smiled Maddy \"I'm glad you like them. Actually, you should probably save a few for your parents. But you're invited to come around to my house some time and I'll bake you some more!\"<br>\r\n\"I'd love to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you were unloading the last of the boxes from the van.<br>\r\n\"Who was that at the door earlier?\" asked your mum.<br>\r\n\"Just some girl who wanted to give us cookies. They're really delicious. Want one?\" you asked, your mouth full of cookie dough, as you held out the bag.<br>\r\n\"How much of your pocket money did you waste on those?\"<br>\r\n\"They were free. She said it was a welcome gift.\"<br>\r\n\"How thoughtful of her! Did you say thank you?\"<br>\r\n\"I ... think so?\"<br>\r\n\"That's good. Leave some on the counter for dad and I.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, mum.\"</span></div></div>",

You receive your class schedule at the front counter and you go to a classroom where you wait for the teacher to show up. Finally, when the teacher arrives, you sit down in the back and you nervously wait for your name to be called. The lady reads the names in order and you look over as every student raised their hand as when they hear their name being called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happens. A familiar face. A familiar name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison Grace Jacobs\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and you recognize here. It\u2019s her! The girl next door! The girl who delivered those delicious chocolate cookies! What a relief. At least there is one person you know who you can talk to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoshua Keenan Jackson\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns towards you and a big grin forms on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, when class is over, you walk out of the classroom and Maddy meets you in the hallway. You were happy that class was over since it was nothing more than a discussion of class schedule, rules and the class materials, so it was extremely boring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Joshua! Now I know your name!\u201d she says to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me Josh\u2026 I\u2019m so happy to see you here, Maddy!\u201d You smile as you pat her on her shoulder. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about your delicious cookies!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come over to my house after school, you know?\u201d she says to you. \u201cMy parents will probably be at work\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might take you up on that! When I get to my house, it\u2019s still a matter of unpacking and straightening out stuff in my room. Moving is so much work!\u201d you groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019ll come over and help you!\u201d Maddy offers. \u201cI\u2019m really good at organizing stuff!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that! I got books and papers and clothes and\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop! It\u2019s not a problem! We\u2019ll go to your house after class!\u201d she insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stop arguing and you accepted her offer. So, just as she said, you meet her after class and you walk back to the house together. She didn\u2019t seem to mind it at all. You feel guilty asking her to help out fixing up your bedroom, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care one bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrive at the house, you let her in and you walk straight to your bedroom with Maddy in tow. When you open the bedroom door, you feel ashamed and embarrassed. The drawers of your dresser are still open and empty. Your closet is still open and disorganized. There are boxes all over the bedroom with books, clothes and binders with all your school notes. You have boxes with music CD\u2019s in the corner. You got two other boxes with sports posters rolled up in another corner. You got three pairs of soccer cleats and your tennis and soccer gear all over the floor. You got your clothes all over your bed. You got five boxes with dress clothes, school clothes, clothes for going out, party clothes, church clothes, sports uniforms, swimming gear and more all over the place. Then there\u2019s the laptop with stacks of computer books, CD\u2019s with games, the flat screen monitor, and all the wires all over the place. Your bedroom is a complete and total mess! You realize it would take hours to get everything cleaned up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can do this, Josh! No problem!\u201d Maddy smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we may as well get started. Here, let me go to the kitchen and get us something to drink, okay? Do you like a Coke, Sprite, some juice or some water?\u201d you offer her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, water will be just fine, Josh!\u201d Maddy giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem This will take us the entire afternoon, if we even get it all done, which I seriously doubt!\u201d you sigh. What a horrible way to spend the afternoon with such a cute girl. You hate it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you groan as you walk over to the kitchen. You can\u2019t stand this situation. Why did you have to move? You were so happy at your old place. You just grumble and complain in the back of your mind as you grab two plastic cups out of the kitchen cupboard and you fill them with ice and cold water from the fridge. Then, you carefully walk back to your bedroom as you try very hard NOT to spill any water over the floor as you\u2019re walking back to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrive at your bedroom, you\u2019re shocked to see what Maddy had done during the three minutes while you were getting the water for the two of you to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is the water for us to dr\u2014\u201d you say as you suddenly notice that the room is all clean, organized, and picked up while Maddy is sitting on the edge of your bed. \u201cHOLY SHIT!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boxes are neatly stashed in the hallway. All the clothes are folded and put away in the dresser. Your posters are pinned up on the walls in the bedroom. Your laptop is connected and up and running with all the cables connected. All the books are neatly stored in the two large bookcases. All the CD\u2019s are carefully placed in the large CD storage stand next to the desk. Your bed is clean, the floor is clean, the bed is made up. Your soccer cleats are put away in the closet. Your tennis and swimming gear is stored away in the other closet. Your entire bedroom is all tidy and picked up. And, Maddy did it all by herself in under three minutes while you were getting some water for her to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 What\u2026 Why\u2026 H-H-How\u2026. How d-d-did you do that?\u201d you stutter as you slowly look around the room. You pinch yourself in the arm. You think you must be dreaming! \u201cM-m-my room! It\u2019s like\u2026 Amazing!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I was really good at organizing things, Josh!\u201d Maddy smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-b-but\u2026 You did this in\u2026. a few minutes! I\u2019m\u2026 What the heck!\u201d you stutter as you sit down next to her. \u201cThis is impossible!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Josh\u2026. You\u2019re so cute!\u201d she chuckled. \u201cNow we need to go to my house and get some more cookies!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-b-but\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go to my place! You\u2019ll like it! I promise!\u201d Maddy insisted! \u201cIt\u2019s right next door!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and follow her out the door and across the lawn to her house. You\u2019re still wondering how on Earth she managed to clean up your room in under three minutes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat other surprises await you as you learn more about this mysterious girl? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you do not want to appear inconsiderate so you ate the Oatmeal raisin cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed at the taste and exclaimed  Delicious - how long have you been cooking cookies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy smiled  ' well, you could say----forever.  Say, why don't  you flex for me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complain  ' But I am not strong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy said  ' come on, flex.  I am your friend and I would not laugh.  I have some of my own. '<br>\r\nMaddy flexed her own biceps which was lemon sized. ' I do work out somewhat...Just flex once for me.

You never had any muscle and you weren\u2019t known to be very athletic at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Josh. Please flex those arms for me\u2026\u201d she pleads with you. You wonder WHY she wants you to show off your skinny bones which you call your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise up your right arm and flex. Of course, your long-sleeve shirt covers everything. Then, using your left hand, you pull back the long sleeve. What you uncover is utterly amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour forearms are as thick and as wide as bowling pins. They are completely covered by long, thick veins as well. And then, you see this big, round, rock-hard mound of muscle between your shoulder and your elbow. Is that a bicep? Maddy reaches out with her hand and she rubs her hand over this huge ball of muscle that is sticking out on top of your arm like a swollen bowling ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026 You\u2019re so strong, Josh! Let\u2019s see that other arm!\u201d she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou switch arms and you use your right arm to pull back the left shirt sleeve. In fact, you just take off the sweater altogether, revealing your ultra-muscular arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just love a guy with big arms\u2026\u201d Maddy purrs as she runs her soft palm of her hand over your HUGE left bicep while you look on in complete disbelief. Are those YOUR arms? And, YOUR muscles? \u201cYou\u2019re so strong, so powerful\u2026. And, so\u2026 Manly! And, you\u2019re just getting stronger and stronger every day\u2026\u201d she trails off quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. What? Huh? Say what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the biggest and the strongest kid in the whole school, Josh\u2026.\u201d She grinned at you. \u201cBecause you just wear those huge muscles so well!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026 what\u2026 what are you talking about?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be a very cool, very muscular boy\u2026. It is your\u2026. Destiny!\u201d Maddy whispered as she ran her soft hand over your pecs and thin abs. \u201cYou got the heart of a muscle guy who loves to help people!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d you respond shyly. \u201cBut\u2026 I gotta get back home soon. I still got some homework to do!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Josh! I\u2019ll see you in school tomorrow!\u201d Maddy grins as she runs her hand over your quads. They\u2019re not big\u2026 Not YET!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026. See ya tomorrow, Maddy! Thanks again for the cookies!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and you stroll back to your house, which is right next door. You like Maddy although she seems a little strange. You wonder what she might be talking about? How does she know you\u2019ll become big and strong? Will she get you a free gym membership? You wonder about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get home and you do some reading and studying at your desk in your bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you go to sleep. Everything seems normal, until\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you basked in the sounds of waves crashing on the shore and the fresh island air, you heard the sounds of your loving girlfriend walking up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh\" said Maddy happily, wearing a tight, pink one-piece swimsuit that flaunted her impossibly beautiful body \"Enjoying your dream?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, this is ... hey wait, did you just say this is only a dream?\"<br>\r\n\"Well ... maybe I can make it happen for real one day\" replied Maddy with a wink \"For now, let's enjoy the moment...\"<br>\r\nWith that she leaned in for a long, deep kiss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke from a wonderful wet dream to the sounds of your alarm. To your annoyance you couldn't remember anything concerning what your dream was about, other than that it was the best dream you'd ever had. With a sigh, you swiped on your phone to dismiss the alarm and pulled your nightshirt off your chest, as it was clinging weirdly tightly to your body. Then, still feeling a quite tired you wandered over to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mum was in the kitchen making herself a coffee, when she heard you scream from the bathroom. Moments later came the sounds of you running through the house.<br>\r\n\"Mum! Mum!\" you called out.<br>\r\n\"I'm right here, sweetie\" she said calmly, as she finished making her coffee and took the first sip from her cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you barged into the room, naked except for your underwear. \"Mum! Look!\" you cried hysterically \"What's happened?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm ...\" mused your mum as she looked you over \"Well, you're still the same old Joshua I love. Why, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Look right here\" you said as calmly as you could manage, pointing to your pecs, which seemed to be about 50% larger than the day before \"And tell me that's normal.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, have you been working out? They do look a bit bigger\" said your mum \"Kind of cute actually. Must have been all that lifting you've been doing. And your room ... I mean wow, that's the tidiest your room has ever been.\"<br>\r\n\"Mum, pectoral muscles don't grow like this overnight\" you argued \"I know I'm going through puberty and everything, but...\"<br>\r\n\"You haven't been taking drugs have you?\" asked your mum.<br>\r\n\"No!\" you replied defensively \"I mean, not unless muscles grow from eating cookies, but you ate the cookies too and you still look normal.\"<br>\r\n\"I think you shouldn't worry about it\" replied your mum, taking another sip from her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you walked out of the house feeling ashamed. You'd put on as much school uniform as you could to hide your increasingly muscular arms and pecs, but it was fairly futile. You hoped nobody would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after you entered the school gates, somebody put their hands over your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Guess who?\" came an unmistakably cute voice from behind you.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm ... Maddy?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"You guessed it! Hi Josh!\" said Maddy, happily moving her hands away from your eyes and beaming at you. Immediately you noticed her hairstyle was different: she'd cut it much shorter than before.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you got a haircut!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm glad you noticed. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n\"I think it looks great, actually.\"<br>\r\n\"I think you do, too\" Maddy purred, running one hand down your chest.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my mum thinks this is just all the housework I've been doing\" you said shyly with a forced attempt at a laugh \"I'm sure these muscles will go away as fast as they came, especially if you help me out like you helped with my room.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I think you'll keep these forever\" she said, sounding strangely commanding as she did so.<br>\r\nThere was a moment of awkward silence. \"Uhm ... well, if you think so\" you said uneasily.<br>\r\n\"Come on, we'll be late for class!\" cheered Maddy, holding your hand and walking off with you following.</span></div></div>",

Why don\u2019t you try out for the boys\u2019 soccer team? You\u2019d do so well at it!\u201d Maddy blurts out. \u201cI\u2019m already on the girls\u2019 team!

You had one test and you scored a 100% on that. For some reason, the tests were just\u2026 Too easy! High school had never seemed this easy to you before. Everybody left you alone during recess and the jerks who normally bullied you stayed far away from you. It was almost as if the bigger jocks were afraid of you for some reason. Homework was a breeze and you finished within an hour and the ride on the school bus went without any incident at all. The day just seemed perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed up at the soccer field for the freshman soccer tryouts not knowing what to expect. You didn\u2019t have high expectations at all, but your promised Maddie that you\u2019d come, so here you were. As you looked around, you spotted her, running around on the soccer pitch, wearing white shorts, jersey and black cleats. She waved at you as soon as you looked her way. Gosh, this girl was so incredibly cute! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer coach arrived with a large bag filled with balls. He blew the whistle and signaled for you to get on the pitch. He lined up several balls in a row and ordered you to make some shots on goal. One-by-one, you kicked each ball in, nice, hard and steady. Every ball went through and entered through one of the corners before hitting the back of the net. The coach smiled, before asking another boy to stand before you and the goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach blew the whistle again and told you to dribble the ball past the defender. He gave you three tries to make it. Every time he blew the whistle, he managed to get the ball past the other boy by kicking the ball through his legs and by dribbling around him and then by finishing it off with a clean shot into the goal. You could hear the comments of the onlookers who were standing along the side of the pitch and you could sense that they were all impressed by your footwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the coach placed several sticks and cones on the pitch, and he rolled a soccer ball towards you, with instructions to dribble the ball between all the cones before passing it at least five times back and forth to another player before making a shot on goal. So, you use your feet to run as fast as possible between all the cones, controlling the ball and sending it before you, keeping it in the lanes between the cones in an impressive show of ball control using only your cleats. You run through all the cones before sending the ball to the other player, who is running down the pitch towards the empty goal. He sends the ball back, and the two of you pass the ball back-and-forth to each other before you make a nice, clean shot on goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, your soccer partner passes the ball to you from the corner, while you stand before the goal. With every receiving pass, you head the ball into the goal, you volley the ball in, or you leap into the air and you manage to punch the ball in with an amazing bicycle kick, as you leap high in the air, flip your body around so you\u2019re upside-down with both legs pointing towards the sky and punching the ball into the goal with your cleat. You repeat the drill with one man standing in the goal, and you score every time you touch the ball. The people standing on the sidelines are very impressed as you clearly hear the comments as you wander over to the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that kid is really good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Josh? He\u2019s outstanding!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis kid can turn pro!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis guy is making all the right shots!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis kid is fun to watch!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, another player walks up to you. He has the bold letter \u201cC\u201d on his uniform. He\u2019s the Captain of the team. As he approaches you, he pulls the shirt off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosh, you need to take off your jersey!\u201d he orders you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh\u2026 Okay\u2026\u201d you just shrug, not knowing what is going on. You remove your jersey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosh\u2026 I can\u2019t compete with you, dude. You got way more talent than me, man. You can do things with a soccer ball that I can\u2019t even do at all! You\u2019re the best I\u2019ve ever seen! Not only that, but\u2026 I can tell you\u2019re working out in the gym as well\u2026\u201d  the boy says to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d I ask him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at your legs! I can\u2019t compete with that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your own legs and realize that your quads and calves are massive! Your quads are so big, that they look like they\u2019re about to burst out of your shorts. They are big, thick, wide mounds of muscle filled with thick vertical muscle cords running from your waist to your knees. No wonder you\u2019re not feeling tired. Your legs are totally pumped up with muscle. Not to mention, your calves are as big and as wide as melons. Your legs are totally ripped, and you look like a pro soccer star! Clearly, your legs are much more muscled than the other boy\u2019s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, here is my jersey! You\u2019re gonna be the team Captain from now on!\u201d the boy said, as he placed the shirt with the big letter \u201cC\u201d over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Are you sure?\u201d you ask him. Holy crap! The kid who was the team Captain just handed you the title! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! You deserve it, Josh! Congratulations! You\u2019re in charge!\u201d he said before he stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before you could react, all the other fourteen guys walked up to you. The entire soccer team stood before you, awaiting your instructions. You had never expected this! This meant that for sure you had made it through the tryouts, and you were just awarded the title of Team Captain! Holy smoke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Okay, guys! Let\u2019s shut down the passing lanes between the opposing team and let\u2019s block all shots on our goal! We need to be aggressive and attack their goal and keep the pressure on their goalie! Let\u2019s play hard and WIN this! Go, go, Goooo!\u201d you shout as your teammates cheer you on. You run down the pitch with the rest of the team in tow as Maddie looks on from the other field. After you win your first game, she\u2019ll be waiting for you by the sidelines to congratulate you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed normal to them, however, one boy would gain the powers of a god that day and become omnipotent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the boy already had the powers. He just couldn\u2019t use them, until now, because they were dormant. This was the day the powers were awakened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai Wen and Rishon Kadam strolled into the store, hoping to get some delicious candy after a long day of boring classes at school and a grueling practice session on the soccer field behind the church down the street. Both boys wear still wearing their uniforms and soccer cleats as they wandered around the candy aisle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRishon\u2019s parents were from Southern India and moved to Florida about ten years ago. Rishon was born in a Miami hospital and he pretty much grew up as a typical American kid, even though he had chocolate brown skin and jet black, straight hair with deep brown eyes. He was slender but athletic since he was always chasing a soccer ball or trying to hit a tennis ball somewhere. The boy was about 4-foot-8 inches tall and he was always wearing shorts with tennis shoes or soccer cleats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story was the same for Kai except for the fact that his parents were originally from Hong Kong. Kai was also born in Miami where his dad ran a small restaurant in a strip mall close to the beach. Kai would occasionally help on weekends when he was not playing soccer with Rishon. Kai was athletic as well, standing 4-foot-6 inches tall with black hair and blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, darn it! I can\u2019t reach the top shelf!\u201d Kai grumbled as he stood on his toes with his arm extended all the way while he tried his best to grab a box of candy from the shelf which was just slightly out of reach. \u201cUrrhhh!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan! You need to grow another three inches, dude!\u201d Rishon chuckled, as he looked on at his Chinese friend. \u201cYou\u2019re too short!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething weird happened. Kai suddenly felt a weird prickling sensation is his short legs, from his calves all the way up to his quads. Then, within a few seconds, it seemed as if the top shelf had come closer\u2026 Or did he just become taller?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! I got it!\u201d Kai grinned, as he grabbed the box from the shelf. He stood back on his feet and turned to face his Indian pal. \u201cIt\u2019s only two bucks! We can buy this!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood deal\u2026 But\u2026 You\u2019re taller than me now!\u201d Rishon noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kai was an inch taller than Rishon! What happened? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha? What\u2019s going on here?\u201d the Chinese boy wondered as he looked around. \u201cYou SHRUNK!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! People don\u2019t shrink, dude! You just got a few inches taller!\u201d Rishon shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could have sworn you were a few inches taller than me a minute ago?\u201d Kai pondered. \u201cThat\u2019s weird!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s pay for this so we can walk back to my house!\u201d Rishon suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys walked up to the cashier and paid for the candy. Then they strolled back to Rishon\u2019s house, which was right next to Kai\u2019s place. They didn\u2019t think much of Kai\u2019s sudden growth spurt, until the next occasion came up where Rishon would use his amazing powers as the new GodChild\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>WILLIAM GRAYSON KING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the name printed on your schedule. You prefered your initials, but until you got established here you would have to answer to William. You had just moved to a new school in the city where your dad had gotten a job. You say \"Dad\", but you were actually adopted; your real parents, whoever they were, had abandoned you on the steps of an orphanage as an infant. If they could only see what you were now, they might have been smart enough to keep you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first class was gym, which was fine by you. You were hoping to check out the pool, as you planned to join the swim team. You had been state champion back at your old school in Kansas, but then there weren't a great number of swimmer's in that state. You were anxious to find out what California had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter peeking into the pool area, you headed for the locker room. But once inside, you realized you weren't alone. On the far side of the room, hidden from any wandering teachers by a row of lockers, two large bullies were harassing a smaller kid, probably a ninth grader. You knew you had to help, but you didn't want to create a scene on your first day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid, what're you doin' here?\" one of them guffawed. \"Shouldn't you be down in the elementary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" the other said, \"if you give us you're lunch money, we won't turn you in for bein' up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid knew where this was going, and was trying to avoid confrontation by doing absolutely nothing. He did not speak, did not move, did not show any emotion on his face. He would be hard to play poker with. But the bullies were getting bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are ya? Stupid? I said give me your money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bullies had their underwear over their heads and their wallets came out of their pockets to repeatedly slap them in the face. The two ran out of the locker room, yelling for help while the kid looked stunned. You tried to leave, but he spotted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" he asked, his voice quivering slightly. So much for not making a scene. You would blame him for losing his poker face, but then, who wouldn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" you try to shove it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so maybe I did do it, but you have to figure it out for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, it's not like I have a giant group of friends to run and tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid's unfallible logic was actually making you consider, but you still had reservations. Your powers allowed you to alter any physical or dimensional aspect of your world and impose influence on peoples' thoughts, but free will was ultimately their choice. If this kid chose to run and tell someone, you could make him a mute, or make the other person deaf, but that seemed kind of drastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you spend the week trying to prove I can trust you,\" you told him. \"On Friday, I'll consider revealing my secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed mildly disappointed, but followed you to the gym. It turned out it was a mixed-grade gym class that he shared with you and the bullies. They were still rubbing their asses from the wedgies and had forced their wallets back into their pockets. They had a look of suspicion and fear as they saw the kid. You laughed inwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ought to be a fun school.\"</span></div></div>",

Just be yourself this week, and we'll see.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he slumped his shoulders a little, obviously disappointed in your answer. \u00c2\u00a0\u201dFine...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him dejected like this made you start to second-guess your decision, but you knew that you had to learn more about him and see if he would prove himself on his own terms. Still, it wouldn't hurt to help him out a little. \u00c2\u00a0\u201dMaybe it would help if we knew each other\u2019s names. I\u2019m Brandon, by the way,\u201d you said, sticking out your hand.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked down at your hand, seemingly unsure of what to do with it for a second before finally grabbing it and shaking.\u00c2\u00a0\u201dAshton,\u201d he replied.\u00c2\u00a0\u201dMy friends call me Ash. That is, they would if...\u201d His voice trailed off as he looked away, but you knew what he was trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat\u2019s okay, Ash,\u201d you said as you tried to smile reassuringly, not confident that you succeeded.\u00c2\u00a0\u201dFreshman year can be tough. I know mine was, back in Kansas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh\u2019s eyes widened.\u00c2\u00a0\u201dKansas? I wouldn't have guessed you were from there. You don't have an accent or anything.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you shook your head. \u201dMost people from where I'm from don't. I grew up outside Kansas City; my house was half a mile from the Missouri state line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAh. Okay.\u201d He looked to be lost in thought for a moment, then suddenly turned back to you with a look of embarrassment in his eyes.\u00c2\u00a0\u201dI, uh, I hope I didn't offend you or anything. I wasn't trying to imply you were a hick or something. Not that being from Kansas would make you a hick-- that is--\u201d As Ash kept talking, he started to look more and more nervous, sweat starting to form on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAsh, relax,\u201d you said, placing a hand on his shoulder. \u201dI wasn't offended.\u201d As you touched him, you decided to use your powers to help him out a little, causing his body to calm down slightly and returning his heart rate to a normal level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGood.\u201d He didn't seem to notice your intervention, and he grew silent for a few minutes. As he did, you looked around at the rest of your classmates. It seemed to be about fifty percent freshman like Ash, the rest made up of a mixture of transfers from other states like you, older students who didn't pass gym their first year, and born jocks for whom taking a gym class was the only worthwhile reason to go to school. Though the bell had rung three minutes ago, the teacher had yet to get started, so most of the class had split into three or four groups and were chatting about their summers, movies and TV shows they had seen, and tryouts for several fall sports that were happening this week. You noticed the two bullies had joined a group with two other older looking kids, all of whom were talking in lower tones, occasionally glaring your direction, though you weren't sure if they were looking at you or Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOkay, lunkheads, shut your mouths and listen up!\u201d The voice of the gym teacher had startled several students, booming from the doorway where he had just entered from.\u00c2\u00a0\u201dMy name is Mr. Buckner, and I get the wondrous privilege to teach gym to all of you 'leaders of tomorrow'.\" These last words were dripping with sarcasm, punctuated by Mr. Buckner rolling his eyes as he said them. \"We all know that this is probably the last place any of us want to be after a nice relaxing summer, but the state of California forces you to be here, and my mortgage and child support payments force my sorry ass to be here, so we\u2019re all going to have to learn to live\u00c2\u00a0with it.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough most of the rest of the class is looking up at Mr. Buckner with a mixture of horror and disgust, you can't help but find his display a little amusing, and you chuckle. Immediately, he spins in your direction, glaring menacingly at you.\u00c2\u00a0\u201dWhat was that?!\u201d He stomped your direction, the other groups of students moving out of his way as he passed.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding directly in front of you, he leaned in, snarling almost like a wild dog. In your peripheral vision, you could see Ash visibly trembling, though he remained by your side, either too scared to move or not willing to leave the closest thing he had to a friend in this school. You seemed to be the only one in the gym who wasn't intimidated by Mr. Buckner-- of course, you were also the only one who could, without moving a muscle, shrink him down to the size of a flea, or crunch his body into the form of a ball and cause him to go flying through the air into one of the basketball hoops. Maybe it was time for the gym teacher to be taught a lesson...</span></div></div>",

Being followed wasn\u2019t something you enjoyed unless you could mess with them. Ash seemed to have some mental block against you pushing your influence onto him. That meant you had to mess with him the good old fashion way. Running through ideas, you decided on a timeless classic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached your home, you thought about all the things you could do involving Ash. Maybe telling someone about your powers could be fun in it\u2019s own ways. Having nearly unlimited power got boring real fast. A normal person giving you ideas or maybe having you set down rules could add some additional entertainment. Either way, you could enjoy his disbelief of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of entering your house, you go around back and just happened to leave the gate unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning to yourself, you suddenly find yourself a few inches shorter as you accessed your power. You\u2019re hair grew longer and your figure became much curvier. Looking at your reflection in the back window, you saw a female version of yourself. Deciding to add the finishing touches, your clothes transformed into a two piece bikini. Ash was a loner who didn\u2019t have many friends, much less a girlfriend, so he was sure to freeze up the moment he saw you. You heard the gate opening and quickly sat down on a lawn chair and waited. A second later, Ash came around the corner and froze when he saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d You ask, playing the part. \u201cWhy did you come here without permission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 er\u2026 just\u2026 friend?\u201d Ash stammered, unable to form a coherent sentence.

I give a happy look at Ash as he seems to be filled with a new joy, then I speak. \"Hey Ash how you doing?\" I say in Beth's voice this causes him to look confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Beth?\" He asks looking me over I smile a bit.<br>\r\n\"Yeah who else would it be.\" I say mimicking her voice and mannerisms.<br>\r\n\"Wait did he just switch you around with him.\" I give a confused look. <br>\r\n\"What are you talking about I was walking back to my house and now I'm here.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh crap I guess he really did become you.\" Ash said looking worried but that only leads you to chuckle. <br>\r\n\"Got ya.\" You say putting a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighs but smiles as he looks you over. \"You did a pretty accurate job and heck had me fooled there.\" He gives a small chuckle as you smile.

Ash's nose seems to bleed a little as he reaches out for her. \"I think I'll have some fun with her.\" He smiles feeling her up as the Cosplay squad rolls their eyes. the Ninja girl giggles a little before kissing Ash. You smile as a few things happens the squad moves to another room to prepared to do 'other' things when they are done as you look over the sight as Ash feels up the ninja versions heavy chest and grabbing her plump rear end. you smile and watch him a little more before moving out and change things a little further.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the fire quickly returned, and he started yelling even louder. \u201dSo, what, will you be the Joker, then? Well, la-di-freaking-da. We've got ourselves a bona-fide movie buff, boys and girls.\u201d He shook his head, smiling in a cruel, sadistic way. \u201dTell you what, Joker. You can be the star of the show. Because every day this week, you\u2019re gonna be running laps for the entire class! Any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there could be worse punishments, you thought. For now, it would be best to just go along with it. Shaking your head without saying a word, you then quickly started running along the outer edge of the gym, as the rest of the class stared at you in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAll right, then,\u201d Mr. Buckner's voice boomed across the entire gymnasium,\u00a0\u201ddoes Mr. Joker have any friends who want to\u00a0\u2019co-star' with him? If so, just speak up, and you can run laps the entire week too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, turning the corner and facing away from the rest of the class. You sincerely doubted anyone would take him up on his offer to join you, and you wondered just why this little speck of a man felt a need to intimidate and verbally abuse a bunch of teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAll right, pipsqueak! Start running! Now!\u201d\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought you had misheard, but as you brought your head up, you noticed the figure of another student starting to run along the edge of the walls. As you looked closer, you realized that it was Ash! You couldn't believe that anyone would voluntarily subject themselves to this torture (well, at least anyone who didn't have divine powers like you), but something had stirred Ash into joining you. Maybe he could be trusted after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Buckner started to perform his pathetic excuse for \u201dteaching\u201d, you slowed your pace to allow Ash to be able to catch up with you. When he did, you looked at him and smiled, him giving you a weak smile in return.\u00a0\u201dWhat did you do that for?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI-- I dunno,\u201d he said in between breaths.\u00a0\u201dI just thought it was pretty awesome the way you stood up to him without being at all frightened, and... I didn't want you to be the only one. Besides, I kinda like running. I do it all the time, around the neighborhood and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHmm,\u201d you said.\u00a0\u201dWell, thanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDon't mention it.\u201d His smile started to broaden, but instantly disappeared when Mr. Buckner shouted at the two of you\u00a0to stop talking and create some space between the two of you.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHmm,\u201d you thought to yourself,\u00a0\u201dif he wants to see space, I can show him space.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was time to make something fun happen, and to reward Ash for sticking up for you. First things first. You wanted to reward Ash for really demonstrating his loyalty towards you. You decided that you wanted to use your godly powers to make Ash do something really cool and stand out, in a way. Since he was running laps around the gym with you, why not make him run\u2026 faster? A LOT faster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou intentionally slowed down the pace a bit, allowing for the distance between you and Ash to increase even more. Secondly, you wanted Ash to stay ahead of you. When Ash was far enough ahead of you, that you could see him running right in front of you, you quietly willed for time to freeze in the gym for everyone but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything stopped and everyone froze. Even Ash froze, while he was in the middle of his stride. In fact, he was practically hovering above the ground as he was running with one leg in front of him and the other behind him. Mr. Buckner and all the other students had completely frozen, and were in suspended animation, standing on the other side of the gym. It was completely silent in the gym; you could hear a pin drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calmly walked up to Ash, who was staring straight in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna reward you for your loyalty, Ash\u2026\u201d you say in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see his legs. You want him to gain thirty pounds of muscle in his legs, making him resemble a professional track star. In fact, he would almost resemble a runner who had just come back from the Olympics! Ash\u2019s quads inflate with layers upon layers of muscle, growing thicker and wider to the point where veins as thick as ropes covered his quads all over. Next, his calves inflated with raw muscle like balloons attached to an air pump. They grew to the size of melons, filling out until they looked almost too big to be real! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW\u2026 Let\u2019s see how fast you\u2019re gonna run, Ash\u2026\u201d you say with a wide grin on your face as you walk back to the point where you were, several feet behind Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently wish for time to resume in the gym. All the students resumed talking and Mr. Buckner continued his lecture. Ash continued to run in front of you with one noticeable difference\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Look at Ash!\u201d one boy noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang! Look at Ash! He\u2019s fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was running faster\u2026 MUCH faster than before! Ash had passed the students and he was now completing his lap already.  He had just turned the corner and he was already passing me for the second time now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Brandon!\u201d Ash said as he blew past me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just watched him as he practically left you in the dust. You could tell that all the other guys in class were impressed by Ash\u2019s sudden increase in speed. Now, all you had to do, was take care of Mr. Buckner. You looked over at where he was standing and you silently willed for your beloved gym instructor to suddenly have the incredible urge to go and use the restroom due to an overactive bladder\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! You two guys can stop running!\u201d Mr. Buckner shouted at you. \u201cSplit up into two teams and get a basketball game going! I\u2019ll be right back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Buckner practically ran into the men\u2019s room while you just started shooting hoops. The rest of the class was a lot of fun. Ash was one of the best players on the team, since he was able to run the fastest and jump the highest with his super-muscular legs of his\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You used your power to instantly wash yourself, without needing the showers, and dashed off to your next class. You promised Ash you'd see him again after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day was pretty boring, though there was some interesting chatter that Mr. Buckner, who'd only taught one class, had been called into the principal's office, and the principal didn't look happy when he was doing it. It seemed that calling one's students 'lunkheads', passive-aggressively insulting them, actively insulting them and attempting to force them to run full tilt for almost forty-five minutes were all quite strictly against staff standards. You found it amusing that they hired the man in the first place, but, by the end of the day, word was that he wouldn't be returning for a second day. \"And I didn't even have to use my powers once,\" you muttered to yourself as you waited outside the front for Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came out his youthful face was beaming. He still seemed entranced by his muscles, and even with a t-shirt the definition in his arms showed. \"Dude! You won't believe it. I got a date, and I got on the track team. I didn't even have to try out, apparently my speed in gym was one of the best a number of students had ever seen. I got recommended and I'm on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations man,\" you replied, \"Wanna ditch our backpacks somewhere first?

We\u2019re here already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat on his bed with a grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d you just smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Ash asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have godly powers, my friend! I can teleport you anywhere I want!\u201d you respond. \u201cI can also do\u2026 THIS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you snapped your fingers again, making Ash\u2019s shorts and t-shirt disappear, leaving him standing before you wearing only his jockstrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

His biceps bulged, his chest expanded and his pectorals inflated some more. In fact, you allowed Ash to grow a bit taller as well, until he towered over you at 6 foot 6 inches in height. He had broad shoulders with delts, traps and lats which gave him that V-taper that bodybuilders loved to show off. Ash now resembled a gymnast who was preparing to go to the Olympics!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoww! Okay\u2026 I was big before\u2026 Now I\u2019m huge! I\u2019m a total stud!\u201d Ash grinned as he looked down and examined his amazing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! All your clothes are adjusted to fit you! How about you wear a tank top and a pair of shorts with a pair of high tops?\u201d you suggest, as you snap your fingers and make these clothes appear on Ash\u2019s well-developed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man!

You just sit down at the edge of his bed, on the other end of Ash\u2019s bedroom and observe as Ash does his homework at lightning speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh starts reading through several pages of his thick English book! His eyes scan the text of the book at an outrageous speed. He reads an entire page in 3 seconds before he flips the page over to the next one. After a few seconds, he flips the page again! After twenty seconds had passed, Ash had finished reading almost twenty pages at super speed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Ash grabbed his pen and his notebook and started answering the questions listed in his book. He started writing his answers so fast, that he filled up a page in his notebook in 10 seconds. Then he filled another page and another, until he had written almost 5 pages full of all his answers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after about 5 minutes or so, Ash had answered about 15 questions from reading 20 pages for his English class. Normally, this would have taken over an hour, but Ash had completed all the work in only 5 minutes flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Ash, back to normal speed!\u201d you say, as you snapped your fingers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!

An older man had a flat tired and he can\u2019t find his jack to raise up the side of his car, so he can remove the flat and replace it with a spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help you with that!\u201d Ash grins as he flexes his arm before he strolls up to the back of the car, places his hands on the bumper, and casually lifts the rear of the vehicle high enough so the flat tire lifts and off the ground, much to the delight of all the onlookers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother gentleman takes a tool and he unscrew the nuts which hold the flat tire in place. He removes the flat and quickly replaces it with the spare. Once he\u2019s done, Ash lowers the car back on the pavement, to the cheers of everyone there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small crowd formed around Ash where people of all ages, including other teens and a few adults, started asking the big teen how strong he was and where he worked out, thanking him for all his help. Ash finally walked back to you with a grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, Brandon\u2026 Being big and strong is so cool\u2026 It\u2019s so much fun to help all these people\u2026 I\u2019m almost beginning to feel like some sort of superhero!\u201d Ash remarks to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you look up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can arrange that! Want to be a superhero, for real? Or, I can make you into a big, teen bodybuilder\u2026 With even bigger muscles than you got now!\u201d you suggest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh pondered your suggestion for a moment and replied\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as the two of you were walking past the lockers, Jason, one of the students athletes, approached you from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash! Ash!\" he shouted, as he came running up to your new friend. \"I heard that you were a really fast runner and I was wondering if you wanted to join our varsity soccer team? We need new players and I would love to see you on our team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soccer team? Me? Uhhh... I guess...\" he sighed, looking at you. You nodded in return, feeling glad to see his rising popularity. While Ash was still talking to Jason you decided to tweak his body a little and to gradually grow him taller and to make his upper body more muscular so that it matches his muscular legs. You see Ash slowly growing taller and taller, until he's about 6 foot 4 inches tall. You make sure his biceps, his pectorals and his abdominal muscles fill out his skinny frame so that he looks like an even bigger jock than Jason! Finally, Ash walks back up to you, and you're now looking up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my first soccer practice in a few minutes!\" he says excitedly. The two of you walk outside and head out to the field. He borrows a pair of cleats from someone and puts them on. Suddenly, he gets up and stands before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang! What happened? You shrunk, Brandon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! I didn't change one bit! You have grown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taller than you! How... How come?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say...

Not only was Ash one of the fast players on the team, he was also be of the first guys to score a goal as well. Needless to say, that all the payers were very pleased to have him as a part of their soccer team!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce practice was over, Ash and Brandon started walking home from the soccer field behind the man school building. They decided to cut through the large public park, which took up several city blocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking through the park and passing several tall trees, Ash had stopped when he heard sounds coming from one of the branches of a tree. When he looked up, he spotted a little kitten, sanding on a branch, anxiously trying to jump down from the high branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! The kitten is too high up! It's too scared to jump!\" Ash noted. \"Maybe I can try to climb up the tree and get to the poor kitten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe branch was about a dozen feet above the ground, and Ash just wasn't tall enough to reach it by jumping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash...\" you say calmly, as your big, muscular friend walks up to you. \"I can help you get to he kitten, but you gotta promise me something, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure?\" he says, while standing right in front of you, with you looking him right in his bulging chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna make you even bigger than you are now... Like really BIG! But don't tell anyone that I made you grow, okay?\" you whisper to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... okay.... But.... Won't people find it strange that I'm so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can alter reality so that nobody will find it strange that you're a giant!\" you explain to him. \"And your clothes will grow with your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back as you watch Ash slowly grow bigger and taller.... His arms and legs grow longer as his torso becomes bigger at the same time. His hands and feet all grow in unison. Within moments, Ash grows from 6 foot 4 inches to 12 feet tall, and his shorts, shoes and t-shirt grow along with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" he exclaims, as he reaches over and easily grabs the kitten from the tree branch, which is now in his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now look up to Ash, who is a twelve-foot-tall giant.

In all of your days of living you have never met anyone more annoying. Allen seemed to appear everywhere you went, demanding that you keep the promise you made to him the first day you two met, a promise that you in fact never intended to keep. You wanted to live a normal life, yes you had omnipotent power but that didn\u2019t mean you had to use them every second of everyday, nor did that mean that you had to tell anyone about them, you did not owe this boy a exclamation, you did not owe him anything. In fact where did he get off demanding anything from you, you a almighty being who could turn that mortal into a worm, or maybe wipe him from the face of the earth with nothing but a thought, this was your power, your authority, so the question that plagued your mind was why didn\u2019t you do exactly that, or at least erase his memory? Could it be that you where starting to actually like that idiotic kid? What ever the answer, you had better things to concern yourself with, today was the day that tryouts where being held for the swim team and you where determined to make the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pool was pretty big, and looked quite impressive, in truth it looked like a professional swimming pool. The pool supported ten lanes that where separated by ten dividers. Their where also ten diving boards that rested at the far end of the pool. You couldn\u2019t help but be impressed. You glance over towards your right, you see a group of around 19 boy sitting down In the stands, all of these boys whore black jackets decorated with yellow stripes, the words Sunshine High Swimming team printed on their backs. You could tell that these boys where your elders, the people who where already on the swimming team. These boys where talking to one another and some of them looked at you with a smug smile on their face. You didn\u2019t have to read their minds to tell what they where thinking, they where simply looking down on you plain and simple. You didn\u2019t mind because in fact you where looking down on them to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and a few more students appeared at the pool. Counting you their where 18 students that where trying to join the swimming team. After a few more minutes passed a man who seemed to be in his 30 appeared. This man wore a Hawaiian shirt and brown shorts that had to many pockets in your opinion. It was obvious to all that this man did not know how to be professional, he wore flip flops to work instead of regular shoes so yea you where pretty sure he wasn\u2019t professional at all, but in all truth and honesty this gave the man a more relaxed demeanor, and that wasn\u2019t technically a bad thing in your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention maggots!!!\u201d The man yelled at the top of his lungs. \u201c(Ok so maybe he wasn\u2019t relaxed after all)\u201d you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNewbies lined up on my right, and oldies on my left!\u201d The man yelled as he pointed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take everyone long to get in line, even the students who where already on the swimming team, rushed to get in line. It was impressive how this man inspired  obedience and loyalty in his students, even though you yourself was not afraid of this man, you thought it best to do what he says for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Jacob Russell, you will call me Mr. Russell or Coach Russell, do I make myself clear!\u201d Mr. Russell says in another loud shout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the students shook their head, others replied \u201cok\u201d softly as if they where mumbling to themselves <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI SAID DO I MAKE MY SELF CLEAR!!!!\u201d Mr. Russell said in a even louder voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201c\u201cYES COUCH RUSSELL!!!!\u201d\u201d\u201d Everyone shouted in a loud voice, even you yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday is the beginning of tryouts, your job is simple. Impress me. Failure to do so will result in termination. This termination includes everyone, newbies and oldies. So in short welcome to hell ladies. Mr. Russell said with a evil smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh brother.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Coach Russell made good on his promise, swim practice was hell for everyone, everyone except you. It was because of your absolute condition, that you could never become tired, it didn\u2019t matter how much exercise you did you would never sweat or feel even a little bit exhausted. Before practice began coach Russell made everyone change Into their swim trunks, while in the boys locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwim practice began at 3:30 and it was now 4:20. You had to give coach Russell credit, he knew how to turn a short amount of time into a nightmare. Coach Russell made everyone do 50 push-ups, 50 sit ups, and 100 laps in the pool. By the time everyone was done with the exercise from hell they where all dripping wet, on their knees or back gasping for air, therefore you stood out from everyone, because you are the only one on your feet, not looking tired at all, instead you look like you could do another 100 laps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell look at you.\u201d Coach Russell says while walking over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou boys see this, this is the kind of endurance I expect from all of you!\u201d The coach yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys on the ground look at you, some with amazement, others with disdain. You didn\u2019t care, it wasn\u2019t your fault that you had the perfect body. While standing around waiting for the coach to give you the next exercise you look over towards the stands and see Allen sitting down watching you practice with a few more students. Allen would not leave you alone, well you would have to deal with him later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk everyone LINE UP!\u201d The coach yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone returns to the lines they where in during the start of practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTryouts are over for today, and I have to say very little of you have impressed me.\u201d Coach Russell says, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the results for today\u2019s tryouts will be on the gym door tomorrow. Dismissed. The coach says, walking out of the pool deck and heading for his office which was inside of the boys locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone starts to head towards the boy locker rooms in order to change out of their wet close, everyone expect you. You grab your back back and start to head home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. William wait up.\u201d Allen says running besides you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to get changed with everyone else?\u201d Allen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers and your wet swim trunks begin to change into black jeans, and your bare chest gets covered by a plane white t shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah now that is cool.\u201d Allen says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen and you walk home together. This was the first time you had ever walked home with someone else and it felt strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you going to finally keep your promise to me, and tell me what you are?\u201d Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen was very Adamant about you revealing your secrets, and maybe you should, you made a promise after all, and maybe it was time you kept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d You said while letting out a little sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told Allen pretty much everything, like how you were omnipotent, and how your parents knew about your powers and how they were never afraid of you, you also explain how you have had your powers ever since you were 8 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how did you get your powers?\u201d Allen asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Allen, for a few seconds then you revert your gaze towards the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all began with a choice.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you need to know. Now look you seem like a good kid but I don\u2019t need any of this.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop walking and look straight at Allen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Allen asks looking a little worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that I\u2019m willing to grant you a wish, one wish, but only on one condition.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat condition.\u201d Allen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to leave me alone when we are at school, and you must never tell anyone my secret, in return I\u2019ll grant any wish you may have, except omnipotents itself.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are willing to grant any wish, I have.\u201d Allen asks, with a face filled with surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, doesn\u2019t matter what it is I\u2019ll give it to you. Like maybe more riches than you will ever be able to spend in your lifetime, or maybe immortality, or to rule over thousands of stars, or the earth itself. Just ask and it will be yours.\u201d You say holding up your right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever wish Allen makes you knew it will only be in his own self entrust, well ether way he will be out of your hair forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case I wish.....\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI wish to be super strong!\u201d Allen said to you. \u201cI had always wanted to be stronger than everybody else, you know?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at him with a smile on your face. That was an easy wish. Easy to accomplish, too. All you had to do was to wish for his muscles to grow to pro bodybuilder proportions and for him to have superhuman physical strength. That\u2019s all there was to it. Oh, and you wished for all his clothes in his wardrobe to adjust to his new proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Allen\u2019s chest started to expand in every direction while his arms inflated with muscle. His triceps and biceps literally doubled the size of his muscles in no time. His flat chest exploded with large orbs of pectorals while his flat stomach now sported the most well-defined abdominal muscles on the planet. His entire torso grew a foot wider by the shoulders. Throughout all this, Allen let out a soft groan while his muscles were growing rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhhhh!\u201d he moaned while he had his eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on happily as you continued to monitor the kid\u2019s fantastic muscular growth. Allen\u2019s quadriceps inflated to the size of Redwood Oak trees, showing mighty columns of thick muscle which ran from his waist down to his knees while they were completely covered in long, thick, rope-like veins. Lastly, his thin calves on the back of his legs grew like bread in the oven, inflating to the size of large soccer balls, fully covered with a network of veins as well. As soon as the growth spurt stopped, his clothes adjusted to cover his larger muscles. His shorts and his t-shirt grew, so he looked like a big, teenage kid with big, bulging muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh!\u201d Allen exclaimed as soon as the growth spurt ended. He looked down, flexing his huge arms and legs. He felt an increased strength coursing through his body. He was strong enough to lift a car with his bare hands. \u201cWilliam! This is incredible!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! You got your wish, big guy!\u201d you smile as you started to turn around so you could continue your walk towards your house, which was just one block away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. William? Please?\u201d Allen said as he easily passed you by. That was easy for him now, thanks to his big, pumped-up legs. \u201cUmm\u2026 Can I still hang out with you after school? I mean\u2026 We\u2019re not at school anymore\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped and you looked at the big muscle guy. It\u2019s now hard not to like this guy. He really wanted to be your friend. You realize, thanks to your omniscience, that he really doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends, either. Of course, that will now change because he\u2019s the big muscle man at school. But for now, he wanted your friendship. You figure his popularity would soar starting the following day and he would eventually gain so many friends that he would forget about you anyway. But for now, he was your only friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, big guy! Come on, my place is over here!\u201d you say to him as you point at your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle man follows you and you let him in. You introduce him to your parents and then you take him to your bedroom. There, you sit down at the edge of your bed and you pull out the game console. The two of you play a round of Fortnite, which Allen easily wins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, you two grab some ice cream out of the freezer and you scoop up two cups with some delicious chocolate ice cream. You sit down on the patio overlooking the backyard pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Allen\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for sounding so harsh earlier. But, you gotta understand that I don\u2019t want everyone at school to know about my powers, okay?\u201d you say to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay\u2026 I understand\u2026 I just want to be your friend, that\u2019s all, William\u2026\u201d he says with a sad look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs far as everyone is concerned, you just have really good genetics and you lift weights in the gym every single day! Because of that, you\u2019re such a strong, young guy! You got that?\u201d you tell him sternly. \u201cI want you to forget about me ever having mentioned anything about my Godly powers and you\u2019ll forget about me making your muscles grow. You became big by going to the gym. You did that on your own!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look on as Allen blinks for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that ice cream was delicious. Now, I gotta hit the gym and work off all those extra calories!\u201d he smiles as he finishes his cup of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, your mom comes out through the kitchen door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, William? I got some boxes with books which I need to deliver to the library. They\u2019re really heavy. Can you carry them to the car for me?\u201d she says to you. \u201cThanks, sweetheart!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind giving us a hand, big guy?\u201d you say to Allen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind that at all!\u201d Allen chuckles as he stands up and flexes both arms, causing his huge biceps to swell up on his arms. \u201cTime to put these babies to work!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an incredible sight. Allen walked over to the back corner of your mother\u2019s bedroom, where she had two large boxes filled with books stacked on top of each other. He just squatted down, lifting both boxes like they weighed nothing at all. Then, he turned around, easily carrying those boxes filled with old books, weighing over a hundred pounds, to the garage where he placed them in the trunk of your mother\u2019s car. It was the easiest task in the world for the big muscle kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll done, William!\u201d Allen smiled, as he rested his big arm over your shoulders. \u201cThat was easy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, dude! Well, I got some studying to do! I guess I\u2019ll catch you at school tomorrow?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I\u2019m going to the gym!\u201d Allen said, as he hugged you briefly before walking off. \u201cSee yah tomorrow, bro!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee ya, big man!\u201d you grin as you watch him walk towards the gym. You were happy with the way that turned out. You still made a friend and your secret was still safe, after all. You just hoped that Allen wouldn\u2019t get into any trouble at school the next day. You wondered if you had made him too strong? Or, maybe you should have buffed up some other kid as well, just to be friends with him and to help him stay out of trouble? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was not the first time, you had made this offer to a mortal. You had to have heard wrong, but deep you knew you hadn\u2019t. But you had to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome again?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to be your friend.\u201d Allen asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn\u2019t be happening, you wanted to get rid of this mortal, now, now you just might be stuck with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky begins to darken, and the wind starts to blow with great ferocity, all of this came from your anger, your wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, you would waste a wish on something so trivial!\u201d You yell, thunder echos throughout the darken sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen was a little scared but for some reason he stood his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI REFUSE TO HAVE ANY RELATIONS WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.\u201d Your voice makes the ground rumble, and makes lightning from the heavens fall, yet still Allen stood his ground, the question was why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOUR WISH, YOUR WISH, is granted.\u201d You say, your voice turning back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes trying to wake up from this stupid dream. But it wasn\u2019t a dream, it was reality. You look at Allen who in turn looks at you with that same gentle smile that made it hard for you to hate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure Allen, are you sure that you want to use your one and only wish, so that we can have a true friendship?\u201d You ask, waiting for Allen to jump and yell \u201c got ya!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m sure William.\u201d Allen says holding up his right hand once again for a handshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your head with your right hand. Your head seemed to almost hurt from all of this ridiculousness, which wasn\u2019t possible because of your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d You said shaking Allen\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks William.\u201d Allen says with a little laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me Will, seeing as to how we are friends now.\u201d You say with a little attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want this, you could have easily backed out of the deal, but you knew you couldn\u2019t. Lying to people just wasn\u2019t your style, you considered it beneath you to not tell the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to say Allen you are one strange mortal.\u201d You say with a little smirk, as you look at Allen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I strange?\u201d Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not the first person I have offered a wish to, everyone else had always used their wish for their own selfish gain, but you used your wish to become my friend, honestly I don\u2019t know if your just pure hearted, or just a idiot.\u201d You say still feeling a little bit annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know I made the right choice, so I have no regrets.\u201d Allen says crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey why didn\u2019t you run away earlier?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Allen asks looking at you confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean when the sky turned black and was filled with thunder and lightning, and my very voice made a earthquake.\u201d You say trying to jog Allen\u2019s memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well I don\u2019t really know, I guess I fooled my instincts.\u201d Allen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInstincts?\u201d You ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, I remembered how you said you wanted to live a normal life, so I figured that someone who seeks to live a normal life would reframe from kill someone. Plus you seem like a kind person.\u201d Allen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Allen for a few minutes, a little surprised. This kid didn't look like it but he was very smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve met many people in my life, but you Allen are truly one of a kind.\u201d You say walking down the sidewalk with Allen right behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly I can only think of one other person that was much like you.\u201d You say looking down at the ground, with a sad eyes, and a gloomy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Allen asks curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go silent thinking of things that have already passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke filled the sky , and burning ash consumed the air. Fields that were once filled with lush crops were set ablaze with a unforgiving fire. Amongst the burning fields lay a teenage girl, gravely injured, and in great pain, you sat next to her clutching her tightly as if you were afraid that she would slip out of your grasp forever. Tears fell from your eyes, tears that you had thought dried up a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please let me save you. You can\u2019t expect me to let you die, not like this.\u201d You say in a grieving voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWilliam, you have to let me go, if you love me then please, let me go. The girl said breathing hard, with tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the girl go silent for a little while, staring into each other\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please do not lose faith in humanity, with these hands you can reach them, I know you can.\u201d The girl says in a quite voice, before she turns silent forever more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA painful scream is carried by the wind, and lighting lights up the night sky, all of this was evidence, evidence to reveal that even gods cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley I\u2019m sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(End of flashback) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Will are you ok.\u201d Allen says shaking your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your daydreaming and look at Allen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea I\u2019m alright, I was just thinking of the past.\u201d You say looking a little sad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Saturday morning, and you with great ease started to get up from bed. You in truth didn\u2019t need to sleep, breath, eat, or even go to the bathroom, but you where so use to it, you honestly didn\u2019t feel like changing your whole system. The suns rays shines through your window curtains, lighting up your room. You standing on your own two feet, slowly walk towards your dresser, which stood by the wall closet to your closet door. You open drawer after drawer and soon bring out a white shirt with a picture of a eagle on the back of it, blue jean pants, and two pairs of white socks. You throw the close onto the bed, and with a snap of your fingers your whole body starts to glow with heavenly light. As the light subsides, the close that where once on the bed, are now on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I better begin my day.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth you where not looking forward to this day. You had Swim practice later in the afternoon at 3:30, plus Allen wanted to spend some time with you as well. Allen in your eyes was truly a mystery, but you felt like you could handle that mystery, as long as nothing else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock, knock, knock.\u201d You hear three knocks at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlash\u201d, you for a small second where covered in a blinding light as you stood in your room, as soon as the light had vanished and you had disappeared from your room, and had teleported right in front of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t ever really answer the door, that kind of thing, you left to your mother, or some other person, but this time was different. You had a bad feeling about this mysterious guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly open the door to see a very beautiful women with light brown hair and brown eyes. The women wore a black leather jacket with a grey shirt underneath it, she had on tight grey jeans and black boots on her feet that went way past her ankles. The women wore a smile as she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t William King.\u201d The women says with a seductive smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think that I would run into the God child all the way out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClara Jean.\u201d You stayed feeling a little irritated \ud83d\ude24. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a lot of problems right now, now wasn\u2019t the time to deal with another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want Clara?\u201d You say with a evil look on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, is that anyway to talk to your friend?\u201d The women asks with a smug smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not my friend, and you now the reason why.\u201d You say getting more and more irritated by the second,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you are still hung up on that, please it happened so long ago, talk about holding a grudge.\u201d The women say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe quite and tell me why are you here in this town, and don\u2019t play dumb on me.\u201d You say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you must know.\u201d Clara says walking towards you in a seductive manner. Clara brings her face as close to your face as it could go. Clara\u2019s face was so close that Will could feel her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIM HERE TO SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME WITH YOU. Clara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was kidding, you and Clara go way back, and if their was something that You knew about Clara, it was when she was lying or hiding something. You believed it to be both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop playing me.\u201d You say with a little growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look behind Clara to see where that voice was coming from. You see Allen standing a few away from your apartment. Allen had his mouth wide open, and his eyes where in complete shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill what\u2019s happening.\u201d Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is great, just great. You had to deal with Clara, but know things had just gotten harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s she,\u201d Allen says looking at Clara, his face turning a little red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't blame Allen for being so weak in the knees when it came to Clara\u2019s good looks. To gods and men she was truly was as pretty as a diamonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllen this is my friend Clara, or as, many people call her, the girl with all the looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You where angry, Allen was nervous, and Clara seemed to be the only one actually having a good time, which pissed you off even more. Why was she of all people here. You didn\u2019t trust her, and you didn\u2019t want her here. Clara in your eyes was a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. You turn your gaze to Allen, who is staring at you with a worried look. Allen had a lot of questions, even more questions today. Allen couldn\u2019t help but wonder who was this women, and why, why did she make you so irritated. You knew that Allen deserved answers, to bad the answers that he was looking for, you weren\u2019t ready to give, especially when it came to this person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHATS ENOUGH!\u201d You say with your thundering voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab Both of Clara\u2019s shoulder and push her to a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall amounts of dust fly throughout the air. You hold Clara against the Brick wall with so much force that cracks begin to appear, threatening to completely destroy the wall. You wanted answers and you wanted them now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen was pretty shocked, he never expected you to act this way, he was even more shocked with Clara, who was wearing a excited smile on her face, as the brick wall around her seemed to be breaking. Allen knew that any normal person would be dead from the amount of force you where using, so how was Clara perfectly fine, with no scratches on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo, you treat all the women like this, or am I just special.\u201d Clara says with a little giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to tell me what you are doing here Clara.\u201d You say seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara looks at you, her smile completely disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came to see you, that\u2019s all.\u201d Clara says with a sorrowful \ud83d\ude41 look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you, leave now.\u201d You demanded, pressing Clara further into the brick wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara looks you dead in the eye \ud83d\udc41 with anger, but soon that look of anger turns into a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what?\u201d Clara says with a laugh as she pushes you away with so much force that you go flying across the neighborhood street, and into the other brick wall that stood on the other side of the road, completely destroying it on impact, and barring you under a lot of rubble  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen couldn\u2019t believe his eyes, this women who ever she was couldn\u2019t be human. You where the most powerful person Allen knew, could their be someone just as strong? Allen wondered how no one noticed these two powerful being, but he soon got his answer as he looked around his surroundings. Every thing, every person had stopped moving. Time Was frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara with a smile on her face walks towards the now destroyed wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Will, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve lost your very special touch, I see you still care for these humans.\u201d Clara says, like she wasn\u2019t one her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue sky begins to darken as black clouds appear from nothing. The ground it self begins to rumble with a lot of power, it was as if the world was about to break apart. Lightning starts to pierce the darkened clouds, alerting everyone who saw it, that this fight was just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d You burst out of the rubble with a great shout as lightning surrounds your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look towards Clara, your eyes glowing dangerously white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are out of line Clara, I will no longer tolerate your foolishness.\u201d You say completely Enraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou with great speed appear in front of Clara, who in turn was not shocked by your actions or surprised by your inhuman speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh flash step, it\u2019s been awhile since I saw that.\u201d Clara says her smile growing larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw a punch \ud83e\udd1c at Clara, your fist completely shattering the sound barrier, creating a sonic boom that threatened to tear apart anything it touched. Clara expecting your attack throws a punch \ud83e\udd1b as well with the same amount of force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!!\u201d The air rages with fury, as a shock wave of unimaginable power spreads throughout the neighborhood, shattering windows and cracking the pure stone pavement. Even more Dust and small pieces of stone flew through the air, clouding peoples vision. Allen was completely blown away from the collision of the two powerful forces generated by both Will and Clara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust began to disappear Allen began to be able to see the result of the short battle. You and Clara where standing in the middle of a large crater that covered up most of the road. Both of your fists where connected, but. Something caught Allen\u2019s eye. Clara\u2019s fist was changed, transformed. Her right hand was covered in fur, and the right side of her jacket was completely destroyed. Clara smiled as she looked you right in the eyes. You no longer radiated that lightning aura, and your eyes where back to normal .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I guess you still haven\u2019t lost your touch.\u201d Clara says with a small laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Clara with eyes as sharp as knives, if this confrontation was going to result in a battle then so be it. You brought Your left fist \ud83d\udc4a up, ready to make your next attack, Clara was doing the same thing, you could tell she wanted this battle, well she was about to get her Wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Allen with nothing but determination stares at you, as if he was saying, in order to get to Clara you would have to go through him, which wasn\u2019t at all hard but still, you considered it a Pain. You slowly drop your fist, and in so doing, Clara follows suit. You both stair into each other\u2019s eyes, your will to battle still flaring like a wild fire \ud83d\udd25. You look at Clara\u2019s right hand, still transformed, covered in black fur, her right eye glowing bright red, her left completely normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve mastered your transformation.\u201d You say feeling even more frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your response Clara smiles with glee, this was all a game to her, and you hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo good of you to notice darling.\u201d Clara says with a girly voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at her, and she glares at you with that devilish grin, daring you to attack her once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan someone please explain what\u2019s going on please!\u201d Allen yells towards the heavens. Once again both you and Clara stare at Will with a little confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who\u2019s the kid?\u201d Clara asks pointing at Allen with her right hand, which had already transformed back to normal, the right side of her jacket was still destroyed though. Clara wore a bored expression as she stared at Allen like he wasn\u2019t worth her time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Allen. He\u2019s a friend.\u201d You say, feeling a little more calm, but still on guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. A friend huh?\u201d Clara says looking at Allen, with a little disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like your new Boy toy.\u201d Clara says walking up to Allen, completely towering over him with that same devilish smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara stood 5ft 3ins tall, while Allen was 5ft 4ins tall, so Clara was easily bigger than him. Height didn\u2019t matter to you, you being able to change your height as easily as a person changing their clothes, but you were naturally 6ft 4ins tall so Clara couldn\u2019t intimidate you, to bad you could say the same for Allen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara stood in front of Allen glaring down at him with her brown eyes, still wearing a grin on her face. You could tell that Allen was feeling a little uncomfortable. It was as if Clara was a predator, and Allen was her prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one doesn\u2019t look like much, honestly we\u2019re do you find these weaklings?\u201d Clara asks with nothing but a loud laugh, as she looks back at you with mocking eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Clara and soon your gaze shifts towards Allen, who was sweeting profusely, with your enhanced vision you could even see Allen shaking from the cold hand of fear. You had seen it a dozen times. You had caused it a dozen times. The look of absolute fear, that only a truly powerful being could instill in those weaker. Allen couldn\u2019t move, he couldn't speak, and he could hardly breath, all of this caused by nothing but Clara\u2019s overwhelming presences, a presence so strong, that even those who did not belong to the world of the supernatural could feel, and knew by instinct to fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell any friend of Will is a friend of mine.\u201d Clara says with a friendly smile, a smile designed to bring<br>\r\ncomfort to unsuspecting people, but You knew that, that smile was nothing but a False sense of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat enough, leave the boy alone.\u201d You say threateningly as you glare at Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in between Allen and Clara, hiding Allen behind you as if he were some frightened child, which he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Clara if you will not tell me the reason you are really here than so be it, but while you are in this town you will not cause any trouble.\u201d You demand as you look at Clara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara continues to stare at Allen who was now hiding behind you with a wide smile. You did not like that. Clara soon shifts her gaze back to you a her smile growing even wider until you could see her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Clara asks playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder echoes through the sky, making it evident to all that you didn\u2019t like that answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will not cause any trouble.\u201d You say once again with a dark tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara\u2019s smile soon disappears as she stares at seriously \ud83d\ude12. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine I won\u2019t cause any trouble... way to ruin a girls good time.\u201d Clara says turning away from your dark gaze, and soon faster than the human eye could track vanishes without a trace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara in your eyes was many things, but she wasn\u2019t a fool. Deep down she knew who was really superior when it came to power. She knew that you could wipe her off the face of the earth with nothing but a thought. She would not defy you, at least that is what you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and look at Allen, who was finally back to his old self. Allen stares at you with a face that told you Allen\u2019s mind was filled with unanswered questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I got to ask one question? Who the hell was that? Why are you so angry with her? Why did her arm transform? Why where you to fighting in the first place? How the hell did she send you of all people flying into a brick wall, and where the hell did she just go?!\u201d Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more than one question dude.\u201d You say a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok look before I answer any of your questions let me ask one of mine.\u201d You say snapping your fingers, returning time to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen looks at you curious as to what the question could be about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you believe in Werewolf\u2019s?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Authors notes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I hope you guys like the story so far, as you can all probably tell it looks like Will has a little hidden past. Please continue to read to find out more. Please also don\u2019t be afraid to add on if you want. Thanks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the Prophet. \ud83d\ude09 </span></div></div>",

You watch as parents and kids pass you bye and couldn\u2019t help but think about how peaceful it all seemed, but as your mind trailed all the way back to Clara, you could be nothing but unsettled. You could feel Allen\u2019s gaze fall on you, waiting for the answers you promised him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d You say still staring at the many families playing all around the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was?\u201d Allen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeeting Clara.\u201d You say, clenching your fists ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a mistake giving her, her powers.\u201d You say, anger evident in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute, you gave that women her powers?\u201d Allen asks shockingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you?\u201d You say turning your gaze to meet Allen\u2019s eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not the first person I granted a wish to.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if a large vail had been taken off of Allen\u2019s eyes, as many things had been made clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo her powers came from you?\u201d Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You respond<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen could tell that, that women deeply bothered you, apart of him wanted to stop asking you questions, but Allen had to many questions, and not enough answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you two even meet, why did you give her, her powers, and why do you hate her so much???\u201d Allen asks one question after the other forgetting to breath between sentences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man, slow down, slow down, just give me a minute to think please.\u201d You say putting both hands up to shoulder length, in a defensive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep breath as you prepare to tell your story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI met Clara when I was 9 years old.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI met her in a large deep forests \ud83c\udf33, a forest that was once called tempest because it always rained in that certain area.\u201d You say thinking back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen strokes his chin with his right hand, his visage evident that he was deep in thought about something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall any forests named that way.\u201d Allen says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think so, this forest no longer exists, it was cut down hundreds of years ago.\u201d You say with a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHundreds of years ago???? When did this all take place?\u201d Allen asks completely shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh about a thousand years ago give or take a few centuries.\u201d You say, as if it was completely normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard, how could anyone live that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so are you telling me you time traveled?\u201d Allen asks with wide opened eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh seeing Allen\u2019s expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack in the old days I would travel all throughout the time stream, looking for something to do.\u201d You say your smile becoming even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime May be a all powerful concept to You Allen, but to me it is something that can be bent, controlled, and even broken.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen thinks back to the battle between Will and Clara. Will had stopped time all around the neighborhood, after the battle Will then reset time back to the way it was, and he did it so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClara at the time was also 9 years old as well.\u201d You continued your story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I met her, she was on the run.\u201d You say with a series tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the run? From who?\u201d Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClara belonged to the Arnulf Clan.\u201d You say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was actually the daughter of the head chief.\u201d You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Alnulf Clan had many enemies, and Clara was constantly a target of the other rival tribes and clans.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I first met her she was running from one of those clans.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go quite for a few minutes thinking about the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saved her.... and with a great amount of pity granted her a wish.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did she wish for?\u201d Allen asks almost holding his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe asked for power, the power to protect her clan.\u201d You say with sorrow in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy a werewolf?\u201d Allen asks with curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClara\u2019s clans name Alnulf, means wolf \ud83d\udc3a. So I believed that it would be fitting for her.\u201d You say getting up from off the wooden bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Allen walk throughout the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why do you seem to hate her, if your the one who gave her, her powers then.\u201d Allen asks looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop walking as a powerful shudder runs up your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause..... she did something unforgivable.\u201d You say in a threatening tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW, what?\u201d Allen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into Allen\u2019s face, your whole body radiating anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust drop it.\u201d You say in a low but threatening voice, before you walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Allen I got practice to get to, see you later.\u201d You say as you walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen watch\u2019s as you walk down the sidewalk. Sweat was falling down his face as he watched you disappear into the crowd of people walking down the sidewalk. Allen knew deep down that he had dogged a bullet, but Allen still couldn\u2019t help but wonder what did Clara do which was so unforgivable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello boy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen turns around upon hearing a familiar voice. Standing right behind him was Clara herself, smiling a  mischievous smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clara had both of her hands in her black leather jacket, and her blue eyes reminded you of a predator that had found the perfect chew toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, it looks like William left his little boy Toy all alone.\u201d Clara said taking a few steps forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen wanted to run away but it didn\u2019t matter how much he tried, his body wouldn\u2019t move an inch. It was almost as if his body was covered in cold ice, ice that kept on getting thicker and thicker with each passing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if Will is done with you, I\u2019ll take you for myself.\u201d Clara said getting so close to Allen that her breasts where right in his face and he could also smell her perfume, which smelled almost like flowers \ud83c\udf3a. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was your name again?\u201d Clara said pushing Allen\u2019s chin up with her finger, so that she could get a better look at Allen\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM, my n,n, name is , Allen.\u201d Allen struggles to say as he looked in Clara\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Allen, tell me what is so special about you, huh?\u201d Clara says walking a few steps away from Allen, which made Allen more comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW, what do you mean?\u201d Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what I mean is, what makes you so important to William, what does a mortal like you have to offer to a god?\u201d Clara asks turning around meeting Allen\u2019s gaze once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Allen looks down at the ground, thinking about Clara\u2019s question and how he should answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I honestly don\u2019t know how to answer that question.\u201d Allen says looking at Clara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I have to offer to someone like Will..... all I know is that when I first met him, he looked.... alone.\u201d Allen says thinking back to the first time he saw Will, when Will protected him from all of those bullies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara stares at Allen with shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlone?\u201d Clara asks as if she didn\u2019t what the word meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY, Yea alone.\u201d Allen says rubbing his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara no longer smiled at Allen, nor did she wear the same smug look she whore the first time Allen saw her. Clara looked at Allen as if he was a complicated puzzle that she was trying to figure out. Without a word Clara turns around and starts to walk down the stone road that went straight through the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen wanted to run away, he had control of his body once again so he knew it was the best time to escape, but as he watched Clara walk through the lush green park, he realized that this was the best time to relieve his curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClara wait up?\u201d Allen yells as he runs after Clara, and walks beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara turns and looks at Allen who seemed to be out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, do you really want to play with me mortal.\u201d Clara says with a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo i w, wantt answers.\u201d Allen say trying to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnswers huh?\u201d Clara asks curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would I have to answer mortal?\u201d Clara asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen didn\u2019t speak for a few minutes and as time passed he stopped walking all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill told me everything... he told me about your past, he told me about your wish.\u201d Allen says with more confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara said nothing, she did not move an inch and yet Allen could have sworn that he had saw her eyes glow red for a spit second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the cat is out of the bag huh, or should I say wolf.\u201d Clara jokingly said stepping closer to Allen, with the eyes of a killer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen didn\u2019t move, this time it was his choice to stay exactly where he was. Allen was afraid but if he was going to get answers he need to face his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you know my story?\u201d Clara says with a smile so wide that Allen could see her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think that you know the whole story but you don\u2019t, but don\u2019t worry let me show you.\u201d Clara says making Allen confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara moving so fast that Allen couldn\u2019t react in time, appears in front of Allen. Clara bends down so her and Allen\u2019s eyes where the same height level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook into my eyes.\u201d Clara says her eyes glowing bright blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo back and See what I remember.\u201d Clara voice echoes inside of Allen\u2019s head as his vision goes blurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl with light long brown hair, and fair beautiful white skin stands in the middle of a forest, a forest with tall trees that seemed to be never ending in size. The girl had light blue eyes and whore strange brown clothing decorated in feathers, and pictures of wolfs. The girl was also coved in mud and fresh bloody cuts and her whole body was sweaty, it was almost as if she had come back from a long deadly battle. The girl with tears in her eyes looks Towards a young boy floating in front of her. The boy whore a red shirt and Nicky black shorts, both of his feet where in black Sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will grant you one wish.\u201d The boys voice echoes through the whole forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you desire will be yours, all you have to do is ask.\u201d The boy says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl says nothing for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please give me power, a power strong enough to protect my family.\u201d The girl says with determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flash forward) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuts made of sturdy twigs and other such plant life, where now burning to the ground. Hundreds of Dead bodies littered the ground, as the whole forest burned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of this carnage, their was only one person left standing in the middle of the flames, on top of the dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I done.\u201d The girl says covered in the blood of friend and foe a like, red glowing eyes looking at her surroundings that where now on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so fast, and none of it made sense to Allen as Clara removed her hand from his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that, all of those images?\u201d Allen asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose where my memories of the long dead past.\u201d Clara says with a little giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the time I had met William, all the way to the time of my clans war.\u201d Clara says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill says you did something unforgivable.\u201d l Allen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara turns around not looking at Allen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnforgivable?

If you ever tired of it you could just change it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew how it had happened. At the moment your father's sperm entered your mother's ovum, a stray cosmic ray had altered something, and you'd been aware of your own existence. Almost immediately after you'd been aware that, in fact, it wasn't just your existence of which you were aware, but rather everything. From the moment of your conception you'd been omnipotent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew, for instance, that the cosmic ray had been no accident. You'd created yourself; in fact, you'd created the universe. And you were aware of other universes, infinitely many, all of which you'd created and could manipulate in any way with a mere thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as a clump of cells that had existed for only a few seconds it had been laughably easy to reach back in time and make sure the cosmic ray intersected your initial genetic material at the precise moment. You'd never found anything else to be any harder--which is to say, everything you'd ever done had been utterly, completely effortless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up you had never let anyone know about your abilities. Well, you had, but you had always erased their memories and reversed the changes, or changed the reality everyone else perceived to make it so that the change you had made was normal. For instance, when you were eight, you'd changed the classroom bully into a girl so that he could see what it was like, but the new girl was a genuinely better person, and so as far as everyone else knew, Karl Young had always been Carla Young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd also read and watched as much science fiction and fantasy as you could get your hands on. You enjoyed the stories, but even more you enjoyed simply appearing in them and messing around however you wanted. It was amazing how the appearance of a truly omnipotent being could change a story. Even in stories that had omnipotent beings you were still more powerful, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was special, though. Today was the first day of your last year of high school. You'd decided to go through school like a normal human child, though you didn't care to limit yourself. If there was one thing you loved about omnipotence more than other things, it was the omnipresence. As Amanda Brown you were a nerd, but you were also enrolled under various other names and were always in multiple bodies, or rather physically manifesting yourself in multiple forms in multiple places. You'd been on every school sports team since you got there, and on the cheerleading team. In that whole time the school had never lost an athletic competition. They'd never even come close to losing. Even the cheerleading team had won every competition it entered. Those other bodies were children of other parents, but they were all manifestations of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Amanda you were the school's academic star. And as Amanda, you had only two friends: Karen Carter and Ashley Durham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Ashley were nerds, same as you, and were it not for you, would have been the school's best students. You had taken them on some wild adventures before, but never allowed them to remember. Today you would reveal your omnipotence to them, and they would remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you had lockers near each other, and when you were all there, chatting, you nonchalantly froze time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" said Karen. \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like they're frozen somehow,\" said Ashley. \"This... this is incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so incredible when you're dealing with an omnipotent being,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm omnipotent. Always have been, always will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you never told us this before?\" asked Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have. But I also knew that you weren't ready to remember it. Now you are. There's really only one rule: you can't tell anyone else. But there's no need to remember the rule. You literally can't tell anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean, we can't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't. You're physically incapable of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You changed us to do this? You just used your powers on us without even asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. I just don't want people knowing my secret unless I want them to know. And I knew that if I hadn't done this, you would--eventually--have blabbed. It's just too big for anyone to sit on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" said Karen, \"but you should have trusted us. I mean, if we had told, you could have just changed things so that we hadn't, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could have, but I chose to forestall it. Anyway, you've got an omnipotent being as a friend, and for myself, I just want to have fun with my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of fun are we talking here, Amanda?\" asked Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any fun you want. It's not like anything I do is permanent. If we screw up somehow I can always change it back. Or we could deliberately mess things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'deliberately mess things up'?\" asked Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever wondered what a galaxy tastes like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really, but now that you mention it...\" Karen trailed off. You knew she had a secret dream of being a dominant giantess but that she'd never thought of being that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally I'd want to pull pranks on people, you know, make them nude at embarrassing moments, change their bodies in grotesque ways, stuff like that,\" said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that and so much more,\" you said. \"But I think the first thing we should do is have bodies that reflect our new status--I've only had this one since society expects that beautiful girls wouldn't be nerds like us. But now I'm going to make myself smoking hot, and I'm willing to do the same for you. I could even give you a number of different forms and let you switch between them as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Ashley looked at each other, shrugged, smiled, and started talking over each other.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Karen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you said we could have multiple forms if we wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Anything for the best friends an omnipotent goddess could want--well, except omnipotence yourselves. There are a few limits on my power--not many--and that's one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you maybe create a simulacrum of me? Just so we can all see the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" and a naked Karen popped into existence nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, I think you both know that I've dreamed of being a huge giantess, so I want to be able to make myself grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten miles? Is that too big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good starting point. All right, here's you at ten miles. You'll also be able to go anywhere in between.\" A city stretched out beneath the simulacrum. Karen's feet covered some of it and you could see the earliest signs of sexual arousal in your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also want to be able to enlarge my breasts and butt so that I can crush things with them.\" In turn you enlarged the breasts and butt of the simulacrum until Karen indicated that she was satisfied with their maximum size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are your maximums, but they'll scale with you proportionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'd like my hair to be able to reach the ground if I want, so I can swing it into buildings. Oh, and I want to be able to lengthen my tongue and lick up people from the ground.\" You applied the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you want as your normal form? This one at least has to be reasonably sized, but you can still have big proportions if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" said Karen. \"Maybe 7'6\", breasts out to here\"--she gestured a fair distance from her chest--\"and a butt to match, hair brushing its top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simulacrum changed to show this form for Karen, and she smiled in satisfaction. You turned to Ashley and prompted her to begin, creating a simulacrum of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got this multiple limbs fetish, and so I was hoping it wasn't too weird for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. To be honest I've had lots of fun giving myself an extra pair of arms sometimes, really helps out in certain situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I want to be able to give myself extra arms, maybe ten pairs\"--the simulacrum changed to show the extras--\"and more breasts, enough for the arms, and more legs, maybe eight, four in front, four in back? Oh, and two extra heads. I know a lot of people wouldn't like this but I just always have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simulacrum showed Ashley with all the changes she'd wanted. \"Okay,\" you said, \"like Karen, you can go anywhere in between. Also, both of you will get clothing to suit when you change. What body do you want for your usual form, Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have this other thing...\" You knew, of course, where she was going, but let her continue. \"I just really like seeing people who are completely identical, at least to my eye. I was kinda hoping you two would be willing to have us look like identical triplets normally, except I guess for the clothes, make-up, hairdo, jewelry... But our bodies should be the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were indifferent on the matter--it's not like anything you did was irreversible--but looked at Karen. \"What the hell,\" she said. \"It'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you morphed into tall, busty women. You decided that the three of you should have purple hair, something more to set you apart from everyone else. Of course, to everyone else, it was completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, Ashley, when Karen makes herself into a giantess, you're completely immune from anything she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm immortal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not until I'm sure you can handle immortality. And if you start doing really foolish things like throwing yourself off cliffs with no safety precautions... well, sorry, but I'm not making promises to bring you back to life in that case. Doesn't mean I won't, though, but don't count on it. And Karen, you can rampage as much as you want, but I'm probably not going to let it stick. And they certainly won't remember it, at least not after I fix it. Still, I might let it stay for a while. And I promise you'll remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou changed reality so that nobody would question how three nerd girls were instantaneously replaced by what appeared to be insanely sexy identical triplets--for now you all even had the same clothing, accessories and hairdos--and unfroze time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wanted to be here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey realized that they were in a World War I trench for real, and ran to man other emplacements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time you returned the class to their original time, which sadly included bringing a few of them back from the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" asked Karen, \"will they remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you replied, \"but they will have a better understanding of life in the trenches than almost anyone else alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class was pretty boring, but you had fun watching as the rest of the class was utterly oblivious to all the changes you made to the teacher. He ranged from being two feet to eight feet tall, wimp to musclebound, fresh out of college to near retirement, and as a woman he went from flat-chested nerd girl to stunning model. You restored him to his original body at the end of class, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you asked, \"what class do you want next?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily, you really don\u2019t have that far to go\u2026 Only three blocks. You\u2019ve known Andy for over eight years now, ever since you entered kindergarten. So here you are, at the beginning of the new school year and it\u2019s a Saturday morning. You get up and skate over to his house to see what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s usually awake by now, but you always end up giving him a call just to be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you\u2019re only a block away you stop and hop off the board. You take your iPhone out of your pocket and you dial his number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Eric\u2026\u201d you hear a sleepy voice reply over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill in bed, Andy? Dang, dude! I\u2019m a block away from your house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Uhh\u2026 Come over, dude\u2026 We\u2019ll skate around my street when you get here\u2026\u201d he explains. \u201cI just woke up in the middle of the night with a weird dream, that\u2019s all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re up late watching horror movies, dude! It\u2019s your own fault!\u201d you say to him. \u201cOkay, get dressed! I\u2019ll be there in two minutes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep sigh. But, you still like the guy like a brother. He\u2019s your best and only friend. You\u2019re a geek and a nerd and so is he, a little bit. Since you\u2019re both in middle school and enjoying life in the seventh grade, you help each other out all the time. You fight off thugs and bullies in school and you cheer each other on. You know one another\u2019s darkest secrets and you know all the likes and dislikes. Andy is the closest thing you got to having a real brother. You\u2019re both thirteen years old and you even have birthdays during the same month, only days apart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach the front door to his house, you hop off the board and tap the end so it flies up in the air, just high enough for you to grab the end with your hand. You turn the cap on your head back before you knock three times on the door. Andy\u2019s mother opens up and lets you in. She tells you that he had just gotten up and that he was just getting out of the shower. So, you walk into his bedroom where you expect to see his bed still a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re very surprised to see his sheets and blanket neatly made up and folded right by the end where the pillows are at the end of the bed. His shoes are polished and his laundry is clean and put away. All his school books are put away in the bookcase and his comic books are stored in his closet. His room actually looks very tidy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Eric!\u201d Andy said, as he walked out of the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was actually an inch shorter than you, with long light-brown hair and blue eyes. His hair was long and straight and it ran past his ears, covering them completely. He still wore braces, which would show every time Andy smiled, which was often. Andy was slender but average, like a skater. You waited patiently as he got his shorts, socks and t-shirt out of his dresser and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan! What took you so long? You knew I was coming! I come over every Saturday morning, dude!\u201d you grumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric\u2026 I fell asleep, dude! I work up like around five o\u2019clock or something after I had this really strange dream\u2026 I don\u2019t even remember all of it\u2026\u201d Andy explained to you as he put on his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you were being chased by zombies again, huh?\u201d you laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026 Not at all! I was in deep space\u2026 I met this beautiful woman\u2026 I think she was some kind of an angel or something\u2026 And she started talking to me about God\u2026\u201d Andy started telling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026 Come on, dude! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re sick and you\u2019re dying of some horrible disease, right?\u201d you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Andy smiles at you. \u201cNothing like that! Nothing at all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy sat down at the edge of his bed as he put on his tennis shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was something about some mighty entity looking to pass on Godly powers to me\u2026 And that I was going to be God from this point forward\u2026\u201d he said as he tied his laces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Well I don\u2019t see a halo above your head or wings behind your back, dude!\u201d you laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spending too much time in church! Now, hurry up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! I\u2019m done!\u201d Andy said, as he jumped up from the bed and grabbed his board. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow behind him, carrying your board as well. You walk outside as both of you hop on your boards as you skate down the sidewalk. After a slow, quiet minute of riding down the sidewalk of your street, you pass the ice cream truck! Suddenly, you become really thirsty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndy! Hey, Andy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a few quarters! Do you have any money?\u201d you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I got a Dollar!\u201d Andy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop off the board and walk up to the counter which is along the side of the truck, where the man is serving his customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will it be, you guys? The man asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have a scoop of chocolate on a cone?\u201d you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a scoop of vanilla on a cone, please!\u201d Andy says, handing him a Dollar bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the man hands Andy his ice cream cone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, son\u2026 I think I ran out of chocolate\u2026\u201d the man said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Are you sure you checked your freezer all the way?\u201d Andy said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ll check again, just to make you guys happy!\u201d the man replied. \u201cBut, I\u2019m pretty sure of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned around and raised the lid on the large freezer in the back corner. He rummaged around, moving small packages containing ice cream around, lifting and moving packages so he can reach all the way to the bottom of the freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t see a single pack of chocolate\u2026 OH! Wait a minute\u2026 Goodness!\u201d the man shouted. \u201cOhmygosh! You are sooooooo lucky!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned around, holding a pack of chocolate ice cream in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook what I found! The last one! Buried under all the other ones!\u201d he smiled as he pulled the lid off and started scooping up some ice cream on a cone for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! That will be one Dollar!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down in your pocket and pull out three dimes and two nickels and two pennies\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh crap\u2026\u201d you groan, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t have enough money to buy a stupid ice cream cone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 Check your other pocket\u2026\u201d Andy suggested to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never carry change in my left pocket, just in my right pocket!\u201d you explain. \u201cI\u2019m right-handed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Look anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grudgingly shove your hand into your left pocket, not expecting to find anything, when you feel something hard! Several hard things! You pull them out and realize you had two additional quarters in your hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! I got it!\u201d you cheer, counting a Dollar in change on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice cream vendor happily hands you the ice cream cone as you and Andy turn around and walk off, both of you carrying your boards in one hand and your ice cream cones in the other hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026 It must be my lucky day because I was sweating it for a brief moment\u2026\u201d you quietly say to Andy. \u201cFirst, it seemed like he didn\u2019t have the ice cream I wanted, and then it almost seemed like I didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for the ice cream in the first place! After all that! What a lucky break!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy just stared at you with a wide grin on his face, without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup\u2026 Today\u2019s your lucky day, Eric\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smirk as you look back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still think that dream you had this morning was totally weird\u2026 I mean\u2026 If you really were God then you could make really cool things happen, right?\u201d you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wanna go over there? The weather seems nice so far\u2026 Even though it\u2019s starting to get kinda cloudy!\u201d you respond, looking up to the cloudy sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u2026 We\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s not going to rain at the park. Don\u2019t worry! Follow me!\u201d Andy says confidently as he starts to skate straight towards the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. Listen here, Mister Weatherman! How do you know for sure that it\u2019s not gonna rain?\u201d you grin as you skate next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look! It\u2019s clearing up right now! We won\u2019t get any rain at the park! Trust me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you look up you see the dark clouds blowing over, the minute Andy said that. Pretty weird! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you skate over to the park and you hop off the skateboards as soon as you reach the grassy area. You walk over to the lake where the ducks swim and you hear a commotion off to the distance. You walk over to a small crowd forming by a tall tree where a cat got stuck on one of the branches, too scared to jump down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, kitty! Aww\u2026. Poor kitty is too scared to jump!\u201d someone stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone needs to climb that tree and grab that kitty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny tall guys around?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe branch that the cat was on was almost 14 feet above the ground. Nobody over 6 feet tall was standing among the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Alex walk up to the crowd. You feel sorry for the cat and you look at Alex, who was watching you the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really want to get the cat down from there, huh?\u201d he says quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, you\u2019re too short\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Darn it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing a giant is one of your secret fantasies, right?\u201d he whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Wait\u2026 How did you know?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be a big, tall, muscle guy, right, Eric?\u201d he adds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-yeah\u2026 I-I can\u2019t remember ever telling you that\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything, Eric.\u201d Alex says. \u201cI know everything about you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Say what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, go and rescue that poor cat from the tree, big guy!\u201d Alex whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and face the tree as you look up and see the cat on the branch, about 9 feet above you\u2026 But wait! Something strange is going on! You\u2019re overcome by an odd tingling sensation all over your body! You let out a gasp as you feel everything shift around you. As you look around, you\u2019re seeing something very strange happen. Everything, yes, absolutely everything and everyone around you appears to be shrinking rapidly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026.\u201d You moan softly as you suddenly realize you\u2019re GROWING! All of you! The people before you are shrinking, so are the buildings, the trees, the cars in the parking lot, the bushes\u2026 And the tall tree in front of you! Within moments, you\u2019re suddenly staring at the tree branch, just above your head, which you can easily reach now with your big, long, muscular arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, kitty, kitty!\u201d you laugh as you reach over with your long arms and you easily grab the poor, stranded cat with your very large hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor kitten seems like a lost, miniature animal while sitting in the palms of your hands as you carefully bring it down while you squat to the ground and release it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers before you as you stand up straight and then look down\u2026 You must look down because everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY else is smaller than you. Even the tallest person can barely reach your waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look for Alex, who reaches to about halfway up your big, thick quads. He just smiles as he cranes his neck, looking up to you. You then realize how your clothes have grown to fit your larger body. You guess you must be at least twelve feet tall by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel being a big, tall, 12-foot giant, Eric?\u201d Alex asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Well\u2026 It feels kinda\u2026 Amazing! I mean, I\u2019m so\u2026 BIG! Holy crap! Everybody else just seems so small! I\u2019m like twice as big as everybody else around here! This is very cool!\u201d you say to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Well, let\u2019s walk around the park, dude!\u201d Alex said as he strolled along the path which circled the large lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking around the lake, you stop and admire your reflection in the water. Alex sees that and he comes and stands next to you. That is when it hits you how truly BIG you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d Alex chuckles. \u201cI can tell how much you\u2019re enjoying being a giant!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Okay, so you used your God-powers to make me grow, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Are you gonna shrink me back to normal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna shrink me? You\u2019re gonna make me stay like this? This\u2026 BIG?\u201d you ask him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup. This IS normal from now on.\u201d Alex confirms. \u201cThis is your new reality.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. You stare at Alex. Then you remember. You\u2019ve always been a big guy. People have always known you to be a huge, towering giant. Nothing unusual about it. You\u2019re used to being bigger and taller than everybody else. This is no big deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky thing you were around to rescue the cat, Eric!\u201d Alex smiled. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s nice being twelve feet tall, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, yeah\u2026 it has advantages\u2026 Sometimes!\u201d you sigh as you hop on your super-giant skateboard while wearing your size 24 custom-made sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, let\u2019s go to my house!\u201d Alex says as you follow him to his place\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You soon find out that he or she somehow has the power of the divines, and is basically all-powerful, able to do anything he or she wants. How you live with (or live as) a child who can change the world  at their very whim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child can be male or female (or neither or both if you want to go that way), can be any age, and can have a variety of personalities, from a goodie-two-shoes, to a mischievous prankster, to an all-out evil, demonic force (or perhaps a mixture of the three). The child can be either friendly, antagonistic, or indifferent to the main character. Basically, go all out and do whatever you want. I don't plan on putting a stop to anything unless I feel it's getting way too out of hand. At least some of my chapters will probably end up with a macro twist to them, but feel free to put in any other fetishes or interests you may have (of course, I'll like it a lot if some of those end up as macro or macro-related! ^_^).
