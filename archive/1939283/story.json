Besides her short stature, Shiho stands out for her jet-black hair and strangly piercing green eyes, but it's always her height - or lack thereof - that gets noticed first of all, something that annoys her to no end. Surely if she were older, she'd be bigger, and she wouldn't have to deal with being so short anymore? One day, before going to bed, Shiho makes a wish - to be a grown-up, and to be big... no bigger! Big enough to look down on everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho's wish is, somehow, granted - and the little girl wakes up as a fully-grown adult. However, it soon becomes clear that her wish to be bigger has barely even started, as Shiho begins to grow, and grow, and grow, on and on and on...<br>\r\nShiho'd never dream of harming anyone, but her growing size may well mean that accidents might become unavoidable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, we have June. June is a happy-go-lucky and generally cheerful fairy, with naturally pink hair and bright blue eyes, and cyan-coloured wings, standing at about half a foot tall with breasts roughly equivalent to a human E-cup. June's a pretty powerful fairy, which explains her size, as the more powerful a fairy's magic the larger they are, but even her powers aren't enough to prevent her from being spotted one day while moving through a human's garden. Shortly thereafter, June discovers two things: firstly, that the reason fairies hide away from humans is that humans being aware of them somehow causes them to become more and more powerful - and of course, with more power comes more size, in a potentially never-ending loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, June discovers that she likes growing more than anything else on the planet - it's a good thing that her magic allows her to prevent anything from getting damaged or hurt, because it's likely that she'll do everything in her evergrowing power to keep on growing, bigger and bigger and bigger...</span></div></div>",

No fairy had been seen by a human in over a hundred years, and she didn't plan on being the one to accidentally reveal her existence - especially with all of the cameras that the humans had nowadays. Quietly taking in a breath, the six inch tall fairy shuffled about a tiny bit, her breasts and butt gently wobbling from the motion, swaying back and forth in time with June's movements as their owner, bent double, slowly crab-walked around the shrub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud, heavy footsteps on the grass met her ears, and June forced herself to suppress a measure of panic at the thought that she was about to be seen. If she could move around the shrub just quickly enough so that the human couldn't see her, then she'd be able to make her escape, and they'd be none the wiser! The footsteps steadily thumped around the shrub, and June heard a voice grunting in confusion as she crouched as low as she could go - to a fairy, it was a rather loud and deep voice, but to a human it was probably completely average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune's plan to escape, however, was disrupted, as a sudden, unexpected bolt of pleasure wracked her body, causing the little fairy to cry out. Dropping the wand that had until now been clutched in white-knuckled hands, June gritted her teeth and groaned, as the pleasure intensified for a brief moment, before evaporating in and instant. Her entire body felt energised, empowered - and, unbeknownst to her, it actually was, in addition to being about half an inch taller than usual, just enough for June to not immediately notice her expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat June did notice, however, was a shadow falling across her, as a small tingle of pleasure - far less intense than the previous sensation - worked its way throughout her body. Gulping, June slowled looked up - and up, and up, and up, gently clutching at a lock of pink hair as she looked up into the face of a human. The human was...</span></div></div>",

Anyone can feel free to run with it.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small high school senior sighed to herself as she made her way down the empty hallway, patting her hand against the nearby lockers. Molly was her name, a very kind girl despite her appearance of nothing but a solid black and bright orange gothic attire, her skin paler than pale yet glowing, with her hair dyed just as orange as her clothing. The girl was late for her gym class, but had a reasonable excuse: she had just returned from a doctor\u2019s visit to investigate an unusual affliction. Molly had been in puberty for nearly three years now, strange and emotional feelings that every teenager has regarding growing up swirling about in her mind constantly, but she was good at keeping quiet and meek with regards to when she would see noticeable results just like the rest of the girls at her high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth's heavy boots clacked against the tiled floor as she entered the girl\u2019s locker room, every head turning towards her as she made her way towards her locker in the very back, Molly able to sense the eyes of everyone in the locker room following her every movement. Every other girl in her class towered at least a head taller than her, but one girl in particular, the very bane of the school, Anna Graham, stepped forward with a sneer. Anna was known for being quite the bully, but none moreso than towards Molly. Anna stood at a large 6\u20193\" advantage over the smaller girl, Molly only coming up to her stomach in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Misfit Molly, how was that doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d the bully asked, poking the anti-goth goth in the head, making her stop in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow...How\u2019d you know about that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriends and know-how. You didn't answer my question: How\u2019d it go?\u201d Anna continued, shoving the smaller girl into the lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That\u2019s really none of your business, Anna,\u201d Molly quietly answered as she rubbed her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m makin\u2019 it my business,\u201d she laughed as she slammed her hand into the locker next to her. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not gonna say it again: How\u2019d it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctors said I have a weird condition-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d they say? You\u2019ve got Loseritis?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...They said I\u2019m...gonna go through a second puberty...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA second one? Ha! That\u2019s a good one, Misfit! You haven\u2019t even had the first one, so how can you hit the second?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have, but I just don\u2019t show off like you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Anna smirked as she pushed her into the locker once again. \u201cYou\u2019re mine today, Molly. I\u2019m gonna <b>destroy</b> you on the volleyball court today.

With no one else around to judge her, she silently began slipping off her clothes, revealing her petite and cute body clad in tight and form-fitting pair of bright orange bra and panties that complimented her hair perfectly. As Molly was about to change into her gym clothes, she felt a strange sensation pulse through her entire body, something she had never experienced before in her life; it was almost tingly in a sense, but also quite pleasurable, making her entire being feel warm. She closed her eyes and embraced this feeling, enjoying the moment. When she opened them again, her head was touching the ceiling of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened at the sudden change in vantage point, stumbling back into the lockers and knocking them all over. \u201cOh...Oh my!\u201d Molly exclaimed, trying to pick them back up, only for her expanding body to quickly fill the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?!</span></div></div>",

Anna smiled as she took her position on the side of the court furthest from the locker room, gazing over to the other side to look for Molly; she knew that she absolutely dominated this game with her great height advantage over everyone else, and Anna was only more than eager to spike the ball directly in the goth girl's several times on \"accident\" over the course of the match. <i>Where's the misfit?</i> Anna grinned, believing her scare tactics had frightened the smaller girl into ditching class. <i>Probably too afraid to come out.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the whistle could be blown for the match to begin, a massive foot as big as a person crashed through the locker room wall. The gathered girls fled upon sight of the massive sole, screaming into the exterior of the school\u2019s outer grounds, all except for Anna, who simply stared in awe at this soft foot that was as large as her. The coach ran off to the principal\u2019s office to seek help, but Anna was drawn to the foot, staring at it in curiosity. As she was about to touch it, the foot expanded once again, pushing her against it as the sole crashed against the bleachers at the other side of the gym, a thigh now visible through the decimated wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...What is this?!\u201d Anna exclaimed as she struggled against the pale foot that was now taller than her. <i>Wait a second...pale?!

As Anna stood out on the high school\u2019s lawn with the rest of the class, they could all hear something moving in the girl\u2019s locker room: something loud, something strong, something <i><b>big</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...\" Molly groaned, \"...I feel like I\u2019m gonna...\u201d </span></div></div>",

The young girl expanded right out of the school, her growing form quickly destroying what remained of it rather easily. Her long legs stretched out into the streets of town now, bulldozing over buildings and moving cars and people out of the way as if they were nothing. Molly felt another odd sensation course through her being as an added bit of weight became evident upon her chest, her breasts ballooning up to D-cups if she were of normal size; the same could be said for her already plush posterior, which continued to fill out even more. Luckily for her, the goth's orange undergarments held true until she eventually paused at a mile tall, the remains of the school and the evacuated students and staff gazing up at her from between her thighs, her body sprawled out across the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Grow.\u201d Molly completed her sentence from earlier, her voice now more powerful than ever, something she had never had before. She gazed down almost curiously and fearfully, spotting the remaining crowd far below her. \u201cOh no! The school! Nobody\u2019s hurt, are they?\u201d she asked cautiously, bending her head low to get a better look at all of them. The now much larger girl was awed at how tiny they were, mere ants in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s...the misfit?!\u201d Anna stuttered as she gazed up at the pale titaness, her surrounding thighs like impossibly huge mountains preventing them from escaping. \u201cNo...No way...\u201d The remaining survivors simply began to flee from the massive teen in complete panic, letting their fears of another rampant growth spurt get the best of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait, I\u2019m not gonna hurt anyone!\u201d Molly shouted, even though her promise was being ignored by the townspeople. \u201cBut I\u2019m...I\u2019m so big now...This can\u2019t be real...\u201d Gazing over at her left foot, the orange goth slowly lifted it up before gently moving it to a nearby block, planting her sole upon the ground and crushing dozens of buildings beneath her. \u201cIt...It <i>is</i> real...I\u2019m <b>huge</b>! I have so much power with just my foot now...I really have to be careful!\u201d Taking in her height, Molly soon realized how much she had annihilated just by growing, her rump alone sitting on several dozen blocks in complete comfort. \u201cNo! This is...too big...\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be taller, but this...I\u2019m as huge as those girls my bro always talks about!\" The mile-tall senior sighed for a moment, imagining her older sibling having a field day if he were to find out about what happened to her. \"Well, at least my underwear grew with me, so I guess it\u2019s not all that bad,\" Molly shook her head, attempting to look on the bright side of the present situation. \"I...just have to talk to someone about all this...This is all just too much...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As gently as she could, she lowered here finger to them. She waited patiently as the climbed onto her nail before bringing it to her eye.

Jack?\" She whispered, so as not to hurt their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's us!\" Vanessa shouted at the top of her lungs so her voice would carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you run?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And abandon our friend? Not by a long shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that and you were sitting on the nearest exit.\" Jack muttered before being smacked on the back of the head by Vanessa. The two had been talking in the hallway she'd began growing. Assuming it was an earthquake they ran for the emergency exit nearby. They turned the corner to find a wall of what they now knew was pale flesh, Molly's upper thigh, replacing the hallway. They then went to the front door to find everyone gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! That's so sweet!  I'd hug you guys but for obvious reasons words will have to do.\" Molly couldn't help but giggle at the thought of her tiny friends struggling against a hilariously one-sided group-hug. Maybe another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mol, you should probably get out of the town before anything bad, er, worse happens!\" Vanessa suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.

She tipped them into her palm before standing up. She brushed debris and flattened cars off her rear as she surveyed the damage. The various sports fields, the parking lot, as Jack had said, and many surrounding blocks were all replaced by a tush-shaped crater. She winced as she saw entire streets demolished by her legs. She was filled with guilt as she saw so much of her home crushed by her own hand or, more accurately, butt. Hopefully, everyone saw her growing and got out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly, with three ginger, tiptoeing strides walked to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the not-so-distant distance she could see hundreds of acres of open land. Perfect. No buildings to sit on. Nobody out there to squish. What to her was a brief stroll was in reality a few miles. She laid on her stomach down as gently as she could to avoid causing an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is much better.\" The orange-haired girl said as she set her friends down. Molly set her chin on her hands, which were flat on the ground. To Jack and Vanessa, her massive visage loomed above, peering down at them in an intimidating fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe how big I am!

Grown up was in more ways than one, she had stopped growing when she was 21 at 900 feet (275m) but she had continued filling out as she matured into a beautiful young woman. With long slender legs and her F cup breasts frequently emphasized in the tightest jeans and tight sweaters of the finest silk, her face was stunning with full pouty lips and long crisp blonde hair framing that very face, her skin was beautifully tanned, emphasized by the copious quantities of gold jewellery she wore, solid gold, when her sweater rose up her belly button ring contained enough gold for the reserves of several countries, her necklaces and pendants could demolish quite sturdy buildings, and several pairs of earrings often caused problems for aircraft as they glistened.. And she still loved her Louboutin boots, owning many pairs, as she stood hands on hips, rings and bracelets glistening, pausing in her stroll across the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short she looked a stunning sight as she smiled to herself. The world was hers as CEO of the most powerful corporation the world had known, she could make or break governments, other companies, anything she chose really, and boy did she take advantage of that fact. Her gorgeous pouty face belied a ruthlessness, a sense of superiority, which had developed from  her brattiness and tantrums of her teenage years, she was used to getting what she wanted. She had inherited her mother\u2019s looks and her father\u2019s business brain, yet with less of the inherent humanity that he had (though he had a weakness as far as his daughter was concerned and indulged her, maybe because she reminded him so much of his departed wife). She basically ruled the earth with an iron grip. Her rampages now were often for punishment (though occasionally she had a bit of fun when being playful, or drunk or both), immediate evacuations were finely tuned, though often there was not much notice given, and often were incomplete\u2026\u2026punishments for daring to compete, for insubordination, and she had no compunction about destroying everything associated with the perceived miscreants. Her wealth increased by the day as her influence continued to grow\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood there hair and jewellery glistening in the sun she took a deep breath of the clear air. She was on a short break walking through the mountains and was enjoying it. She had a small group of friends and confidantes, male and female, normal human size, looking after her interests when she was gone. She could be contacted but fear of the consequences kept her corporation in line under her friends/confidantes so she unlikely to be called. She was relaxed and smiley, but tell that to the mountain villages she had casually wiped out in passing, not really noticing, indeed as she looked down her boots were resting on the ruins of another one, and she shrugged her shoulders and walked on, creating deep boot prints as she did on softer parts of the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was peaceful but then as she walked round the next mountain\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And currently that 300 mile high girl was sitting in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean (Or as Jaz dubbed it the <i>Ant</i>lantic Ocean).  Her legs stretched partially out so that her feet could rest on the ground that was the American east coast. Depending on which way she moved herself her feet occupied any number of states. She seemed comfy with her a foot resting in both Virginia and Maryland respectively. Her feet pointed straight into the sky, standing higher than the tallest of mountains. A slight misstep or shuffle of either foot could easily crush multiple towns. That's why people were apprehensive about approaching them to do as the giantess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys! For me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only it were that easy. When she got comfortable Jaz asked multiple cities as casually as she could, \"Hey guys, can you come kiss my feet?\" She said it so abruptly and out of nowhere it was easy to think she was joking. Unfortunately Jasmine never joked about this. She was a delightful girl, a miraculously good kid, but man did she love having her ego stroked. When she started to change from a normal girl to a giantess it didn't take long before she first asked people to worship her. At the time she was fifty feet tall and it only took a couple people. Not it took hundreds just to barely cover the bottoms of her soles. She'd never crush anyone. They all knew that. It was just that one \"What if\" that kept people scared enough to do as she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long after the request for people to show up to worship Jaz as she asked. Driven by fear or a perverse lust a line of people began to form and appease the self-proclaimed Goddess. Somehow the girl always felt when they started and uttered a soft moan in response. \"I need some of you guys between my toes.\" She quickly declared. Carefully so as to not accidentally crush anyone the giant black girl sat up and randomly plucked up nearby people within reach. Many of them weren't even worshiping her. In fact they were specifically leaving the area to avoid it. Oh well. Now they all sat between Jaz's toes with no choice. They too had to start doing as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bugs.\" Jaz smirked. \"I always knew you guys liked my feet. It's okay, I like having my feet worshiped. So we all win.\" She leaned back into the ocean. Tides flooded in worldwide as the water struggled to keep the giant girl afloat. Mountain-sized strands of hair floated gently up to the surface of the water. It would be much too easy for a single strand to simply fall off naturally and crush some coast. Or for Jaz to accidentally float her way through an island. Or to accidentally roll over and crush a country beneath her stomach. The girl was a walking disaster waiting to happen. Somehow though such hadn't happened. Dominating as she was, Jaz was actually very considerate. She made sure her hair was properly cared for before heading out. She didn't let her body float no matter how tempting. And no matter how uncomfortable once she laid down she didn't flip over. Just to name a few things she did to assure people would be safe. In return she just asked for worship. All things considered, not a bad deal at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only issue was no one was ever safe from her demands. Jaz always got what she wanted. Everyone was just likely people were smart enough to give it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....\" The giantess hummed pleasurably, \"Now start licking.\" As instructed everyone switched from kissing to licking her feet. The girl giggled at the ticklish feeling. Her voice echoed across the planet, assuring everyone knew she was up to something. Concerned, people turned on TV's to check the news to make sure Jaz wasn't heading their way. Satellite images showed the girl, wearing nothing but a purple bikini combo, minding her own business in the ocean. Thankfully most people were safe...for now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That wasn't all the news showed. Today also marked the day of an important United Nations meeting in France. These meetings were fairly common but the topic of today was of note: what to do about Jaz. At least once a year world leaders came together to discuss the giantess and her effects on society. Really it was just a gathering to see if either any country had been harmed by her or if anyone had come close to isolating what caused her to grow and possibly cure it. Mercifully almost all these meetings never had to discuss the damages too much though more than a few leaders begrudgingly admitted having to worship her. The gatherings became more about assessing the progress of research. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the large room full of national icons a group of scientists were set to give their presentation. Silently everyone watched as the head scientist cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the past year we've made great strides in isolating what makes Jasmine so...unique.\" He clicked a button to move to the next slide. \"As you can see here this is a standard human DNA strand. After copious amounts of time researching Jasmine's DNA we've discovered it's fully human but at the same time...not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" England's Prime Minister queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a perfect example of DNA. No flaws whatsoever. But that simply doesn't make sense. A normal person doesn't simply become hundreds of miles tall. So we turned from genetics on to her cellular structure and there in we found something interesting. You see, despite Jasmine being fully human her body is completely superior to ours in virtually every way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\" Russia's leader chirped in a thick accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her height is one thing but I'm talking about from a human perspective. Jasmine is extraordinary. Our research shows she's capable of effortlessly lifting much more than her body mass would indicate. Her senses are superhuman. I'm sure as you are all aware she is still somehow capable of detecting humans despite long since becoming too large to logically do so. This is because her sight, hearing, and sense of touch have all been magnified somehow. Perhaps as an adaptation to her size but we cannot be certain. Further tests also demonstrate that she has significant endurance, much more than should be possible for someone who doesn't regularly exercise. Alongside this tests of her muscles and bones show they aren't merely healthy, they are extremely healthy. Healthy to a point it would be impossible for a regular human. Even if she were normal sized Jasmine would be one of the finest specimens of humanity to ever walk the Earth. We can't be certain but she may very well possess the keys to the next phase of our evolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing to a giant is evolution? Preposterous!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as much as you may think. You see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the scientist was trying to say got drowned out by the sound of the roof being ripped away. A gigantic finger effortlessly brushed away the ceiling revealing a set of mile-high teeth smiling down at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you guys are hard to find. It's almost like you're trying to hide.\" Jaz giggled. \"You can't have a meeting about me without...well...me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have slipped our minds Jasmine.\" The U.S. President nervously answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! Just keep going like I'm not even here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...Ahem, as I was saying. Jasmine is a fine specimen of a human. Perhaps the greatest we have ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something I don't know.\" Jaz chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist sighed, \"Further testing may be required but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys I can't hear you too well. I'm going to bring you in closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for response Jaz picked up the U.N. meeting place with a fingernail and brought if closer to her ear. \"Now repeat that please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he regained his footing the scientist nervous stuttered \"W-We may need to do further testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz groaned, \"<i>More</i> tests? Seriously? They always cut into my worship time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand Jaz but you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know...It's important to make sure everything's fine with me. I get that. But you guys take so much time doing it it gets so boring...Unless...you guys wanna keep me entertained.\" Everyone paled as they began to find mischief in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact.\" Jaz continued, \"I think I should remind you all who's in charge here.\" She poked her tongue out playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know who's in charge dear! No need for anything drastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I haven't been hearing Goddess anywhere from you guys. Besides I can't remember the last time I had the President lick my toe nails. Or the Prime Minister climb my finger. In fact, I can't remember the last time any of you bugs worshiped me.\" She smiled, \"We should fix that...Actually. Let's get all of Europe in on this. I think it's time Jazzy has herself some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hrhm...Let's see here...I got it!\" The giantess snapped her fingers. \"You guys are going to love this!\" Carefully Jaz plucked up a dozen more buildings from the ground and emptied the people into her palm. \"Wave bye to everyone for a minute, you guys are heading out for the day.\" She giggled. A handful of earth-rendering footsteps later Europe was a land on the horizon with nothing but ocean everywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight guys.\" She warned them. Everyone on her palm did help onto the cocoa brown ground beneath their feet as the giantess lowered herself into the ocean.  Water enveloped her body, submerging it miles beneath the surface. As impressive as that feat was in reality Jaz's body was barely submerged at all. The Atlantic Ocean was more than long enough to fit her, but it was barely deeper than a puddle. Still, it made for a nice cool relaxation spot to lay down in. Once she got comfy the girl finally opted to focus back to the people in her hand. Up close her eyes alone seemed to block their whole view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing like a day out in the water huh? Bet I can beat you guys in a race. I'll even give you a head start...and a few boats.\" Jaz laughed. \"Not really. I don't wanna accidentally crush you guys. How would I get my fun then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to us?\" A fearful man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz eyed the speck with an amused look. \"Don't sound so scared man. I won't bite...yet.\" Her teeth chomped once for a quick joke. \"Nah, if anything you guys are gonna be the ones using your mouths. Whilst the people exchanged worried looks they became aware of the ground beneath them moving once again. They traveled dozens of miles in mere seconds; the only landmarks they could use to tell how far they traveled was Jaz's own body. From the girl's youthful face past her arched, toned back just outside her underwear they were finally lowered. It was miles of brown all around with ocean in the distance mixed with more brown. The only other color was a layer of purple that stretched on for another few miles ahead. Just seeing the purple reminded everyone once again how small they were in comparison to the playful giantess. With a simple movement of her hand Jaz relocated all the people to the top of a butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love having my feet worked on but there's a reason they call this kind of thing ass kissing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaz's message couldn't have been clearer. With her watchful eye focused on them, the people she quickly took from the land soon fell to their knees and kissed the brown skin. Those who couldn't understand her English dialect saw and quickly followed suit. There wasn't any point in fighting it. Degrading one's self to Jasmine was just one of those things you had to live with. The dangers of not doing so were enough to make it seem worth it in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she felt the affectionate pecks Jaz laughed, \"Wow! You guys really did it. Since you like my butt so much you can just keep that up for a while. In fact-\" Jaz crawled back a few dozen miles and wiggled her overturned toes against the ground of mainland Europe. \"You guys put yourselves to work too! My toenails won't clean themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her feet starting to get worked on she went back to mocking the people on her rear. \"Wow...The President, Prime Minister, and all other kinds of nation leaders are kissing my ass. You guys are doing the world proud by worshiping me! Not like it's anything new for a politician right?\" No one broke their kisses to both replying. After a few more quick insults Jaz stretched and let herself get nice and comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep wasn't far off after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Jaz didn't remember her dreams. She didn't know what a lucid dream was or had any recollection or most of the ideas her brain spawned. What dreams she did remember she kept to herself, and with good reason. Jaz is a kind giantess, a benevolent self-proclaimed Goddess, but not a single day went by without its temptations. With the slightest movement she could crush anything, crush anyone. She could literally make the world do whatever she wanted and not a damn thing could be done about it. Of course life has its darker temptations and being a giant was no reprise from that. Jaz was a lot stronger than most people in that she didn't fall to these temptations. But in her dreams it was another story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rarely would remember them but without a doubt each night her mind was filled was visions of a much different, bolder version of herself. A version that had the courage to just do what she wanted and say screw everyone else. She didn't have to playfully ask for worship, it was a pleasure for people to please her. Anyone who had the nerve to try and not to would meet their end with a swift stomp to their home. Anytime Jaz opened her mouth it would be to mock the people worshiping her. Not the playful, kind-spirited insults she usually said, but much meaner, cruel, degrading things. She loved to playfully call people specks but this dream version constantly found new, lower lifeforms to compare them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn many ways this dream Jaz was just an evil giant. But it was still a little relieving to have these dreams. In reality the pressure was constantly on to avoid hurting even a single person. In her dream it was free game. For someone like Jasmine who never has this sort of freedom, nothing could beat it. A part of her always really got into her role as an evil Goddess. Something was really empowering about churches being built in her name or all lands and businesses renamed and made in her image. Even her dearest friends and family were just pests who made their living by licking beneath her toenails. Or maybe depending on the dream they'd be in her ears constantly praising her. Or perhaps scaling her nostrils or cleaning out her teeth. It all depended on the dream and mood she was in. She most likely wouldn't remember any of this in the morning so Jaz had to embrace it while it lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dream had her seated on the ground with her legs spread around countless people. What they needed to do didn't need to be said out loud. With a beckoning finger Jaz ordered the people to enter the valley between her legs and start pleasing her. Her body shuddered as specks by the hundred crawled inside to do their duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...Kiss harder.\" The sleeping giantess giggled. Fervently the people on her rear began to do just that.</span></div></div>",

It's time for the morning pledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue roughly forty students rose their seats and lazily began to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. From behind his desk the teacher sat comfortably watching in silence. Granted his hand still rested on his chest much like his students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...With liberty and justice for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you may all be seated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Jenkins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man held back a sigh. Every day it was the same thing with this girl. \"Yes Juni?\" He turned to the notable girl amidst his students. Notable because, unlike the rest of her class, Juni was a giantess. No one really knew why but Juni Sanders towered over all her fellow humans at a whopping 80 feet tall. Normally such a girl wouldn't be going through something as monotonous as school, but for some reason she was. Despite her size Juni took her academics very seriously. All things considered she was a model student. She got good grades. She did many extracurriculars. Heck, she was even the Class President. Granted no one was dumb enough <i>not</i> to vote for the girl who could crush them beneath her foot. Thankfully nothing like that had happened in quite some time. The only thing Juni's size ever brought about in school was the fact the class had to be held in the gymnasium. That aside, it seemed like Juni was an angel; but even so Mr. Jenkins dreaded every interaction with the girl. Why? Because she was mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't let her cute looks fool you. Juni's as crafty as they come. She had powerful over just about anyone and she knew it. But instead of flaunting it and trying to run everything she was smart about it. As Class President she had a natural level of authority over all students. As a result, anytime the girl found some students breaking the rules she made sure to punish them personally. And not a single person was ever bold enough to stop her. Not even teachers were safe. If they didn't act properly at all times Juni was certain to call them out on it, much like how she was probably about to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" The giantess crossed her ankles in feigned nervousness. She was seated in a 60-foot high desk behind everyone. There was no hiding her body language. \"I couldn't help but notice you didn't stand for the Pledge. I don't mean to tell you how to do your job or anything but...Next time could you please stand? It's in the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher smiled, \"Of course my dear.\" Mentally he groaned. It's in the rules. Juni's favorite phrase. If it was in the school rules it was something in her self-declared jurisdiction. Even if she went overboard it served as her safety net at all times. Ironically enough Juni broke the rules all the time. Right now in fact. Juni was at this very moment breaking dress code. The giantess was in class wearing a miniskirt that was barely past her butt and a tank-top that left very little of her breasts to the imagination. But did she get punished for it? Nope. Because she was a giant Juni had the convenient excuse of it being too hard to make clothes for someone of her stature. She doesn't have a choice. It'd be believable if everyone didn't already know those clothes were made to Juni's exact wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh well...It is what it is. Mr. Jenkins moved on with the lesson. Today he would be teaching the first chapter of Pre-Calculus. The class went by nice and smoothly with the only interruptions being Juni asking for clarification on this or that. Pretty soon the bell rang, signaling the next class...Normally. However once again, thanks to the gigantic asian girl seated before him, Mr. Jenkins had to do things a bit differently. Normally the bell would mean it's time for students to leave and head to the next room. In this case everyone had to stay in place and deal with the same teacher for the next subject. And the next one. So on and so forth until the day finally came to an end with naught but a lunch break in the middle of it all. It all played out like a normal day. It was now one and lunch would be starting in half an hour. Having finished his lesson early the teacher quickly seized the chance, \"Since I'm done early for this class please study amongst yourselves  until lunch. I'll be in the teacher's lounge if you all need me.\" Without missing a beat the teacher was out the door. He took any chance to be rid of Juni he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he did just leave a room full of students with an 80-foot tall teenage girl. What was the worst that could happen?</span></div></div>",

Under her ever-watchful eye what could've been a pleasant break turned into a fervent study session. Every once in a while someone would peek from behind their book and see the giantess staring at them until they went back to reading. You could cut the tension with a knife. At least lunch was casual. Students quickly got together in their social groups and ate among themselves while trading banter. Juni silently pulled out her lunch and got to eating. Every once in a while she'd chime in with a comment to a nearby conversation but for the most part she was quiet. It was the normal-est time that a day with the giantess ever got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell rang and people realized it was time for Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a normal class gym would just be most people lazily walking around or engaging in some kind of sport. In this class things worked a little differently. Gym class was a time where the streets cleared themselves. While most of the students would be doing the standard warm-up exercises Juni did her own modified version. Each gym class everyone was required to do three to five laps around the track, going somewhere between three-fourths to a little over a mile. There weren't any exceptions, not even for Juni. But of course a measly little track could barely hold her feet, let alone be something she could run on. Therefore it was a given that during this time Juni would run her laps through the town. If anyone was dumb enough to leave their car on the roads or be walking down the sidewalk during this time it was their own fault. This wouldn't be an issue as far as property damages were concerned. The main issue was with noise. Every step Juni made was a loud crash. Every word she said sounded like it came out of a megaphone. Every hair on her head weighed multiple pounds. Such a girl running laps around town created such a ruckus that it's impossible for anyone to get any work done. But what could they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class split off into genders and headed for their respective changing rooms, with Juni removing her clothes on the spot. Modesty was a foreign concept to this girl. She was big enough it was impossible to hide her body so she just didn't. She actually kind of liked the attention it gave her. Once her shirt came off every guy in the class stared at her in awe. Juni giggled as she shooed them away with a wave of her hand. \"You guys don't wanna be late.\" She smiled. Begrudgingly the teenage boys started to move on, fighting every hormone in their body that said to try and claim the giantess as their own. Once she was sure they were leaving Juni removed her skirt next and started to put on her change of clothes. It was nothing flashy, just the standard white tee-shirt and a pair of black shorts that stopped around the upper thigh. Once it was all on the girl put on her sneakers again and readied herself for another day of gym class. Minutes later everybody lined up before their teacher and awaited his instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four laps today. Go!\" Mr. Jenkins hurriedly waved them away. After multiples sighs the various students started jogging down the track. Meanwhile Juni did one last stretch before heading the opposite direction. Her leg easily cleared the school fences and the girl was in the town. Loud, piercing crashes rang in  everyone's ears for a square mile. The ground rumbled enough to knock several people off their feet. In the distance all could see the girl's head hidden between buildings as she jogged. Like clockwork every two minutes would consist of the booms of her steps growing softer and softer then louder and louder til the girl's giant white sneaker would stomp in front of the school and she started the next lap. After the first lap Juni started to mildly sweat. It was mere drops to her but a single drop could and did easily drench a person. The giantess shook her head once to rid herself of the pestering beads, raining down little flash floods on the unsuspecting world. One drop hit a window and broke it. Another smacked the top of a car and triggered the car alarm. Yet another landed right on top of someone who forgot it was time for the giantess to run. It knocked him to his feet where he quickly gagged as a mouthful of sweat filled his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat repeated six or seven times until Juni decided she did enough extra laps. Panting she returned to her class drenched in sweat. They were mainly in a field playing soccer, with everyone who chose not to walking slowly along the track. The asian girl seated herself next to the track and kicked off her shoes to air her feet out. \"Ahhhh~\" She sighed, glancing at the track. She didn't like seeing people just walking the track. Maybe she should do something.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For miles they lined up. People by the thousands all cramped together in a winding line eager for this chance. Echoing all across the planet rang out an enthusiastic female voice eagerly selling the attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one. Come all! Don't miss this once in a lifetime chance to enjoy the illustrious land of Max the giantess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this huge line was here for one thing. The giantess Max, the largest wonder of the world. A woman so massive even the biggest of cities were nothing before her almighty toes. A girl with a bosom so large and charge they dwarfed mountains easily. Long dark blue hair that made wading through the amazon mere childs play by comparison. Tattoos so grand and epic they were museums in and of themselves. That was the attraction known as Max. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared one day from out of nowhere, tall enough do destroy the world in less than an hour. No one knew where she came from, who she was or even what she was. There were no records of Max anywhere. People panicked, nations overreacted, weapons were fired, people were convinced it was the unequivocal end of the world. Every nation banded together to fight the apocalypse that came in the form of this woman. Yet none of it mattered. Bullets didn't go through, missiles did nothing, blades broke, even poison dissipated without doing anything. Nothing Earth could do so much as scratched Max. The world was at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she became an amusement park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the fervor died down and Max explained herself it was pretty clear she was only interested in was money. She started off doing things like help with construction but she quickly proved too big for that. The giantess soon found her calling though, as a living attraction. People paid top dollar to explore the massive beauty and for a nominal fee the perverts even got to worship her. As an added bonus this also kept the giant woman very clean as any and all dirt was cleaned away by fervent worshipers. All Max had to do was sit down and tan all day and the money would rake itself in. At first it was slow but now people came in from all across the world for the change to scale her toes or explore her bellybutton or slide down her cleavage. She got rich and was pampered all the while. It was the perfect deal for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday seemed moderately busy, a solid ten or twenty thousand people were stationed in lines all throughout her body. Laying down Max was easily over a hundred miles tall so the way it all worked was people would line up at the body part they would like to visit. Today seemed like a good day for her breasts and feet. Stationed all throughout were ticketer's who collected people's money and let them in. Fun fact: They aren't paid. Their reward is exclusive privilege to worship Max during off hours. In other words, they were perverts. It was more money though so what did she care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax rested her head on a set of massive clothes, her own of course, removed so her bare body could soak in the glorious sunlight. Since it was a kids park she still had on underwear unfortunately but that was about it. A chuckle escaped the woman's lips as she felt the first onsets of people began to set foot on her immense form. The giantess closed her eyes and focused. When she concentrated she could vaguely tell what people were doing. Of course almost all of it was walking. But more than a few shameless people were already licking her toes clean. Not to mention the bold men who paid to start the climb up her breast. If they made it to the nipple they got to win the grand prize of 100,000 dollars. Of course they had to pay a nominal fee to try. No one ever even came close to making it. One stubborn fellow almost did once, but funny enough just as he was starting to pass the middle point Max \"accidentally\" blew him off. His mangled body was promptly cleaned off of her of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all it was a good business day. Max smirked as she felt herself relax. Sleep almost came when a minuscule voice disrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...Miss Max?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, the giantess clicked her tongue. \"You know the rules...\" Carefully she rolled her head over to look at a puny employee by her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! <i>Mistress</i> Max. We just got done with the first ten thousands entrants and I came to deliver you the numbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...? Hurry it up you're interrupting my beauty sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well Mam...You see...\"</span></div></div>",

I fear he'll disrupt everyone's good time if we don't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sighed and rolled her eyes. \"I see you are all as worthless as ever. Honestly why do I even pay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With good reason it looks like! Bring the guy here. I'll deal with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee stopped in his tracks and turned around, \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please clear everyone off me.\" Max smiled, \"I want everyone to watch me deal with this pest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes Mam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took around twenty minutes but thankfully since the business day just started there weren't too many people to worry about. Everyone quickly evacuated Max and watched in curiosity as a lone, stout-looking man was escorted to the giantess. Rumors spread through the crowd. Rumors about how this man cheated Max out of money or refused to pay or, God forbid, demand a refund. Max was incredibly kind given how easily she could destroy the world, but money was the one thing you never messed with her on. Those who did...well this man would quickly remember what happens to them. To her credit though despite how annoyed she must've been to temporarily close so early in the day, Max looked very calm and courteous. She still laid on the ground though, so the man was brought before her face which easily dwarfed his puny frame by a mile or two. He was the only one past the \"safety line\" Max's workers set up miles and miles away from the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I hear you have a complaint you wish to talk to me about?\" Max whispered. Her voice went as low as it could be even that was enough to make everyone's ear hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man however, didn't seem to react. \"Yes. I'm here to demand a refund!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Sir, I do not give out refunds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horseshit and you know it! You have all this money, giving me back mine isn't that big of a deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a big deal?\" For a moment anger flashed in Max's eyes. \"Pray, tell me. Why do you want a refund so bad? Was my body not satisfactory enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Gotta give the guy credit, he had guts. \"I pay over a hundred dollars and all I get out of it is the chance to walk on your feet for an hour? If I wanted a walk I'd just go take a walk. I come to an amusement park to be amused!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you say that.\" Max sat upright and re-positioned herself so she sat on her knees. Her immense form cast a shadow for countless miles and totally blocked out the sky for the man bold enough to demand money from her. \"I think it's actually pretty amusing to see someone stand up to someone <i>millions</i> of times his size. Isn't that right, <i>little</i> man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now look here! Don't you try to intimidate me Missy! I am a paying customer and I deserve respect dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I agree.\" Max laughed, each word full to the brim with sarcasm. \"In fact, I should apologize. Here I am sitting down in the middle of our professional meeting. Give me a second.\" The man's jaw dropped as Max stood back up to her utterly massive full height. Her immense toes blocked everything for miles before the man, with her mountainous legs leading up to Max's curvaceous figure and finally her head, so far above no one on the entire planet could properly see it without a telescope. \"I'm sorry sir. That was very unprofessional of me. Now that we're standing as <i>equals</i>, perhaps we can come to some sort of agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile seeing Max stand up rendered him speechless for a moment, the man quickly found his voice and repeated his stubborn complaint. \"Just give me my money back dammit! Quit trying to scare me and give me what I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Max didn't hear a bit of it. \"Hmm...tell you what...Here's an idea. If exploring me isn't enough of a thrill for you I'm sure this'll do the trick for you.\" Max raised her big toe and loomed it over the man. \"I'm going to count to ten and put my toe on the ground. If you can get away in time I'll give you all the money I've earned today. If not, I get to keep all of <i>your </i>money. Is that a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Of course n-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's booming voice radiated through the planet, cutting off the foolish man before he could finish.\"Perfect! Then we have a deal.\" Below the man realized he'd been tricked and turned to run. \"One...\" Max chuckled, imagining the same sight she'd seen all too many times before. \"Two...\" The man would be running as fast as he could, maybe even doing really well. But covering less than a millimeter from her perspective. \"Three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man ran and ran with everything he could ever muster. \"I was in track in high school you bitch! Just watch, I'm going to get out of this and sue your ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground around the man darkened as a toe began its descent. Cursing he quickened his pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the crowds watched, not offering any sympathy for the man about to be crushed. It was a well known fact you didn't mess with Max's money, everyone who came here today understood that. Those who didn't all met the same fate. She offered him more than enough chances to back out. But he wouldn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" The man cursed yet again, utterly out of breath but still pushing on with all his might. He dared a look to the sky above. As far as his eye could see in every direction was toe. Toe for miles and miles. The logical part of his mind told him he was doomed but he pushed all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax held back a chuckle. This was always her favorite part of dealing with pests. Unfortunate for him too, today was rather hot. Who knew how sweaty her feet were?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!!!\" The man stopped his running and stared in awe as a lake fell from the sky. One solitary drop of water the size of a large building crashed a mile ahead of him, erupting into a tidal wave that knocked him off of his feet and pushed him back all the way to where he started. A salty taste in his mouth told him right away what it was: A bead of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's toe was almost at the ground. It was close enough one could reach up and touch it. \"Come on Mam be reasonable! We can talk about this right? You can keep the money, just let me go!\" No reply. \"Please! I'm begging you! Goddess Max please!\" Throwing all shame out the window the man stood up and attempted to appease the massive toe above him. His tongue desperately licked at the sweaty surface between his frantic submissive kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no restraint Max's toe smashed into the ground, creating a crater large enough to form a new lake, which did promptly exist once another couple beads of sweat dripped in. The man of course was totally eviscerated. All that remained of him was a small, human-sized pool of blood that desecrated the monolithic toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for contacting Customer Service.\" Max smiled, seating herself once again. She snapped her fingers, signaling a crew of her feet workers to do their job. Quickly they gathered and began licking away the filth from her toe. \"Someone contact that man's lawyer. I believe he has a verbal contract to oblige. Transfer all his funds to my account.\" A worker went right to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax looked back to the people who watched, \"Pardon that everyone. Give me a moment and I'll reopen for business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn ten minutes it was like nothing ever even happened. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the early-morning incident the day continued without any further problems. Not a single person seemed the slightest bit bothered that they and their children watched a man become a mere splatter on Max's toes. Quite the contrary in fact. Pictures, recordings and even limited edition merchandise became available for sale at the gift shops located safely away. Unsurprisingly, they sold out in minutes, allowing a select few to have a little something to remember the incident by. Stupid as he was, the foolish man ended up making Max a hefty profit. Such a shame he wasn't around to enjoy his ten seconds of fame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, like all amusement parks, closing time soon came as the sun began to set on another profitable day, the blue-haired bombshell sighing as she sensed the yellow star's rays to longer gracefully tanning her tattoo-laden skin as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closing time, everyone,\" Max whispered. \"Thanks for coming by today. Hope to see you all back here again tomorrow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA collective sigh escaped from the combined masses scattered across her 100 mile form, disappointed that the world's greatest theme park had once again shut down for the day. One by one they began to exit the giantess, scurrying along to their respective vehicles and heading home, after a trip to the gift shop of course. Max silently watched from the corner of her eye as the last of the specks of light began to vanish into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure that no one remained on her titanic body she sat up and stretched her arms, notable pops coming from each of them. \"Another day another few thousand dollars.\" She sighed. The end of the day always depressed her to some extent; it meant that for a little while she was not making any money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Max noticed a small man running towards her. Carefully she lowered her face to see and hear him. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just here to deliver the numbers for today's profits Mam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uninterested look Max had immediately vanished. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today went marvelously. On top of our regular entry fee profits of 520,000 dollars we also made a killing on the limited edition souvenir merchandise from the...incident this morning. Add that together with food sales and you made just over a million dollars in one day. Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled, \"Over a million hmm? Excellent...\" It just went to show how the world with Max went. She publicly crushed a man in front of thousands of people and not only received no punishment, but made an incredible profit off of it. Max couldn't help but chuckle at the thought. Maybe she should make a habit out of crushing people more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If I may Mam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you need all this money for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joy left Max's face. \"Do I need a reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No I just...\" The little worker realized he jumped into a topic he shouldn't have. \"I mean...you're the richest person in the world. A year after you established yourself as an attraction you made enough money that you could do anything you wanted. But here you are, years later, still doing your best to make as much money as you can...Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my decision whether or not I've made enough money, as well as what I do with that. Next time keep your curiosity to yourself before I end up having another limited edition souvenir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry Mam! I'll leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scurry along little bug.\" Max gently blew, sending the pest back several feet before getting back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scowl on her face Max grabbed her clothes and slid them on. First was a black, sleeveless tank-top cut so that it exposed all her cleavage. Next was a pair of high-rising jean shorts that barely held back her sizable rear. Once she was dressed she rose to her feet and stretched some more. After lying down all day her body was incredibly stiff, though it was nothing new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I remember right tomorrow's supposed to be over a hundred degrees? That'll probably get me real sweaty. Maybe I can run tomorrow as a water park and charge extra for people to slide down my body...Hmm...We'll have to wait and see.</i> Already her head was on business for tomorrow. There was no such thing as a break to the blue-haired Goddess. All day, every day it was about money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's not for another ten hours though.</i> Max frowned. <i>I slept most of the day too. Need to kill some time until morning...Hmm...that should do it...</i> A smile crept onto her face as she got the perfect idea for how to kill time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(This storyline was written in collaboration with Awesomex18, something we did a LONG time ago and I was just too lazy to look up and posts. Thanks mate.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman hummed cheerfully to herself as she sat upon an examination table within a sizable room, kicking her feet up and down in tune with her humming. She was Ellen Spiral, or mostly just \u2018Miss Spiral\u2019 to her friends. She was a beauty of a woman, long brown hair of curly locks flowing down her back, golden-tanned skin, bright green eyes that you could just gaze into, and a body to make people stare wherever she went.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, a divorce had struck her family, leaving her with custody of her children and a very bruised image of herself, so much that she had made frequent visits to \u2018Perfect Surgery\u2019, a new-age, highly-advanced medical center that specialized in making you the \u2018perfect you\u2019. With her visits, her skin had glowed more, her body gave a little more sway, and her already large and bouncy breasts perked and rounded a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long is it going to take for that doctor to finish up my examinations?\u201d She mused to herself, standing up and stretching. She wore a very simple attire of a matching set of a tight sports bra that clung to her chest and a pair of incredibly high-cut jogging shorts with matching sneakers. She was going to go for a quick run right after this, as she loved to remain in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skipped over to a wall of the room that contained various shelves with their own various items. Some were shiny, others sparkly, and some confused her with their shape and function. But one thing caught her eye in particular, a phial stowed away in the very back behind everything else. She reached for it and picked it up, raising it to her eye for examination. There was a label upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperimental DNA Activator . . . wonder what that means?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around to make sure no one was there, and her curiosity getting the best of her, Miss Spiral popped open the cork to the top of the phial, swishing it around and sniffing it. \u201cMmm! Smells like bubble gum!\u201d she smiled. \u201cI wonder what this does...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to wonder what the contents of the phial actually did, the woman heard footsteps from outside of the room, signaling that her doctor was quickly approaching. \u201cUh oh! Don\u2019t want the doctor to know I\u2019ve been looking at all his medicines, so I guess I\u2019ll just have to find out what it does!\u201d With a quick few gulps, Miss Spiral rapidly downed its entire contents, her entire body soon filled with a warm presence. \u201cMmm! That was really delicious!\u201d The door to the examination room soon began to wriggle, and Miss Spiral quickly threw the empty phial into the nearby trash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Ellen, we\u2019ve got the results of your recent tests,\u201d the doctor said as he walked in the room, tearing off a piece of paper from his clipboard and throwing it in the trash without looking, covering up the depleted phial from sight. \u201cOur tests show you\u2019re still in perfect form. No negative side effects have been noted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great news, doc!\u201d she giggled cheerfully. \u201cI look great and feel great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well, some of your other tests were quite interesting. Your DNA structure is quite unique. In fact, you have a strand of DNA in your genetic code that predisposes your body to growth in all its forms, hence why you\u2019re practically six feet tall with your, erm, proportions,\u201d he nervously explained. \u201cIt\u2019s why all of our work has shown amazing results with you. You could almost say you\u2019re the perfect candidate to become the \u2018perfect you\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what does that mean, doc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as it is now, your DNA will continue to enhance yourself just as it always has. I honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were six feet even by the time we next met. But for now, nothing major should occur. However, were we to act on that DNA directly, the results would, in theory, be astronomical. Of course, this is all mere hypothesis, but the mere notion that you possess \u2018godly\u2019 DNA is simply ludicrous. I\u2019m sure someone at the lab made a mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s some interesting info...\u201d she replied, her mind wondering if what she had just consumed would actually affect her DNA. \u201cSo I\u2019m all good to go then? \u2018Cause I wanna get a quick jog in before it gets dark out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re all set. We\u2019ll see you next week for your next installment of \u2018Perfect Surgery\u2019. See you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the doctor exited the room, Miss Spiral following soon after. As she stepped into the lobby, she began to stretch her entire body, the eyes of everyone in the room staring at the incredibly beautiful and curvaceous woman. \u201cNow for a nice, relaxing run!\u201d she cheered as she walked outside after her warm-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral stood on the sidewalk outside of the building, stretching and enjoying the warm sun overhead. She then began to run at a light pace, her body bobbing up and down with every step, eyes following her down the road. She giggled to herself, enjoying the attention, even though something seemed odd as she turned the corner. Near the beginning of her run, she seemed roughly six feet tall, but now, she appeared to grow, inch by inch with every step until she was easily seven feet, and the people walking by couldn\u2019t believe an amazon like this was jogging by with a hum.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had ambled over to the shelves containing his supplies before he noticed something strange. Everything was out of order, as if it had been moved. Nobody else had been in here this morning save for him and Ellen Spiral. At first, he thought she was simply curious and peeked at his equipment, until he paused in almost horror. The phial he had been working on, safe from view in the very back, was gone.<br>\r\nHe whipped out his cell phone hurriedly, dialing a number of a certain lovely patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral had just finished her run, approaching her home and bumping her head on the doorframe, rubbing her forehead. \u201cOuch! Wow, I really need a change of footwear. The support in these sneakers make me too tall.\u201d She noted to herself, entering. Her children were out and about on their own, either with friends or doing who knows what, but she trusted them. Just as she retrieved a bottle of water from the kitchen fridge, the telephone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpiral residence, Miss Spiral speaking.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEllen!\u201d The doctor tried to remain calm. \u201cDid you...go poking around in my supplies today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...you noticed. Sorry doc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, the supplies are fine, it\u2019s just that...did you happen to drink anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a phial?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeeeeeeessss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEllen...do you know what you might have done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...tasted some nice DNA stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEllen...your diagnostics said you had a dormant DNA pattern within you, nearly a one-in-a-trillion chance of happening. That serum awakened the DNA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what I told you earlier? That this had the potency to be astronomical?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Ellen Spiral, you might want to get used to the fact that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re...going to be a giantess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a big one at that. You\u2019ll grow in random intervals, some huge, some miniscule, all unpredictable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA giantess? Like in the movies? Me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I\u2019m sorry to give you this news so suddenly. This must be quite the stunning news, so I\u2019ll hang up and leave you with some time to think about this. Feel free to stop by the office again if you\u2019d like.\u201d With that, the doctor hung up the phone, sighing as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe...an incredibly big giantess...\u201d she paused for a moment before exclaiming, \u201cit\u2019s my dream come true! That place really does make people into their perfect selves! I just hope my clothes\u2019ll keep up with me, but I think I\u2019ll go barefoot just to be more comfy, or maybe I\u2019ll grab a quick pair of sandals. I can\u2019t wait to tell the kids! Oh, no, better yet, it\u2019ll be more fun to let them find out on their own that mommy\u2019s had a growth spurt!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral giggled in delight at her greatest dream coming to reality. She had always dreamed of growing to immense heights, towering over the entire planet as a living goddess. She knew deep down that for her, bigger was better, and that the bigger she became, the more fun she could have. Miss Spiral hoped that with this latest news, she would never stop growing, eventually becoming larger than all of space and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I better get used to being a giantess. I can\u2019t wait until I start getting really big!\u201d With a cheerful grin, she kicked off her shoes with glee, her smooth and sexy bare feet now resting on her kitchen floor as her toes wiggled with delight. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just cool down from my little run, then start preparing for my new life. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d Opening up the bottle of water in her hands, Miss Spiral sighed with delight as she sat on her couch in the living room, finding her legs stretching all the way to her television, to which she estimated herself as about eight feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked through the television channels, not so much paying attention to the screen as she was to herself. Slowly, ever so slowly, she was experiencing her first growth spurt, one that was long and drawn out, but potent. By the time a thirty-minute episode was over, she had reached nine feet in height, and apparently weight as well, the couch underneath her round and firm butt groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, might want to lay off the snacks for a little while.\u201d The mother chuckled to herself, leaning back against the wall behind the couch now, placing both bare feet beside the tv. There was a knock on the door before the knob turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mom, it\u2019s me,\u201d Lily Spiral, her youngest daughter called out, entering with her back facing towards her mother, carrying a load of shopping bags, which she was showing signs of struggling with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpent the day at the mall, found some cute clothes.\u201d She said, closing the door with her foot and turning around slowly. \u201cCould you help me with these baaaaaaaaGGGGGGS!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily nearly screamed at the sight of her amazonian mother who simply waved at her with a grin. \u201cHi darling! Of course I\u2019ll help you with those bags.\u201d Miss Spiral slowly stood up, having to stoop her head a little to keep from bumping the ceiling. She approached her tinier daughter who now barely reached her waist and took the bags from her with ease, carrying all of them in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you want me to put them? I don\u2019t think I can walk up the stairs anymore...\u201d She said as she grew right in front of her daughter, expanding much more quickly now to twelve feet tall, forcing her to bend low. Her growth was exponentially increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! W-What\u2019s happening to you?!\u201d Lily stuttered in shock. \u201cY-You\u2019re...You\u2019re huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuge? Me? Oh, not yet sweetie, but maybe in a few hours,\u201d her mother smiled warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just grow?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I\u2019ve got bitten by the growth bug!\u201d she giggled. \u201cThere\u2019s no cure, so I\u2019m going to be growing a whole lot bigger! It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always dreamed of!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of her children knew of their mother\u2019s dream to grow beyond human comprehension, and they always simply dismissed the idea by complimenting her on her already naturally tall stature and her incredible beauty. Never in their wildest dreams did they believe it could happen, but here she was, over a story tall and growing, the massive Miss Spiral making her dream come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, we have to get you out of here quickly!\u201d her daughter yelled, more concerned over protecting the TV lest she miss a new episode of her favorite show later in the evening. \u201cHere, put the bags over in the kitchen and I\u2019ll help you get out the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, my little angel! Mommy\u2019s so blessed to have such thoughtful kids like you!\u201d Miss Spiral hummed to herself as she bent down lower to fit inside the kitchen, placing the bags on the kitchen table. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see if we can get outside!\u201d Making her way to the living room entrance, she slowly dropped to her knees, the floor creaking under her apparently increased weight. \u201cThis\u2019ll be a tight fit...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, let me get outside first,\u201d Lily said as she ran out the door, getting in position. \u201cOK Mom, let\u2019s do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral began to exit her home, easily pushing her head through the door, though finding it near impossible to move her ample F-cup chest past the doorframe, each breast pressing against her tight-fitting sports bra and the frame at the same time, putting up quite the struggle. \u201cUm, little help sweetie?\u201d she smiled as her daughter sighed and began to pull her mother\u2019s bust through, filled with embarrassment at the task. After a great two minute struggle, her bust was freed, along with her arms. However, just as she was about to free her waist, a quick surge of growth forced her to sixteen feet tall, her feet pushing back to the edge of the living room as her ample butt now overflowed the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoopsies! I think I\u2019m stuck!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom....\u201d Lily sighed, rubbing her temples in annoyance. Even with her mother being a giantess, she found her relentlessly cheery attitude annoying. The small daughter approached the doorframe and pushed and pulled, but it appeared her mother was much too large for her to even budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use, Mom, your butt\u2019s too big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,well, we could just wait until I outgrow the entire house.\u201d Miss Spiral giggled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it so many times on television, it\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d destroy our house?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh calm down honey. I\u2019m sure you can go live with your father while we sort out this whole \u2018house destroyed\u2019 and me being a giantess business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both waited as she slowly but surely grew from sixteen to eighteen feet, her body filling the doorway even more, making the paneling around it begin to crack, until eventually the giant mother could push her way through onto the lawn at twenty feet tall, making the entire front wall of the home collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, much better!\u201d Miss Spiral said, standing up to her full height and dusting herself off. Lily merely stared up in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so awestruck, baby? I\u2019m gonna get much, much bigger, so get used to looking up!\u201d She laughed as she felt another growth spurt coming on, this one in a surge of powerful waves that she knew would make her big...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lily quickly took several steps back as her mother\u2019s bare feet began to approach her, the unique smell they possessed becoming more and more noticeable with each burst of size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, I can\u2019t wait to see how my brother\u2019s gonna react...\u201d Lily gulped as Miss Spiral surged past the classic fifty foot height, still growing strong. As she continued to grow, she felt other aspects of her body beginning to increase: Her bust swelled another size, now a G-cup, her already bountiful rump plumped even further, making it even more pronounced and alluring, her skin became even more radiant as her eyes softened into a more heavenly green, and her legs became more toned and curvaceous while her feet perfected themselves even further. After another several more bursts, the massive woman reached 125 feet tall, her growth spurts seemingly ending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here comes the finale...\u201d she giggled as in one massive, audible spurt, she doubled in size, bringing her to an astounding 250 feet in length, her feet now covering both her lawn, the road in front of it, and her neighbor\u2019s yard across the street. The ground cracked beneath Miss Spiral\u2019s massive weight, her body much heavier than it should have been, possessing the gravity of a woman many times her size, yet another testament of the power of her dormant DNA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAh, now that was just what I needed! Thank you, Mr. Growth Bug!\u201d she joked, her laughter resounding throughout the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily stood between her mother\u2019s left big and index toes, barely able to see her face past her impressive bust, still in awe at the size upgrading she had just undergone. \u201cShe was right...She did just get a whole lot bigger!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral testily wiggled her toes, creating a seismic force that rocked some nearby houses and sent Lily straight onto her back to stare up at her towering mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, now where\u2019s my little girl?\u201d She looked down, eyes scanning the area around her feet until she spotted her tiny daughter right between her toes, nary inches tall to her. \u201cOh, there you are!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled as she reached down slowly with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cDon\u2019t move, honey. I\u2019ll be as gentle as possible, but I don\u2019t want to squish you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily found two huge fingers twice the length of a city bus pinching her on all sides, lifting her upwards into the air at an incredible rate until she stared into the eye of her mother, which was as big as her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness, aren\u2019t you the cutest thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Put me down!\u201d Lily struggled helplessly. \u201cYou know I\u2019m afraid of heights!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry dear, here.\u201d Complying to her daughter\u2019s wishes, the massive mom knelt back down and placed her child across the street from her, patting her atop the head with the pad of her index finger. \u201cNow, you be a good girl while momma\u2019s away! I have business in the city, like a giantess should!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled to herself as she stood up and stomped away towards the heart of their home, each step rocking the land with small booms. Lily only watched with mouth agape, and thirty minutes later, her older brother arrived, only to stand beside her, mouth open as well at the destroyed home and giant footprints covering a good portion of the block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...What happened?\u201d Michael Spiral asked in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom got big. Wrecked the house. Heading towards the city now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d He sighed and simply walked through the footprint towards the remains of their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake way, big girl coming through!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry about your car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGracious, my hips can barely make it through these narrow streets...\u201d Miss Spiral said to herself, forcing her way through the spaces between buildings, giving those on floors with windows a nice view. The main part of their fair home was a couple of tall buildings and only one true skyscraper. This was her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow having grown to nearly 325 feet tall, Miss Spiral sauntered towards the largest building in town, her feet now taking up most of the small streets as the ground cracked beneath her every step. The skyscraper was an impressive 812 feet high, though compared to the growing mother, it was now only more than twice her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is...\u201d she smiled as she placed her feet in front of the building, wiggling her toes playfully. Every day, Miss Spiral had dreamed of becoming larger than the skyscraper, passing by the massive structure on a daily basis. She had been to the building\u2019s roof several times in the past, taking in the view with pride and hoping one day to always see the world from that vantage point or higher. Now, with her newly unlocked DNA, she was going to make that dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s every giantess\u2019s duty to be the biggest thing around, so I better get to work!\u201d she cheered, waiting for her body to enlarge. It was only a few more seconds before another wave of growth spurts could be felt getting ready to rock her entire form, and Miss Spiral knew she would be in for another big upgrade. \u201cI wonder if I\u2019ll be big enough for it to fit between my toes...\u201d she giggled as the first spurt surged through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer size had amped itself accordingly to the spurts that came in waves within her, boosting her all the way up to five-hundred feet in a matter of seconds, the area around her giving way for her growing body, her massive and bare feet wiggling against buildings and concrete in their expansion. No sooner than another second later was she just as tall as the skyscraper, her eyes meeting the peak of it, only for her grinning face to surpass it as she continued to ascend higher and higher into the sky.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Television stations from around the area quickly scrambled their news vans, traffic helicopters, and cameras galore to tape the massive mother growing rapidly, now easily the largest thing the city had ever seen. Each channel quickly broke into their regularly scheduled programming to broadcast Miss Spiral\u2019s growth, everyone in the suburbs glued to their screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, bro, you might wanna see this...\u201d Lily said in monotone back at the remains of their home, resting atop the semi-broken couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2019s on TV...growing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me,\u201d he sighed as he slowly walked over to the television just as Miss Spiral\u2019s foot suddenly enlarged, wiping out a few small buildings beneath them. \u201cYep, that\u2019s her alright...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she looks like she\u2019s having fun. I just hope she doesn\u2019t interrupt  the season finale of The Cool Bunch tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I know I should be concerned about Mom, but TV comes first today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...just going to pinch myself and hope this is a dream...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t! Already tried it, bro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Miss Spiral had now reached over 2600 feet tall, now triple the size of the skyscraper, it now only reaching the top of her knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally enjoying the view from up here!\u201d Miss Spiral said to herself gleefully, holding her hands over her eyes and getting a scenic view over the entire town. Police squads had sealed off several blocks around the growing woman, dozens of men and women training their pistols on her towering form, and several helicopters of different newsfeeds buzzed around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed one and happily reached for it, plucking it out of the air easily. \u201cHello!\u201d She said, bringing the chopper up to her eye, the pilot, cameraman, and news reporter inside all panicking at the sight of a huge eyeball many times their size to stare at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you\u2019re getting my good side! I want the world to know that Miss Spiral\u2019s going only in one direction, up!\u201d She released the chopper and it steadily moved far away from her. By this time, she had reached 2800 feet tall, the skyscraper now slightly shorter than her shin now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly place she\u2019s going is down...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwat teams and military had arrived, one soldier arming a rocket launcher, aiming, and firing directly into her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, direct hit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwie!\u201d she pouted as the missile exploded against her ankle, the blast not damaging her flawless skin, but still causing the pain of a painful, sharp bee sting in comparison. \u201cI wonder what that was? I hope the military isn\u2019t firing on me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Firing on her?\u201d Lily sighed from home. \u201cYeah, sure, Mom never gets angry, but that\u2019s never a good thing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Miss Spiral stopped growing, only for her to suddenly double in height, exploding to over one mile in height, her feet annihilating several city blocks almost instantly as if her body was reacting to the missile\u2019s impact. \u201cWow, that was a big one!\u201d she giggled as her spurts continued at its former pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the people below, she now appeared as a living goddess, her sports bra-clad bust now like two enormous mountains in the sky, blocking out her face and casting a massive shadow. The simple wiggling of her toes caused most of the city to rumble in unison, her amplified weight a testament to how much power her simplest actions held. Now having viewed the substantial eruption of size, the SWAT teams and members of the military opened fire with whatever small and automatic weapons they possesses, a hail of bullets assaulting her feet and ankles. Though there was a literal rain of bullets pounding against her skin, Miss Spiral felt none of the resistance, just a simple tingling against her feet which she chalked up to her growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice up here!\u201d she hummed happily, the skyscraper now nearing her ankle in comparison. \u201cAnd to think that I\u2019m only going to get even bigger! This is just so lovely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFall back!\u201d The gathered military and law officials had to regroup, seeing as how both of her massive feet now stretched beyond the borders of the security threshold they had set up. Miss Spiral looked down just as they all scrambled away, looking like ants to her as they fled. \u201cWow, this world\u2019s just getting tinier and tinier, while I get huger and huger!\u201d<br>\r\nHer eyes fell upon the skyscraper that once towered over her, now with the roles reversed. \u201cCome here, you...\u201d Her gargantuan hand reached down from the sky, wrapping around the building easily. With the slightest of tugs, she ripped it right out of its foundation along with a chunk of the ground. It was raised high into the air to be placed in front of her grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just knew one day I\u2019d be able to pick this little ol\u2019 skyscraper up.\u201d She laughed, her voice shattering the windows in the skyscraper seeing as how it was within the vicinity of her mouth. \u201cI wonder what I should do with it?\u201d Miss Spiral mused the question as she reached nearly two miles tall. \u201cHmmm...Well, let\u2019s see, I\u2019ve already done some of my duties as a giantess, but I haven\u2019t had anything to eat since I left the doctor\u2019s office, so I think I\u2019ll have myself a skyscraper-sized snack! After all, big girls need to eat too to keep growing strong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter cameras were all trained on her mouth as she slowly brought the building to her awaiting lips, popping the large structure into her maw as if it was a piece of popcorn. With a slight chew, her teeth ripped through the building with ease, tearing apart its layers of forged steel like they were nothing. There were still some survivors left in the building, though they knew there was no chance of surviving; they were destined to become fuel for this massive babe who suddenly appeared out of nowhere and grew larger than humanly possible. With one quick gulp, the skyscraper was devoured, beginning its journey to the giant mother\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never thought the day would come when she actually did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither did I, but you know Mom,\u201d Lily shrugged. \u201cShe always ends up fulfilling her promises somehow. I just didn\u2019t think this one would actually happen! Now c\u2019mon and switch back to regular TV already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like this little town is getting too little for me.\u201d Miss Spiral noted as she gazed down past her now enormous H-cup breasts, her feet taking up a good portion of the area at three miles tall now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to do some relocating.\u201d She raised her foot high above, taking long and powerful strides across the landscape, each footstep booming and quake-inducing. The helicopters tried to keep up with her, but her much larger form granted her a speed advantage as she effortlessly walked across the area to a much more open land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, plenty of room for me to grow now.\u201d She said as she stopped in the middle of empty farmland, a valley in-between two mountains that rivaled her size. Strangely though, she didn\u2019t feel the urges of growth within her. Looked like her spurts had subsided for now, just as the sun began to sink over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a day! I was only six feet tall this morning, and look at me now, three miles with the possibility of getting bigger later!\u201d She clapped, creating a resounding boom that echoed across the land. \u201cThis has been the best day ever! I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019ll happen tomorrow! I hope that this is just the beginning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set in the background, Miss Spiral simply relaxed and enjoyed her size, carving out a section of the mountain for her to rest in using her gargantuan rear, it now having grown even larger than ever. Once that was done, she stretched out to her full length, her curvy legs taking up over a mile and a half of farmland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so wonderful. I can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m even bigger!\u201d she playfully smiled, content with her life. \u201cI wonder if my little angels saw mommy on TV today? Oh well, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re fine. I\u2019ll make sure to visit them again in a little bit. Better rest up for my first true day as a giantess! The Massive Miss Spiral is going to have so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral cuddled up between the mountains and clutched her arms beneath her bountiful chest before closing her eyes, resting up for the day ahead. It would be several hours before the helicopters caught up to the mammoth woman, though they dared not wake her for fear of the wrath of a three mile titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, Mom\u2019s on every channel!\u201d Lily grumbled as she flicked through the TV listings, an image of the sleeping woman no matter where she looked. \u201cI missed my show! Oh man! Oh well, they\u2019ll probably air it another time, when everyone\u2019s gotten used to her being big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019ll take a looooooooooooong time,\u201d her brother replied. \u201cI\u2019m not even used to it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am...well, sorta. By the way, did you notice Mom\u2019s getting hotter as she\u2019s growing? Her boobs were never that big before, and she\u2019s definitely even curvier than before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s gross for me to even think about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you shoulda noticed anyways,\u201d she stuck her tongue out. \u201cGuess we should head to bed. Mom-Watch \u201813 starts tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I get the feeling she\u2019s only getting started?\u201d he said as both of them sighed in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new day approached, the sun rising overhead to make way, Miss Spiral\u2019s eyes fluttered open briefly, only to take in a strange scene. Dozens of helicopters that acted like gnats flew overhead, a barricade set around her body with military personnel filling the valley that she had claimed as home for night. She had not experienced a growth spurt overnight, but given the random-factor of her DNA, it could happen at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good morning everyone!\u201d She giggled as she sat up, sending the tiny soldiers below scrambling to retrieve their firearms, unloading countless bullets upon her that simply bounced off her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTut, tut you little mean soldiers. All I did was grow and move out here safely, and you fire at me?\u201d She bent over until her large face was before them, took in a little breath, then puffed out, sending them and their vehicles flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should treat a lady with respect, not fire at her before she even has her morning breakfast. Speaking of breakfast...\u201d She looked around, noticing one part of the land she hadn\u2019t crushed yet, an entire field of crops. She reached over and dug it out of the ground in the palm of her hand, bringing it up to her mouth and chowing down upon it in zest. Once she was done, she patted her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, all done.\u201d She giggled. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready for another day of fun!\u201d Slowly getting up to her feet, Miss Spiral pulled herself out of her spot in the mountains, an imprint of her magnificent, plump butt now etched into its surface as she dusted off her shorts. \u201cWhat\u2019s a big girl like me to do today...\u201d she mused as she drummed her toes against the ground, sending shockwaves and quakes for miles. \u201cI think I\u2019ll work on my tan for a bit first, then maybe I\u2019ll visit another city. Actually, the view\u2019s so lovely from up here, I might just try to take a tour of the country!\u201d she giggled once again, her voice echoing for miles. \u201cNow to find the perfect spot...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up her right foot, Miss Spiral stomped off once again, each step leaving an imprint of her foot in the land while simultaneously triggering more quakes all around, countless helicopters fruitlessly trying to follow her, yet not able to keep up with her amazing speed yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the media had begun to discover more information on the titanic woman, dubbing her \u201cMassive Miss Spiral\u201d or simply \u201cMega Mom\u201d. Every channel was focused solely on \u201cMega Mom - Day 2\u201d, devoted to her every action, no matter how minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s still on every channel...\u201d Michael sighed as he finished a bowl of cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot surprising. Mom\u2019s pretty big, not to mention she\u2019s got a hotness factor that the networks can\u2019t resist,\u201d his younger sister agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be eating out again tonight. Thank goodness Mom had that \u2018When I get big...\u2019 jar with all that cash saved up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, who knew we\u2019d actually need to open that thing. Never knew she put so much money in there. She must\u2019ve been really prepared...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. Listen, if reporters show up here, let\u2019s just say we have no idea how this happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like how most of what Mom gets into? Gotcha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany miles away, Miss Spiral found yet another wide stretch of grassland, the sun shining down brightly on the meadowland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is perfect! I can\u2019t wait to get some well deserved relaxation. Being big is such a tough job,\u201d she laughed as she began to lay down on her stomach, stretching out to her full three mile length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the choppers recording her actions arrived, taping and live-feeding her simply suntanning to all networks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For those of you not in the loop, yesterday morning, Ellen Spiral, a stay-at-home mom of two, had been going to \u2018Perfect Surgery\u2019, a franchise that had been popping up all over the country with claims of being the best in the field of drastic changes to the human body, but no one could have predicted this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmployees at Perfect Surgery claim that Miss Spiral, or as she has been dubbed, \u2018Mega Mom\u2019, had taken a dangerously experimental drug that altered human physiology, activating a long-dormant gene within her DNA, granting her great size along with invulnerability. Hours later, she had become a towering titaness one would see in mythology, and no one can hardly believe this turn of events of this massive woman is taking. She appears to be slumbering now, tanning herself, like all beach beauties do. We\u2019ll try to head in and receive an exclusive interview with the Mega Mom, something our rivals in other networks are too scared to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter nodded at the pilot and he replied by diving towards Miss Spiral\u2019s head, landing the small helicopter within her ear. Diana along with her camerman stepped out onto the fleshy surface, earwax covering her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...excuse me, Mega Mom!\u201d She shouted at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm? Who\u2019s there?\u201d the beauty mused as she opened her eyes, getting up slightly to look around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Diana Allers of Action News here to interview you, if that\u2019s alright!\u201d she shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a newsperson? Sure, but just one condition: Just make sure to get my good side on camera, alright?\u201d she giggled as she lay back down comfortably. \u201cWhere are you anyways, hun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve flown into your ear for the time being. We hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, hun. Just make sure to be careful in there, alright? Wouldn\u2019t want you to get lost on big ol\u2019 me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure to do that. Tell us, Ellen...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please! Call me Miss Spiral!\u201d the titaness chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, yes, well then, Miss Spiral, also known as Mega Mom, can you tell us a little bit about why you started growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMega Mom? Is that what they\u2019re calling me? That\u2019s cute, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be \u2018Mega\u2019 for too much longer. Hopefully I\u2019ll be \u2018Momnipotent\u2019 sometime in the future!\u201d Both of the journalist gulped at the statement, wondering what she meant. \u201cBut to answer your question, I\u2019ve always wanted to be big, but not just regular old big, to be the biggest and still growing! When the doc told me about my unique dormant DNA that could make me big, I was so excited, and when I actually did start growing, I was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been! I hope I just keep getting even huger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you comment on any other changes your body has undergone? From our files, you look different than you did before, and you\u2019ve become immune to bullets through your growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s sorta nice to know I\u2019ve gotten stronger. Makes it easier to get a tan in peace!\u201d she joked. \u201cAs for the rest of me, it\u2019s only natural that the big get bigger, right hun? I absolutely love my body and my figure, especially since I\u2019m not pencil-skinny like most women in the world. I\u2019ve always embraced my curves, so I\u2019m proud to be the beautiful big woman I am today!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Spiral, during your first growth spurt, you destroyed your own home. Aren\u2019t you worried about your children?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrection, I only partly destroyed it, only one wall went down. As for Michael and Lily? They\u2019re bright kids, they\u2019ll be fine. Plus, their father will probably pick them up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very...nonchalant about this. Aren\u2019t you even worried about them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI raised them well, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...during your rampage later that afternoon,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would hardly call it a rampage honey! I wasn\u2019t even angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you destroyed several city blocks, offices, and the tallest structure within the county. Some people are even missing after your growth to two miles tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll show up soon!\u201d She giggled, her stomach rumbling ominously after finishing her sentence. \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me, Diana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, not at the time, Miss Spiral.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty then! Just fly on out...wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might wanna stick around! I feel another growth spurt coming on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Like I said yesterday, I\u2019m only going up and up and up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her giggling traveled across the land, Miss Spiral simply laid down and continued to tan as her body began to lengthen once more, this time in a continuous spurt rather than bursts of size. To her, it was as if she was slowly inching outwards, but in reality, she was growing at over two hundred feet per second, that rate beginning to pick up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-This is Diana Allers with A-Action News here!\u201d the reporter spoke nervously into the camera as the fleshy, waxy ground expanded underneath her. \u201cWe have breaking news here! I\u2019m...I\u2019m here inside Mega Mom where she\u2019s...she\u2019s apparently becoming even bigger! This reporter has to admit that this is an absolutely unique sight to witness up close like this, and once again, Action News will be first to report on Mega Mom\u2019s latest size! One can only imagine what the woman herself is feeling at this moment...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral hummed a sing-song tune as she playfully wiggled her toes, her frame now another mile longer as her soles crashed through an old, abandoned barn, not even feeling the impact. \u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling in the world than growing...\u201d she chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth exponentiated as the seconds passed, going from two-hundred feet a second to five hundred, then eventually an astounding thousand feet a second. Her growth continued on shortly afterwards, giving one last powerful surge to her size, topping her off at ten miles in height, filling up the plain in which she rested in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Diana Allers...and it appears Mega Mom has stopped growing for now. Her ear, which we are in, was like a moist cave when we landed, but now, it\u2019s like a massive abyss one could become lost in...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news crew gathered themselves and took off in the helicopter, flying away from the now ten-mile high mother who dominated the land with her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d She sighed to herself. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll get much bigger soon. I wanna be at least a hundred miles tall by the end of the day.\u201d She declared, her voice echoing for many miles and frightening all. \u201cSo you hear that, me? We\u2019ve got some growing to do!\u201d she added with another chuckle. \u201cNow, I think that\u2019s enough tanning for today. Time to go on a quick jog! Can\u2019t let my figure go to waste just \u2018cause I\u2019m just a tiny bit bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver so slowly, Miss Spiral gently lifted her body off the ground, the land quaking in unison as she slowly rose to her feet, her soles sinking into the land as she did so. Gazing out at the land before her at her current stature, she planned out a quick jogging route, making sure not to come by heavily populated areas unless absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey, Ms. Newslady, are you still around?\u201d she asked aloud to the dozens of copters circling about her thighs. \u201cJust wanna let you know I\u2019m going to be doing a quick bit of exercise, so feel free to report that too. If people suddenly feel earthquakes, they\u2019ll know I\u2019m coming near them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick bit of stretching out her body, Miss Spiral took off on her brisk jog with another happy sigh, her first step appearing more of a powerful stomp rather than a quick one. Headlines across the country suddenly read \u201cMega Mom takes jog. Take cover!\u201d as the shockwaves from a single footfall could be felt throughout the tri-state area due to her enhanced weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral began her light jog across the country, her ten-mile high form visible on the horizon and each footstep of her bare feet against earth created an impact that shook the land around her for miles and leaving behind a trail of mile-deep footprints and destruction. She was careful not to enter populated areas such as cities, but had trouble avoiding smaller towns that were harder for her to notice while running.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, after fifteen minutes of a solid run, she paused, having built up a light sweat. \u201cWhooh! That was good!\u201d She said, wiping some sweat beads from her forehead, sending them splashing to the ground and flooding most of the area. \u201cBut y\u2019know what, I don\u2019t feel tired...not at all. I feel like just like I did earlier...\u201d She mused. \u201cCan I not even get tired? And I\u2019m not that very hungry either...\u201d As she dawned upon the aspects of her activated genes, she felt a very familiar feeling beginning to well within her, releasing a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrowin\u2019 time! Was wonderin\u2019 when I\u2019d get bigger again! The view\u2019s great from up here, but this gal\u2019s only going up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral closed her eyes and planted her feet into the ground, her soles sinking deep into the planet\u2019s crust before the spurt began, this time a continuous expansion combined with bursts of size awaited the growing woman. Her feet bulldozed through hundreds of yards of forest by the second, her waist quickly piercing the cloud layer as she soon doubled her previous size. As her growth continued, she opened her eyes, just as her breasts began to enlarge once again, her now I-cup chest clad snugly in her sports bra just the way she liked it, making her feel even bigger than she already was, further emphasized by the fact that it was getting hard to see past her chest, though she didn\u2019t mind - she knew that all growth was good growth. As Miss Spiral started to reach thirty miles, her toes soon began to wiggle their way into a nearby town, overtaking whatever dared to challenge her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops! Gotta be careful down there, guys!\u201d she chuckled as she took a step backwards, shaking the entire state with her impact. \u201cA girl needs her room to grow, ya know! And I need plenty of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth continued on, her body undergoing even further changes: At thirty-three miles, her butt enlarged, her shorts now further bringing out her ample figure; at thirty-seven, her skin became more youthful as her green eyes practically glowed with radiance; at forty-three, her figure became even more curvy than ever, putting the curves of a circle to absolute shame; and at forty-seven, her feet softened as their heavenly smell became more powerful, her weight increasing faster than ever to give her more power with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you newspeople are gonna have to stop calling me Mega Mom now!\u201d she giggled, her laughter now the thunderous boom of a living goddess. Finally her growth ceased at fifty miles tall, leaving her at a truly colossal stature that towered the highest anything had ever been on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...I\u2019m not Momnipotent yet...but I\u2019m pretty big in all areas, so maybe \u2018The Living Goddess\u2019, \u2018Ultra Mom\u2019, or \u2018Super Sexy\u2019 is the correct terms.\u201d She said to herself. \u201cYou hear that, tiny newspeople?\u201d She called out, her voice heard not just by them but all the populace of the world. \u201cThose are the titles I liked to be called from now on!\u201d She giggled. \u201cThough, I\u2019m still just Miss Spiral to friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched a little before deciding what to do next. \u201cWell, now that I\u2019m this big, I\u2019m thinking of leaving America for a little. I can take a nice stroll across the ocean now without worry of sinking or even having to swim!\u201d Miss Spiral said aloud to herself. \u201cAfterwards, I can probably come back and see my babies. They\u2019ll wanna see how big their momma\u2019s gotten!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her schedule set for the rest of the day, the titanic woman stomped off the coastline of the US, looking around to where she could travel to. Meanwhile, the media was abuzz with this new data relating to the ever-growing woman. Several anti-Miss Spiral organizations had popped up overnight, and there was rumors of global war being threatened against the truly monumental woman that towered higher than the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see...maybe I\u2019ll go say hello to \u2018Big\u2019 Ben, though he\u2019ll be \u2018Little\u2019 Ben to me by now!\u201d she laughed at her own joke. \u201cOh, actually, I think I\u2019ll be setting a new world record: The first woman to ever walk across the Atlantic Ocean! Well, better get to work...This ocean won\u2019t cross itself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral gently dipped her right foot into the ocean, the cool water rushing over her bare feet as the tops of her foot still was uncovered. With a few more steps, she had reached the deepest parts of the English Channel, the water only now barely reaching her ankles, tidal waves forming with every one of her strides. \u201cThis is such a lovely little walk,\u201d she hummed as she took in the landscape of western Europe approaching in the far distance. \u201cI just hope I can do this again someday, but next time, with my feet completely dry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only the span of three minutes, the massive woman made landfall on the United Kingdom, accomplishing her world record that no one could ever dream of breaking. As she touched down, she gently shook the water from her feet, sending a rain of ocean water across several acres of land before plopping her foot back on terra firma, wiggling her mighty toes against the ground and causing seismic quakes on a new continent.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHello Europe! Don\u2019t mind me, just a big girl exploring the world!\u201d she called out, her voice traveling throughout the world. \u201cOh, and don\u2019t worry if I get even bigger while I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve still got lots of growing to do!\u201d Suddenly, she paused for a moment. \u201cWhoops! I forgot to bring my passport with me! Oh well, maybe you can just make an exception this once, right?\u201d she giggled with a playful wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending the military towards such a titanic woman would be fool-hardy and very costly, so Britain\u2019s troops were held off until further notice. \u201cNow, let\u2019s take a look see...\u201d Miss Spiral boomed, looking down towards the tiny city of London. \u201cHmm, everything is so tiny, I don\u2019t know if I can find it, oop, there it is!\u201d She said, finally spotting Big Ben amongst the buildings of the city, the structure not even comparable to the the bottom fraction of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me just get a look-see...\u201d She knelt down even more, casting a long shadow with her sky-filling form of tremendous curves, her hands coming down towards London. She couldn\u2019t help it as her fingers came closer to their target, they knocked over several other buildings beside Big Ben, plucking the clocktower right out of the earth. Giggling, she raised it to her eye for examination. \u201cMy, so teeny. And to think I thought this was big when I little...\u201d With a playful smile on her face, she pondered what to do with the ancient clocktower. \u201cHmmm...Well, I should probably put you back, buuuuuuuut...I think I\u2019ll just borrow you for just a teeny bit! I\u2019ll bring you back home as a little souvenir so my kids can just see how great mommy\u2019s adventure was today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe British officials were absolutely stunned at the stunning declaration, absolutely flabbergasted that an American would simply take something, just like they have during their entire history as a country. The thought of a military assault was now back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s see...I gotta find a nice place to keep you safe...Oh, I know!\u201d Using her left hand, she pulled open the top of her sports bra, and with the other, dropped the structure between her massive breasts, letting it snap against her skin once it was placed in position. \u201cAh, there we go! Nice n\u2019 comfy!\u201d Miss Spiral smiled as she gently patted her chest. \u201cThanks for letting me borrow this for a bit. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll bring it back before you even know its gone! Oh, actually, maybe I can help make London even better. How about my autograph right in the center of town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down low once again, Miss Spiral slowly lifted up her right foot, angling her big toe towards where the mighty edifice once stood, a large crater of rubble standing in its place. \u201cOK, hold still!\u201d Lowering her toe into the crater, she knocked over hundreds of other smaller buildings as she eventually touched the ground, her massive toe pressing miles deep into the planet with just the slightest presence due to her heaviness. \u201cWhoops! Gotta make way for a growing gal!\u201d she simply giggled as she pressed her toe firmly into the ground before pulling it up once again, a permanent imprint of her toe etched into the city as the smell of her feet now combined with the air supply. \u201cThere we go! Now London\u2019ll be known for my first big autograph!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw of a declaration of war upon the mother that stretched mightily into the sky. Military forces were sent out in full power; Jets, soldiers, tanks and watercrafts had one target: Miss Spiral. Of course, she was completely oblivious to this oncoming assault to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, y\u2019know, maybe I should collect tokens from around the world! I could make a little collection of souvenirs, only much better than any cheap model!\u201d She giggled at the thought, an entire collection of ancient architecture and grand buildings from around the planet in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she could take her first step towards her next target, tanks rolled through the streets with squadrons of soldiers, all firing away at Miss Spiral\u2019s landscape-dominating feet. The best they could do was focus on the closest toes, missiles, mortars, and bullets all ineffective against her invincible skin. Jets buzzed around her ankles at cloud level, bombarding them with the best of their weapons. Ships and subs in the ocean fired away upon her heels that were stationed closest to the shore, and even with all of their combined might, it could do nothing against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme just take a look at London before I head off! ...Wait, are those tiny explosions dotting along my skin? Oh, how cute, the little military is trying to hurt me!\u201d the massive mother chuckled, the shockwaves from her laughter alone causing a fleet of jets to quickly ground. \u201cGuess I\u2019ve finally gotten so big I can\u2019t be hurt! Well, guess this means I\u2019m gonna be bringing home lots of souvenirs with me! Feel free to keep attacking me, little military guys, but this big gal\u2019s got places to go and size to grow! Hmmm...Now where to go next...\u201d she pondered as she gazed out at the rest of Europe, stretched out like a map in front of her. \u201cLet\u2019s see, I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Paris, or the pyramids of Egypt to help Lily with her school project...or maybe I\u2019ll pay Dubai a quick visit and check how the biggest building in the world compares to lil\u2019 me! So many choices!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military brass were furious as everything they threw at the massive mother was completely ineffective. Were she to take a single step, she would accidentally decimate all forces sent to fight against her without even trying. They knew the only option left was a possible nuclear strike, though because the United States was an ally and she an American, the debate of bombing Miss Spiral began to rage on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know...I think I\u2019ll visit \u2018em all! Buuuuut...I think I\u2019ll save Dubai for last since I know I\u2019m gonna be doing some growin\u2019 before I get there. I can\u2019t wait until my toes are bigger than every little building on the planet!\u201d she cheerfully giggled as she began to pick her next stop on her world tour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think...little old Paris would be nice, since it\u2019s the closest. Farewell, United Kingdom! I\u2019m trading you for a much more romantic view...I so wish my husband would\u2019ve brought me here when we were together, but oh well, it\u2019s much better seeing it like this anyway!\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled, raising her right foot and utterly destroying every military unit that was near her and leaving most of England in a ruined state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...You\u2019ve been watching \u2018Mom Watch\u2019 for like, hours sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing on...even stations with scheduled shows are airing it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBummer.\u201d Michael said, shrugging and heading off to his room to play videogames. Their father had come and taken them to his home, grumbling about how their mother was a freak of nature and the doom of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily sighed as she switched from channel to channel, nothing on but an image of her own titanic mother. She didn\u2019t even need to watch the television to know what was going on, everytime her mother spoke, it echoed for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope this is over soon...Mom\u2019s really taking up all my favorite show times!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral only had to take a couple of steps and she was within the vicinity of France, her feet landing just outside of Paris, unknowingly devastating nearby countryside and villages. \u201cAh, such a lovely little city. Now, where\u2019s the Eiffel Tower? It\u2019s gonna need to join Big Ben soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entirety of the Parisian countryside rumbled in unison with Miss Spiral\u2019s drumming toes as she scanned over the seemingly tiny city stretched out before her. As the titaness loomed over the town, her chest blocking out the sun for part of the city, half of the population fled as fast as they could from the worldwide phenomenon making a stop in France, while the other half either stayed in their homes or went to view \u201cUltra Mom\u201d in person. In any case, the smell of her feet quickly wafted through Paris\u2019s many streets, making the famous city now officially another stop on her world tour. After scanning through the dense cloud layer around her ankles, Miss Spiral was finally able to discern a large, pointy metal structure towards the middle of her city, her estimation being that it was smaller than her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound ya! You can\u2019t hide from me, little tower!\u201d she smiled as she bent down low, causing a powerful wind to sweep through the area before gently placing her fingers around the metallic structure, ripping it from the ground along with patches of earth from the surrounding area. Bringing it fifty miles into the air, she slowly examined the legendary piece of art, her eyes reflecting off of the metal surface. \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely! It\u2019ll make a nice lil\u2019 add to my collection! Hope you don\u2019t mind me borrowing it for a while!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her free hand, her bra holding up her gargantuan mammaries was opened up once again, the captured monument deposited within the fleshy folds for safe keeping alongside its brother. She closed it with a reverberating snap that echoed across the planet, giggling while she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, y\u2019know what, little France?\u201d Miss Spiral asked as she gazed down towards the country beneath her feet. \u201cI do believe you\u2019re about to get littler to me! I feel another growth coming on! Oh DNA, you never let me down.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The casualty list has not been confirmed yet, but the toll is believed to be high. Just recently, she has made her way to Paris to capture the Eiffel Tower....wait folks, breaking news!

Your country feels so nice to grow on top of!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled as she felt herself suddenly surging up in size, zooming up several miles in a quick burst of height, her feet acting like living bulldozers and charging relentlessly into the \u2018City of Light\u2019. Dozens of blocks of buildings disappeared effortlessly beneath her soles, only causing the colossal woman to feel a sense of elation as she felt herself dominating and towering over more of the land below. As another few miles were added onto her frame, she could feel herself beautifying even further: Her breasts swelling against her tight sports bra, still snugly containing her bust, now reaching a J-cup and practically blocking out her sight were she to look below; her ample butt jutting out even further, allowing her to rest in magnificent comfort; her curves becoming more sultry than ever; her skin becoming positively radiant, almost now glowing in its perfection while her eyes glowed with an almost heavenly aura; and her feet softened and perfected even more than ever, her weight also dramatically increasing as well, evidenced by her soles beginning to sink into the planet by merely standing. Whatever her DNA strand was doing to her, one thing was certain: Miss Spiral was rapidly becoming a living goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness, I\u2019m getting so big now and I don\u2019t even need to breathe up here,\u201d she noted. \u201cLooks like my DNA\u2019s got me covered for everything! Now at least I can look forward to growing even more!\u201d With each five seconds that passed, more and more of Paris succumbed to her soles: Sixty-five miles, seventy, eighty, ninety, soon hitting a full one hundred and still growing strong. \u201cI just keep going up and up...and up!\u201d she giggled, her powerful laughter now heard all across the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to expand larger and larger, higher and higher, bigger and bigger, her giggling becoming a sonic roar that echoed throughout the corners of the globe, forcing people to hold their ears lest they go deaf. Eventually, her ascension halted for now, leaving the towering titaness at a colossal 150 miles tall, her feet covering a good portion of the the remnants of France.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy oh my, I\u2019ve gotten big! But there\u2019s plenty of room for growth later on!\u201d she said. \u201cNow, onwards with my world tour! I believe Egypt was next?\u201d With a wide grin upon her face, the curvaceous colossus turned around on her heels and taking nary half a dozen steps to cross the ocean, the sands of egypt before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiana Allers back with Day Two of Mom Watch. The meeting of world officials has been brief, coming to a conclusion almost immediately after the trial had begun. With two destroyed countries in her wake, countless lives lost, and no end in sight to her growth, the remaining nations of the world have declared war on Miss Spiral. Forces from all over will descend upon her as a target, employing both nuclear and unofficially announced weapons on her. May God help us all, or we\u2019ll be praying to a goddess instead...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! It\u2019s so sandy out here!\u201d Miss Spiral mused as her soles filled a large portion of the Sahara Desert, her toes rising much higher than the legendary pyramids of the country. With each minute movement of her body, massive sandstorms quickly picked up, causing an untold amount of chaos on the surface 150 miles below. Due to the recent conflict in Egypt, the military and rebel groups were already well-armed to join the world in their assault on the gargantuan foreigner, armed to the teeth with rockets, machine guns, aerial bombs, and various other weapons of destruction. Though they had heard rumors that the efforts of the British military did not even damage her - in fact, their attacks bounced off her invulnerable skin! - they refused to believe a being, and a woman no less, could possess invincibility. They knew that no matter how large she was, she was still human, and because of this, they were inspired by the legendary words of Arnold Schwarzenegger: \u2018If it bleeds, we can kill it\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s see where those itty bitty pyramids are,\u201d the mammoth mom said aloud as she bent down low, resting her hands on her knees as she searched through the cloud layer. As she did, Miss Spiral noticed her vision had improved dramatically, almost as if she could  zoom in on anything beneath her and view it from a lesser vantage point, allowing her to quickly find and identify her targets. \u201cFound ya! Looks like that DNA of mine gave me super-vision too. First growth, then super metabolism, and now super-vision...My genes never cease to amaze me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached down for the entirety of ground holding the pyramids, she noticed that a large group of people were around them as well, every last one of them armed with a weapon of some kind. The moment her massively monumental fingertips came into range, the war against Miss Spiral began in that region of the world. A hail of bullets, a storm of rockets, and a plethora of various other explosive killing devices flew towards the appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, not a very nice welcome I\u2019m receiving.\u201d Miss Spiral declared high above, chuckling at the efforts of the tiny people below. The bullets bounced harmlessly off and ricocheted right back at them, and the rockets launched only left a little ash on her fabulous skin. The rebels and military stationed were in awe, the thought true in their minds: If it bleeds, they could kill it, but Miss Spiral couldn\u2019t bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s over, you all better get out of the way! These little pyramids are joining my collection!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, the titaness\u2019s hands dug deep into the earth, shaking the land as she removed the ancient structures from the desert, holding them in her palm as she let the sand drain through her fingers and back onto the planet, causing massive sandstorms and burying those who attempted to attack her in the process. Once she had the objects she desired, Miss Spiral brought her hands once again up to her chest and pulled open her tight sports bra, dropping the man-made pyramids snugly between her breasts before letting it snap shut against her body, the reverberating sound heard across the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother few minutes, another little souvenir!\u201d she giggled high above. \u201cLily\u2019ll love seeing these things for her project! Now then, I think I\u2019ll visit the biggest building in the world in Dubai before heading home for the day. Hopefully tomorrow I\u2019ll be able to flatten Mount Everest with my toes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy hum, Miss Spiral turned around on her heels, creating yet another sandstorm before heading onto her next destination. The remaining Egyptian rebels fired off every last bit of ammo they had left, yet their attacks were just as futile as before. The American they had tried to take down was now a living goddess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The massively monumental mom continued her world tour, entirely ignoring, or was oblivious to, the attacks on her while she made her trip of a few steps to Dubai. Jets crashed into her while she made her strides, armies on ground with crushed underneath, and ships were sent away with her tidal-wave inducing feet. Eventually she arrived at the arabian country of the Emirates, Dubai below, and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, standing pitifully before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, there it is! Tallest building in the world, meet the tallest woman in the world!\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled with a mighty boom. The building stood at an impressive 2000+ feet tall, but compared to the huge mother, it wasn\u2019t even comparable to her height. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got quite the little collection already, but I think I\u2019ll have myself a little tasty treat instead. After all, big girls do need to eat big, even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll never need to eat again by tomorrow. Oh well, time to show why humans are better than buildings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful chuckle, Miss Spiral reached down and plucked the edifice  from the ground, tearing up half a city block along with it. The titaness was once again met with resistance as her fingertips touched the earth, but just as before, no made-man weapon could harm her in the slightest. Moving a strand of hair from her eyes with her other hand, she brought up the tallest structure in the world to her awaiting mouth, and without a warning, simply popped it inside and quickly swallowed, rubbing her stomach in delight shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, now that really hit the spot!\u201d she giggled. \u201cWell, now that that\u2019s over with, I think I\u2019ll head back to see my little angels. I can\u2019t wait to see the look on their faces when they see just how much mommy\u2019s grown! I think I\u2019ve definitely beat my goal of a hundred miles today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral turned on her heels, her massive footsteps enunciating on such a powerful defeat to several countries of the world and how seemingly unstoppable she was. Her strides returned to her America as she looked across the country, trying to locate her husband\u2019s home from on high, just outside her origin as a goddess, her hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is!\u201d She giggled to herself, her enhanced vision zooming in on the small home. She took only one step, slamming down both enormous bare feet near it, destroying the farmland and nearby towns so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, kids, I\u2019m hooooooome!\u201d She boomed from so high above the cloud layer. Michael and Lily both ran out, but were quickly shoved back inside by their father, who promptly stood at the door with a shotgun in his hand, quaking in his boots as he stared up at the towering woman that was once his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Go away, you o-overgrown freak!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019m glad Mom\u2019s divorced...\u201d Michael sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and why she won us too,\u201d his sister chimed in. \u201cShe really could use a boyfriend, though finding one who\u2019d like a woman of her size would be pretty impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, she\u2019s grown like 150 miles in two days. Nothing\u2019s impossible anymore, Lily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on out guys!\u201d Miss Spiral smiled. \u201cI want you to see just how huge I am up close! Oh, and go ahead and fire if you want; you won\u2019t hurt me one incy-wincy bit!\u201d The frightened male did as instructed and fired off a few rounds, though as foretold, the bullets simply bounced off harmlessly against her seemingly invincible skin. \u201cSee? Told ya! Oh, that reminds me - I\u2019ve got presents!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPresents?\u201d the siblings blinked as they walked outside, covering their noses to lessen the intensity of the powerful smell of her feet that pervaded the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Let me just find \u2018em first...\u201d Reaching into her sports bra, the gargantuan brunette began to lay out her collection of world monuments, placing them on areas where her feet had already made landfall so as not to destroy the planet any further, her increased mass alone causing her to slowly sink into the planet just by standing. \u201cThere we go! For my little historian, I got you the pyramids to help you out with your project for the end of the month. And for my big guy, I got you Big Ben. And to remind you both just how much mommy loves you, I brought the Eiffel Tower so you\u2019ll always know that if you ever need me, just look up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom took monuments from around the world and settled them here...\u201d Micheal said, holding his head, while Lily happily clapped her hands. \u201cYay, I have the pyramids now!\u201d She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet away from here, now!\u201d The father shouted up, reloading his shotgun. \u201cYou\u2019ve already crushed enough, so get away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral merely rolled her eyes, then they lit up. She could hear him now so far below. \u201cOoh, another little perk from my DNA! Advanced hearing!\u201d She chuckled to herself before bending low, eying her ex-husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you really going to do? Put that away before you hurt someone.\u201d She said, raising a toe and slamming it down, the quake making him drop the firearm. \u201cNow come \u2018ere, Momma wants to see you...\u201d Miss Spiral giggled, holding out a finger and leaning it towards the home. The sheer heat and oil on her skin, upon contact, made the man stick right to the pad of her finger, and when she did so, she tilted the house just back a little, making it creak. Once she was sure he was on her finger, she raised it up to her eye.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A \u2018Dunderheaded bimbo with more looks than anything else?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Not so loud, will ya!\u201d he complained. \u201cA-And y-yeah, I remember sayin\u2019 that. And I was totally right too. You\u2019re even more of a bimbo than ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral simply pouted in response, her endless cheerfulness not allowing her to become the slightest bit mad. \u201cWell, this \u2018bimbo\u2019 takes better care of the kids than you ever did. Now that I\u2019m large and in charge, I\u2019m standing up to you. Besides, you know this is my dream come true!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think it\u2019s goin\u2019 up there?\u201d Michael asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t talk. Pyramids...Mom awesomeness...Sooooooooo cool...\u201d she replied, hypnotized by the recently received gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really care at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, Mom knows what she\u2019s doing. Besides, she\u2019s always said \u2018A bigger Momma is a better Momma!\u2019, so there\u2019s nothing she can\u2019t mess up...Well, as long as she doesn\u2019t accidentally fall on the house or something, but she\u2019s not that clumsy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were a dumb freak when you were normal, and now you\u2019re just a giant monster freak!\u201d her ex replied. \u201cYou\u2019re still just the same dunderheaded Ellen I know, just freakishly big and crushing whatever gets in your way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shush now.\u201d She said sternly, giving her finger the slightest of shakes, making her divorced man extremely dizzy upon the pad of her index finger. \u201cYou better be a lot nicer to me now, mister, or you\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s coming to me is that you need to put me down now, you oversized freak of nature!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your tone...\u201d Miss Spiral warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate you now, and I hated you even before our divorce!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pushing it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd y\u2019know what, you overgrown bitch? You don\u2019t even deserve the kids! They\u2019re much better off without a freak o\u2019 nature as their mother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S IT!\u201d Miss Spiral roared, not even bothering to lower her voice. \u201cINSULTING ME IS ONE THING, BUT YOU NEVER DRAG MY CHILDREN INTO THIS!\u201d Not hesitating for a moment, she turned her finger over, letting him plummet from 150 miles above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Lily, I think Mom\u2019s mad...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, not mad, more like super offended. But yeah, he totally deserves it. Mom\u2019s nothing but nice to everyone, but there\u2019s certain things you don\u2019t say to her...especially if she\u2019s big enough to be called a living goddess by the media.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFIRST OFF, EVEN THOUGH I\u2019M BIG NOW, I\u2019M NOT OVERGROWN - I\u2019M UNDERGROWN!\u201d she boomed as she watched him fall, her shouting heard across the globe. \u201cIF YOU THINK I\u2019M BIG NOW, I\u2019M GONNA BE EVEN BIGGER TOMORROW! I\u2019M GONNA MAKE THIS SIZE LOOK TINY! SECOND, EVEN THOUGH I\u2019M BIG, I\u2019M STILL WAY MORE OF A PARENT THAN YOU\u2019LL EVER BE! THIRD, DON\u2019T YOU EVER, EVER DRAG MY ANGELS INTO THIS AGAIN! AND FINALLY, YOU DON\u2019T DESERVE A WOMAN LIKE ME, OR ANY WOMAN AT ALL! I\u2019M GLAD I\u2019M FINALLY RID OF YOU, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO BE WITH A BIG, SEXY GIRL LIKE ME!\u201d After watching him rapidly descend over 75 miles, Miss Spiral reached out her palm, catching him in her palm without injury. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m still me even though I\u2019m big,\u201d she sternly added as she glared at him. \u201cNow say you\u2019re sorry...NOW.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorryyyyy....\u201d He whispered, nearly on the verge of a heart attack and tears. Her hyper-hearing was more than enough to catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d She said, regaining her composure. She reached out her hand many miles, and deposited him in the middle of a forest. Once that was done, she looked down to the household, frowning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry you had to see that, kids. I know you babies don\u2019t like it when Mommy and Daddy fight.\u201d The mega mom said a little sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool Mom.\u201d Lily said dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Micheal added, though he was just a bit more shaken up, having to get used to the ringing in his ears from the sheer power of his massive mother\u2019s voice. He was pretty sure a couple people round the world had gone deaf too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou babies going to be okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d They both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Mommy\u2019s going to go to sleep now, and in the morning, hopefully I\u2019ll be bigger!\u201d She chuckled, her cheerful disposition already returned. She blew them a kiss farewell and stood up, stomping away to open ocean, the only place she could safely sleep without crushing anything other than the odd unmapped island. \u201cWell, this looks like a good spot to rest!\u201d she chuckled as she found a large, uninhabited island in the middle of the Atlantic, barely big enough to support her ample posterior. Miss Spiral slowly bent down, gently rubbing her shorts-clad butt into the landmass, grinding it into the planet until it was absolutely flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don\u2019t feel the least bit tired, but I can just stretch my legs for a bit. A growing woman needs to rest too! </i>she mentally giggled.<i> I had such a nice day today...Got some time to tan, broke a world record, and I even got some great presents for the kids. Not to mention I\u2019ve gone from 3 to 150 miles today...over fifty times my size! I couldn\u2019t\u2019ve wished for a better day, buuuutttt...Maybe tomorrow will be even better! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight everyone!\u201d she cheered to the planet. \u201cHope you all have a great night! Don\u2019t worry, I promise I\u2019ll hit a thousand miles by tomorrow! I actually might grow in my sleep tonight too!\u201d With another giggle, the mammoth mother closed her eyes, a smile on her face as she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is officially the end of Day Two of Mom Watch 2013, and with Miss Spiral now soundly asleep, the world can rest easy...for now. With her growth spurts bolting her over fifty times her previous height, Earth\u2019s leaders can only pray that Ultra Mom doesn\u2019t fulfill her latest promise. No one is certain whether the planet could handle a woman thousands of miles tall, but with her body shrugging off most of the world\u2019s weapons and her powers growing, people have been turning to her as a deity, while many other anti-Spiral groups have sprung up in just the past few hours. One thing is for certain, however: Before morning, Miss Spiral will be nuked. It was only a few minutes ago that world leaders-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bad,\u201d Michael said aloud as he watched the program on television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...The cameraman is a total pervert...\u201d Lily sighed as the camera suddenly shifted to an image of her massive breasts tightly held by her black sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-Ew! Not that! I meant the whole nuke thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooohhh...Yeah, that\u2019s pretty bad too. But hey, Mom did make my history project super easy now. Just wait until I bring in a piece of the pyramids to class tomorrow! Now if only they could air my shows instead of focusing on her so much...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seriously more concerned about TV than Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm...Honestly? Yes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like she can be hurt at that size, especially if she\u2019s shooting for \u2018Momnipotence\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue...This is Mom we\u2019re talking about...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Miss Spiral slumbered, the remaining world\u2019s forces had been sent out in strength. Countless ships and submarines from across the globe, once foes and now friends for the common goal, created a perimeter around the giant woman. Helicopters buzzed overhead of various newsfeeds, while on home soil, hundreds, if not thousands, of jets armed with nuclear weaponry prepped for take-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world\u2019s assault against Miss Spiral had reached its apex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, bombardment after bombardment from battleships fired away at her colossal body, dotting along skin with explosions. Miss Spiral merely mumbled in her sleep, turning off and creating a tidal wave that destroyed half the fleet. The opposite side of her fared no better, as she stretched out her legs and kicked them all away so easily and not even knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that stage an utter failure, the second phase was unleashed. Soldiers were deployed from the helicopters, squadrons of them by the dozens scouring onto her body, all firing away, the bullets merely bouncing off as they had done before. Nothing could harm her, from grenades to bazookas, it left naught a mark on her flawless skin. With a warning rumble, Miss Spiral turned over again in her sleep, sending all of the soldiers upon her to their deaths, either from being crushed by a body part or to fall many miles to the seas below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, no choice was left, no other alternative. The strike was called out to unleash every last atomic weapon upon Miss Spiral, declared by the world leaders and their gathered resources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless jets took off into the skies, all armed and prepared for the worse. The blue sky literally buzzed with the wings of jets from across the nations, their target, the living goddess known as Miss Spiral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first wave of jets came from Asia, releasing their nukes upon her feet and legs, lighting her up with mushroom clouds and atomic fire. The second wave from what remained of Europe, her stomach becoming a bevy field of radiation. Thirdly, her chest from South America and remaining countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorth America lead the final drop, her entire face coated with fallout ash and incredible power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoah...they actually did it.\u201d Micheal gasped as she gazed at the television, the entirety of his 150-mile mom completely covered in fire and smoke. Lily merely sighed and turned the station, seeing what else was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Diana Allers! Miss Spiral has been hit, I repeat, Miss Spiral has been hit with every nuclear weapon on the planet! We are now waiting for the clouds to dissipate and see the final result, which will determine the course of the human race. Wait...there\u2019s movement down below!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the now irradiated battlefield, a deep rumble could be heard emanating from deep within the thermospheric cloud of dust. Though Miss Spiral\u2019s body could not be seen, sonar could still tell that something was in her place, something very, very big. The rumbling continued to increase in intensity, the planet beginning to tremble around the immediate vicinity, a 3.0 earthquake rocking the ocean floor for a thirty mile radius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA playful giggle could soon be heard throughout the globe, a sign that the mighty titaness had been awakened. \u201cHey! That tickled!\u201d Miss Spiral\u2019s cheerful voiced laughed. \u201cHow nice of you all to wake me up like this! You saw me about to grow and knew just how to wake me up to see it? This planet must really know how important my dream is to me, so I really do appreciate it!\u201d The massive woman could begin to feel her body physically building up power, while simultaneously, the planet reflected her buildup as the earthquake intensity only increased, now a 4.0 and causing tidal waves to emanate from her resting form without her even moving a muscle. \u201cOoooh, looks like it\u2019s gonna be a big one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, hold it right there!\u201d Michael exclaimed as his sister changed the channels, all of them once again focused on their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Even Cartoon Network is broadcasting Mom now?\u201d her daughter complained. \u201cNow how am I supposed to know if Luffy wins Chopper back...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not that. Turn it to the news channel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-This is D-Diana Allers...Miss Spiral is...completely unphased by the nuclear assault...In fact, she seems, almost...happy to be awakened. The smoke is still too thick to see anything, but one thing is for certain: Humanity has given birth to a true goddess. Mega Mom is...apparently here to stay...The ground is trembling like crazy here, and it only seems to be getting worse, and...W-Wait a second, d-did she just say she was about to grow again?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good...\u201d Lily sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Mom\u2019s grown before, so why weren\u2019t you worried with all her other spurts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, duh! Isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot...really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen does Mom ever consider things to be big, let alone herself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they basically just supercharged Mom...\u201d the young girl sighed as she walked towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInternet. If I can\u2019t watch my shows, I\u2019ll just catch \u2018em on Youtube!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking this waaaaay too calmly...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...I feel it coming on!\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled with a boom, the shaking of her body generating a 6.0 earthquake on the richter scale now, until suddenly, it all stopped. There was a pause, a moment of peace and silence. Those who remained thought it was over, those who watched all over the world thought their screens had frozen or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an explosion. A sonic boom of growth as Miss Spiral\u2019s expanding body shot upwards and outwards, followed by her ever-deepening laughter, her massive form quickly filling out the smoke and ash, replacing it all with her expanding body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go,whoo!\u201d She chuckled, quickly surpassing the 200 mile mark in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Diana Aller! It appears Mega Mom is growin--whoaaah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newsreporter was cut short from the updraft created by the growing woman, the sheer force generated from her growth sending the helicopter into a frenzy, only to crash in Miss Spiral\u2019s naval with minimal injury, but their vehicle would be out of commission, letting them stay there to ride out her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, stretching and moaning in almost pleasure as she grew bigger and bigger, quickly outpacing the previous size and putting it to shame. 300....500....800....she quickly dismissed all of those previous sizes so easily, even reaching her mark of one-thousand miles and continuously growing. \u201cMmmm...This is absolutely lovely...\u201d she smiled warmly as she closed her eyes, her feet occupying more and more of the ocean floor by the second, losing herself in her own growth. Though she did not know why, something simply felt right about her current spurt, something natural, something good, something beyond words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Are we still rolling?\u201d the reporter asked her cameraman. \u201cWe are? Good, let\u2019s get back on the air! H-Hello mankind, this is Diana Aller reporting from...inside of Mega Mom. Our helicopter has crashed on her stomach...Luckily, no one is injured, but we\u2019re stuck here until someone comes to rescue us...if someone ever does. The ground beneath us is exploding outwards at an incredibly unreal rate, a state that this reporter cannot accurately detail in words. We must be hundreds of miles in the air by now...By all means, we...should all be dead...but we\u2019re alive and still breathing...What the hell is going on?...Ladies and gentlemen, I have no idea if we\u2019ll make it out alive this time, but...stay tuned to Action News for constant updates on Mom Watch 2013...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s really getting huge!\u201d the giantess\u2019s daughter exclaimed as she came downstairs, Miss Spiral\u2019s bare expanding feet the only thing on every channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were right...This is definitely a big one...She\u2019s already beat one thousand miles...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire planet felt the same powerful shaking as the living goddess simply continued to grow, a cheerful smile still on her face as she effortlessly expanded. In only another minute, Miss Spiral had reached an incredible twenty-five hundred miles in height, her rate of expansion still increasing rapidly. Just as with her previous larger spurts, her body began to improve as well: Her sports bra continued to fit her perfectly as she jumped not one, but two full cup sizes, bulking up to full L-cups proudly decorating her chest; her shorts performed the same duty as her already gargantuan butt enlarged as well, allowing her to sit in perfect comfort; her legs lengthened slightly as she became much more curvier and beautiful, her body making her appear as if she were 8\u20191\u201d were she normal-sized; her feet became ever more unique, softening and becoming even closer to perfection as their smell began to mix with the air of the atmosphere; her skin became more radiant than ever, her curly brown locks practically shining as her beautiful emerald eyes glowed softly beneath her closed eyelids, giving her the facial features of an impossibly beautiful woman; and lastly, her entire body became much stronger, easily able to shrug off even nuclear blasts were the planet stupid enough to assault her once again. At only three thousand miles, and still climbing higher and higher, Miss Spiral was living her dream, her DNA allowing her to become the towering woman she always dreamed of becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm....so good!\u201d Miss Spiral whispered to herself, eyes still closed as she enjoyed the pleasurable sensation of growth. At 3000 miles tall, she only grew further, quickly reaching 4000 only half a minute later. But slowly, as she escalated higher, it began to pause, now instead of a continuous growth, it was jumpy. Her growth was slowing down, much to the relief of the world. Finally, the titanic woman, the living goddess Miss Spiral, ended her latest phase of growth at a whopping 5000 miles tall, bigger than anything anyone had ever seen before, her gigantic form taking up the horizon for many miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and grinned at the new perspective she had on the world. \u201cWow! Look at how big I am! I knew that little growth bug would kick in eventually! Good ol\u2019 DNA, you never let me down!\u201d The mighty mom chuckled, a deep and booming roar that echoed across the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what was I going to do today?\u201d She mused to herself before snapping, like the sound of a sonic boom going off. \u201cOh yeah, feel itty-bitty Everest underneath my toes!\u201d With a laugh she raised her foot, but before she moved, she paused, slamming her gargantuan foot back down and creating massive tidal waves. She...felt something in her tummy. At first she thought she was just hungry, but it was something different. She felt the pitter-patter of tiny footsteps, and something metal, running around inside of her belly button. Looks like her DNA gave her super-sensitive skin now too for those tinies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, little people inside my belly button! How\u2019d you get there?\u201d She giggled, reaching in and digging them out with her nail. \u201cThere we go!\u201d she smiled down at them, able to quickly identify the newswoman, her cameraman, and their destroyed helicopter. \u201cOh! You\u2019re that nice little newslady from earlier! Looks like your little helicopter is all smashed up. Do you need a ride home? Or were you sneaking onto my belly button to get another interview?\u201d she chuckled. \u201cCome to think of it, how are you guys breathing all the way up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe...We don\u2019t know...\u201d Diana replied in awe, only able to view an endless landscape of titanic elastic mountains high above, surrounded by a bright jade glow from the woman\u2019s calm eyes. \u201cWhat...What exactly are you...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Miss Spiral, of course!\u201d she answered. \u201cHmmm...I wonder if that lil\u2019 growth bug allowed me to keep little guys like you alive on me? Oh well, I don\u2019t know how, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you get home safe. Besides, I\u2019ve got a mountain that needs to go smashy-smashy beneath my itty-bitty toes!\u201d Miss Spiral laughed yet again, her voice deep and powerful, shattering glass across the globe like that of a powerful deity. \u201cSo, wanna do a quickie interview or...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes...T-Thank you,\u201d the reporter composed herself. \u201cS-So, um, Giga Mom-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiga Mom? Is that what they\u2019re calling me now? That\u2019s so adorable! But you better start coming up with newer names soon just in case!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Uh, y-yeah...A-Anyways, Giga Mom, how big do you think you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...Well, I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019d say I\u2019m about 5000 miles or so, but there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m definitely sure about...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely nowhere near big enough!\u201d she proudly declared with an earthshattering giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClassic Mom...\u201d her children sighed in unison, no longer needing to watch television to view or see their monolithic mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...y-yes...n-next q-q-question...\u201d Diana stuttered out, her cameraman quaking just as much as she was as he continued to film. \u201cHave you any consideration for the...t-t-the...\u201d She was almost deftly afraid to even ask this question. \u201cThe untold amount of d-destruction you\u2019ve caused in the last three d-days? The entire balance of p-power of the world has drastically shifted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Miss Spiral mused with a roaring chuckle. \u201cCan\u2019t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, right? I was bound to get big, I always knew that, so, like in any giant monster movie before the plot is resolved, something\u2019s bound to get destroyed.\u201d She giggled after such a childish answer. \u201cI\u2019m sure the world\u2019s fine, everything can be rebuilt, from a relationship to a couple knocked-over buildings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...o-okay. Next question, why uh...why do you want to crush Mount Everest?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I can, silly~\u201d The giga mom replied in a sing-song voice. \u201cNow, is there anymore you\u2019d like to ask me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot...not at this time, Giga Mom...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty then! Here, honey, I\u2019ll be nice and settle you and your camerman back down wherever you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe...uh...your hometown would be fine. That\u2019s where our news station is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Kay!\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled, bending low with her nail, putting it as close to the ground as possible, somehow instinctively knowing where her hometown was. Once they were off of her now, she chucked the destroyed helicopter into orbit with a grin. Now, all she had to do was her goal for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cItty-bitty Everest, here comes Miss Spiral!\u201d She laughed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With her shadow casted across most of southern Asia, her toes playfully drummed against the ocean floor, her left foot occupying the entirety of the Arabian Sea, while her toes on her right foot alone filled the Bay of Bengal, the rest of her soles taking up a large portion of the Indian Ocean. Each perfect digit was over 80 miles tall, over twenty times the size of the world\u2019s tallest mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya down there!\u201d she waved down to Nepal in general, the civilizations around the mountain absolutely frightened knowing that their sacred mountain was about to be obliterated before their very eyes by this massive American. \u201cHope ya don\u2019t mind, but my toes really wanna meet your mountain. Thanks so much!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another playful chuckle escaping her lips, her right foot slowly rose from the ocean, massive torrents of water falling from her soles and drenching India with more than one hundred years of monsoons almost instantly. Next, she slowly hovered her appendage over the small country, her foot covering an area from Indonesia to Afghanistan. \u201cAlrighty, time to flatten the world\u2019s biggest mountain!\u201d Miss Spiral then gently lowered her pinky toe on top of the massive mountain, her increased weight causing it to collapse even before her toe hit the ground. Once it did touch terra firma, a massive shockwave was felt for hundreds of miles as the living goddess made landfall, her toe almost sinking deep enough to reach the Earth\u2019s magma layers. After several seconds of feeling the formerly largest object on the planet fall to her smallest toe, she gently removed her foot back into the ocean, an unfathomable tidal wave hitting Myanmar and Thailand almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so much fun!\u201d the continental woman cheered. \u201cNow I\u2019m officially the biggest gal on the planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral patted herself on the back, but found she still had almost the entire day left to do as she pleased. \u201cWhat can a 5000-mile gal do?\u201d She asked herself, a wondrous echo across the globe. \u201cY\u2019know, I feel like maybe I\u2019ve deserved a little something, growing this big in the past three days! A nice suntan, maybe something to nibble on, some pampering. Today will be my spa day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her booming declaration, most of the world had no idea what a \u2018spa day\u2019 meant for a woman 5000 miles tall, or whatever actions it may entail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her hometown, Lily and Michael gazed upwards, sighing. \u201cWonder what mom\u2019s gonna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake full advantage of her size, that\u2019s for sure. She did tell me she always wanted to have a little tanning session sprawled entirely across the Sahara Desert\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive her a minute. It\u2019ll come\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ve got the perfect little tanning spot in mind!\u201d Miss Spiral smiled. \u201cMy own private beach right in the middle of Africa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, told ya,\u201d Michael said to his sister. \u201cWell, at least she won\u2019t be causing too much trouble now...for at least a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally depends on how stupid the military is,\u201d Lily nodded. \u201cThey try to nuke her again and it won\u2019t be a pretty sight. Twenty bucks says they try to attack her and Mom only gets bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm...You know, I\u2019ll actually take that bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour loss.

It made her feel quite good, to know that with every step of her, she was wiping out miles of land, filled with life like it was nothing. It was the darker part of her fantasy of becoming a giantess, that miss Spiral now let loose, after she became taller then the earth's radius (3,959 miles) and the feeling of absolute power that came with her latest growth spurt and she finally wanted to know how it would feel and it didn't disappointed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"when do you finally stop changing the channel and turn off the TV bro\" Lily asked her brother, who wasn't even paying any attention to the TV. \"What else am I supposed to do?

Long time no see. Hope you don't mind me laying in that little sandbox of yours, just try not to disturb me during my tanning session, I can get pretty cranky when someone disturbs me.

As she looked down at her, even normal standards giant breasts, she saw how her trusty sports bra was finally giving up and being torn to shreds by her boobs growing two times their previous seize, but still being perky enough to stand on their own, but saggy and soft enough to look natural and wiggle with every movement of hers. Slightly shocked by this, miss Spiral looked at her butt, to see that it became so large, that if she was normal sized, it would be impossible for someone to cover most of just one cheek with both hands( remember that she appears to be 8'1 tall, so it's more proportioned). So the logical thing happened and it utterly destroyed her shorts, leaving her completely naked now and even though she had this massive spurt in the butt and breast department, it only made the living goddess even more worth her title, because she looked even more perfect and impossible of a sight to be true. <br>\r\nMiss Spiral's first reaction was trying to hide her most sensitive parts, which was considerably hard, looking at her breasts that could be seen from behind her, which made it hard to wrap one arm around them.<br>\r\nBut as quickly as she tried hiding her nipples and crotch, she stopped and a large smile started to form itself on her face.<br>\r\nShe maybe lost her favorite clothes, but she knew now that she could control her growth spurts. \"Hope you all like my new body, I changed it just for you guys!\" Miss Spiral said happily, as she laid down on her belly, with her boobs working as giant pillows for her, as she flattered much of Africa and all of the Sahara desert, killing millions of people who desperately tried to flee from the massive Mother. An act impossible with the time given to them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily sat alone in the living room, her brother went into his room after their earliest fight, leaving her alone with the TV. <br>\r\nShe switched from channel to channel just to see her mother from different angles. Lily began to breath heavily and started to feel aroused, her hand slowly going down to her crotch and feeling that she was getting wet at the image of her mother's impossible to reach beauty and showcase of power.<br>\r\n\"This is so wrong.\" Lily said under heavy breathing, as she started fingering herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her daughter who was miles away from her, watching her mother on TV, was masturbating at the sight of her mother just laying naked in the Sahara desert. \"This so wrong, but it feels so good. They are just jealous of me having the best mother and not an old hag like they have.\" Lily said to herself under heavy breathing, trying to convince herself, that she was right and the kids from school were just trying to make her feel bad by telling her how her mother is, one or two of them having their parents lost due to miss Spiral's action of eating the biggest building in town. But Lily knew that they were lying, her mother would never do something like that. \"AAAAH AAAAH!\" Lily screamed as the came.<br>\r\nLily felt a sense of relief, after all, it was her first time doing anything sexual, even though she saw her mom as more than just a mom.<br>\r\nLily got often made fun of from the other kids for having, in Lily's, the most beautiful woman as mother. They often would say things like \"Why isn't your your mom doing porn with a body like that?\" or \"Your must really be a horrible person, if your dad left her, or was because of you?\" or \"You clearly are adopted, I'm look at you and your mother, she looks like porn star while you look an ugly child.\" It made Lily furious and now that her mother was the most talked-about person on the planet, all her classmates would of course be jealous. Maybe Lily should tell her mother of the mean kids, now that nobody can stop her. Lily began to feel herself getting wet again at the thought of revenge, so Lily started to masturbate again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that all happened, the leaders of all the different countries were debating what to next. Many military scientists were working day and night, since the moment miss Spiral grew larger than possible, to create a serum that could turn miss Spiral back to normal, it would be filled in a drone, that when would fly in miss Spiral's mouth, where the serum then would become a gas that then attack her most important DNA-strings, even though it could kill her, the recent events showed that it would be better for the planet and humanity. But it was still important to find the right moment to strike, many say that now is the right moment to strike, while others say that they should wait, because if something gets wrong, it could mean the death of millions of people.<br>\r\nIt was put on a vote and it was decided that now was the right moment with the majority reasoning that many people will also die if the gigantic woman keeps breathing.<br>\r\nA rather small drone was filled with the serum and it flew in the mouth of miss Spiral. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant mother was relaxing for a solid hour now, she felt wired taste in her mouth spreading. She began to cough up a green gas which confused her even more. \"Whats happening to me?\" Miss Spiral asked with fear in her voice and for the first time in days, she didn't know what to do and this made her feel terrified, as her vision started to get blurry. </span></div></div>",

In front of him was his sister, laying on the ground, violently shaking, nothing but her underwear on her, surrounded by her pussy juices and her face soaked in tears, staring expressionless at the TV. She slowly tilted her head so she could look at her brother \"Michael, w...what did they do to mom?\" Lily said so quiet, that Michael had problems understanding her. \"WHAT DID THEY DO TO MOM!\" Lily screamed at her brother, surprising him so much that he jumped away from her, right before Lily started to cry again and let out a scream a few times. Michael didn't know what to do, his mother could be dead, his father went far away from them, out of fear for their mother and his sister was an emotional wreck. \"What the hell happened here?\" Michael whispered to himself in complete disbelief of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile miss Spiral's children were at their lowest point, the rest of the world celebrated the defeat of the gigantic woman, finally giving everyone a moment to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Diana Allers with action news.

I always wanted to ask you something important the whole time.\" \"Do you want to tell me that you...\" Tom was interrupted by a low sounding boom, similar to a heartbeat. Both Diana and Tom looked at each other with fear in their eyes. They started to sprint to the chopper as a giant sandstorm formed behind them started to move in their direction.

The last thing I can remember is that I started to cough up that wired green gas and then nothing. Maybe it was a side effect of that DNA enhancer-stuff.\" But right as miss Spiral came up with that explanation for her passing out, her DNA started to enhance itself to a level, no human could even dream about. For example, she immediately able to tell that her fainting wasn't connected to the DNA improvement but from an outside force. \"So that means that it was probably the military.\" Miss Spiral said with an angry undertone to her voice as she stood up.<br>\r\nThe immense anger that was building up in the gigantic mother, made her DNA go wild and miss Spiral felt the familiar feeling of her starting to grow again, because like she said herself, she is only going up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world panicked as it released, that the  believed dead giant was indeed not dead, but wasn't looking all to happy either and knowing what would probably going to happen next.<br>\r\nSo as soon as the gigantic, naked frame of miss Spiral was standing, everyone one who was left on the African continent tried to flee. Chaos broke lose in major cities, car accidents happening left and right, every ship and plane taking off as fast as they could, leaving thousands and millions of people behind in fear for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was outside of his father's house, not wanting to look at what his sister had become. He thought of calling someone for help, but they would in the best case scenario just leave them after finding out who Lily's and Michael's mother was and he didn't wanted to imagine what the worst case scenario would be. So he sat outside, alone, for 3 or 4 hours after realizing that his sister wasn't going to be reacting to him and continue crying. Was he a bad person for leaving his sister alone at her lowest point and not really caring for what happened to his mother, maybe, but what was he supposed to do, he asked himself. <br>\r\nMeanwhile in the living room, Lily was curled up in a blanket, her brother gave her. She still kept crying and screaming, even though it started to hurt in her throat. She didn't care, the thought of her mother being dead, hurt her more than anything else in the world. As Lily looked at the TV, she saw how people celebrated at the sight of her dead mother. \"YOU SHOULD ALL BURN IN HELL!\" She tried to scream with her broken, but still loud enough voice, that her brother heard her clearly enough, giving him a shiver running down his spine.<br>\r\n\"WHY DID YOU KILL HER? SHE DIDN'T DESERVE IT!\" Lily started crying even harder, not just from her sadness and anger, but also the pain in her throat.<br>\r\n\"... Wait, we have information that something is happening at the corpse of the gigantic woman...\" the channel cut away from the reporter, to footage being filmed live by someone, who was hundreds of miles away from miss Spiral, but still couldn't get her whole body into the frame. The footage showed miss Spiral, against all odds and believes, wobbly trying to get up, letting her enormous butt and rack wiggle wildly in the process. As miss Spiral was standing at her full height, the person who was catching the event on camera, got so scared that he let his camera fall to the ground and started to run away. <br>\r\nLily couldn't believe her eyes. She just saw her mother stand up, after everyone said that she was dead. Lily wanted to let out screams of joy, but she had a better idea of what to say \"Grow mom, grow grow grow grow...\" she kept chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral's growth came in continued expansions. She grew thousands of miles in few seconds, her body became so heavy, that she broke through the earth's crust. Her breasts grew to a size of 70 inches if she were normal sized, making it now completely impossible for her to see anything past her bust. Her hips also widened, making her butt even more gigantic, doubling in seize, redefining the term ghetto booty and bringing it to a whole new level. Her legs lengthened and her thighs became thicker as well, making her appear 10 feet tall if she were normal sized, making her bigger then the tallest human who ever lived, making her look a bit more proportioned, with her butt and boobs were defining physics with their ability not to be to saggy and not looking like pure fat or causing miss Spiral any back problems. <br>\r\nDuring her growth, miss Spiral's feet destroyed anything near her and creating an 10.0 earthquake on the African continent, that could be felt on the other side of the world and creating tsunamis that hit Europe, Asia and the east cost of both North and South-America, fluting hundreds of cities and killing millions of people. Her senses improved so much, that she could hear, feel and see, everything and everyone crystal clear and she was also able to filter everything out, that she didn't wanted to focus on. <br>\r\nDifferent from the other times, her most growth spurt didn't really brought any joy to miss Spiral, who up to this point really enjoyed growing. The reason was, that it only served to make her stronger, so she could take revenge on the people who tried to hurt her. Miss Spiral's growth stopped and she now stood at 35 thousand miles tall, making her bigger than the equator was long. (24854 miles). <br>\r\nShe looked at the rest of Africa, seeing that all of it was in ruins and chaos. Miss Spiral got on all fours, to focus on a city in the south of Africa, where the most chaos was. Her hands crushing almost all of Africa and her legs destroying most of Europe with her feet not even touching earth anymore, because of her legs being to long, her face looming over the city blocking the sky for hundreds of miles. Her naked breasts landed on the ground, crushing everything underneath them, completely blocking the way to north, only leaving one direction for the survivors to run and creating huge crates that were several hundred miles deep. <br>\r\n\"Hey! It's not very nice to welcome me with such a mess when I wake up\" She said, her voice so powerful, that it made many of the damaged buildings collapse, giving miss Spiral the feeling of complete power back. <br>\r\n\"Can you please all stop running? I want to ask you something.\" The only response to her were pleads from people who didn't wanted to die, or prayers to all possible existing gods not to let them get killed by this monster. This made miss Spiral really annoyed. \"I don't care if you don't want to die!\" she roared, destroying the few standing buildings and shattering many ears in the process. \"You there, in the black suit, you look like a politician, surely you can give me answers\" Miss Spiral said, as she brought forefinger down, bringing it in front of the man she meant. As her gigantic finger hit the ground, miss Spiral could feel, how over three hundred and fifty miles, everything and everyone was being flattened and getting squished making her slightly aroused. With a quick motion, miss Spiral dug up a small(for her) chunk of the city, there the man was standing on and brought it to her face. As she looked at it, she saw, hundreds of other people alongside the man, all of them laying on the ground, some of them passed out from the speed with which they were being lifted from the ground. But miss Spiral only focused on the the man in the black suit. \"Hey you, the man in the black suit. Do you know where the people are that hurt me are?\" almost shattering the ears of the survivors, letting them scream in agony. \"Stop whining, you should consider yourself lucky for being still alive. But for real now, where are the people who hurt me?\" miss Spiral asked again, a little quieter this time. But the man still didn't answered the question, instead he shivered in fear. \"I know where the men are that organized the attack are.\" Miss Spiral heard from a woman. The woman looked pretty similar to miss Spiral before her boost in height. \"Finally someone who can talk. Tell me you little cutie, where are the bad people and how do you know?\" Miss Spiral asked with a little smile. \"I think they are in Australia right now. They changed the location almost every three hours, but nearly every supporter of them has left them alone in the outback of Australia without any vehicle . I know this, because my husband who is still there has told me that before the earthquake that was caused by your growth.\" At the last sentence the woman started to cry, making miss Spiral really uncomfortable.\" Thank you... Sorry for asking you so much, but what is your and your husband's name?\" The woman looked up at the eye of miss Spiral that filled the entire sky for her and said \"Sarah and my husband's name is Frank.\" \"Thank you Sarah, your husband can be really happy to have such beautiful and amazing wife. To everyone else who is on my fingernail right now. If you go anywhere near Sarah, well how do I say this? I hope you don't mind going all the way down.\" Miss Spiral said as she stood up, the city remains still on her fingernail. \"Time to go to Australia!\" The living goddess declared with a smile as she went the (for her) short way to Australia. </span></div></div>",

Huge tsunamis formed, hitting every continent on the planet, many island states, like Japan or Haiti, were completely wiped out by the combination of the earthquake that was strong enough that at some places, the ground broke open, spilling out magma and the tsunamis that were over hundreds of feet tall. With just one step, miss Spiral had reduced earth's population to under 70%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirens rang all around the world, streets were filled with chaos and carnage, everyone tried to get to a safe place that didn't existed on this planet, or using the utter chaos to do acts that were unnoticed by the public, who was more focused on the gigantic woman who was destroying the world. <br>\r\n\"LET ME IN LILY!\" Michael screamed while he was banging on the door of his father's house. Lily locked him outside as soon as she felt her mother grow. Her eyes were now glued to the TV, after changing the channel for a long time, she found one, that didn't just played the emergency interruption, but satellite footage. It showed (in surprisingly good video quality) the actions of miss Spiral. Lily felt herself getting hot again, but this time she restrained herself, she knew that if her mother would come to her, it wouldn't be the best thing if Lily was in the same state as her brother found her in.<br>\r\nAs Lily watched her mother stand up, she could hear miss Spiral declare her next destination, Lily whispered \"Go get them. Make them pay for what they did.\" And as the humongous mother made her step to Australia, Lily could feel the house shaking like crazy. From outside she could hear the screams of terror become even louder, she could hear how even some buildings collapse. It was basically a miracle that Lily's house was even standing standing, but Lily didn't cared for that. Lily just watched in awe how one step of her mother could create such cataclysmic events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spiral towered over Australia, scanning the devastated continent for something that could be the base of the world's leaders and after a short while she found it. She kneeled down and said, in a very serious voice \"If this is the base of the world's leaders, I want that the man named Frank, who is married to a woman named Sarah, who lives in Africa, to come out and to step on my fingernail.\" Everyone wondered what this living goddess wanted, but all of them did what the gigantic woman told them to do as fast as they could.<br>\r\nAs Frank was pushed outside of the building, he could only see the shadow casted by miss Spiral. As he looked up, he couldn't see anything past the giantess's toes and her gigantic finger that she had layed down next to the base. \"Hop on\" A voice boomed from the sky. Frank climbed on the fingernail and the city part on it, shaking wildly out of fear. As he reached the top, miss Spiral stood up to her full height, watching how Frank and Sarah walked through the destroyed streets of the city to each.<br>\r\nAfter a short, quiet gaze at each other, Sarah and Frank ran into each other's arms, starting to cry tears of joy because of the others survival.<br>\r\nMiss Spiral looked at the reunited couple, the anger inside her building off. She looked around her, focusing on the surrounding area. And for the first time, miss Spiral saw the destruction she had caused in the last few days. She could hear the outcry of millions of people who lost everyone and everything because of her. Tears started to form in her eyes, miss Spiral knew what she had to do, if she wanted all of this to stop.<br>\r\nWith one stretch of her arm, she set the city remains in her fingernail in an empty area of the USA, next to her hometown and with a smile, the giantess whispered \"Goodbye everybody.\" before she jumped off the planet and started to float away from earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could grasp of what just happened at the moment. It took weeks for the chaos to go away and order to come back. It would take years to repair only a fraction of the damage caused by the gigantic mother. Because every possible country has been affected or even completely destroyed by miss Spiral, most conflicts were set aside for the moment and the world's different nations worked together, trying to rebuild everything. The docter responsible for the DNA activator was killed by an angry mob for the creation of the world's most dangerous monster and his lab was burned, together with his research, so no one could copy his work. <br>\r\nBut what happened to miss Spiral's children? Nobody really knew, they just disappeared. In truth however, shortly after their mother had left the planet, they both left their home, they split ways, trying to live lives under new names. <br>\r\nBut most importantly, will Ellen Spiral return? If so, she would probably be much bigger than last time she was on earth. This fear for her return made everyone on earth work together. Because no one wanted to be unprepared, even though they all knew that they couldn't be really prepared for miss Spiral's return. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wore a simple shirt, a backpack and pants that complimented her cute, but giant bubble butt. The woman had a slender figure and was flat-chested, she looked rather young for her age, someone could guess her to be around 21 years old. She had a rather cute face with freckles and shoulder long hair that she had dyed red. Her name was Sophie Longing, formally known as Lily Spiral, the daughter of Ellen Spiral. Lily/ Sophie was walking through her abandoned hometown. The town had been abandoned due to the fact that no one wanted to live in the place, there the monster, that almost destroyed the world originated from.<br>\r\nLily/ Sophie had been laying low for 12 years, starting a new life, pretending that she was someone else.

A massive, feminine figure floated through the emptiness of space within a local solar system, peacefully asleep. The beautiful visage of divinity was astronomical in every sense of the word, her home planet of earth a small orb of green and blue that appeared so puny as she floated by in her slumber. From upon the planet\u2019s surface, millions gazed up, their entire sky nothing but golden tanned skin of absolutely smooth perfection, the horizon completely consumed by the color of her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sheer statuesque stunner of size was Miss Ellen Spiral, a wonderful mother of two upon earth, but now a gorgeous goddess.

Being the kind soul that she was, she was more than eager to cooperate with the governing powers of every country, working together to aid this monolithic mother. She did not require sustenance or even air for that matter, but she enjoyed simple pleasures, like clothing. A majority of labor, time, and resources were put into it, but she had been given something she regularly wore before getting too large, a sports bra and jogging shorts that snugly matched her incredible curves and every facet of her body, along with sneakers, flip-flops, and heels, even though they could not spare any more for a fancy dress. Miss Spiral was disappointed, but she did not mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus she assumed a life among the stars with earth barely a baseball in her grip. She would spend her days exploring, or sleeping, or whatever else would come to her mind. For despite her situation, she was ever cheerful, optimistic, as bright and sunny as the solar body itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she wasn\u2019t alone. With much pleading, she had managed to get her family of her two children to live on her, as well as her neighbors, the two being close friends of the family, the tiny foursome living upon her figure. At first this seemed troublesome and almost impossible, but Miss Spiral seemed to defy everything as she usually did, her skin emitting its own breathable atmosphere and gravity similar to earth\u2019s, as well as possessing impossibly sharp and keen sense enough to interact with the miniscule microbes she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft breathing broke in its pace, enunciated by a smacking of her lips that rippled as sound waves that would travel for lightyears. \u201cAhh . . . what a lovely, lovely rest! I feel so . . . so . . . ready for the day!\u201d Miss Spiral giggled to herself upon awakening, turning her head and noting the placement of everything around her. Earth was far away enough she could shift and readjust herself comfortably without endangering it, and all pieces of her clothing were floating in a neat line next to one another, sports clothes and footwear all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweeties . . . time to wake up! Mommy\u2019s moving!\u201d With a mischievous snicker she wiggled her voluptuous cheeks. As Miss Spiral\u2019s ample posterior shook, so did the land that her inhabitants called their new home, their ground quaking uncontrollably and instantly waking all four of them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?! WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING?!\u201d Spiral shouted as he fell out of bed, the rumbling continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same thing that happens every morning: Try to avoid being killed by Mom,\u201d Lily joked, half-asleep herself as she rolled around on the floor of their bedroom. \u201cWhy does Mom have to be such a morning person? What time is it anyways, like 7 AM or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry 6 AM,\u201d her brother answered in monotone, now having calmed down. \u201cYeah yeah, we\u2019re up, Mom! You can stop now!\u201d he called out as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet~\u201d the monolithic mother sang. \u201cHow about our fantastic neighbors? Rise and shine, you two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early\u2026\u201d Molly groaned, trying to bury her head back into her pillow, even though the ground and their goddess of a planet wouldn\u2019t allow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it, Mol,\u201d an exhausted Alena replied from outside on the smooth, jiggly surface of her posterior, following suit. \u201cI know she got her beauty sleep, but us other gals do too, y\u2019know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re technically still a guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe go over this every day, Mol: Just because I\u2019m bigger than you and have a ridiculously huge rack doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m any less of a gal than you. There\u2019s no need to be jealous,\u201d her brother/sister teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...Just tell her we\u2019re awake already. I just want to get five more minutes\u2026\u201d Molly sighed, obviously not a morning person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it. Yo Miss Spiral, we\u2019re awake down here too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! It\u2019s always great to start your day early so you can make the most of it!\u201d Miss Spiral cheerily replied, stopping her movement. Immediately afterwards, all four of her tiny citizens collapsed back in their beds, needing their daily extra bit of rest to get over Miss Spiral\u2019s alarm clock routine. \u201cAh, now to get ready for my day! Make sure you guys get ready too. I\u2019ll be putting on my shorts in just a little bit, so get ready for pickup in just a little bit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the smaller residents sprang into action. Being the largest of them all, Alena quickly forced herself to stand up, reaching through the bedroom window and grabbing Molly from her bed, the anti-goth goth beauty screaming as she was whisked away like she did every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, put me back! I\u2019m still in my underwear!\u201d Molly panicked, her bright orange bra and panties her usual sleepwear. \u201cSpiral\u2019s gonna see me like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s either that or spend the rest of the day in darkness again,\u201d the 100 foot Alena replied, shoving Molly in her cleavage. \u201cYo guys, hurry up over there. We\u2019ve got like a minute max here. Spiral bro, I\u2019ve got an incentive today~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna forgive you for this one bro!\u201d Molly pouted, punching the massive orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing most of all that their mother always did as she said, both Spiral children fled outside, joining their neighbors on the toned tan plain of Miss Spiral\u2019s posterior. \u201cLet me guess, you didn\u2019t give Molly time to change again?\u201d Lily sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I might be her older sibling, but I gotta balance that with being Spi\u2019s best friend too,\u201d Alena grinned toothily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, my little angels, Mommy\u2019s gonna start getting dressed now,\u201d Miss Spiral giggled. \u201cNo peeking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful goddess gently shifted her position, allowing her to reach out and grab her signature sports bra and shorts; she\u2019d decide on her footwear choice, if any, once she was fully dressed. Next, with all of Earth watching, Miss Spiral struggled to put on her top as she did every morning, loving the tightness as she made sure to get it nice and tight against her massive S-cup chest, a cup-size worthy of a goddess of her caliber. \u201cPerfect!\u201d she chuckled, cupping her bust and letting them bounce for a moment. \u201cAlright, my little darlings, the Finger Express to Bra Town is coming into the station~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways such creative names . . .\u201d Lily mumbled to herself as the four of them stood amongst the enormous landscape of Miss Spiral\u2019s single cheek, her opposite one a distant blurry planetoid all on its own right, expanding onwards and outwards for miles wherever they turned their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can let Molly out now, ya know.\u201d Spiral said upwards to the purple giantess of a friend, Alena smiling down and chuckling, bouncing their sibling gently, to which the orange-themed girl yelped slightly before resuming her angered punching against the jiggly mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhhh maybe later. Gotta keep an eye on her while we move! Speaking of that.\u201d Two hands reached down, Spiral and Lily held in either one, while far off in the distance, a catastrophically loud rumble thoomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen four pairs of eyes turned to the dull and distant boom, they could see the cause of it, a ginormous fingertip flying through space, aimed directly at them. It approached at speeds unimaginable, its scale enough to lodge entire landmasses in between the confines of the fingerprint lines, enough for cities to rest among the most subtle grooves of skin. Closer and closer Ellen Spiral\u2019s finger encroached, eventually landing with unbelievable precision nearby, shaking the soft, fleshy landscape. \u201cThe Finger Express has arrived, choo-choo!! All abooooooooard! Unless any stragglers want to spend the remainder of the day on my booty~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTempting . . .\u201d Alena muttered to herself, until the tinier three huffed and glared up at the purple haired giantess. \u201cBut uh . . . we\u2019ll have to pass, Miss S! Climbing on now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the secondary mode of transportation, Alena dashed to the looming wall of finger, so up close and massive not all of it was even visible, latching onto it and finding a nice place to sit. \u201cAlright, we\u2019re on! Ready to roll, Miss Spiral!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear ya loud and clear cutie, chugga chugga chugga chugga choo-choo!\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled, gently and meticulously removing her finger from the surface of her bum while using her free hand to slide her shorts upwards until they snapped into place, the stretchy fabric taunt and pushed to its threadbare limit against the supple mass of rear.</span></div></div>",

Within a few more seconds, she had reached the surface of her sports bra, readying for a landing. \u201cWe\u2019re coming into the station now. End of the line, all passengers please exit safely at Bra Town!\u201d she sang. Alena grasped her present position hard as the \u2018train\u2019 came in for a landing, the titanic mother gently resting her fingertip against the top of her right bosom. \u201cThank you for riding the Finger Express! We hope you enjoyed your trip!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would\u2019ve, if only your boobs weren\u2019t moving around the entire trip,\u201d Lily complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if Spiral wasn\u2019t staring at me this entire time!\u201d Molly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s a tight fit in here!\u201d he defended himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit complainin\u2019,\u201d Alena sighed. \u201cThanks for the ride as usual, Ms S. Always the greatest train ride on the planet!\u201d Reaching into her bust, the purple-haired titaness pulled out her friends, gently placing them on the \u2018ground\u2019 that was Miss Spiral\u2019s jiggly, pudding-like flesh covered by her sports bra, next to her high heel. \u201cThere we go! The gang\u2019s all here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four craned their necks upwards as Miss Spiral\u2019s planetary bright green eyes stared down at them happily, gently waving down to her inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, Miss Spiral can see me like this!\u201d Molly panicked, trying to cover herself, but failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like she hasn\u2019t seen you like that before,\u201d Lily sighed. \u201cSo Mom, let me guess, can\u2019t decide on shoes again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFifty gold stars for you, my little Lily!\u201d her mother giggled cheerily. \u201cMind helping out Mommy again today? I can just never decide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I would!\u201d Alena quickly called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFamily only!\u201d Spiral called out to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026\u201d she pouted, sitting down on the bouncy surface, the area jiggling slightly like a trampoline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my adorable little sweethearts, what kinda shoes should I wear today? Or maybe none at all!\u201d Miss Spiral asked, her eyes focusing on her children for their advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth siblings turn to look at each other for a brief moment of eye contact, shrugging in unison. \u201cI think we can rule out the heels, since they don\u2019t really match her outfit.\u201d Lily suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh poo, and I love those heels!\u201d Miss Spiral huffed, dangerously close to generating a windstorm that almost blew her tiny occupants miles away from where they were currently situated. \u201cDo you think I could convince the itty-bitty world leaders to make me a dress to go with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I don\u2019t even think there\u2019s enough supplies left on the planet to make a single thread of fiber fit for your scale.\u201d Spiral sighed upwards at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry mom, you still have other options, and we\u2019re here to help.\u201d Her daughter added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwww!\u201d Now back to her usual perky self in a flash. \u201cThanks sweetie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, her sneakers are classic. Nice design, iconic, really fits what she\u2019s wearing.\u201d Spiral went on to muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but her flip-flops are really nice too, underused.\u201d Lily made a counterpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think she looks good in either of them . . .\u201dMolly interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mols! It\u2019s just family!\u201d Alena pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, no need to fight.\u201d Miss Spiral\u2019s own thunderous voice interrupted them all, feeling the deep bass of every booming syllable within their very bones. \u201cAll of your opinions are valid! Though, if there\u2019s going to be an argument, then I\u2019ll just let my feetsies go bare~\u201d She winked down at them, several seconds later a blasting gust of wind roaring over them from that simple action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBare, bare seems good.\u201d They all seemed to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, and if none of you could have decided I would have done the feet test!\u201d The massive matriarch teased. It was more of a game to her than a decision-maker. Miss Spiral would take Spiral and Lily and place them respectively on either the bed of her flip-flops or inside the sole of her sneaker, and put it on to see which was more comfortable for her and her kids at the moment. They were incredibly grateful she did not decide to go that route. \u201cAlrighty, no shoes it is! Thanks again for your help, everyone!\u201d With a cheerful smile, Miss Spiral leaned downwards slightly, blowing the group a playful kiss, her hurricane-like breath practically sending them flying if it weren\u2019t for her own gravity. \u201cNow I\u2019m dressed and ready for success!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling her toes in glee, the beautiful goddess crossed her arms beneath her bust, once again staring at her children and neighbors. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve got a big day planned for today!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m gonna check on Earth for a bit, then Mommy\u2019s planning on spending some quality time with her favorite munchkins~\u201d she lovingly teased. \u201cOh, I almost forgot! I have a surprise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is never good,\u201d the Spiral siblings and Molly said simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is always good,\u201d Alena grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot to mention it, but last time I talked with those science guys on Earth, they said I was supposed to have a growth spurt around now! I can\u2019t wait!\u201d she squealed with glee. Anyone who knew Ellen Spiral in her human life knew that she was obsessed with her own size, always knowing that deep down, she was destined to be big. And not just a mere fifty feet either, the biggest of the big, every day telling herself that she\u2019d be bigger than the last, finding herself more comfortable the bigger she became. For her, news of a soon-impending growth spurt was like an early Christmas present, one she couldn\u2019t wait to unwrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, way to go Miss Spiral!\u201d Alena gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her. She\u2019s big enough already,\u201d Spiral growled. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re even still here! Can\u2019t you just get as big as you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can, but living on the prime real estate of your mom is much more fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Spiral siblings and Molly facepalmed, Miss Spiral turned her attention back to her home world, Earth. The blue and green sphere of life was no larger than a baseball compared to the massive mother, her truly godly S-cup bosom easily twice as large as it. \u201cHello down there!\u201d she greeted North America with a gleeful smile. \u201cHope you\u2019re all having a fantastic morning! Now then, I\u2019m ready to start that UN meeting whenever you little guys are. I know it\u2019s gonna be great!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaning in as close as she possibly could, the atmosphere was effectively replaced with the overwhelming enormity of fractions of Miss Spiral\u2019s all-encompassing beauty.Turning her head slowly, strands of stray hair thicker than entire landmasses narrowly passed by the planet, almost scraping it. Her ear now faced planetside, signaling that the meeting was to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn almost invisible mite flared through the air, the tiniest ship rocketing towards its destination. Every six months or so, the United Nations would schedule a conference with the mightily massive mother. Ever since her ascension, they figured it would be for the best to involve a literal living goddess in most of their meetings, considering she held the whole world in her hand at times, and so much had been dedicated to her, from resources and manpower to flat out worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the ship prepared for landing with the darkened cavern of her ear canal, Miss Spiral\u2019s dull giggles echoing outside. \u201cHehe, you all tickle! Now be careful, it may have been a while since I cleaned in there, but after we\u2019re done shooting the breeze, feel free to stay and help clean it out for me~\u201d she snickered as she felt the tiniest tappings of dozens of feet leave the ship and step out onto her hyper-sensitive skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were greeted by a humid darkness, and once their eyes adjusted, the depths of her size came to light. It was like standing within a cave, except the largest cave in space was simply the ear canal to an astronomical woman. They couldn\u2019t even see the ceiling, let alone the blurry walls so far off in the distance they might as well disappear into the horizon, though mountainous masses of ear wax dotting the landscape within were quite visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, Miss Spiral,\u201d one delegate sounded off, coughing before shouting to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello ladies and gents, welcome to Planet Spiral for your annual UN meeting!\u201d Ellen chuckled, imitating a game show host\u2019s voice. \u201cThere are some ladies in there, right? At least some progress has been made down on that little planet, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of pause as the gathered number of leaders all strangely looked at one another. \u201cYes . . . there are some women here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d She nodded, almost sending them all tumbling in deeper with the turn up of her head, and almost tumbling out into the bleakness of space with the turn down, stumbling the countless miles, but they clung tightly in place, and fortunately the ship was not displaced and remained steadfast in its position. \u201cSo, what did you all wanted to talk with me about? You know all that silly politics mumbo-jumbo makes me sleepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust checking up on things. We receive reports from NASA daily about you, but want it right from your mouth about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, how sweet of you! Well, I\u2019ve been doing well, just having a liiiiiittle craving for some new clothes, like maybe, I dunno, a dress-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Ellen, we won\u2019t have enough supplies to give to you for at least another hundred or so years of replenishing them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c. . . Miss SPIRAL, thank you, and darn. Hmmph. Oh well. At least you\u2019re honest, which is very rare for politicians these days. Anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019d generally just like to ask with your cooperation in the continuing maintenance of Earth,\u201d another delegate said aloud. \u201cFor example, upon your stirrings this morning, you happened to block out the sun for part of the world with your...ahem, chest\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing really new. Can\u2019t be ashamed of the fantastic body I\u2019ve been given! Most gals would kill to have a bust like mine!\u201d the mother giggled. \u201cWell, I guess I can try that. Or better yet, maybe if I get bitten by the growth bug again, I can become sunnier than the Sun! Wouldn\u2019t that be swell?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delegates were quiet for a moment, unsure of how to respond. Would she actually go so far as to consume the Sun and become its replacement if given the opportunity? Hopefully, that day would never come. \u201cErm, well, yes then, we greatly appreciate your assistance, Miss Spiral. The rest of the members of the UN council will be thrilled to hear about this. We\u2019ll make sure to have supplies delivered to you later today for your, erm, \u2018residents\u2019. They...are all doing alright, are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever better!\u201d she cheered. \u201cWell, thanks for your little visit, everyone. Hope you enjoyed the meeting in Spiral Cave, and we hope you come back to visit us again soon. Don\u2019t forget to give us a great review on Yelp!\u201d Miss Spiral joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the brief meeting now over - the ambassadors having only a limited number of subjects to discuss with Ellen without her feigning boredom - the delegates boarded their ship and prepared to take off. As the white ship fired up its engines and turned towards the exit of her ear canal, a few of the ambassadors used the ship\u2019s internal wireless function, actually looking up \u2018Spiral Cave\u2019 on Yelp for fun. They were shocked to find out that it was, in fact, listed on the site - Spiral had listed it a month ago on the \u2018suggestion\u2019 of his mother - and proceeded to give it a one star review. Miss Spiral waited patiently for a minute or so, giving the vessel enough time to escape her ear before turning her head, spying the nigh-invisible mite exit safely and continue on to the remainder of its journey back to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye! Have a safe trip back!\u201d the optimistic woman waved farewell to her visitors. With the delegation now gone, Ellen Spiral\u2019s emerald eyes stared down at her bust, her vision zooming on her children and neighbors. \u201cAlright my little darlings, Mommy\u2019s all free to have some fun with you now! Ready for another fun filled day with little ol\u2019 me?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Well, since you\u2019re all right here on my chest, let\u2019s start off with a fun game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c. . . Fun.\u201d Spiral sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever really fun when you plan it, Mom.\u201d Lily added in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust er, b-be gentle, Miss Spiral.\u201d Molly mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoohoo! Ready when you are babe!\u201d Alena cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty everyone! Now this game is a simple one. I\u2019ll be doing all the work, you all just have fun with it! Though, you might want to brace for impact every once in a while, hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm . . . pact?\u201d Spiral gulped, sort of figuring out what was going to happen. It started as a slow, built up rumble as most actions did with Miss Spiral, but the effects were imminent. Leaning forward slightly, the group took a tumble the vast distance across her silken chestscape, until they were positioned neatly more or less near the center of the jiggly mass of her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeeeeeeet ready! It\u2019s time to play Boobaline!\u201d The titanic mother could barely withhold her excitement as she stared down from the heavens at the tiniest of mites that served as her company and entertainment. \u201c3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . boop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing just the sheer force of muscle control she had over the region of her chest, Miss Spiral bounced the fleshy orb, sending the occupants upon it careening through the air, two screaming, one crying, and one whooping in joy, flying towards the opposite breast almost millions of miles away. They landed with an impact that caused them to sink deeply into the softness of the squishy flesh, but another bounce from her left tit sent them flying back the opposite way once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis carried on for several minutes, Miss Spiral giggling the entire time as she did so, her laughter of joy ringing throughout space. She seemed to even be trying to break a personal record. \u201c33 boops . . . 34 boops . . . 35 boops . . . 36!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt carried on eventually until the trajectory was off and the momentum was lost, all of them hitting just the wrong spot, briefly bouncing off until they took a long, long, loooooong tumble downwards in a straight line, directly towards the depths of her cleavage. Down into the darkness they fell, the abysmal chasm of her chest enough to engulf worlds. After a descent that spanned what seemed to be the longest time, eventually they all met a point where flesh on either side of them met, catching them in its overwhelming and smothering embrace. \u201cHa-ha! 55 boops! That\u2019s a new Boobaline record! Great job everyone, did you have as much fun as I did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna hurl\u2026\u201d her son replied, completely dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo much...bouncing\u2026\u201d Lily groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never knew...Miss Spiral\u2019s boobs were big enough to do that\u2026\u201d Molly noted, equally dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better believe it, Miss Spiral! Best fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life!\u201d Alena laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I\u2019m so glad you all loved it! We\u2019ll have to play it again tomorrow!\u201d Ellen giggled, making a mental note of the the success of her latest improvised game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you, can you just grow outta my mom\u2019s cleavage and get us out of here?\u201d Spiral asked his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, and ruin your mom\u2019s good time? No way!\u201d the violet-haired vixen answered. \u201cIf it was anyone else, maybe, but you know I\u2019ve still got the hots for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you guys wanna do next?\u201d the goddess asked. \u201cOh, I know! It\u2019s time for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s gonna\u2026\u201d Lily began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoobalanche!\u201d Miss Spiral exclaimed with glee, grabbing her colossal chest and bouncing it up and down, shaking around the tiny captives in her chest. The four residents bounced back and forth against the mighty mom\u2019s planetary orbs, the jiggling flesh continuing to throw them around in what felt like the universe\u2019s largest bouncehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is awesome!\u201d Alena giggled as she was tossed about. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you guys always complain when I trap you in MY cleavage. If this was what the fun is all about, I definitely wouldn\u2019t be complaining!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d the other three exclaimed in unison, each of them having experienced it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly thirty seconds of shaking, Miss Spiral slowed her bouncing bosom to a halt, her occupants losing momentum as they once again came to rest between her massive orbs, all but one of them completely exhausted. \u201cLooks like the Boobalanche stopped for now!\u201d she giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Finger Patrol is going to come and rescue the trapped angels!\u201d Pulling on her sports bra with her left hand, Miss Spiral exposed her cleavage before digging her right hand inside, delving deep into her cleavage until she safely secured them on her palm. Once she removed her hand, she let her sports bra snap shut once again, embracing the tightness of her outfit. \u201cRescue operation success! Great job, Finger Patrol!\u201d she exclaimed cheerfully, bringing her palm in front of her face, her children and other inhabitants getting to view her planetary, heavenly visage up close, taking it the full extent of her natural beauty. \u201cSo, what shall we do next?\u201d the mother eagerly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm . . . can we just go back home? Sorta worn out from all of . . . t-that.\u201d Molly stated, the group dizzied and simply trying to recover from the onslaught of mammary-fueled mushings they had just gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree with Mols.\u201d Lily groaned, holding her head in her hands and trying to stand up without feeling an extreme sense of vertigo. She was failing quite poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. You guys are lightweights!\u201d Alena cackled, peering down at her tinier friends, the hundred-foot purple beauty grinning from ear to ear. \u201cI could go for a whole other round of that!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Spiral grumbled simply, holding up a finger and pointing it at Alena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, are my babies tired?\u201d Miss Spiral cooed from so high above. \u201cYou are all so cute.\u201d Her green eyes seemed to flicker with the glint of an idea, the sparkle of her mischievous side still quite visible in the emerald sea of her irises. \u201cCute enough to eat, in fact . . . ~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Spiral . . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like where this is going.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her breath alone, a sweet, humidly warm wash of a storm that spread over them, followed by the sheer astronomical vastness of her tonguetip slowly making its way towards them. Molly released the highest-pitch yelp imaginable as it neared, slamming directly into the four microbes and sticking them to it, withdrawing to the maw from whence it came just as meticulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, my little sweethearts are as sweet as I thought they\u2019d be!\u201d  Miss Spiral giggled. From inside her mouth, the massive tongue swished and tossed about, hurling her \u2018snacks\u2019 tens of thousands of feet into the air before they landed with a light thud atop the lengthy crimson serpent, only once again to be thrown airborne. Screams of mostly terror escaped the lips of her snacks, fearful that at any moment, they could be accidentally swallowed up by the monolithic mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommmm! Stop it!\u201d Spiral yelled. \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna get eaten!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, you crybabies,\u201d a giddy Alena assured them. \u201cMiss Spiral\u2019s too careful to do something like that. Besides, if something did happen, you\u2019ve got me around to save you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of us can grow at will, bro!\u201d Molly complained, letting out a yelp of fear as she was tossed around yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta agree with the grower here,\u201d Lily shrugged. \u201cNot like we can do anything, so we just gotta go with the flow. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two aren\u2019t helping!\u201d Spiral and his girlfriend shouted together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, I\u2019d never actually eat my darling little angels,\u201d Miss Spiral assured them. \u201cYou just taste so delicious!\u201d After another several seconds of being sloshed about in her mouth, the planetary woman stopped her tongue\u2019s movement and brought her left hand in front of her mouth, proceeding to stick out her tongue and deposit her almost-snacks back on her palm. \u201cSee, safe and sound! Wasn\u2019t that fun?~\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m soaked... \u201c Lily groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely gonna have to dry out for a bit,\u201d the goth girl agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, you guys are always complaining,\u201d Alena smirked. \u201cI\u2019m already dry as a bone and looking as stellar as ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce again, we don\u2019t have your powers, bro,\u201d Spiral glared. \u201cMagic clothing on top of everything else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, need me to dry you off? Miss Spiral\u2019s Blow-Dry Service is just an ask away!\u201d Bringing her lips together, Ellen Spiral gently blew out a stream of cold air, the power of her hurricane-force concentrated breath threatening to send off of them flying were it not for the smaller titaness among them keeping them from doing so. \u201cThere we are! Everyone\u2019s nice and dry again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...Thanks mom\u2026\u201d Spiral said sarcastically, his hair now completely frizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, my little angels~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Just one dizzying event after the other.\u201d Lily sighed. \u201cWonder if my equilibrium will ever be the same again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you, Miss Spiral.\u201d Molly sat up, blown over from the gale force of the monolithic woman\u2019s tempest breath. \u201cE-even though I was just a liiiiiitle afraid you were going to swallow, it was kind...fun? I mean, thanks for saying we\u2019re tasty and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly.\u201d Spiral stated in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? She complimented us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW you\u2019re getting it Molly!\u201d Alena cackled, patting her sister on the back with a finger. The orange goth chuckled along nervously, but smiled nevertheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe. Now, what else should we do, hmmm? We still have so much of the day left!!!\u201d Miss Spiral announced gleefully down. \u201cWe couuuuuld explore some planets together, ooohhhhhh or play hide and seek!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom we sort of can\u2019t survive off of you in the deep recesses of the airless vacuum of space.\u201d Lily mentioned. \u201cNot to be a buzzkill or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd uh, last time we played hide and seek, I got lost for a week.\u201d Spiral frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky I found you in the nipple crevasse, ey Spiral-Bro? You still owe me for that by the way.\u201d Alena nudged her tiny friend. \u201cAnd stop being such downers guys! Miss S here is just trying to have some fun with us! We\u2019re the only company she\u2019s got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, sweeties, it\u2019s okay! Mommy understands it\u2019s rough spending time with me, but I mean the best for you, no matter how big I ge-\u201d Her cheerfulness paused mid-sentence. She seemed to be distracted now, mind wandering elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh, Mom, you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, mom, helloooooo? We were talking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Spiral?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlena grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Miss Spiral grinned as well in return, a star\u2019s worth of gleam shining off of her perfectly white teeth. \u201cOoooh, I feel it, babies. Momma\u2019s gonna grow again!\u201d In response, her body shuddered, rolling quakes that they could feel coming from miles away. \u201cBack between my boobs you all go, for safety reasons~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard her everyone!\u201d The smaller 100 foot giantess chuckled, picking them all up and holding them close while the hemisphere of her palm shifted, lowering them back down to her sports bra and subsequently the abyssal space of her cleavage, dropped and deposited, giving her chest a little jiggle once she felt them land. Grinning even wider, from ear to ear, she sighed pleasantly, already miles adding onto her figure within seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere I grow~\u201d She announced to the solar system, stretching for all the world to see, turning towards it and watching it dwindle before her enormity. The planet darkened in the shadow of her astronomical form that was cast, from everywhere when everyone looked up, all they could see was Miss Spiral, growing larger and larger exponentially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBiiiiiiiiggg\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBIIIIIGGGG BIG BIGGGGG~!!!!!!!\u201d She laughed, voice echoing far past the reaches of our own star system. It carried on for a short time after, but soon stopped, reaching a point where her growth ended with a large \u2018bang\u2019, body jolting. \u201cMMMMmmmmmaahhhhh!\u201d A pleasurable sigh escaped her lips. \u201cThat was soooooooo nice! Growth spurts are always welcome, and that one felt great! Now, let\u2019s see how itty bitty earth is now\u2026~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering down, the monolithic mother could only grin. She held up her fingers for comparison, earth now an easily pinchable pebble between the appendages. \u201cOh myyy, how teeny\u2026\u201d Miss Spiral chuckled, eyes following the tiny world she once called home, even giggling even more upon watching the fleck of rock once known as the moon crash into her nail, dissipating against it easily. \u201cOopsies! Sorry about that!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ellen Spiral\u2019s bosom now blocked out the sun for over 90% of the globe, basking the planet in perpetual night, and with the accidental annihilation of the moon, control of the Earth\u2019s tides were now out of control, flooding and tsunami occurring across the globe, submerging dozens of coastal cities within a few minutes. An emergency gathering of UN leaders took place in New York, mostly with other delegates appearing by internet video messaging in order to address this critical issue. An unanimous vote was reached within minutes, all to decide that due to the loss of the moon, a grand exodus of humanity was needed onto the titanic form of the one who caused the problem, the only currently safe proposal to avoid the calamity that was befalling the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, well, it looks like nothing bad happened from Mr. Moon going away,\u201d Miss Spiral smiled in her flawed observance. \u201cLooks like everything\u2019s gonna be A-OK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid, uh, Mom just say SHE DESTROYED THE MOON?!\u201d Spiral yelled, panic setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like she didn\u2019t do it last week too,\u201d Lily reminded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just reset stuff later,\u201d Alena casually shrugged, as if cleaning up Miss Spiral\u2019s messes were commonplace. \u201cI\u2019d do anything to keep my future wife growing and happy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet despite all that power, you can\u2019t find a part-time job\u2026\u201d Molly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Like they\u2019re gonna hire me after all the times I\u2019ve stomped Sizemore into the ground! I enjoy my lazy life, thank you very much\u2026 Miss Giga Goth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you not to call me that around Spiral!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uhhh, don\u2019t really mind that, Mols.\u201d Spiral added quietly, to which the shared a quick glance then turned away from one another with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I almost forgot!\u201d the titanic mother said aloud, using her right finger to tug open her sports bra and reveal light onto the small denizens between her massive orbs. \u201cIs everyone alright down there? Hope you enjoyed my visit from Mr. Growth Bug~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeahhh mom, we\u2019re fine, don\u2019t worry about us.\u201d Lily called upwards with a wave to the enormous emerald eye that gazed down towards them, so blurred by the haze of distance they might as well use a telescope to look up towards it. To them, she was still simply beyond enormous, now just more emphasis on her scale than beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re all okay! I know Mr. Growth Bug can be scary sometimes, but trust me, all it does is make mommy bigger and better in every way imaginable!\u201d She laughed gleefully, the echo of her voice alone shaking nearby worlds. \u201cI\u2019m going to check back up on earth, get our scheduled resupply visit ready which the tiny world leaders promised us, then we can carry on the rest of our day together! Heehee, though, while you\u2019re all in there, can\u2019t let a ripe opportunity to share some love pass up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her bra snap shut, enveloping them all within the warm darkness of her astronomical abyss of her cleavage, Miss Spiral cupped both of her mammoth mammaries comparable to a megaplanet in each hand, giving them a playful squeeze before slowly pressing them together gently. For her tiny occupants, it was a rumble beyond comparison as the fleshy monoliths on either side of them began to squeeze together until they were practically touching, smushing them all even further. Eventually she let go from her playful boobhug, each orb bouncing slightly before returning to a resting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNowwwwww, little bitty earth, I\u2019m really sorry about the moon!\u201d Her gaze turned back towards the tiny planet, lowering her face until her eye was level with it, most continents only able to see green in the endless sky above. \u201cThoughhh, you seem to be doing just fine without it. Hehe.\u201d She squinted, sight roaming over the green and brown landmasses, the unnoticeable crashing blue of the ocean. A single blink from her parted the atmosphere, an eyelash nearly crashing into the planet and shearing it. \u201cStill, all\u2019s forgiven, right? I\u2019ll take your silence as a yes. Kisses!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world\u2019s view went from her eye to her golden flesh, her nose, then the pink of her lips, puckered, blowing one massive \u201cMwah!\u201d That sent a blasting shockwave of air, almost obliterating whatever was beneath. Definitely a town or two had been displaced, as well as most of the landscape now flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve played nice and made up, could you pretty pretty please send up those supplies? My babies need a fresh batch of everything! Chop-chop to it now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from earth, Miss Spiral giggled to herself as her back faced the planet now. \u201cHehe. Since I accidentally broke your moon, I hope you don\u2019t mind if I substitute it with mine.\u201d Hooking her thumbs around the waistband of her tight elastic shorts, she stuck out her tongue playfully as she pulled them down, enough so to tuck them just underneath the shelf of her fully bouncing cheeks, now the view for billions simply the jiggling of her giga-ass, occasionally dubbed the gigass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be there while they make the delivery?\u201d Spiral asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaw, they won\u2019t mess with anything. Plus, I\u2019m wayyyy too comfy in here to ever leave it.\u201d Alena sighed, nuzzling into the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lazy ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now. Careful, or you\u2019ll end up underneath it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Spiral would never punish me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno bro...sis. I-it\u2019s the drawn line between whether she likes her kids or y-you more. A-and I think we shouldn\u2019t test that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMolly, the voice of reason here.\u201d Lily added with a nod.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knows how to get what she wants, no matter who she steps on, both literally and figuratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Beautiful in a strange sense of the world. Ghostly pale skin, but incredibly soft and supple. Extreme, gravity-defying curves, with a large H-cup rack and a butt to match. Her hair is long and straight, normally either pure black or shades of purple, her favorite color. Wears tight, form-fitting leather clothing that reveals quite the amount of skin, but always has on her signature white boots that go up to her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiography: Considered by most to be the devil in disguise. No matter what size, Rouge will be, as she sees herself, a goddess amongst insects who she barely deems worthy to grace the bottom of her boots. All shall fear and tremble before her, and might throw in a bit praise her way if they know what's good for them.</span></div></div>",

As she stood there, hands on hips, legs astride, she bit her lip, \"fucking AWESOME!\" was all she could say as she looked around at the now tiny landscape. Now fully 1,000 feet tall she towered over most things in the vicinity, hills on the horizon were bigger, but not much else. She smiled as she looked down at the ruins of her mansion under her white booted feet, \"ho-hum, won't need that any more\", she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself, dressed in a tight black leather catsuit with the zip open revealing a lot of her ample cleavage, the trouser legs poured into her trademark white boots which went over the knee and approached her thighs. She had teamed this with a matching wide white belt around her waspish waist and a matching pair of white over the elbow gloves worn over the catsuit arms. Her long straight hair, black with streaks of purple poured down her back. Pausing to trample the rest of her estate into the ground she delighted in the delicate crunches as the houses of her employees disappeared under stomping boots with the added frisson that some of the now tiny ants that served her were also being buried underfoot. \"They are all fucking insects anyway\", she drawled, \"not worthy to grace even the soles of my boots\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was used to getting what she wanted, as she grew up her adoptive parents showered money and gifts on her, she had them around her little finger. They were totally unaware of who she really was, she was a cute though demanding and strangely pale baby when they adopted her. As she grew up more further unsettling traits developed. She had a sense of her own superiority, she treated the servants dreadfully, getting them running around, clearing after her, especially after her quite frequent tantrums, which often involved breaking things. Also a fussy eater, if something displeased her she tossed it on the floor or at the wall and occasionally was known, when she had some of her followers/groupies around, to trample the feast laid before them, her followers didn't go along with this at their peril. She was the owner of an incredible amount of clothes footwear and jewellery, a lot of of which she had never worn, though she often had pleasure in ruining once worn clothing, by say diving into her pool fully clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the years passed, her parents who were relatively elderly passed away leaving her a fortune. It was then that her true colours revealed themselves. Her thoughts grew darker, her superiority complex grew further, she lost her followers, discarded as inadequate not worthy scum. She took to wearing unusual outfits, superhero style, often tight fitting to emphasize her obvious features, an ample butt and an ample pair of boobs, and had taken to wearing tall white boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer employees were scared stiff of her, which pleased her greatly. They were often too scared to leave as Rouge made sure life became even more difficult for them. She was still prone to violent fits of temper and frequently her property bore the brunt. But lately she had been quieter, and stayed in her room a lot more. Something was going on. It was almost as if she was preparing for something. It was in the middle of trashing one of her kitchens as the food had displeased her that she suddenly stopped, dropping some plates, and stood totally still, and almost in a trance went to her main bedroom suite. There she stayed and the staff heard nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly one morning it happened, Rouge started growing, \u201caaaaah! The time has come! Blessed relief! The goddess is rising\u201d, as she crashed through the roof of her house and grew more and more and more\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving trampled her now previous life underfoot she was ready to face her destiny, and did she know it\u2026\u2026.standing still again white booted leather clad legs apart, gloved hands on hips, boobs jutting out, straining the catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe time has come, the time of Goddess Rouge, time for you worthless insects to bow down and worship if you know what is good for you, time to trash this fucking planet!\u201d. With that she put one booted foot forward, which crashed onto a nearby village crushing much of it flat and then started strolling\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted worshippers to play with, lots of them, she wanted a city. The country landscape meant nothing to her as her bootsteps trampled farmsteads, smashed villages in her way, deformed railway tracks, brought down powerlines, squished trees and lakes: \"fucking country bumpkins, not worth even bothering with, not that city dwellers are much better\", she laughed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city was the other side of a narrow valley, just wide enough for goddess Rouge to go through. Rouge proceeded through trampling the river, causing banks to burst, and trampling on waterfront properties. She even playfully ran her gloved hands across the hilltops wiping out all that was there. Going round a bend in the valley she saw the city gleaming before her. She was delighted, such a big city, so many potential worshippers, for her to toy with, spare some, trample others.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so lost in her thoughts that she almost didn't see a bridge across the valley, laden with cars........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooops! Shit, I nearly didn't see that\", she said as she stopped abruptly. Too high up the valley sides for her to just step on, she looked at all the life on the bridge and smiled, \"let's have some fun\". She could see and almost taste the palpable fear of all the people in their cars crossing the bridge as they saw the big shadow come over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be afraid, be very afraid, for I am about to crush you, hahahaha!\". Which is exactly what she did. Tearing the bridge apart she let some of it crash to the valley below while she held the centre span and put in front of her eyes to take a closer look. The fear and panic was terrible. Even more so when she visibly licked her lips. \"Nah! Won't do that yet\". She then proceeded to wring the bridge span with her gloved hands and squeezed it and all that hadn't fallen off. You could see her fingers indent the metal and you could even see specks of red on her gloves as 100s were crushed for gratuitous fun. A capricious goddess, the world was in great danger..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing her white leather gloves in the river just beyond where the bridge was, she stood up and strode towards the city, pausing only to smash the airport, and there she stood in all her glory, gloved hands on hips, leather clad boobs jutting out, legs apart,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the city and addressed its inhabitants:-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, scum, bow to your goddess!\"</span></div></div>",

Rouge seeing this happening, giggled to herself before launching herself forward, which is what she intended to do anyway, she couldn't give a shit about the miserable microbes, only fit for squishing beneath her boots. CRUNCH! saw a major shopping and office complex collapse to gales of laughter, before she sauntered across acres and acres of suburban streets watching them explode underfoot with a delightful crunch. Sometimes they did explode into flames burning a large part of the nearby neighbourhood.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now hand on hips taking big lazy strides, crashing down on wherever she pleased, a school campus, a petrol station, which took out several neighbouring streets as it exploded, kicked over some residential highrises watching them fall like dominoes, smashed a traffic intersection, crushed a plane overhead, killing all on board. This was happening at foot level too as block after block collapsed under her lolloping strides. She was in her element, a goddess of total devastation. As the noise of destruction crescendoed, she burst out in gales of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUELCH! \"What the hell was that?\", she said giggling. She knew full well as she lifted up her booted foot and saw blood and mush dripping from it, \"that's fucking cooool\", she drooled.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge smiled as she sat atop her throne gazing down at the world. It was all her's. She was a true Goddess over this puny planet. All living things were less than the dirt on the bottoms of her boots. She was reminded of this when gazing down at all her servants. Rouge sat regally in a beautiful and utterly massive throne with her legs crossed. Today her outfit of choice was a dark leather skirt and a leather corset-style top that did very little to hide her torso, of course with her favorite white thigh-highs on. All of humanity was spread before her awaiting her command. Rouge looked down at them all and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single person began to walk towards her. To her they were mere inches away but there were miles between them and her. She silently watched as the millions of specks all brought themselves towards her. It was all one conglomerated mess of people who went on for at least a couple feet from Rouge's perspective. The sheer density of the crowds made the ground beneath them utterly invisible. It was an impressively massive number of people all huddled together before their Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in near-perfect unison all these people bowed before Rouge. The Goddess smiled as she planted both feet on the ground before the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people moved to her boots and began to lick them clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what people were now: boot-lickers: a glorified cleaning group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many years had it been...four...five? People weren't sure. Dates lost all meaning once Rouge ruled the world. Before the world was far from perfect but people could live. There were corrupt governments and jerks everywhere but it was still a nice world. Then Rouge appeared. She existed before of course. In fact, she was a very successful woman. Born with incredible looks and charm Rouge found herself marrying one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the world. Overnight she went from town idol to global icon. It would've been fine if it stopped there but of course it didn't. About a year passed and Rouge's husband vanished, gone without a trace. He never appeared again so as his will stated she inherited all his income and wealth. There were many rumors of foul play but no one could ever find proof and Rouge had a good enough persona with the media that people quickly forgot. With her now in charge her corporation rose to the top. They fearlessly and mercilessly took down any and all competition and rose to be the greatest company in the world. There wasn't a single facet of life her company didn't have a hand in. Entire countries relied on her company and Rouge led all these deals herself. In a way she personally controlled the way the world worked. Even that would've been fine. Then it happened. No one knew what but one day Rouge towered over everything. She became a giantess, a 100-mile tall giantess. Some said she got that way through an experiment. Some said she had people research a way to do it. Some said it was just God's sick joke to give her that power. Whatever the reason Rouge became Earth's giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first statement which she bellowed out to the entire world made it clear how this would go. \"I am your Goddess. Worship me or die.\" It was clear and to the point, much like the woman herself. Of course no one listened to her. That was when the casualties started piling up. Rouge began to visit cities and demand worship. Those who were scared enough by her size lived after pleasing her. Those who didn't listen...they met cruel fates. No one was entirely sure what she did but stories claimed Rouge stomped out entire cities in one step. She drowned people with her spit. Sat on a country. Picked up a city and dropped it. Ate people. All manner of vile things no one would put past the woman. Needless to say it didn't take long before the military got involved. Which military you might ask? Easy, <i>all </i>of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an hour for the assault to begin. In a coordinated barrage of all of America's best weaponry Rouge was hit with everything they got and more. Other nations who could sent in their own attack force to counter the gigantic threat. It was enough firepower to destroy an entire country, and Rouge merely laughed it off. \"Oh dear, I think you singed my skin.\" Everyone remembered the deep, seductive, echoing laugh that spread across the planet when that happened. For their transgressions Rouge quickly visited every capital in the world and disposed of it. In a single day almost all nation leaders were dead. Those who remained alive listened to whatever the giantess asked of them. It quickly became a daily routine to worship Rouge and address her as Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not all though. Even when she'd won Rouge was far from done. Her first order of business was to round up all the people into the world so that they could be in one convenient place to worship her. Such a plan took time, even for Rouge, but before long everyone was in a single location. Of course there's no city in the world big enough to fit that many people. Even after the rampage a couple billion people still lived. They spread to as many cities as they could that were nearby but inevitably more than a fair share of people died. What remained was all that was left of humanity: less than half a billion, spread out to several cities close enough Rouge barely needed to move to go to any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone properly loyal and moved her first order of business was to build a throne. Or more accurately, for everyone else to build a throne. This was the first task she gave as a Goddess. With her bare hands Rouge destroyed as many cities as she felt like and gave the raw materials to her slaves to build her a throne that she could sit and look down at them from. Such a task seemed impossible, but lead by Rouge it got done. Piece-by-piece the throne got built and the Goddess assembled it together herself at the end and sat upon it proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the new rules. By law under penalty of death it was required that all people obey these rules. Rouge was your Goddess. You must always do as she commands no matter what it is. Even if she told you to die you should be happy to. Likewise all other religions were abolished. In its place was the Red Church, a church dedicated to worshiping Rouge. It was another rule that you attend that church daily, after which you follow yet another rule which declared you worship Rouge all day. Society existed solely to worship their Goddess. Food, water, personal belongings, it all became irrelevant. Your only necessity was to worship Rouge. People quickly grew hungry and thirsty and before they knew it their supplies from the time before Rouge dwindled. They couldn't travel to get other food and growing crops took time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bold soul tried to inform Rouge of this. After humoring the man's complaints she laughed and stomped him into the ground. \"Are you bugs stupid or something? <i>I'm</i> all you need. If you need food lick up the crumbs from the bottom of my feet. If you need water drink whatever you can find. Even if it's my sweat or natural oils. You're all lucky that I bless you with that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne might ask how Rouge still fed and cared for herself? That's easy: her company. The one organization permitted to exist in the new world was Rouge's old company, which now had the sole duty of enforcing her will. The rest of the planet became grounds where they created all the things she desired. She wanted clothes so her company made them. She wanted food so it was grown. She wanted a church she got a church. It was either obey her or join the people in the slums before her. It was an easy choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been years since this became the norm. Each day everyone would worship Rouge and do what she commanded. Some days that meant just cleaning her boots, sometimes it meant humor one of her games. It was all dependent on her will. Every once in a while someone would try to defy Rouge. She took great pleasure in punishing them in front of everyone. She had completely bent the human species to her will. Now people by the millions gladly licked her favorite boots clean as she mocked them for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a large amount of time her boots were cleaned and Rouge gazed upon them with a satisfied look.\"Very good my little germs. This pleases your Goddess. Now then...What shall we do next?\"</span></div></div>",

In a panicked flurry all the slaves before her boots pushed and shoved their way amidst the crowds to get away from the giantess, anyone who didn't make it far enough would almost surely be crushed. There was almost a perverse gleam in the Goddess's eyes as she hurriedly moved a foot onto a knee. Noting the fresh blood-stains from her last movement she smirked and plucked the boot off, gently lowering it on its side beside her throne. Likewise she pulled her other boot off and put it near opposite end of her throne, with both boot openings now facing eachother. The Goddess inspected the footwear for a moment before silently nudging the pair closer with her feet so that they were nearly touching. Everyone watched curiously as they awaited Rouge's words informing them of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall need...a thousand of you pests. Step forward. Your Goddess commands it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo step forward would almost certainly mean death, but if no one stepped up then who knew how many more would die? One by one volunteers stepped up, sacrificing themselves to protect their friends and families. Barely a minute passed before the gap between Rouge's boots was completely filled with over two thousand people, twice what the Goddess had requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to satisfy her, evident by a deep laugh escaping her purple-covered lips. \"Excellent. As you may know lately I've grown somewhat bored of your lackluster performances and repetitive worship. Normally I'd just crush you all into nothing for failing your Goddess but I think I have a better idea. One more...<i>interesting</i>.\" Rouge laughed to herself, \"I call it the Goddess Games. Think of it like the Olympics from before my reign except all are games I personally chose and moderate. Whichever groups actually manage to win any of these games shall get a nice reward from me personally. Now then, with that being said you lucky little germs by my boots get to compete in the first game!\" The giantess's fingers clapped together repeatedly in what sounded like thunder. \"Get into a straight row in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs commanded everyone who stepped up to compete got into a single line spanning halfway past each boot. With a smirk Rouge knelt from her throne and used a long, purple nail to dig a line right in the middle of the row. \"Now you're split into teams. Now each team go into one of my boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of trespassing on such sacred ground as Rouge's favorite boots frightened more than a few but they did as commanded, with roughly a thousand people going inside each of the boots. In the distance they could stare past the opening into the other boot where the other team was just as nervous. High above Rouge silently reached for her head and plucked a single, long, violet hair from her head, placing it between her boots. \"This is a simple game of tug and war. I want you all to grab my hair and get ready, when I say go I want you to start pulling...I don't think I need to say what happens if you lose?\" As the people began to defeatedly pick up Rouge's hair and get ready for the game of their lives a loud snap drew all their attention. \"Just because you aren't in the game doesn't mean you can slack off you ants! Come here and worship my toes!\" Once the rest of the people gathered around Rouge's feet, properly pampering her soles as well as polish her throne it was finally time. Rouge saw her hair held up by two opposing lines of people that went far enough back they vanished into her boots, just as she had envisioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight off the bat everyone pulled with all their might. In this world ruled by Rouge there weren't many who had the luxury of muscle or even weight to try and turn things one way or the other. Really it was a couple thousand malnourished, broken people pulling with all their might. The closer a team would get to winning the further inside a boot they would go, usually resulting in enough of a effect that the other team would regain themselves and pull them back out. They were so weak, so tired, so broken that even holding up Rouge's hair was wearing on the people's muscles. It did not take long before some got exhausted. But still the match was an overall stalemate. It was pitiful to watch. Their lives were on the line but with how they acted you could barely tell they were trying, even if it was literally everything they could ever hope to muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing that tipped the scales of the contest. By pure luck one team had more elderly and children than another. They were quickest to fatigue and once they fell it was only a matter of time before they started to get dragged from their station in Rouge's boot. With extra vigor the team that was winning pulled themselves deeper into the massive footwear until finally you couldn't even see them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" Rouge's godly voice declared. \"I think we have a winner here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sighs of relief on one side and dread on the other everyone released the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast now, losers better grab that hair again, you aren't done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and more than a bit frightened, the losing team grabbed their make-shift rope again. With a dominating smile Rouge effortlessly plucked up the other end and with it all of the team who grabbed a hold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on being the first losers of the Goddess Games. I would say I'm disappointed in you but that would mean I have the slightest expectations for microbes like all of you.\" She laughed. \"Now I suppose you all are ready for your punishment then?\" Rouge smirked as she lifted herself out of her throne. Her massive bare feet destroyed countless human homes and settlements with zero concern as she toyed with the thread full of people desperately hanging on. The Goddess stopped just short of a mountain range that stood at a trivial ten miles tall. Nothing before Rouge. Her fingers released and dropped the hair along with all of its people on the snowy peak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home. I'd hurry out of there if I were you. If I remember right freezing to death is more than a little bit painful.\" The Goddess laughed. Just to make sure they'd suffer she flung up some snow and boulders with her fingers and buried them all. If any of the people weren't dead they sure wished they would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always fun to be a Goddess!\" Rouge laughed, returned to her throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for your reward my little champions.\" Rouge lifted up her boot with all the winners in it. I do believe I need a new toe ring and you lot seem just perfect for the job. Your new job is to get busy making me a new platinum toe-ring and I want it in two weeks. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes Goddess!!\" The people answered. After all that their reward was an impossible chore that they'd somehow have to get done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now get to work!\" Rouge lowered all the people from her boot and watched them scurry away to work. After putting her boots back on she then had everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, time for the next game!\"</span></div></div>",

In her size, she is quick to look at the human race as more of a plaything for her amusement. Simply lives which can simply be snuffed out when she's tired of looking at them, which with her doesn't take long. Not to mention, the cruelty in which she does so caries depending on the severity of her fowl mood from day to day, aka making her a Giant no one wants to deal with, and a potential Goddess everyone fears the day of.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dark days have since descended upon the Earth, and it began 19 years ago with the birth of a particular girl, Trish Pierce. Even since her childhood, she had been trouble, growing up most of her life as a normal child, she like much of the world would be unaware of what exactly she was and an ability she possessed, though lacked control of.It had began when she was sixteen, she grew up much of her life a girl angry at the world. Her background not being the best, growing up in a rough household. Earning her more than a few names and a bad reputation on that merit alone, though the more limbs she broke didn't help her case either. Trish was violent, pure and simple, and whilst the octagon may have been a place for her to vent, it would not last. After the age of sixteen the world would see a rather terrifying development in Trish, she would go from a normal 5'4\" girl to an astonishing 30 foot monster. Shocked, stunned and a but elated by this, it wouldn't take Trish long to begin to abuse her power over the rest of society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, that's when the Companies stepped in to halt this, after all, Trish was a normal girl, just bigger, she still had needs in which the companies would supply her with if she played nice, something which would work for a year or two. Fast forward to her current 19 year old self and one will find that the Companies iron fist over the giant punk was far from enough anymore. She was no longer a simple 30 foot tall girl, she was now a 1000 tall behemoth which made the rest of the human race look like ants to her. The Companies which supplied her with her food, water, clothes and other perks, they no longer supplied her to keep her from causing trouble, they supply her to save their own lives from her wrath. Trish had made it clear to them long ago, that they were only alive due to their importance to her, to take away their importance would make them outlive their usefulness. Since then, many cities around the country simply sat in fear, going along with their normal lives, fearing for either the day she would become even bigger and simply stomp the entire continent out of existence, or that she would show up for a \"visit\" in their city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for a metropolis up North, that would be the case. It had been a relatively normal day for the citizens of the city, they going about their busy lives, gridlock traffics, bullet trains zipping around, the sidewalk nearly without an empty space on it as people continues to walk about. Though this would be until they felt the first tremor. The ground shaking lightly underneath them, causing a few people to simply stop in place, only to get shoved forward by the crowd. Many just ignoring it all together as a minor tremor and nothing more. Though it would return and this time, it's intensity growing, soon followed by another and another until a shadow passed over the city and a maniacal chuckle to fill the air. Many screams broke out and many fingers were pointed to the sky as they all looked up at the 1000 foot tall Trish who stood on the outskirts of their city. Not even the tallest building able to reach past her chest. This would only cause a confident smirk to form on her lips which currently held the worlds largest cigarette between them. The end lit and a puff of smoke coming from her slightly parted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her first step into the city, Trish's DC shoe would blot out the sky for many who were locked into the highway, a large traffic jam of cars from owners simply abandoning them. Many of the unfortunate souls who didn't follow there lead would find themselves under it's shadow, only able to look up through their sunroofs or windshields to see the biggest foot any of them had ever seen falling upon them. Although far from calculated, it was nothing more than a simple action from Trish, the act of walking which already was causing the death tool to go up as he foot would come down. Easily compacting these cars into the street as if they were a paper cup, flattening them under her weight, causing blood,oil and even steel to simply coat the treds of her shoes as they leaked out from underneath her weight. Something she would barely notice as she would look down, an annoyed glare from her. <b>\"Get out of my way you pathetic fuckin' ants.\"</b> She would practically shout, causing many glass pane windows in these skycrapers to simply vibrate and many citizens to cover their ears.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>People would try to flee in fear, some running to safety while others were caught in the mob of traffic and panic, only to end up as one of many smears underneath Trish's street-filling shoe sole. She casually stamped her way through the city, glaring down and noting everything with a bored, apathetic sneer, even going out of her way to make sure her leg or foot crashed through some of the smaller buildings mid stride. Catastrophe and debris was name of the game as the enormous girl smashed her way left and right, even knocking over some buildings 'accidentally' with shoves of her elbow or mid-swing of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was such a common occurrence, and everyone knew they could do nothing to stop her. Sure, if she were smaller, but that was too long ago, and now if they were to risk attacking her the consequences would be fatal. The many global corporations supporting her had many a government in their pockets, and Trish herself was a force of nature. If she were attacked and was to survive, hell on earth would occur that day. For now all they could do to satiate the giant punk was to keep her as happy as possible, and unfortunately that was letting her do whatever she pleased with the 'ants' below, and even worse was that she liked to crush ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took another draw from her cigarette, letting a wash of black smoke fog over the city skyline, she coughed and discarded the building-sized stub, letting it slam down and crush some poor unsuspecting bugs. <b>\"God, that was my last cigarette too.\"</b> She thundered, making sure the anger creeping into her voice was known. <b>\"That pisses me off.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could fully enact her petty wrath for finishing off her last cig, she paused, looking almost . . . calm. This confused most people staring up at her, an unnatural wave of calm washing over the city, only broken by the occasional siren and bit of crumbling concrete that had forgotten to fall over. Slowly, a grin began to spread across Trish's face. This grin bore no sense of goodwill, but instead malice.<b> \"Well ants,\" </b>She boomed, feeling a familiar sensation run through her body. Growth. <b>\"It looks like you all are getting upgrades-\"</b> She laughed, her body beginning to shudder, and to the horror of the tiny people below, her already towering form began to shoot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"-To microbes.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowth for Trish had always been an odd deal. It was almost pleasurable in a sense, but didn't happen nearly enough for her to properly enjoy it. Fortunately for her, and unfortunately for the rest, that was compensated by the fact that as she grew older, her growth spurts seemed to exponentially increase to drastic numbers. When she was sixteen, three years later after her initial growth, she was three hundred feet. Eighteen, five hundred. And only a year later, doubled that at a thousand. Now she was growing again, and it felt like a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expanding form crashed into everything surrounding her, either knocking it over, bulldozing, or simply making it explode just from contact. Unfortunately her clothing couldn't be saved. Her supporters had invested in different fabrics that could stretch to accommodate her when she grew, but even that could only go so far. Her shoes were left ripped and torn until she simply kicked them away, letting her bare feet slam down back in place. Her jeans and tanktop became shreds of cloth that simply fell of, her growing body quickly leaving everything behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Trish herself was surprised by her growth. It was going on long, three minutes in and she didn't even seem to be done yet, and by that point she felt as if she had long since should have stopped. Where had all this size come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did stop eventually. Once the last burst of growth died down within her, and her slight confusion and awe left, Trish sneered and laughed, lifting up her foot and finishing off whatever survivors remained far below with her sole, relishing the slight 'crunch' of entire city districts, the landscape shaking with a resounding shockwave that carried on long after she had set her foot down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now loomed over, well, mostly everything at an astounding 100 miles tall, surveying the landscape from a position high above the clouds, her naked body now dominating most of the horizon, her toned form from years in the gym visible for all to see, and she didn't care. She was a goddess now, let them oggle, but let them know they must do it reverence and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Aww, I wanted to be bigger.\"</b> She chuckled, not even bothering to lower her voice, words echoing for miles with an ear-deafening boom. <b>\"Oh well, maybe next time I can get to continent-stomping. But for now, city stomping's good.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish placed her hands on her hips and looked down at her handiwork, the landscape scarred into nothing but dirt from her simply growing where a city and hundreds of thousands of people used to be. Far below, somehow her eyes had caught something. A tiny sliver of something by her shins, probably the highest it could go. She sneered again. <b>\"What, the little plane a little lost? Sorry fuckers, wherever you were landing is under me now.\" </b>The punk thundered deeply into laughter, slowly lowering her hand, pinkie finger extended, going out of her way to maliciously ruin the lives of all those who were smaller than she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey really had no time to react or maneuver as a wall of flesh miles wide suddenly appeared before them, the plane slamming into Trish's pinkie in a fiery explosion that she could barely see. With a laugh she wiggled the appendage, letting whatever debris had stuck to it fall off the remaining eleven miles below.</span></div></div>",

Usually, she's quite calm when it comes to most things, but she's known to be quite the confident gal, and quite the talker too. Overall, she's a rather nice girl, and whatever height she ascends to, Jackie will be a kind giantess...well, if she's feeling like it.

Jackie's E-cup breasts are definitely one of her main attractions, paired with her gorgeous curves and a perfect round butt shaped by years of exercise and hard work. By default, Jackie stands an already impressive 7'6\" thanks to her gracious puberty, and her standard measurements are 42 x 28 x 40. She normally wears a tight-fitting tank top, cut-off jean shorts, and boots, but she's known to wear flip-flops on occasion, and usually moreso than not, one could find her barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiography: A simple cowgirl from a small town deep in the heart of Texas.

Perhaps it'd be best if you heard her tale straight from the cowgirl herself... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy y'all! So, y'all wanna know my story, huh? Well, it's a bit of a long tale, so y'all better sit a spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born on my family's small cattle farm in Canker, Texas, youngest of three children and the only girl in the family. My older brothers are quite the wily fellas, always been wranglin' up cattle and ridin' horses 'cross the ranch ever since I could remember. I always wanted to be just like my brothers, but my momma and daddy tried to steer me away from all that, tryin' to get me to play 'Princess' and all that like the other girls my age. I, of course, didn't wanna have none'a that - I always tried to play 'Cowgirl' as often as I could instead. Momma always said I wasn't cut out to be a cowgirl like my brothers were, that as the ladies of the family, we weren't suppose'ta 'get our hands dirty' like them - we were suppose'ta be the pretty ones. But I told Momma I wanted to be both a tough cowgirl and pretty at the same time. Momma told me I'd have to work really hard if that's what I really wanted to do, that I'd haveta get big 'n strong, bigger 'n stronger than any other gal in Canker. I told Momma that I'd become the biggest 'n strongest girl on Earth to fulfill my dream, and she simply chuckled 'n wished me luck. I know Momma didn't believe I could do it, but on that day, I pledged that I would never forget my promise. On that day, I took destiny in my hands and told it to listen, 'cause like it or not, I was gonna be the biggest gal the world was ever gonna see! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did everything I could to achieve my dream: I ate lotsa healthy foods and milk, even sneakin' one or two of my brothers' special milkshakes once in a while - you know, the ones they have at them fancy stores, protein shakes I think? - I tried to help out on the farm whenever I could - herding cattle, liftin' feed, all sortsa things - and most importantly, I said a prayer to God every night. Before I went to bed, I folded my hands in prayer and said, 'God, it's me, Jackie. Please make me grow big 'n strong, bigger than all've Your other humble sheep. I wanna be bigger 'n 'em all to show 'em that I ain't no pushover and that I can do anything I put my mind to. Oh please, Lord, grant me this prayer. Thank you, Lord.' I kept training hard every day, mainly after school mostly, but I can tell y'all something, I was definitely the strongest gal in the entire school! Sure, I was about as average-lookin' on the outside as you can get, but everything started changin' real quick 'round 7th grade... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, 'fore I knew it, my entire body was changin' faster than a cricket jumps on a peach fruit in summertime! Momma said I was goin' through 'the changes' and was 'becomin' a bona fide proper lady now', but my teacher said it was somethin' called 'puberty' and that everyone'd be goin' through it now too. Well, I don't know about them, but my changes were mighty fierce! Before I was in high school, I was the biggest gal in my entire class of 50 kids, standin' over 6' tall by my freshman year. Heck, I was even bigger than Daddy and my brothers now too! Felt real good to be the biggest one in the family for once. 'Course I wasn't done there neither! When my girls starting comin' in - y'all know what I mean! - I started attractin' a lot more attention 'round town too. Nobody could believe a farm gal like me could be so strong 'n pretty-like! By sophomore year, I'd gotten even bigger, taller than even all the boys in school now, and my girls had gotten so big that they were even bigger than Momma's! I just couldn't believe it! After goin' to church one weekend, Momma and her friends suggested I try out for Miss Canker, our local beauty pageant. Momma had always wanted me to be in those girly things when I was little, but I never wanted to do 'em - they just didn't seem right to a natural-born cowgirl like me. But after a bit a'thinkin', I decided I'd try it out, just for fun, y'know? I never thought I'd actually win the darn thing! Who knew the judges would love my lassoin' skills during the talent portion! Well, after that little victory, I just kept on gettin' bigger n' bigger while keepin' up with school and farm work - it felt so great when my older brothers would ask <b>ME</b> for help on occasion because they weren't strong enough to rassle up some cattle or whatnot. By the time junior year was over, I had stopped gettin' taller, but dangit was I big! Heck, I was the tallest person to ever come outta Canker, being over seven feet tall! People startin' callin' me 'Giant Jackie' and whatnot, asking me how the weather was like up there 'n such, but I loved every second of it, teasin' back that I couldn't see 'em down there past my girls, which by now were healthy D-cups. 'Course lots of people were 'fraid of a tall cowgirl too; I think I scared off all the guys in school since none of 'em were manly enough to ask this gal out to the prom, but I ain't sad at all 'bout it - if they didn't have the balls to ask me out, then they aren't really men I wanna be 'round! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the time I graduated high school, my body had had one last burst'a size, bringing me up to 7'6\" and my girls to E-cups - I was so excited to get all new bras from the new Victoria's Secret that had opened up just a few weeks ago! Anyways, we didn't have enough money saved up to send me to college - not like most other people in my class did neither - so I helped out at the farm afterwards with Momma, Daddy, and my older brothers. For a time, I felt content in what I was doing, but after a few weeks had gone by, I felt myself yearnin' for something greater than workin' on the farm. I remembered my promise to God 'n Momma that I'd be the biggest gal on Earth, that I'd show 'em all that a country girl can do anything she puts her mind to, and I suddenly knew what my purpose in life was supposed'ta be: I was gonna be the biggest, and there was nothin' that would get in my way!\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turns out they were one'na them scientific research companies like they have a lot of in the big cities 'n such. I did a lil' research and found that they were workin' on 'human enhancement products' - y'know, like human growth hormones, muscle powders, and all that futuristic stuff. Well, heck, it was like God himself wanted me to find that company 'cause as sure as sunshine, I applied there and was hired that same day...probably helped that I took Momma's advice and wore a low-cut shirt to show off the girls; guys're always a sucker for a gal with a bust like mine! I couldn't wait to get my hands on their big city research and see iffin' they could make me bigger 'n better, but they said I'd haveta work my way up the ladder first 'fore I could work there. I was pretty sad at first, but I knew that God would pull me through and help me out with every challenge in my way. After packin' up my things and gettin' ready for my new life, I said goodbye to Momma and Daddy and started my new job at Hillbriar as their new 'Executive Sales Girl/Truck Driver'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life on the road sure was tough, and hot too! For the next three years, they sent me all 'cross the country, doing sales interviews and haulin' cargo in every state in this great nation. I didn't mind it though; I was haulin' heavier stuff on the ranch, 'n every sales interview I had always was met with big success, probably 'cause they had never seen a gal as big as me before!

I was super disappointed, I could hear my body beggin' me to find a way to make me bigger than ever, but I just could never find anythin' that worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily for me, God musta heard my prayers one day 'cause the big wigs at Hillbriar called me up and said there was a new job opening at their HQ back in Texas, paying double what I was makin' now! I couldn't believe the news and quickly told my folks 'bout their lil' girl's new job closer to home. I started that next week at the job of my dreams, workin' as a stock gal in their top secret research lab, y'know, where they did all their new testin' 'n stuff. I stayed sorta quiet for the first couple'a weeks or so, but then I started using my 'womanly charms' on some of them scientists; it's so easy for a gal to manipulate those lil' nerds, y'know, especially since I was probably the closest they've ever gotten to talkin' to a real girl in their entire lives. So with a lil' bit'a flirtin' 'n such, I found out that they were workin' on some sorta new experimental hormone to cure world hunger or somethin' or other like that; it was some sorta lame excuse they would give to the public, but they were secretly usin' it to create a 'super-soldier serum' for the military - seemed like somethin' from outta those comics my brothers 'n I used ta read growin' up. Anyways, I couldn't pass up on the opportunity, so I convinced one'na those lil' guys to take me in there one night after the place shut down for the day and let me check it out - a lil' hint, ladies: Give a man a quick kiss 'n he'll do whatever you say! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That night, we went in there, just the two of us, and he showed me what they were workin' on: It was just a big ol' vat of chemicals, all green 'n glowin' 'n such. I asked 'im how the stuff worked 'n such, but he told me it was all still new and hadn't been tested on humans yet so he didn't know what would happen if anyone were to try it. Usin' my charms again, I told 'em to go home and let me lock up the place; another kiss was all it took to send 'em blushin' on home. The second he was gone, I locked the door behind me, shut off the room's security, and jumped in that big ol' vat without another thought - I knew this was God finally providin' a way for me to fulfill my dreams once 'n for all. I don't quite know what was happenin' to me, but all I know is that it felt right as rain. I dived on into that vat 'a green stuff, gettin' my clothes and my entire body from head to toe covered in that stuff. I think I was under for only a few seconds before I tried to swim back up to the top, but for the life of me, I was stuck in the water! Some sorta science-y effect was keepin' me underwater! I started panickin', usin' all my strength to get back up to the surface, but within a few more seconds or so, my breath gave out and I started drownin'...or, at least that's what I thought at first. Yep, I was still alive, y'all! Can't keep Jackie Magnus down that easily! Yee-haw! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was all freaked out in that vat. I was all like, 'How the heck am I doin' this?!', 'til I realized it must've been God that saved me that day. However it happened, all I know is that I started breathin' in naturally underwater, like I was some sorta fish or somethin'. I tried swimmin' up again, but I still couldn't make it past whatever strange force was holdin' me down. Well, a Magnus always makes the best of any situation, so I simply floated there in that vat for a while, though I felt my entire body changin' somethin' fierce. I felt as if my entire body was gettin' bigger 'n stronger, but I wasn't even growin' a single inch. Not only that, but I felt my brain startin' to hurt a bit, and that's when I realized that the green stuff around me was havin' an effect on my entire body. See, I quickly learned that this stuff was actin' on my DNA - that's one of them fancy science terms for the smallest parts of your body - and changin' me on the most basic levels. It was like I was becomin' God Himself! Maybe this was His plan after all, maybe ol' Jackie Magnus was to become His messenger on this planet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little while later, whatever sorta knowledge I was learnin' was comin' through this green stuff's 'unlockin' of my brain potential' since it was actin' on my DNA at the most basic of levels. I also learned that the only way out was to drink my way out; y'see, this stuff had a sorta 'yeast effect' goin' on where it kept me held down in there. It was time for me to unleash the drinkin' power us Magnus's were known for for generations! It musta been a few hours or so, but I drank that entire container of stuff like it was milk or them useless growth shakes I used to try, but by 3:20 AM (at least that's what it said on the clock in the lab), ol' Jackie had finished every last drop of it. Only problem now was how I'd get outta a vat that was a couple times bigger than me without a ladder! I thought hard for a few minutes, but then I realized somethin' was wrong with me: It'd been over eight hours since I was stuck in that vat, and I didn't feel like eatin', drinkin', usin' the bathroom, and I wasn't the least bit tired neither. In fact, I felt like I had just eaten one of Momma's home-cooked meals and was plum full, not to mention feelin' like I had just gotten a full night's sleep. Somethin' was seriously off. That's when my brain started unlockin' more of my potential and I started figurin' out what all that stuff had done to me... \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Me, Jackie Magnus, one of His sheep, had taken His righteous place and was now God, or rather Goddess! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...At least that's what I figured, at least. Y'see, turns out that super-serum of theirs made me, well, super! Might as well've just started callin' myself God right then 'n there. So I did! I learned that that stuff had changed me forever; I no longer needed to do lots of human things like eatin', sleepin', and whatnot, and that I was immortal in a sense - I couldn't die and I'd never age a day older than I was now. Besides all that stuff, I learned I had powers, lots of 'em, that I was pretty much...uh, what's that fancy city word for it again? Om-somethin'? Whatever, let's just say I was just as powerful as God Himself, or heck, even stronger! I could create, destroy, make things outta thin air, control the world as I saw fit, and much more. But most importantly of all, I could get as big as I wanted and nobody could stop me! I couldn't believe what had happened - I never thought a simple gal like me could become God Himself, I mean, Herself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a test of my new powers, I tried out somethin' real simple: I stopped time itself. I focused real hard, and 'fore I knew it, everything 'round me had stopped in place - the clocks, machines, even the owl in mid-flight outside the lab's window, I had stopped it all. I couldn't believe the power I had! Now with all this power in my hands, it was time for Jackie Magnus to make things right, to fulfill my dream and enjoy my new role as Goddess over everyone else! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My first task was t'grow. I tested out my power a bit by tryin' to grow my girls first, my tank top and bra growin' right along with 'em - I made 'em so big they touched the floor, and even at that size, they didn't feel any heavier to me, but judgin' by the cracks they put in the floor, they'd be just as heavy to everyone else! I then shrunk 'em down enough so that they'd be just big enough where I'd have to look past 'em to see the ground, huggin' my new J-cup girls, lookin' bigger 'n healthier than ever before. Now that I could control my size at will, it was time for me to get big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when we Texans say we're going big, you better believe we go bigger than big! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I burst through that lab and kept right on growin' strong, bigger 'n bigger 'n bigger. I could feel my boots completely crushing Hillbriar's HQ beneath 'em after I hit a couple miles, but I still wasn't satisfied. A Magnus never knows when to give up! Thinkin' myself mighty big for now, I stopped growin' once I reached an even 50 miles tall, my mind somehow able to sense exactly how big I had gotten. I simply couldn't believe the view from up here; I could probably see all of Texas from here if I tried real hard, 'n maybe even some of the neighborin' states! All I know is that I never felt more happy in my entire life; I was not only the biggest gal ever, but I was God now, or Goddess actually. The good Lord had heard my prayers and had given me His seat, and now with the power he had blessed me with, I...\" </span></div></div>",

From now on, I was gonna enjoy my life to the fullest, and it would be either my way or the highway! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I had to make a buncha changes to pretty much everythin' 'fore I unfroze time 'n started my new life as Goddess Jackie. Startin' with my size. I concentrated real hard, and in just a little bit'a time, I felt my body sorta solidify at my current height - I was 50 miles tall and there was no way I'd ever consider gettin' any smaller than this ever again, same thing for my big girls. Next off, I did a little bit of reshapin' of my background 'n all that. Hard as it was to do, I erased everythin' 'bout my old life - Momma, Daddy, my brothers, the ranch, every last trace that the ol' Jackie had ever existed I made sure to wipe clean from this an' every other Earth out there. It really was hard for me to do, but with my new size as my 'normal' height, I couldn't stand it if I accidentally crushed the house or anyone in my fam'ly, so doing this was the best means I could thinka to protect everyone the ol' Jackie used'ta love. Once that was all done and there was no trace of me left, I started up on the next part of my changes: Gettin' rid of Hillbriar once 'n for all. 'Course I just did the same thing I had done with my former life - I just erased it from ever existin' in the first place. Wouldn't want any copycats or nothin', now did I? Finally, after all that was done, it was time to come up with my new backstory, how Goddess Jackie came to be, iffin' ya will. Well, being the proud Texan gal I am, I decided I'd at least keep that as part of my history, so I decided on this as my story: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'From where our ranch once stood - now made into abandoned wasteland thanks to me - a big Southern belle emerged, and when I mean \"big\" I mean \"Texas big\". Nobody knows how she got so big 'n strong, but a 50-mile beautiful brunette gal with a massive rack covered by a tight tank top, a pair of Daisy Duke cut-off jeans coverin' her amazin' rear, and her long, strong legs bein' shown off by some high-heeled boots? Can't be more Texan than that! The gal proclaimed herself as Goddess Jackie (that's me!), and that the world and everythin' on it and beyond was hers to do with as she wished. People tried to stop the Goddess at first, but after a lil' demonstration where she crushed the planet between her tits before returnin' it back to normal, humanity realized that the Goddess was here to stay, and that she really was Goddess.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After instillin' my lil' backstory in everyone's minds, I felt like I was ready to go. I took in a deep breath and gave thanks to God for makin' this all possible...and then I thanked myself since <b>I</b> was God now. Once I was all ready, I turned time ahead to 8 AM that day, and after raisin' my right foot high over the closest town to where Hillbriar used to be, I unfroze time. 'Mornin' y'all!' I addressed the world for the first time. 'Goddess Jackie is ready for some fun...' I then dropped my foot down, crushin' the entire town beneath my boot...and it was the greatest feelin' I ever had. 'Mmm-mmm! Dang it's good to be big!' </span></div></div>",

Being realistic, Tanner knew better that his powers didn't allow for anyone or anything to be bigger than him or to steal his powers from his very being. However, the Growth God took in great delight in hearing the words that would come from his daughter's lips every time since she was just 4 years old: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be bigger than you one day, daddy, just you wait.\" She would giggle, then run off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would wish for it, she would drop pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half-dollars, and dollar coins into wishing wells and fountains, she would wish for it on her birthday - as she would blow off the candles, and even to wishing stars, she would offer the same wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be a Giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after countless tries. After so many days where she would say to her father that she would best him in size and scale, after many disappointing days that told her that she wasn't an inch taller - her 17th birthday would soon be. A day that signified the coming-of-age, and with that, one more swing at making her favorite wish. She saw her birthday cake, seventeen candles lit, and the words: \"To my precious, (and hopefully) Gigantic Growing Girl - Jessica.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would look at her father, to which he smiled tenderly back at her. She knew that her father was hoping for the day that her time would come as well. She smiled big, hugged her father, and promised him one more time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I make my wish, I'm going to grow even BIGGER than you daddy.\" She giggled, as she looked back to her cake, closed her eyes, and made one final wish attempt. As she did so, she felt an odd sensation from inside her belly. It was a sort of\u2026 <i>tingling </i>sensation. It quickly disappeared, and with that, her wish was made. She blew off her candles, and she hugged everyone around her, laughed, ate cake, and enjoyed her 17th birthday with friends and family. Everyone was having a great time: Gifts to be had, friendships to be made, and family bonding was more than plenty upon this faithful day of merry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not all was what it seemed in this image of family and friends, as her father and mother had to both head off for work tomorrow - which meant assignments for the two, and plenty of time for the young one to revel in her new found independence. But for now, it was a joyous time for young Jessica to enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and it was closing night for everyone. Clean up was a breeze, and everyone either had headed home, or was heading off to their rooms. All except one man - Jessica's father: Tanner. He was heading towards Jessica's room in order to obtain the time for a Father-Daughter talk about her new independent life. He started by opening the door, and greeting his daughter - who was resting upon her bed. Manga Doujins in toe, Jessica saw her dad come in, and welcomed him inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad, come on in.\" Jessica's cheerful disposition greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" He opened the door, and closed it right behind him. \"So\u2026 you are now 17\u2026 heh\u2026 it was almost a lifetime ago when you first started saying that you planned on getting bigger than your father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know I WILL.\" Jessica giggled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that is what I wish to talk to you about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See\u2026 what inspired you several years ago - to start saying such, was your uncle Alan - as he grew into an enormous Giant himself, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIGHT!\" Jessica would reply with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Uncle and I\u2026 your mother as well, as well as everyone that you know and love - even Kika-chan, all share the love of growth with ONE simple knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What knowledge is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never settle for less,\" he happily replied, \"rest assured, dearest Jessica, your love for growth will be rewarded. And when that day comes, I'm certain you will become even BIGGER than myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's eyes would lit up a brilliant blue sparkle. \"You really think so dad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know so.\" Her father would smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica would gasp quietly, glomp her father, and giggle happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the end to a wonderful day - however, little did Jessica knew, that the \"tingling\" sensation would return, and so would begin her quest to becoming a Goddess. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A peculiar and yet familiar sustained rumbling sound seemed to fill the entire world as the sun rose over Lisa Little's body. The seventy five mile tall five year old was an anomaly in perhaps the purest sense possible, and becoming even more of an anomaly with every passing day. Her lightning-quick growth rates had propelled her beyond natural human size mere days after she was born, and she grew more and more with every passing day. The rumbling everyone could hear was in fact the noise of her body relentlessly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was smart for her age. As if her vast body boosted her brain power with every daily growth spurt. And yet, she remained the same happy, giggly little(ish) girl she had always been. If she laid on her back, she was big enough to reach London if her heels were positioned on England's south coast - which was what she was currently doing. Her giggles filled the air across Europe, and all anyone could see in the United Kingdom's capital was an utterly immense wall of brown hair creeping steadily towards them. To Lisa, growing bigger and bigger was the best thing ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, naturally, any child would want more and more of what they considered to be the best thing ever - and more and more Lisa got, as her body spurted and surged larger, day after day after day. It was because of this that Lisa was often treated as a stick with which to beat rivals, as despite her huge size, her nutritional requirements never seemed to increase - if they did, she'd be out-eating the rest of the world put together. This, coupled with her five year old level of maturity, meant that she was rather easy to control - and easy to harbour, save her ever-escalating size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lisa didn't care about this. She just wanted more - more and more growth. Despite this, she was a kind and sweet child, looking out for any ways she could help anyone. There weren't many, but it was the thought that counted. Blue eyes eternally sparkling, Lisa's infectiously joyful personality had effects on almost anyone who knew her - and that was a lot of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy heels pushing out into the English Channel, and her head threatening to grow clear into and through London, Lisa giggled. This was what she wanted. Growth. And with each day, more growth - and more, and more, and more...</span></div></div>",

Disregarding her rather pale skin tone and merely somewhat above-average face, her body is implausibly appealing - as well as extremely excessive. Her distinctive outfit - a purple tank-top and a pair of denim jeans - are horrendously stretched by her bouncing spheres, the latter to the point where it is essentially nothing more than an ill-fitting bra. With a slim stomach and thin legs - and small feet for her size - it is a wonder that Tammy can even stand up at all. Another anomaly is her bright pink hair - is it naturally that colour? And if not, how does Tammy manage to dye it that way at her size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Busty. Bubbly. Big. These are all words that define Tammy rather well, and she knows it. All too eager to show off her hyper-developed curves as she romps throughout whatever area she is in, Tammy delights in ever stare or glance she receives. That said, however, her intelligence leaves something to be desired - it seems her body developed where her brain didn't. For example, Tammy may not understand why a guy might not appreciate being picked up and taken for a 'ride' inside her cleavage. Or why her growth might not be the best thing in the world. But Tammy doesn't let that get her down - she's here to have fun, and nothing in existence can possibly spoil her good mood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiography: Until her transformation into a giantess, Tammy was more-or-less completely normal, save her excessively joyful personality. She came from an average background, went to an average school, and had average friends. The day of her 17th birthday was when she started to change, though. Her entire body began to grow at an accelerated rate, assets growing to ridiculous proportions as she shot up and up in height. Tammy's been a giantess for a while now - just over 2 years. And she loves every second of it.  </span></div></div>",

BZZT.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm was something that Brenda hated to hear every morning, and swore one day, she would tear the thing apart - for making her wake up from one of her many wonderful dreams. For when the alarm would start buzzing, her dream would fade away - unraveling a reality that she personally hated more than anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of tinted blue, the sharp white contrast of the corners and high trims, and the the chaotic fate that is her floor itself - covered with piles of clothing, some plastic that Brenda tossed carelessly the night before, and some books laid resting as well. Brenda shut the alarm off, stretched her arms, and got herself out of bed. All she had to her were male boxers, and a white shirt - to which she take right off, before heading into the shower. That is, before she realized she didn't have her towel or clothes to change into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, gently looked behind her, and saw the pile of clothes that she was supposed to have placed into her closet - but was far too upset with her drunkard mother to do it at all. She huffed, walked to the mountain of clothes, and grabbed something that she was most familiar and comfortable with. Her high heels, her leg-hugger jeans, and a shirt that she thought up to be as \"sexy\" - a black shirt with a blue bird design and exposed midriff. But with her pants, came another item that she needed to find: A belt. Not just any belt, but one that would melt into the sexy jeans that she loved most - lest she gets a big belt, and completely destroy her favorite look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a small black belt, and a white towel that rested beside it, and headed off to the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne shower, dress-up, and a long descend from hall and second floor stairs later - Brenda heard nothing but the quiet. It was 11:22 a.m. and no one was home. Not a soul to be heard - not even a mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caramba, you can never count on them to be here - can you?\" Brenda huffed, as she then headed towards the kitchen. It was upon the kitchen that she would see her worst nemesis of them all: The measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor so long, Brenda was the type of child that wanted to be noticed by everyone. This meant that she had to be TALL, sexy, and a bright personality to be noticed by her peers, and by everyone else around her. However, only ONE of those three became possible - and that was that Brenda was a sexy teen for her age. The other two were stifled, because one, she was 5'3 (on a good day), and the other, because she had the patience of fire ant army, attacking the youth with a magnifying glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who could blame her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda's mother was inattentive during most of her childhood - if not negligent. She was arrested several times for driving while being intoxicated, endangering Brenda on more than one occasion, and even leaving her alone in the park for more than a few hours (just so she could drink her liquor.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father was no better himself. In fact, if you asked her, the ONLY memory that she could recall when he ever WAS attentive to her, was when he suffered a foot injury that had him recovering in the hospital. That was when she was 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a miracle that she didn't end up even worse, with the aid of such awful parents - were it not for her cousins and her best friend. Though that was the previous year, and in that year alone - all things changed for Brenda. Her friend left and moved to another state - and her cousins moved back home with their families as well. For Brenda, it was back to seeing notes on the table that said: \"*Chamaca, your father left you some breakfast in the fridge. Microwave it, and\u2026 something else\u2026 whatever. Have a nice day at school - and stay away from that Antinio-Antonio Kid of whatever his name is, he's a BAD influence for you. - Luv ya' - Mom.\" (*Spanish for \"Child.\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gritted her teeth, grabbed her breakfast meal, and enjoyed the quiet company that was herself\u2026 and the ticking of the kitchen clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, like the clock and breakfast before her, her patience was wearing herself thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SERIOUSLY!? What will it take for me to get some attention around here? Why the hell am I still here? I shouldn't be here - I should be out there, making better out of my life\u2026 or something like that!\" Brenda spoke loudly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it remained quiet for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean\u2026 come on,\" Brenda would look at her own chest, \"What does it take for me to be BIGGER, TALLER, SEXIER? Huh? Big boobs, longer legs, tighter ass - you know, the whole thing.\" She sighed, then quickly picked up her fork, before resuming eating breakfast again. Shortly, she would finish eating her breakfast, and was about to place her plate into the sink, but not before a loud thunk would break the quiet silence within her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda knew that she had to find out what that item was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small\u2026 box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda, unamused by this would-be prank, would walk right inside with the box, and took a good look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing suspicious. Just a box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening it, she would find a small piece of paper and a bottle with a dark red fluid inside. Opening the note, it read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To boldly flee where no lady has done so before, this is your wish come true. Drink the content within this flask, and see a brand new you. But be warned, fate will never see to you again, should you wish to take it back, or perhaps, you could\u2026\" Brenda squinted, as she read the last words: \"Leave it be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 The F***?\" Now I know someone is messing with me. With a disappointing sigh, she was about to brush off the box and note - before thinking about it one more second. Perhaps, this bottle and note were trying to HELP her. Not hinder her life further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she wanted a bigger bust, she wanted longer, leaner legs, and a more gorgeous form to feel great about herself. This bottle was too good with its promises - and she has noted disappointment before. What did she have to to lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 at best, I could see it do nothing - worst, I could feel sick and die from whatever POISON this is.\" Brenda shrugged it off, and proceeded to open the bottle, and drink its content whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tasted raspberry. A flavor she liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would close the bottle up, tossed it in the trash can, and proceeded to carry off her bag - but not for school\u2026 for it was SATURDAY. School (and that note) were meant for FRIDAY, the day before, but with Brenda's negligent mother being who she is, it didn't take Brenda long for her to toss the note aside, and headed her merry way. </span></div></div>",

Will you follow the tale of a kind giantess, or a destroyer of worlds? You decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world, since the giantess was born, has accustomed to her. No matter what size she is, most of the planet either has a neutral or kind disposition towards her. Even the most successful business companies have pitched in to generate clothing, food, and shelter for one such as her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Heights To Choose From</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Amazon</b><br>\r\n-Your giantess is 12-20ft. in height. Has trouble fitting into most small buildings. Most people are only knee height to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Average</b><br>\r\n-Size ranges from 50-100ft. in size. An average home reachers her shin. People are like toys, barely the size of her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Big</b><br>\r\n-She's 500-1000ft. tall. She's easily a head, or even a whole torso taller than most skyscrapers. Normal people have become ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Mega</b><br>\r\n-Now we're getting up there. Your giantess's size scales on a 50-100 mile tall frame, most of a city's skyline and countryside dominated by her toes alone. People are mere dust specks now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Giga</b><br>\r\n-Here we go. One of the biggest sizes around. Easily going from 500 miles....to infinity.

In a social click setting, she's an 'Anti Goth' Goth. She's dyed her short feathered hair a stunning bright orange, and wears an ensemble of an orange tank top, which covers her C-cups nicely, black leather belts and leather bands all up her arms, a tight black plaid skirt, and knee-high black boots with large treads and orange lacings. All of this compliments her pale skin nicely, but doesn't match her sweet personality.<br>\r\nBiography: Molly has adapted to her position as the largest human in the world, but not without repercussions. Some people despise her, while others have even built a cult around worshipping her.<br>\r\n(Molly is originally a character from Awesomex18)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Vera Cartington<br>\r\nAge: 25<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: As snobbish and bitchy as a girl could get. Her size, along with having the richest daddy in the world, has corrupted her perception of everything around her, seeing everything as inferior and unworthy. Whatever size chosen, if Vera doesn't get her way, a rampage is bound to happen, and people let it happen and pray she doesn't come their way. Because of Joseph Cartington's(Vera's father) money and influence, nobody thinks to stop her.<br>\r\nAppearance: Slender frame outlined by golden tanned skin, crisp blonde hair that goes down her back, a pouty face that decieves her intentions. Usually wears sweaters of the finest silks which enunciates her massive chest, Bordering F cup, along with tight blue jeans and matching flip-flops.<br>\r\nBiography: With her father now dead, Vera inherited his vast wealth and is now in charge of the largest and most powerful company the world has ever known, even without her great size advantage. Vera rules the planet with a tight grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jasmine 'Jaz' Truitt<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: In your face, rude, and to the point, is what describes Jaz. Despite this, she's a rather nice girl, if not a bit loud. Whichever size is chosen for her, Jaz will be a nice giantess, if not a tad mischievious.<br>\r\nAppearance: Dark, cocoa brown skin, black hair cut to her shoulder, a nice face with glasses. Wears normal short-sleeve t-shirts of black or white with jeans and converse shoes. Makes up for her average attire with D, bordering DD cup breasts and a butt to die for.<br>\r\nBiography: Jaz has just graduated from high school and is on her own in the world now...which she is pretty much used to being an outcast giantess and all.<br>\r\n(Jaz originally is a character from here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1564499-Cheating-Death\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1564499-Cheating-Death</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Bianca Baxley<br>\r\nAge: 13<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nPersonality: Very chipper and bubbly, but this hides a sadistic and almost ruthless side underneath.<br>\r\nAppearance: Lean and fit with a budding body. Long black hair, fair skin, normally wears yellow outfits.<br>\r\nBiography: As she grew into a giantess, Bianca came to relish her newfound power and size over the tinier humans.
