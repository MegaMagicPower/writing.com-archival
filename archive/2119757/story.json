Sure it had been months since her last attempt at 'dreaming', but the more she thought about it the more it confused her. Such a simple action bringing forth such an odd branch of pictures into a big....what did Steven call them...mixed up movie. Of course while it all appeared to be chaos, she did have some form of control over the whole experience. That might of explained why....she was there...of course it was only her body and Greg was the head and his mouth.... Pearl slapped herself as if it would help get the image out of her head. There was no way she could train herself with these thoughts racing about her. Looking to the fountain at her feet. Pearl took a deep breath. \"Now lets see...lay down...okay...now..close my eyes....yes...now *yawn* don't think about.....anything....\" Minutes passed by minutes as Pearl tossed herself about, not knowing if she was in the optimum position. \"Uggh....this is so pointless...\" As Pearl opened her eyes, she found herself in.....</span></div></div>",

Her skills with a sword had become quite impressive over the past months. It was almost like she didn't even need to be here, Connie could run through the motions all by herself. Of course, deep down inside, Pearl couldn't help but worry about the girl. There was after all more to being a warrior than having skills with a sword. A warrior and guard had to have a strong mind as well as a strong stance in order to protect thier superior. Of course she understood Connie and Steven saw themselves as equals but the truth of the matter was that Connie needed to understand the mental tasking as well as the physical. Besides, if Steven's stories about Connie and her fears were to be believed then it was clear she needed to be improved. The question was, just how to go about it all? While gems knew about the art of simple hypnosis, Homeworld had tried to keep it's use to the lowest of minimums and Rose was no different. However Pearl did remember a few interrogation spells she saw a few gems try during the rebellion. Of course maybe it would be best to ask Garnet over the whole affair. After all, she new about mental cleansing better than her. Then again...there....no....well...there was this one weapon she had taken from some Homeworld scientists in the final days of the war...if it could work the way she heard.....but....no...maybe....</span></div></div>",

Pearl took a moment of hesitation before heading to the warp pad, still worried about just what she was about to do. Sure there was a good reason but she had no idea how this device really worked anyhow. As the she warped into the temple, Pearl found herself welcomed by a quiet home. Steven was visiting Peridot and Lapis and Amethyst was most likely in her room. As for Garnet....well...who knew where she was. Her gem and the door glowed before the latter opened up to the fountains and elegance of her room. <br>\r\n<i>\"Are you certain that is what they told you Pearl?\" \"Yes, well..they said something along the lines. All it shows is how desperate Homeworld is.\" Pearl watched as Rose carried the concealed weapon across the water, unable to see the gem's face through her hair. \"Pearl, do the others know about this?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I made certain I told only you.\" The two gems came to a halt atop the largest of the bowl fountains as Rose bubbled the device. \"To rob one of thier ability to truley think for themselves. If they had finished this machine....\" Pearl saw the tears dropping to the floor and for a moment, didn't say a word. \"Rose, can I ask why we are not destroying the weapon?<br>\r\nI don't want to question you but is it really safe to keep it...\" Before Pearl could finish her sentence, Rose shot the bubble downward into the water. When the bubble vanished from sight, Rose turned directly toward her dear Pearl. \"Promise me Pearl, promise me that whether we win or lose the war, you will never forget this weapon is here. It is to be a reminder of what this could have come to, the ends that some will go to destroy the will of another.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl watched as the bubble came into view, her flashback not helping her questioning over the morality of her choice. The bubble exited the water, seeming as clear and as set as the day it was made. Pearl's hand twitched as she held it out to pop the bubble. She wasn't meaning to destroy Connie' s will though, only to help it. As the bubble popped, the rather small and covered device fell into Pearl's other waiting hand. Uncovering the cloth, Pearl gazed upon the object in her hands and examined it for the first time in thousands of years. The device was similar in shape to a gun, though more rounded out. Two light dials were etched into the sides of it's handles with a simple trigger. Though what it fired was rather a mystery to Pearl as she never really saw it in action. </span></div></div>",

Pearl turned to find Garnet standing there without a readable expression. \"What do you think you are doing?\" The tone of the red/purple fusion shook Pearl to her core as she showed the weapon off. \"Future vision I take it?\" Garnet nodded and began to slowly step forward across the fountain, her arm outstreched. \"Pearl, I have seen images of that weapon and I can assure you the consequences of it's use are far worse than what you plan for it. To do such a thing...taking the willpower away from someone whose looked up to you for so long.\" \"But she would have understood if I explained....\" \"But what about anyone else?!\" Garnet was halfway across the water and could see the gun shaking in Pearl's arms. \"Connie' s parents, Amyethest, Steven, would they understand if you just explained to them?\" Pearl's breathing became heavy as her teammate was a few steps away. \"This is for Connie' s own....\" \"No Pearl!

She didn't like to use that angle for reasoning with her fellow gems but Pearl was going through a serious case. All was quiet in the room, neither saying a word as Pearl glanced to the gun in her hand. \"You know Garnet....over the years I've had to learn some things about myself. But there is something you told me about myself that I really need to exercise more. I am who I am and I dictate my own actions. Not you, not Steven, not Homeworld customs and not even Rose. You might be right about this being wrong, but I want to show you that with the right help it won't have to be.\" Garnet began to rush Pearl, her future vision telling her what Pearl was about to do. With a flick of the trigger, the gun became active. A small, purple pellet fired from the tip at high velocity, hitting Garnet square in the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Pearl stood over Garnet with a slick smile of success. That smile however was soon replaced by the anxious expression one would expect to give at such a time. Her breathing was quick and her mind raced to find an excuse for this action. She stated at the weapon in hand, dials and all and looked back to the fallen Garnet. \"Garnet...are you alright?\"</span></div></div>",

She took a few breaths to calm herself down after the multitude of thoughts struck her head. After a few moments though, Pearl began to notice that Garnet had yet to get up from her position on the floor. It also didn't help that Garnet hadn't spoken out about Pearl's actions. She just layed there still without even a single moan. \"Umm....Garnet? Is everything alright?\" \"It seems fine to me, but what matters is it you think everything is fine.....so do you?\" Pearl looked once more to the weapon of control in her hands and sighed. \"How could they be? I just shot you with a weapon ment to enslave other gems out of self defense in a completely selfish desire to hypnotize someone I cared about....to force them to obey me.\" \"Seems fine to me my Pearl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl took a step back with that remark, it was clear now that the device had indeed taken control of Garnet but the way she spoke...a Pearl in charge. While she had long forgone the ways of the average Pearl, it was beyond strange to hear herself being addressed like a higher noble. \"Um...you can get up Garnet.\" \"I know, I am just trying to refocus myself in my new purpose.\" \"And what would that be?\" As Garnet began to get herself off the stone, she looked Pearl in the eyes and said \"Serving you.\" Pearl's eyes couldn't leave Garnet for a moment, the realization of what was happening finally coming to light. She now had total control over Garnet, a fusion who (for the most part) is highly capable of focus and self control. If she could take control of her then Connie would be a snap. A small pang of concise came to Pearl as she realized what she thought. Garnet began to step forward with her usual mysterious look. \"My Pearl, you're worried about what you are about to do I suppose?\" Pearl nodded slowly, not sure if that was the problem or something else. \"Don't be, I can see so many outcomes of your success and all of them end exactly how you would like.\" \"And the ones where I don't.....\" \"....Connie will understand, and so will the others. You have nothing to lose.\" After one more deep breath, a gleam came to Pearl's eye as she headed for the the door out of her room. As she and Garnet walked through, Pearl was greeted with the sight of Amethyst swallowing something Pearl didn't wish to know. \"Yo P, what's up?\" \"Amethyst, is Connie still training?\"</span></div></div>",

Pearl eyed the litter with distain and gritted her teeth before sighing. \"Great, just when I was about to..\" It was at that moment Pearl realized she was still holding the hypno gun in her hand, quickly tossing it aside to Garnet. \"...improve Connie' s training.\" \"Geez Pearl, ya got some kind of secret with the kid or something? Ha ha, just joking. Anyways....do either of you know when Steven is coming back? No wait, Garnet give an average with your future sight.\" The taller gem woman stood silent and stonefaced, the daming weapon of evidence unmoved in her grasp. Shuffling sounds could be heard from the fridge as Pearl tapped her foot rapidly. \"Garnet...could you awsner her question please?\" \"If going by averages and knowing Steven' usual time spent with Peridot and Lapis, I'd say an hour and a half to two hours. Pleanty of time, for Pearl to help Connie.\" The rustling sounds from the fridge stopped as Amethyst looked back. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" After giving an unamused look to the enthralled Garnet, Pearl stepped forward and....</span></div></div>",

That always was the problem with her in Pearl's eyes, even now she was always too joking and careless. Looking to the floor around Amethyst, Pearl could see the trash around her feet. Without hesitation this time, Pearl fired the weapon. For only a second, Pearl could see a look of unbridled horror on the gem's face. That however was quickly quashed as the pellet it it's Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl smiled, though not without a smaller tinge of regret than last time. \"Amethyst, clean this mess up.\" Amethyst saluted and flopped herself onto the ground, opening her mouth and shoving the garbage inside. \"Well at least she still has some form of herself inside.\" </span></div></div>",

The last image in the sequence was not of Steven...but of Rose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl's legs shook as she dropped the gun, tears welling up in her eyes.

This place isn't going to clean itself, Amethyst!\" Amethyst rolled her eyes as she looked back to the book. That was when an idea popped into her head. An excited grin grew on Amethyst's face as Pearl began to storm off. \"Hey, Pearl!\" The long-haired gem shouted.

Almost like she was hungry for sunlight. Bounding out of the bathroom and onto Steven's porch, she felt the heat of the sun caress her body. Soon this heat began to run through every part of her being. Her gem began to glow, and she felt the power building within her, begging for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe!\" She cackled to herself.

But not like normal shapeshifting, nor did this feel at all like it felt to reform. It was more... Euphoric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with her legs, becoming long and slender, while the rest of her body increased in height. Her hips pushed out slightly, while the feeling of heat and energy began to center around her chest.

Peridot looked over herself. It seems that by visualizing Lapis, she had taken on her physical traits, adding them to her own. Indeed, while not perfectly curvaceous, her hips and breasts were only slightly larger than Lapis', but her height had greatly increased, bringing her up to only just above Pearl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with that change, Peridot still felt the energy push and surge throughout her body. Meanwhile her bodysuit had become tight, straining against every inch of her in the most satisfying way.

But, what if these amazing warriors were to undergo some...interesting changes? That's what we're here for! To explore odd and fascinating stories staring the female Gems in wacky antics across Beach City and beyond!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few basic rules to make this the best experience it can be for everyone:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Grammar and syntax are important, please don't forget to spellcheck / proofread your writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Nobody likes a one sentence entry, so be cool and write about a paragraph or two per entry. People will appreciate you for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. While there can be plenty of great ideas, a story has to start eventually. Let's be courteous and not create a never-ending tree of \"But what about this?\" <br>\r\n   i. To compound on that, don't be afraid to end a story if it seems like there's little left to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Just a few Okay / Not Okay things to explore:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Okay:<br>\r\n*Inflation (excluding muscle/eye/nose/ears/things along this line)<br>\r\n*Transformation (within reason)<br>\r\n*Hypnosis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Not okay:<br>\r\n*Vore / Preg<br>\r\n*Bodily Fluids<br>\r\n*Slob<br>\r\n*Torture<br>\r\n*Male<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't see something you'd like to write on, feel free to ask. The worst I can say is no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlrigthy, that just about it. Now go and have some fun!</td>",
