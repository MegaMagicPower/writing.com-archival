            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>The Mother Of Invention</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story follows David Johnson, 22 year old college graduate, right after he had to move back home with his mother, 44 year old Karen Johnson. After graduation, David had applied to multiple publications in order to utilize his new journalism degree. Unfortunately, David hadn't heard back from any those applications in months, and also couldn't seem to land a side job to support himself in the meanwhile. Having quickly went through his savings, David had run out of options and was forced to return to his Mother's house. Karen, despite her efforts to hide it, was very happy to have her son home. Ever since David's graduation, Karen had lived alone for nearly 6 years. She enjoyed the privacy for the most part, but she was excited to share her home again. David, on the other hand, was pretty embarrassed to move back home. Still broke and without any prospects for employment, David couldn't help but feeling like a failure. He had spent most the first week back home depressed in his room and smoking the remaining weed he brought from college. Karen's maternal instincts picked up on this, and she quickly devised a plan to get her son out of this funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe company Karen worked for always needed new test subjects for their assorted products, and she figured this would be an easy way for David to make some quick cash. He may be hesitant though, since his mother works for Renovate Inc, a company famous for its groundbreaking body reshaping technology and medication. For decades now, the company boasted it's ability to change you however you see fit. Using their machines and drugs you could become a body builder, or a supermodel, or a killer whale! Despite these claims though, Renovate was still years away from going commercial. They needed more human testing and were willing to pay decent amounts for willing participants. Unbeknownst to David, his mother has already signed him up for a product trial and now is legally required to use whatever product is given to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Memory Lane</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story follows 19 year old Greg Canary as he searches for a new apartment. When Greg decided to move in with his best friend after High School, he learned slowly what a huge mistake that was. Greg found out the guy who he liked to party with actually partied every single night. Any moment of cleanliness or quiet were few in their apartment. This bothered Greg much more than he thought it would. He could feel himself getting progressively more annoyed and aggravated every passing day. <br>\r\nStill, he was not great with confrontation, so he let it go on for a year before finally snapping. Greg supplied his roommate with a list of things that needed to change in order for them to keep living together. In response, his roommate left the next morning, leaving Greg to handle the rest of the lease by himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough frustrated from his first apartment experience, Greg was excited to find new place to live. Despite staying within the same town, he was considering this a new start. A chance to reinvent himself after he letting someone else have so much impact on his personality. Fortunately for him, he's found a fairly affordable building with many apartment for rent signs out front. Greg walks into apply, determined to be more of an individual in this new space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Greg had read the fine print though, he would have understood why the rent was affordable. The apartment building he was about to apply for was (allegedly) the most haunted building in his state. Nearly every room had a at least one confirmed death. Most of these deaths were from previous occupants, usually from mysterious circumstances. Local legend states that the memories of the dead have left impressions within those rooms. Who can tell what kind of impression they'll leave Greg with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Girdle Hurdle</b>d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story follows Rex Geiger, a gullible 26 year old. Rex wasn\u2019t a stupid guy, but he did have a habit of being easily manipulated. Whether it was a harmless prank from his friends or straight up getting scammed, Rex usually found himself fooled. This trusting nature never did Rex much harm, until he had made a fairly decent misunderstanding with a loan shark. Rex hadn\u2019t realized how steep his monthly \u201cinstallments\u201d were going to be or how the loan shark would react without getting paid. Rex got his answer a week ago when his apartment was broken into and robbed of all it\u2019s valuables. In the middle of Rex\u2019s destroyed bedroom was an odd note, only thing on it was \u201cWE\u2019RE WATCHING YOU, PAY UP\u201d written in red ink. Rex was terrified to say the least, but he still didn\u2019t have nearly enough cash to fend of the shark and his goons. He figured his best course of action was to hightail it to his nearest relative\u2019s place and lay low for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Rex\u2019s closest living relative was his grandmother, 65 year old Annabelle Geiger. Annabelle lives in an age restricted community, a small subdivision where the minimum age to be a resident is 55. Something Rex definitely forgot about before he started making his way over there. Despite this, Annabelle isn\u2019t one to turn away a family member in need. One way or another, Annabelle will have to figure a way for Rex to pass in her elderly community. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Misfiled and Miscorrected</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story follows 30 year old Keith Maron, company man. In the last few years, Keith has been working as a sales expert for \u201cChello\u201d, the number one food supplier in the USA(in this fictional universe). While working there, Keith had practically worked 60 hour weeks in an effort to bring his sales as high as possible. It was hard work and Keith had lost touch with most of his friends in the process, but he was desperate to climb that corporate ladder. Of course, there was the much higher salary that came with a promotion, but Rex was more intrigued by the rumored benefits upper management received.  He had heard stories of free vacations, secret parties, and even luxury company cars. Rex\u2019s free time and buddies were a small price to pay if it meant he could get a taste of the high life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, his manager noticed his initiative and sent an email his way, attached with a ticket to an expensive island resort named \u201cRestituo\u201d. In the email, Keith\u2019s manager explained that in order to move up in Chello, Keith would need to attend a destination wedding for one of their biggest shareholders. It would be Keith\u2019s job to represent Chello in a professional manner, and his promotion would be guaranteed upon success. Unusual circumstances aside, Keith jumped at the opportunity and quickly scheduled his trip to Restituo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Keith wasn\u2019t so thrilled for this chance, he might have been more careful registering with the resort online. Restituo marketed itself as \u201cHeaven\u201d on earth, a perfect vacation systematically suited to your preferences. All you had to do was answer a few personality tests, and you\u2019re flying to formulated, generated paradise! In his excitement, however, Keith had managed to miss the personal details page, missing his chance to set up his vacation. Untouched, the details were left with random default options, which the resorts systems will know only recognize Keith as. Will the island change to better fit Keith\u2019s needs or will he have to change for the Island? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAw, come on!\u201d David exclaimed, as he scrolled through his emails, \u201cNot a single reply? How is that even mathematically possible?\u201d Considering the ridiculous amount of resumes he had sent out, it was disheartening to see such little response. He had expected to be hired right out of college and that was 6 months ago. He had spent almost all of that time applying and he had absolutely nothing to show for it. Not even the small local business were interested, David being denied a simple dishwashing position was a particular low point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just my shitty luck, I guess,\" He mumbled grumpily to himself, as he looked out his bedroom window. Even with all of employment issues, he was grateful to have a roof over his head. Plus it didn't hurt that his mother still bought all of his groceries for him. Still, David had hoped his new/old living situation would be a way for him to save for his future, and so far, that hasn't been the case. He has made a grand total of zero dollars, being exactly where he started half a year ago. Not that he needed the cash, his Mother's job paid enough to support the both them. But being unemployed still meant missing out on new experiences or learning new skills to add to his resume. David's biggest concern however was his ever-growing boredom. Considering he was jobless, without disposable income, and in a town where all of his friends moved out of, David was given few options to spend his free time. When he wasn't applying for jobs, David was alone in his room, smoking weed and playing videogames. Definitely not the healthiest way to deal with his problems, but David just figured he was just wasting time until he got a response for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey David!\", His mother's voice yelled from the living room, \"Can you come downstairs for a sec? I need to show you something before I leave for work,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mom, I'll be there in a sec!\" David yelled back, putting down the joint he had just made. Now was around the time he would start to vegging out, since his mother was usually gone by now. Her lab needed her pretty early in the morning, so David would usually have the house to himself for a while during the week. This was convenient, as it was easier for David to smoke without his mother knowing. But she has never stayed this early on a Wednesday before, David figured it must be important. He slapped on some sweatpants and made his way downstairs. Turning towards the living room, he saw his mother in her business attire with a large box behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.imagefap.com/images/full/61/912/912806550.jpg?end=1603481701&amp;secure=0ed1c97dc203f611c6769\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.imagefap.com/images/full/61/...</a></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Look who decided to leave their cave today!\"  Karen joked, \"Good morning, Sweetheart,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, good morning Mom,\" David rolled his eyes, \"So what uh... What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how do I say this...,\" She considered her words for a moment, then continued, \"Look David, I know your going through a rough patch right now. I know this isn't where you expected to be and I know how frustrating that can be. But that's just how it is sometimes, buddy. Sometimes life punches you down, then punches you again. But you just gotta roll with the punches! You buck up and start punching back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" David asked in confusion, \"Are you saying I haven't been trying? I send out like 30 applications a day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No David, That's not what I meant. I'm not talking about getting a job\" Karen sighed and tried again, \"Look, I know you're busting your butt off trying to find work, and heck, your initiative brings a tear to me eye. But locking yourself in your room all day isn't healthy. You need to get out of the house every once in a while, for your own sake. When I was in my twenties, I would spend every day outside, hanging out with my friends and having a ball! Those days were some of the best of my life and I feel like you're missing out on that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well jeez, Mom,\" David remarked sarcastically, \"It's not like I want play videogames all day, I just don't have a whole lot of other options. Everyone I knew moved out of this town four years ago, and even If I still had friends around, it's not like I have the cash to do anything fun. My poor ass can't afford to party like you did, Mom,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's funny you say that...\" Karen smirked, as if she had planned for what her son said, \"So you know how it's my job to schedule new test subjects for Renovate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" David scratched his head trying to recall the details of his Mother's job. He knew that she had worked for Renovate for nearly a decade now. Renovate was a company solely dedicated in pioneering new technologies and drugs in order alter the human form. They claimed they already had the technology to change anyone into anything, but still had countless human trials before they could go commercial. That's all David or any regular person knew about Renovate, since the company was incredibly secretive. They were worried their tech and pharmaceuticals would be stolen before they could patent any of it, thus all employees and test subjects were obligated to sign an disclosure agreement, forbidding them to share anything they experienced with Renovate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so don't be mad,\" Karen carefully said, \"But I signed you up for a trial with Renovate! All you have to do is try one of our products and report your results!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what!?!\" David yelped, flabbergasted at his mother actions, \"How could you do that without even talking to me first? I don't want to try one of those crazy gizmos! Nu uh, no way in hell am I doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, will you relax?\" Karen chuckled, \"I didn't tell you about it because I thought you wouldn't accept my help. I tried to offer you money before and you turned it away, so I found you a new way to get you paid! Did I mention how much we pay our test subjects? We're talking about, at minimum, five grand per test subject! And possibly even more money if you can give us particularly useful feedback,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, five grand is a lot...\" David pondered, considering his empty bank account for a moment, \"But still Mom, I've heard rumors about that company. What if I change into some monster and can't turn back? or what if I get stuck as something nasty? That would be a nightmare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A monster?\" his mother laughed at him, \"Son, we don't make monsters and I wouldn't sign you up for anything dangerous. We're just trying to let anyone look outside how they feel inside. Of course, we still need a lot of testing, so nothing is perfect yet, but no change is permanent. Renovate has had issues with products before, but every test subject leaves the way they came in. So no matter what happens to you, we should be able to get you back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should?\" David fixated on that word, \"Mom, I'm not gonna lie, that five grand is very enticing, but I'm still not sure about any of this. Do I have to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well only if you want the money,\" Karen shrugged, \"I guess I should have mentioned that Renovate does end up billing subjects who back out of testing. Considering how each subject is issued a unique prototype to test and how many employees involved with each test, the bill usually ends being around two grand,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that would have been good to know!\" David grunted, realizing the bind he was in, \"So basically I try this Sci Fi nonsense or I end up owing some shadowy corporation two thousand dollars? Doesn't seem like I got much a choice do I? Gee, thanks Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of the attitude, kid,\" Karen sighed as she picked up the box behind her, \"Will you just look at the product before making a fuss? This won't be as bad as you're making it out to be. Heck, you might even have fun! A lot of test subject comment how much they enjoyed the experience, I bet you will too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely,\" David said with a huff as he took the box out of his mother's hands. Inside of the package, David found...</span></div></div>",
