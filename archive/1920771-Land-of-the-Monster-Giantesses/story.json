You walked over to get a closer look and, well, big mistake, very big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked towards the water, the light glows brighter and then you scream because it turns into some form of portal. \"Oh no!\" you yell. \"What's going on?!\" Before you can say another word, you are sucked right down into the portal screaming.

You were in a world full of black gothic style buildings with dark skies and green torches lighting the streets. This world looked like something you'd expect to see in some kind of horror movie. And then you see strange markings in the ground. They looked sort of like footprints or scratch marks and then you gasp at the size. You weren't alone. There was somebody or something in the area and it was big. At your guess hundreds of feet tall. At least five hundred given the size of the prints, but they were so blurry, you couldn't get a good idea of what it was that lived in this citadel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel a quake and fall off of the brick you're standing on.

She had to be at least 800 feet tall because her footsteps were generating tremors that made it next to impossible for you to stand up. She was a titanic gold yellow color with pointed ears and long blonde hair that reached down to her backside. She had six small horns on her forehead and leather wings folded over her shoulders like a cape. She looked a bit on the heavy side, especially in her thighs and she had breasts that would be bigger than bowling balls had she been normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. You had no idea that gargoyles actually existed. But the question is, what would this gargoyle woman do if she saw such a tiny human in her home. You see her tail wagging and realize she's only wearing a loincloth skirt. Her wings were forming a makeshift bra. But then she opens her wings up and then she stares up into the sky as her eyes glow bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to get a closer look but then you remembered something. Not all gargoyles were fond of humans. You remembered learning about them and that one of them even tried to annihilate humans. Of course that was only fiction. But this was real.

You have to duck as the tail nearly hits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you get an idea and grab hold of the gold gargoyle girl's tail as you are taken into the air.  You hold on tight and grunt.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fall into the gargoyle's loincloth, landing right in her cleavage. She doesn't appear to notice you and keeps walking. Looking up you see her giant face looming above, as well as the massive walls that are her breasts. You don't know what she's doing, but soon you hear a voice. \"Hey Tress, finally back?\" it asks. From above the gargoyle you're riding with, Tress, answers. \"I was just out for a little stroll, Cathy.\" she says. You hear a rumbling get closer and closer until Tress stops walking. You can't really tell from your position, but this Cathy must be standing in front of her. \"Is it really a stroll when you're flying?\" she asks. \"Whatever,\" Tress says. The two of them begin walking together. \"Hey I;m about to take a shower, so I'll talk to you later.\" Tress informs her friend. From the sounds of stomping you can tell that Tress is alone again. After a few minutes, she appears to be in a large room that seems very spacious. You are suddenly thrown for a loop when Tress begins to unfasten her loincloth. You find yourself falling as her breasts are set free. You look up and see the length of her body as you fall down toward the ground. The last thing you see are her thighs before you land in a mountain of cloth. Luckily she just let her loincloth fall to the floor, as your landing was much softer than it could have been. After fighting out of it you look up and are in awe at the sight of her. Seeing her entire form is nothing short of breath taking. Her feet begin to move and her talons soar over your head as she walks toward a massive shower on the other side of the room. You watch as she shuts the curtain and you are effectively left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tress showers you decide to make an escape. Once you locate the door you head toward it, leaving the sounds of the running water behind you. After slipping under the door you find yourself in an expansive hallway. There are lights along the walls but it still seems kind of dark. The walls and door have a gothic feel, giving a sort of creepy atmosphere. While you're admiring the architecture you realize you have no idea where to go. Wherever you are its most likely Tress and Cathy's home. With Tress behind you the only one you may run into is Cathy, and thats if they're the only ones living here. Since you were trapped in a prison of boobflesh when they met you still have no idea what she looks like. With no other option you start walking along the hall. As you walk you think about just what's happened. You've been sent to some world with giant gargoyles and are trapped in one of their homes. You have no idea what to do now so you should try and see what you can find. Maybe the giant women that live here might actually help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually while walking you come across another door. With a shrug you slip underneath and see whats inside. Once again you're in awe at how big this place is. Even if you weren't the size of a flea it would still be pretty expansive. This room in particular appears to be a living room of sorts. There's a large television as well as several comfy looking chairs. Its definitely not a library, but there are still several bookcases filled with reading material. The walls and carpet are crimson colored, the carpet having black spiral like designs on it. For some reason the dark colors make the room feel cozy. Suddenly though, tremors start to approach as you admire the room. With a loud creaking the door opens and you turn to see someone entering the room. Its another gargoyle like Tress, but this one has forest green colored skin and two large pointy horns. Her figure is very full and voluptuous like Tress, but she seems like she's more thick than chubby. Her breasts and thighs are still a knockout though. \"Time to relax,\" she mutters to herself with a smile. From her voice you can tell that its Cathy, who you couldn't get a glimpse at earlier. She takes a step into the room and the impact of her foot on the floor knocks you to your feet. Your brain finally realizes that standing in a giant gargoyle's way is probably not the best thing to do and you take off running. Before you get very far however you look up and see her massive talons pass over head before touching down ahead of you. The ground shakes again and you are knock off balance as she takes another step. Finally your eyes settle on the armchairs and the small table near them. With new resolve you get up and make a beeline for them. Cathy however, was already on her way over there for a seat. Do you make it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently gargoyles don't wear panties. This encourages you to step forward and take a closer look. Then you hear a shrieking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle looks up to see something else, another giant monster girl coming down fast. She was a white haired banshee with a pink streak in her hair and pale white skin. She was an hourglass shaped creature with a tattered black dress. She was coming down and you realized you couldn't be hypnotized by this gargoyle woman's fine figure and cover your ears lest you fall victim to the banshee's death shriek. The banshee flies down in front of the gargoyle and the gargoyle looks directly at this banshee. Now there were two monster girls at this citadel and you have a front row seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is... do these giantesses like each other?</span></div></div>",

Vampires were bad enough as it was, but this one was huge and she was walking right up towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampiress looks down on you and cracks a smile. \"Hello there little guy,\" she says. \"Haven't seen a human for a long time.

You let out a sigh. \"I'd rather take my chances with your roommates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampiress lets out a sigh and then shows her fangs. \"Typically. Nobody ever wants to sink their teeth into me. Now let's meet my roommates.\" The vampiress walks indoors and squeezes you in her hand. You start to sweat. \"What were you thinking?\" you think to yourself. \"One monster giantess nearly considered eating you and now you have to deal with two more.\" You then look to see that this citadel appears to be some kind of apartment building given the big hallway full of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the vampiress stops and opens a door and inside you see her two roommates on a couch who were watching a horror movie involving aliens (because after all they <i>are</i> monster). \"What was that upstairs Barbara?\" asks one of the monster giantesses as she presses mute on the movie. The vampiress, now named Barbara, giggles and shows her fangs as she holds you up. \"Nothing. I just found something interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Barbara's roommates get up and you get a good look at them to see they were both much bigger and heavier than Barbara herself. One of them was a brown reddish haired minotaur woman with viridian green fur. She had a massive hunched back and huge stomach with an udder even bigger than her head and a massive booty. She was naked from the waist down but wearing a purple bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second of Barbara's roommates was a giant white furred unicorn woman with long whitish blonde hair with an enormous stomach and larger breasts. She seemed to be wearing a pink dress. Both the unicorn and the minotaur look at you and take a closer look before they get excited. \"A human?\" asks the unicorn. \"Oh. Humans are my favorite!\" Favorite? Favorite what? The minotaur woman then lets out a snort and shakes her cheeks. \"Rowr. I could use a man. Can't wait to have him inside me.\" The minotaur shakes her hips as you look in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara just lets out a laugh. \"Don't worry girls.I'll let him decide.\" This was bad.

It's been way too long since I had a human all to myself!\" The minotaur cheers, rudely plucking you from Barbara's grasp with her fat fingers. Giggling, she holds you close to her face and smilies devilishly. \"Ohhh, you made the right choice, little human. Big Helena's gonna have a LOT of fun with you!\" She snorts, blowing steam out of her nose and making you sweat from the heat. \"Maybe <i>you'll</i> even like it...if you can handle me.\" She coos, carressing her fat belly with her free hand. \"If not...well, I'll enjoy it, and that's all that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helena, quit that!\" The unicorn woman whines, cutting the bovine titaness off. \"It's bad enough that I won't get him;I don't want to watch <i>you</i> have all the fun!\" she pouts, looking offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, London.

You were enslaved by three giantess monsters and the first one was already ready to kill you if you got out of line. Just where did that portal come from? <i>Surely</i> you couldn't be the only human to get stuck in this crazy world. But you couldn't think about that because Helena wants a massage and you definitely don't want to get the skyscraper sized minotaur mad at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes, you're exhausted and roll down Helena's hump to the back of her head. The humongous heifer reaches back and picks you up. She places you in front of her mouth and grins at you. Just one of her teeth was several times bigger than you. Not good at all. \"Very good little man,\" says the goddess sized bovine as she coos and pets you on the head like some kind of pet. \"But don't think you're finished yet. I'm not just ready to hand you over to Barbara or London just yet. Now you're ready to start on my...\"</span></div></div>",

A giantess had walked forward, around 500 feet tall with an hourglass figure and with pale skin and in a purple toga. But what struck you most about her was her hair. She had large pink horned vipers for hair. This girl was a gorgon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that if you looked at her directly in the eyes, you'd be turned to stone. The gorgon was looking around her citadel and let out a sigh as she looks into the city with the bright torches burning. She sits down on the ground, forcing you to run away rather than being crushed and drags her finger around the floor. You look closer at her without looking her in the eye and you see her snake hair drooping. THis gorgon looked sad and lonely. Of course, she was a dangerous monster even by monster standards so she probably felt very alienated. It wasn't her fault she had snakes for hair, at least, you don't think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then one of the vipers in her hair spots you and lets out a hiss as you gasp. \"What is it girl?\" asks the gorgon to her hair. You try to run but then the gorgon turns her head and spots you. You realize this and yell \"Crap!\" before you begin to run. But the gorgon puts on glasses and jumps over you, creating a large quake that knocks you off your feet. Before you can get back up, one of the gorgon's snakes slurps you into its mouth screaming. The snake then spits you into its mistress's hand and you're covered in saliva. You scream and flail about but then you gasp because you see the gorgon's house size eye in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for some strange reason you weren't turning to stone. Her glasses must've canceled out her gorgon eyes. The question is... what does this gorgon think of humans.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The entire floor begins to rumble and you can barely stand as a gigantic monster woman is walking forward. From the sounds of her footsteps, this giant woman wasn\u2019t just a giant woman, she was a rather heavy giant woman. A shadow falls on you, highlighted by the light of the moon. The shadow is huge and obese with an oddly-shaped head and the shadow\u2019s owner was getting closer and closer. Suddenly, you see a large foot come down in front of you and jump back in fear. You take a closer look and see that the foot is as big as a stadium and is rather flat like that of some form of pachyderm and ended in four toes that were painted bright red. You then look up and see a bright yellow bikini bottom with red leopard spots. It looked tight enough that they were painted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look further up and you see the owner of the feet and the bikini bottom and you were in pure surprise. Standing in front of you was a 1500ft tall werehippopotamus woman. She had pitch black skin and long grayish pink hair and from the looks of it she was wearing glasses and a long fancy looking bathrobe with a bikini underneath. She had D-Cup (in scale) breasts as well as a 2000ft wide belly and a 2500ft wide butt. She even looked like she was wearing mascara and lipstick. Your jaw drops as you look up at this titanic werehippo lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was this possible. It was one thing if giant monsters did exist, but who ever heard of something such as a werehippo? You heard of werewolves, weretigers and even wereboars, but a werehippo?\u2028\u2028Before you could ponder this situation any further, you gasp because the hippopotamus giantess was walking in your direction. You scream as one of the hippo lady\u2019s stadium-sized feet is over you and rush out of the way as the big foot comes down and the hippo lady continues to walk forward. There was no way she could see you. Not only were you an ant compared to her but her belly was so huge that it was doubtful she could see her feet. Then again, you had no way of knowing if this big hippo lady was friendly or not, so you probably wouldn\u2019t want her to see you anyway. She keeps on stomping towards you when suddenly you slip and fall off a large edge. \u201cWhoa!\u201d you yell. You scream and think you\u2019re about to fall right off of the citadel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you suddenly land with a splash and you surface and cough. You\u2019re floating in what appears to be an ocean of water. But how was that possible. Was the citadel built on a beach. Suddenly you taste the water and then gag. This is chlorinated water. You were in the world\u2019s largest rooftop swimming pool. You couldn\u2019t believe it. You were running so you wouldn\u2019t be stepped on by a hippopotamus lady enormous enough to use Godzilla as a lapdog and you fall into a giant swimming pool. Then you gasp and remember the werehippo woman was wearing a bathing suit. You look up and see the hippo lady tossing off her bathrobe before she looks up at the full moon. She sees a Chinese dragoness giantess being followed by a phoenix giantess, flying out in the moon. \u201cWhat a beautiful full moon tonight.\u201d Says the werehippo giantess. You look up in fear as the hippopotamus lady dives into the pool and scream as you try to swim out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. The pachyderm giantess lands with an enormous splash in the water and you\u2019re sent flying as you yell. You land in the werehippo lady\u2019s hair right before the black-skinned blonde dives again. You\u2019re forced to hold your breath as she swims laps under the water. You try to swim away, but your leg is tangled in the hippo giantess\u2019s long hair and you can\u2019t get free. You grunt as you try and free yourself but it\u2019s no use. Eventually, you feel the werehippo giantess waddling out of the pool and she shakes her hair to get the water out. You have to hold on tight to avoid being tossed off of the citadel before you slip and fall onto the ginormous hippo woman\u2019s face and slide to the end of her snout and finally maintain your footing. You look up and see the werehippo\u2019s enormous moon-sized eyes and don\u2019t know what to expect when she spots the tiny human in front of her face. To your confusion, she hasn\u2019t spotted you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Then it hits you. The werehippo woman was wearing glasses earlier. She probably doesn\u2019t see too well and you breathe a sigh of relief. But before you can enjoy your brief moment of relief, the hippopotamus lady walks up to a table where she placed her glasses right next to a bottle of red wine and a glass. The werehippo giantess puts her glasses back on and she immediately spots you. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she asks. You step back and yell as you fall off her snout and into her cleavage. You almost sink into the hippo giantess\u2019s fat but she plucks you out with some long red painted fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see the hippo lady staring down at you. \u201cMy,\u201d said the giantess in a seductive sounding contralto. \u201cWhat have we hear? I haven\u2019t seen a human around for ages.\u201d You sweat as you wonder exactly what the werehippo is going to do to you or if she\u2019s even friendly. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

How'd you end up between my knockers, little one?\" She quips, starting to walk away from the pool. At your scale, her casual footsteps create dull <i>thoom</i>s that make her massive weight and power compared to you all too clear. \"It's rather rude to touch a lady <i>there</i>, especially without her permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, you stutter out, \"S-sorry about ending up....there, ma'am. I wasn't being a pervert or anything; I swear! I'd <i>never</i> do that to a lady--especially not one as big as you...\" You cringe in horror, slapping a hand over your mouth. That was NOT a smart thing to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo lady laughs...which gives you a VERY good view of her cavernous maw. Her tongue alone looked as big as an aircraft carrier. \"Oh, calm down, you little gentleman. I'm a <i>pachyderm</i>; being plump comes naturally. Besides, even if I was skinny as a rail I'd still be 'big' to you. I'm not going to eat you just because you said ONE thing to offend me. Now, how did you show up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she seemed reasonable. You continue, now less fearful. \"Ahem. I...just sort of found myself here. Then I saw you, fell into the pool when I tried to run away--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And got tangled in my hair and taken for a ride?\" She finishes. You nod. \"Hmm....well, I guess your evening didn't go very swimmingly, eh?\" She chuckles at her pun, and you laugh along with her. This HAD been a pretty bad night so far, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that her booming footsteps stopped. \"Ah, this looks good. My favorite chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're just about to ask what she means when the hippo lady suddenly lowers her hand towards the wide metal chair, and drops you onto its cushioned seat. <br>\r\nShe made the drop a short one, but you still land on your back...as a shadow suddenly covers you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up--and yelp in terror. A familiar building-sized, bikini-clad rump loomed over you; plump enough to cover the entire plush cushion you'd been dropped onto. The hippo lady looks over her shoulder and gives a seductive grin. <br>\r\n\"Like the view, little one? I hope so, because you're in for a VERY close look.\" Her knees bend, and her gargantuan booty begins to slowly descend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble back, but even at the edge of the cushion you'd still end up flattened; and you couldn't bring yourself to jump off the chair. \"N-NO! STOP! PLEASE, NOT LIKE THIS!!\" You plead, futilely holding up your arms to block the oncoming fleshy orbs. \"THIS IS UNDIGNIFIED!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo woman's butt stops its descent an arm's length away from your from, and you hear her sigh. \"Oh, don't be so dramatic. I know how to sit on humans without killing them with my big, beautiful behind--\" She wiggles said backside and giggles a bit;  '--so you won't get crushed to death, just a little squished. Like I said, I'm not some monster. I just haven't seen a human around in AGES, and this was always my favorite way of playing with them. You might even like it! Oh, and try not to scream when my cheeks come down, you'll get an open mouth full of bum that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cry of protest is ignored as she promptly lands her big rear on you, flattening you into the cushion. And just like she'd warned, you get an open mouth full of spandex and hippo flab. The taste of sweat, chlorinated water and spandex almost makes you gag; even as the animal giantess' impossible weight painfully pins you down. You can't move beyond pitiful twitches and struggling, and all you see is the print of her bikini. Everything hurts....but miraculously, no bones were broken and you weren't smashed into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, you hear the hippo woman release a blissful, throaty sigh. \"Ohhh...that feels lovely. Just the feeling of that little lump in the cushion...the first few twitches....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush despite your pain and confusion. The hippo woman was getting <i>aroused</i> by this?! Pancaking people under her big ass was how she got off? Being eaten didn't sound so bad now; at least that wasn't as humiliating as being a pleasure object for some giant chick with jacked-up hormonal glands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmmm....</i>\" Your captress purrs. After shaking off her ecstacy, she calls out to you, \"Alright little gentleman, I'm almost finished. Just a warning; this part gets a little rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she begins to slowly twist and grind her massive behind on the cushion, the sheer weight dragging your arms and legs side to side with the crushing mass. Even your still-open jaw gets involuntarily waggled, due to the mouthful of hippo-butt you'd gotten when she'd first sat down. And throughout, you could hear her laughing and sighing with bliss as she toyed with you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ten minutes before the grinding stopped, the hippo lady giving one last satisfied breath. Her butt pressed down on you a little harder, meaning she was likely leaning back in glee. \"After sooo long...almost forgot what that feels like.\" She cleared her throat, wiggling down on you one last time for good measure. \"I think that's enough for tonight, little one. I'm sorry about that, but I just couldn't resist after so long without seeing a human around here. And for what it's worth...you made a <i>fantastic</i> little seat cushion. And such a gentleman, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gargantuan booty FINALLY begins to lift....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You give a few panicked wriggles as you feel the ground disappear, but promptly freeze when you see how far away the chair is as she stands at full height, giving a tiny whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming a rather chipper tune, your pachyderm pal's behind quakes with each step she makes towards the steps, swaying her hips around far to much to be unintentional. As she goes through the door, her butt cheeks are squished between the narrow staircase's walls, and the only direction they can go is to bob up, and down, up, and down, so much that you're scared the layer of sweat keeping you adhered (and alive) to her is getting shaken up, and now you're actually trying to really grasp onto her supple flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the two of you, the staircase is a spooky black, with only a few candelabras hanging on the wall to light the way. Her butt cheek slips past a doorway on the right wall, and then another, and then another, and as one by one they go by, you start to realize something doesn't make sense about the layout; the citadel looked huge from the outside, already enough for a titanic hippo to live in, but she's traveling down way too many steps without reaching the ground level, or just another curve in the steps as they'd reach the entire length of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a seemingly random door, she stops and pushes it open. Not only is there light inside, but the walls are also painted with a nauseatingly bright yellow, and the black of her skin sticks out like a black hole against all the peppy pastel colors of the bedspread, the furniture, and all the picture frames, books, and girly accessories sitting around on the dressers and bookshelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, we're here!\" She peeps. She spins around, nearly peeling you off with the centrifugal force of her ass' momentum, but she shakes you right off as she raises it up and slams it down on the end of the bed, the metal bed frame groaning from the sudden weight. Thankfully, you safely land on the mattress as you fall off, and she doesn't seem to really mind that you're no longer forcibly worshipping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she casts an open hand towards a bookcase overstuffed with old leather hardbacks, and one wriggles its way out and floats through the air into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...woah.\" You half say, half breath at the magical sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we've got all <i>that</i> out of my system, I think it's time we get to the <i>real </i>fun!\" She winks, flapping through the pages till she reaches one right in the very center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...business?\" You mutter worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm!\" She hums, trailing a pudgy finger along a line in the book, which is scrawled in some bizarre, ancient-looking cipher of complex symbols. The letters all light up as her fingertip traces by, glowing with an eerie yellow that, as you look up at the smirk tugged along her maw, is also starting to manifest itself along the irises of her eyes, their lids fluttering with excitement...</span></div></div>",

Her already cheerful expression brightens further when she reaches what she\u2019s apparently looking for. \u201cA-ha! <i>There</i> it is!\u201d She chirps, floating the book back onto the shelf. \u201cThis should be fun! Haven\u2019t used this spell in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of spell?\u201d You ask, trying not to gulp. The last time she got nostalgic, you ended up squished under a mountain of hippo rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winks at you again, already waving her hands in slow, deliberate patterns. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, little one. Oh, and you might want to sit down. This one\u2019s a bit of a doozy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue glow starts shining from her hands as her gestures speed up; first low, then slowly building up. She starts chanting in a gibberish language, her voice becoming distorted and rumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her hands are a blur, the glow blinding, and her voice a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room seems to shake, stretch, and spin all at once. You feel hot, then cold; like you\u2019re falling, then floating; everything becomes a blur\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then all at once, everything snaps back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger and faceplant on the giant bed, your head spinning and spots dancing in your vision; like a hangover from hell. What had that hippo woman just done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you you should sit down,\u201d a familiar voice scolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your head up--to find your pachyderm captress is gone. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the--?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here, sweetie.\u201d She says from behind. You spin around\u2026.and find her <i>human-sized</i>, standing on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops, and she giggles. \u201cSurprised? I figured I\u2019d be less intimidating like this. Or do you prefer me like I normally am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than you could blink, she was huge again and looming over you with a smirk. There wasn\u2019t a wave of her hand or a magic glow. Just an instant change, like cheap trick photography.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr would you like a change of scenery?\u201d She asks, grinning. With a blink, you had left her bright yellow bedroom and were at a sandy beach\u2026in broad daylight. Salt air and the sound of waves hit you, and you scramble back on the sand---which suddenly turns back into a blanket as you find the two of you back in her room. Smiling, the hippo-witch picks you up and holds you in her giant hand, close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod dumbly, and ask the obvious question:. \u201cWhat\u2026what WAS all that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPocket dimension spell. Makes this room my\u2014well, OUR\u2014little corner of the universe. Lets me twist reality all around. No illusions, it\u2019s all real. If I want to be a different size, I just have to think it, and it\u2019s true. If I want to be at a beach, I can do that too. Almost anything I want; bam, mine. I just have to imagine it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape. This giant hippo wasn\u2019t just a sorceress, she was practically a goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile suddenly drops. She sighs, the gust nearly knocking you over, and drops you back on the bed. \u201cTakes a ton of magic to do it, though. I\u2019m stuck to minor spells for WEEKS after using it for even a little bit. Overdid it once and was powerless for a month. And it\u2019s not much fun without\u2026well, a playmate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. That didn\u2019t sound good. <br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Playmate? As in, me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I can dream up people, but they\u2019re\u2026predictable. They\u2019re part of the spell, so they all come from here\u2014\u201d she tapped her head, \u201c\u2014and don\u2019t do much I don\u2019t think up. Not much fun in that. And most people kinda find me scary...\u201d She frowns, but leans in and smiles. \u201cBut you? Well, like I said; I haven\u2019t seen a human around here in ages. And I\u2019ve NEVER played with one in my pocket dimension, so\u2026why not try it? Don\u2019t worry; I wouldn\u2019t think of hurting you; I always will it so everything is harmless, even when I, heh; play rough. Remember how you didn\u2019t get squished too bad when I sat on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll too well\u2026\u201d You mumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. \u201cHmph. Spoilsport. Anyway, if it gets too scary or intense I can always kill the spell and return things to normal. It\u2019s all in good fun.\u201d She leaned down and cuddled her cheek against you. \u201cAnd, even if you don\u2019t want to do it, I\u2019ll let you stay here regardless. You\u2019re a guest, not a toy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment to realize she was asking for permission. Powerful as she was, she wasn\u2019t going to force this on you. She was even taking you in\u2014in this world of giant monster women, a roof over your head could be lifesaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extend a hand. \u201c\u2026Alright. I\u2019ll do it. Just...just please don\u2019t sit on me again, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink, she\u2019s human-sized again, and shakes your hand. \u201cDeal. And don\u2019t worry; I won\u2019t be doing <i>that</i> again for a while. I just had to get it out of my system\u2014like I said, I hadn\u2019t seen a human in ages\u2026I just couldn\u2019t control myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \u201cAs long as you give me a warning. And the view wasn\u2019t too bad, now that I think of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me,\u201d she warns. Then she smiles.\u201cOh, and where are my manners? My name\u2019s Morgan, what\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your name\u2014and mid-word, Morgan is huge again. She snatches you up between two fingers, light playing off her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is gonna be so much fun...I have a great game in mind, little guy!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, whatever you can still call \u201creal,\u201d anyways. There\u2019s voices surrounding you, male, female, young, old, but all speaking a random assortment of words, probably even gibberish, you can\u2019t tell, its only purpose being to provide the ambience of a crowded area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move your foot, and the course of action infuses energy to your body like it were breathing life into you; your eyes ache, your limbs are shivering, and your tiredly rub your eyes to relieve them of the glaring sources of light sitting overhead; at last, it seems like everything that\u2019d happened before, Morgan, her magic, being sat on her was an ended dream, and you were finally waking back up to everything you knew as true and dear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if you\u2019d fallen asleep at a wrestling ring. In a patriotic spandex uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\u201cLET\u2019S GIVE IT UP FOR MORGAN THE MORTICIAN!!!\u201d</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201caudience\u201d (just rows and rows of dark-colored blobs, merging and squishing against one another to substitute crowds of people fighting one another for space) all converge into a roaring ovation as a certain set of legs steps into the light from the nigh pitch-black surrounding the ring; wide, awkward hooves swallowed by grotesquely bloated calves that seem to get wider and wider the more their owner trundles into the opposite end of the playing field, till Morgan is completely in the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s now around twenty feet tall, a <i>slightly</i> more interactive size than she was before, but gone is her mysterious, subtle wardrobe, now swapped for a black and white rubber leotard that conforms to the thick, meaty rolls and naval of her bloated stomach, whilst sparing her legs of any imprisonment and allowing the ponderously wide cliff of ass bulging out from her backside to spring out into its full, untapped vigor, the monolotihic globes of adipose and cellulite squished together in a hell of a wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black mask covers her entire face, her eyes whited out in a way semblance to a super hero in a cartoon. She thrusts her arms up to the air and rotates to fully embrace her roaring fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201c...but a battler is only good if there\u2019s somebody to battle, so without further ado, let\u2019s give a wrestling fan\u2019s hello to the one, the only, <b>JOHNNY \u2018DEATHBRINGER\u2019 MCPUNCHFACE, THE FACE-PUNCHING BRINGER OF DEATH!!!\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the white voids of Morgan\u2019s eyes take on a more cheery shape as she leans forward and gestures to you, directing the audience to cheer for you as well. Taken aback that Morgan was at least kind enough to supply you with an applause as well, you nervously manage a smile and polite wave to the cheering sounds roaring over youre back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...this is gonna hurt, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You snark through your grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>DING DING DING!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Morgan hunches forward with her mitts open and fat feet digging into the floor, eyes seizing up with every intent to hurl you out of the ring. You flinch, but, not wanting to go down without a fight, you raise your fists and glare right back, trying your best not to shake under the prospect of what you knew was going to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThree...two...one...BATTLE!!!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lunges forward, her footsteps seemingly moving in slow motion as the =entire stadium rattles beneath her footfalls. Navigating over the tremors, you run forward as well, face clenched in the most furious face you can possibly fake whilst wrecking your vocal cords in trying to produce the most metal scream you\u2019ve ever made before...only for it to come out in a girly shriek as you run towards the oncoming hippo like an enraged three year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Morgan jumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...no, she doesn\u2019t jump. She merely flicks at the floor with her toes and catapults twice her height into the air, twirling around in the air before she floats in front of one of the lights shining down on the stadium, a silhouette of her body bracing for impact forming an eclipse that would\u2019ve almost resembled a superhero\u2019s logo, and truly, at the sight, the fear of getting flattened beneath her plummeting body was thrust deep into your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime goes even slower. The distance between you halves, and then halves <i>again</i>, and right as the world is shifting to black, you realize you\u2019d never stopped screaming like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WHMPT</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...the sound impacts your ears like every occurring sound during a meteorite impacting a city, the full magnitude of the explosion, buildings toppling, and all the screams compressed together into a a fraction of a second. Then it\u2019s silent. Even the blood traveling in your ears is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s dark, even more black then shutting your eyes in a dark room. You try to move a finger, wherever they are, seeing as you can\u2019t even feel your own head. There\u2019s no pain, but no pleasure. No heat, cold, weight or air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but then a loud schlup fills your ears as air travels back into purgatory, Morgan giving a grunt of satisfaction as she rolls of your body. The cheering returns, but you stare at the ceiling, processing what happened. You\u2019re still alive, there\u2019s that, but that only means you have the pleasure of seeing what\u2019s happened to your bloody, imagining what all the bloody details would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing yourself for the horror film you were about to witness, you tilt your head forward to observe yourself, but you jolt upwards in shock at the sheer <i>lack{/} of being a bloody, bony puddle from the waist down. You push up with your unbroken arms, peeling from the layer of hippo sweat gluing you to the ring, and numbly run your hands down your chest and legs, devoid of anything less than a bruise. Hell, you\u2019re not even mentally traumatized, if just having trouble accustoming to the fact that you\u2019d survive vied being flattened by a fat, Amazonian hippo.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, a warm giggle comes from your side, and you see Morgan having a laugh near your side, arms folded underneath her breasts and her massive legs playfully kicking about, splayed like she were a lover waiting for you in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s two out of three sound?\u201d She offers.</i></span></div></div>",

She slaps her ample belly, then her rear and gives you a sultry look. \"Which one should I flatten you with this time, Johnny-boy? Belly or booty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just can't STOMACH that I'm gonna kick your ASS, you pachydermic priss!\" You return, trying to keep a straight face despite the awful pun. Morgan still loves it, though--the crowd of shadows cheer at your quip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Second Round!\"</i> The announcer bellows. <i>\"Three, two, one....BATTLE!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan thunders toward you as she did before, and you see her legs bend for another jump. Not wanting to get flattened again, you dash to the side and avoid her charge--but not fast enough to get out of arm's length. She goes for a grab and catches you in a bear hug! Your face gets smashed into her ample cleavage and you hear her throaty laugh from your fleshy prison. \"Johnny, there are kids watching! Keep it PG, sweetie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt of effort, you manage to squirm out of her grip and backpeadle away. \"Says the one with implants,\" you quip, pointing at her breasts. Morgan's sizable knockers were 100% genuine, but you couldn't resist a quip. \"Not the best role model, big gal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan almost breaks character, barely containing a laugh. She puts on an angry glare, acting offended. \"Pervert! Looks like Morgan the Mortician's gonna have to call a <i>hearse!</i>\" She charges at the last word, trying to ram you. You dodge again, skirting behind her--and give her a LITERAL butt-kicking. Your foot bounces off her rump like the cheeks were foot-thick rubber, but Morgan plays along and trips herself, even landing with her rear in the air. You make as if to kick it, but the hippo spins out of her fall, nailing you with a hip-check to the face. The wrecking ball of a booty sends you flying across the ring and slam into the turnpike. The crowds howl with laughter and you see stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you're the BUTT of the joke now, Johnny!\" Morgan says with a smug laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling, you get up--and see her charging at you again. <br>\r\nBut this time, inspiration strikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than avoid the charging werehippo, you rush at her! The aggessive move makes her blink in surprise, even forgetting to jump for a belly/butt smash...which was just what you needed. Just as Morgan is about to run past you, you grab her arm and pull an Irish Whip--dragging her in the opposite direction and making her run back at the ropes. She bounds off them, running too fast to stop right at you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her open for a clothesline! You raise an arm at the last moment, and she takes the bar clear to the face; like she ran into a tree branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan staggers--there's your opening! She was either genuinely dazed, or playing along and giving you an open. Either way, you were taking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the \"audience\" and theatrically crack your knuckles. \"Looks like there's a face in need of punching! And when faces need fists, who delivers the goods?!\" You shout, putting on your best manic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"JOHNNY! JOHNNY! JOHNNY!\"</i> The blobs chant, roaring as one. \"Time to KNUCKLE DOWN!\"<br>\r\nYou smile. Morgan even gave you a catchphrase! You'd have to thank her for that. You crack your knuckles again and turn to Morgan, still comically stumbling about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wind up the biggest, most exaggerated haymaker you can, and decide to throw in a one-liner. \"Hey Morgan! If you're a mortician and I send you to a paramedic, is that irony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the cue, she smiles and answers. \"No, it's just coincidence--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter! TIME TO KNUCKLE DOWN!\" you roar, and throw the punch. Your fist collides with Morgan's snout, eliciting a <i>Whump!</i> that echoes around the ring, audible even over the crowd's wild cheering. Morgan goes flying across the ring like she'd been hit by a truck, cartoonshly bouncing off the ropes and falling flat on her face with a *THUD* that shakes the ring. She's either out cold, or playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>DING-DING-DING!</i> \"DOWN SHE GOES! DOWN GOES MORGAN!\" the unseen announcer yells. \"Ladies and gentlemen, after rough start, Johnny McPunchface has lived up to his name! I have not seen a hit like that since BoneButton floored Nicky Nitro back in '87! We've seen history today, folks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swagger around the ring, flexing your arms and winking at the crowd. You haven't had this much fun in a long time, and what a rush! A chuckle catches your ear, and you look to find Morgan sitting up, grinning ear to ear. She applauds, clearly enjoying this bombastic wrestling as much as you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mean right hook you've got there!</i> Her voice echoes in your head. You blink in surprise, but shrug it off. If she could manage this reality warping, of course she could be telepathic. <i>And I was worried I'd take the first two matches. You, little human, are a ton of fun!</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You and Morgan look upwards, the sounds of a large, groaning mechanism lurching somewhere above as four metal walls descend from between the light fixtures, their ends meeting and clamping together to form a cage. Whilst her maw remains masked, you have a gut instinct by the white silhouettes of her eyes that she seems a little too pleased by this change as she cracks her doughy fingers and wrings her head to the side, proving bones still exist in that fat neck-tyre of hers with a loud pop. You stay in character and throw a few mock punches into the air, unleashing a few amateur kung-fu poses to rile up the crowd, but your inner sense pride tells you it\u2019s not nearly as intimidating as she could be just by standing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen motors begin spinning in the ground as well. You leap back as a panel beneath your feet shifts downwards and pulls over to the side, enabling a metallic rack to rise up from below. The same happens for Morgan, who itches at her double-chin at the selections that were laid out for her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your own arsenal; one\u2019s a katana, its blade wrapped in an undying sheathe of red flame. The next is a jet pack, but its rocket pack is also accompanied by a tank of green fluid affixed to its back that is connected to a manual hose, its tip leaking a noxious gas of the same color. All tempting choices, but, ever the gamer to go the energy-weapon route to fry your enemies to a crisp, one item catches your eye the most; that is, mainly the glow of yellow light burning from within. A pair of iron wristbands adjourned with lightning symbols, semblant to the shells of batteries with their maws wide open, silently screaming for an owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt another gut instinct, you thrust your hands in, the metal shells clamping down on your arms. Your hairs stand on end as sparks of electricity buzz within the tips of the gloves, which traverses into your arms, making your every pore and muscle tingle by an influx of static pooling in the air, black rubber oozing out from the gloves\u2019 openings and covering your hands like a proper set of gloves, completed by a pair of buttons that shoot out and rest in the center of either palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons both glow red and, shedding any care for the consequences, you press either with the middle fingers of both hands. With little acknowledgement worse than getting shocked by a doorknob, you\u2019re encased by a cocoon of lightning bolts that swarms the metal rack like a plate of glowing white snakes, sparks emitting from the jet suit and fizzling its rockets before the shelf lowers once again, the floor sealing itself to how it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs does Morgan\u2019s, who\u2019s equipping herself with a tank on her back with wires that connect to white sleeves that she\u2019s stuffing her doughy arms into. There isn\u2019t the curiosity and wonder you\u2019re holding in right now: she knows exactly what it does, and her cheeks are wide with an invisible grin as she turns a switch on one of her wristbands, inviting glowing blue liquid to travel through the tubes and into her bloodstream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer veins shine as the liquid makes its way though her body, enabling you to see the quest it takes through her arms and into her chest...as well as the effect it leaves wherever it moves. Her mask stretches to accommodate her bloating jowls whilst they spread along her spare chin, which fattened to give space for <i>another</i> birthing its way from under her jaw, followed by {i]another after that; she emits an enjoyed grunt whilst cupping her palms around the expanding curvature of her breasts, satisfied by an extra few handful\u2019s worth of titfat that\u2019s still growing in their grasp, then maneuvers her hands downwards to feel the widening curves of her belly, growing heavier and larger whilst merging with the immense width of her legs, briefly supplying her with the proper roundness of a sumo wrestler\u2019s build...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then comes her favorite part, judging by the pleased howl she releases as her behind grows to compete, her entire lower half rapidly widening out and bloating up to seize its former dominance on her figure, and then beyond. Her panties ride up against the extreme influx of size to the legs they were containing, so much of the gargantuan globes of her rump pushing their way through that it brings into question if she\u2019d have enough decency in a proper match. Coupled with her extra-fattening figure is the fact that she\u2019s growing <i>up</i> as well, initially at only a slow enough pace to notice, but it really picks up as the glow in her veins touches her feet, forcing every part of her between her toes and her hair to grow, soon ascending an extra half of her fight with a much, much more tremendous figure to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer black skin adds a nightly tint to her growing shadow, which soon overtakes you as her shoulders grow past the lights, but throwing a punch to the floor gives you all the light you need, timing a button press so the floor lights up with a circle of energy that surrounds you, filled with stray bolts of lightning that painlessly burrow through your body and singe the floor. Morgan ascends to fifty feet. Then sixty feet. Then seventy feet, her body fattening to such frighteningly fat proportions that her asscheeks each outsize and outweigh her entire form but seconds ago. The distance between your eyes and hers increasing, she arches down, belly and boobs squashing against the ground and forcing her to stretch to smack a fist down with a glare as she continues to grow, her extending height surpassed behind by the growth of her utterly cyclopian butt as either half tower over her back rolls like a pair of otherworldly monoliths that are budding into the sky to consume the planet, outsizing all that humanity knew existed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then her eyes widen at the sound of metal warping, and she stares up past her shoulder as her behind fills the entire space between the cage\u2019s walls, black pachyderm blubber bending the bars and railing out of place. Sheepishly, she claps her hands, and the entire cage swells to dozens of times its size, supplying her plenty of legroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree! Two! One!\u201d The announcer counts off. \u201cFIGHT!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ding! Ding! Ding!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ball your fists, thus clenching the buttons and preparing crude whips of lightning that flutter from your hands, prepped to fight back when Morgan inevitably gives charge to flatten you again...but she stays put. Forgetting how much of a head start she has, she instead straightens out and stomps forward, a slow, lethargic feat that just watching makes you feel like your own legs are caught in cement. Another step follows, descending into a lazy stroll, but you don\u2019t bother watching the show and fire your lightning whips at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. You throw your whips back and forth, striking her in her extra-sized belly a few times, but she only scratches at her singed leotard without losing her steadily growing pace, at which point it\u2019s very, very apparent how close she\u2019s getting. You pull your hands behind your back and shoot them forward, firing a slew of lightning bolts at her body that her dimply hide accepts with no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s when she\u2019s a single stomp away from reaching you that you give up on the light show and run the other way. Running away proves itself a temporary choice; you guess it requires Morgan just two steps to catch up to you now, but on a whim, you press the switches and throw the resultant sparks at your feet, and achieve the exact thing you need right now: speed. Your legs paddle on beams of lightning at speeds your thinly-muscled legs wouldn\u2019t achieve a tenth of in the real world, and even time itself seems to blur whilst you remain at a frantic space, white light bordering the very rim of your eyes. You look back, eager to mock Morgan as she stumbles to catch up with you...but you instead see her leap in long, powerful bounds that do a decent enough job. At the speed of flowing molasses, she performs another leap and spins through the air, the spanning view of her ass providing a brief comfort to her fist coming around and barreling right to you, the sight of her clenched, meaty fingers soaring your way prompting a shriek from your lungs before you throw your hands over your head, only able to hope that not seeing what was to follow would lessen the pain. Morgan\u2019s fist meets the face of your gauntlets, providing your face with but an inch-thick strip of metal to guard your body with the sheer tonnage and velocity of her punch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your gloves dig into the supple flesh of her hand, but anything further than that delivers as much force as a runaway shopping cart. Looking past the crux of your arms, Morgan\u2019s eyes are also bugging as she tries to exert more force onto her arm, even grabbing it with her other to aid in pushing it upon you, but sparks of electricity fizzle through her muscles that prevent her from play-smashing your body into non-bloody pudding. Her struggles renders you just as moot to battling any further, but at a quick glance on your own gauntlets, the yellow symbols are gradually turning white, siphoning the power in her limbs into your own source of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut your eyes, mellowing out your face...then deliver a punch that, amongst a resounding explosion of energy, knocks her fist aside. Her legs slip out from beneath her, a letting out a startled yelp as she flies out of balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRACK!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you soar upwards on the speed and path of a lightning bolt as thick as a bus, the ensuing roar mixed with the clap of thunder and the impact of your fist striking her jaw.</span></div></div>",

She staggers back, drunkenly swaying as stray flickers of lightning dance across her blimp-like body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer snout fills your view as she focuses on you hovering before her at eye-level, a bewildered look on her face. She wobbles in place, slurring. \u201cWha\u2026I didn\u2019t know it could\u2014YIPE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the opening, you zoom at her and deliver a haymaker to her nose, calling forth another burst of lightning! Current shoots through Morgan and she spasms and jitters uncontrollably, her muscles thrashing from the shock. The entire stadium shakes with a staggering step back, a crater forming in the floor. \u201cGuess this news is a SHOCK, Morgan! You should keep up with CURRENT events!\u201d you taunt, posing for the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroans at your horrible pun mingle with cheers at your light show. You eat it up, striking some more poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And barely dodge Morgan\u2019s swatting hand, the wind it leaves in its wake knocking you briefly astray. It sounds like a freight train zooming by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan\u2019s blimb-shaped-and-sized body crackles with stray current as she again stumbles, her massive booty slamming into the cage\u2019s wall, bending the metal out. She retakes a stance, but the pachyderm giantess is unsteady on her feet, blinking in confusion. But she\u2019s recovering, and a glance at your gauntlets shows the glow dimming\u2014these things didn\u2019t have much of a charge, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Time for the coup de grace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap your fists together, coating them in lightning. Your hair stands on end, the air around you seems to vibrate. Even the stage lights above the ring flicker, as if you\u2019re drawing away their power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Morgan\u2026stares wide eyed and slack-jawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, you zoom at her, cocking back your fist. And deliver one last quip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTAKE THIS! MY RAGE, MY FEAR, ALL MY POWER! <b><i>SEARING! STORM! FIST</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land a punch square on her massive distended belly. It caves in like a marshmallow, and ALL of the lightning shoots into her at once. The gloves power down and you fall to the floor\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you\u2019re forced to cover your ears as a massive explosion envelopes the ring. The audience screams\u2014in fear, not approval. Morgan\u2019s devices spark and explode into dust as a storm of power shoots up, her form thrashing even worse than before\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the storm clears. Morgan is now holding her gut, her costume covered in burns and crackling with current. She tries to stand up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>and slips.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan lets out a startled, rather <i>squeaky</i> yelp nothing like her seductive contralto. Her feet slip out from under her, and she tumbles backward. Her titanic butt slams against the cage wall, bursting the metal open like it was wet cardboard. The crowd behind her are enveloped in the shadow of her all-encompassing booty, and they barely get time to scream before her cheeks crush down on them with meteoric force. Those out of the impact zone fare not better, for a massive shockwave is sent out, obliterating everything in its path. Half the arena\u2014and the crowd\u2014were wiped out in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan tries to rise\u2026but slumps back down, flat on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll is silent\u2026all is still.<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*DING-DING-DING!!!*</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S OVER! IT\u2019S OVER! MORGAN IS DOWN, LADIES AND GENTS! GIVE IT UP FOR OUR NEW CHAMPION!\u201d the announcer bellows, voice cracking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheer that follows is even more deafening than Morgan\u2019s fall. Joyous wails assault your eardrums, and you rasie your fist in victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was amazing, the thrill of the crowd; the adoration and adrenaline!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And then, in an instant, it collapses.<br>\r\nThe arena seems to stretch and wave, and in a blink you\u2019re back on Morgan\u2019s bed. Your weapons are gone. Sweat drenches you. You\u2019re exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan is flat on her back, panting and fanning herself with a look of exhausted bliss on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat. Was. Incredible\u2026\u201d she breaths, winded. She looks at you, grinning. \u201cYou were amazing, sweetie. Absolutely amazing.\u201d Her plump hand suddenly grabs you and lifts you to her face\u2026toward her mouth. You try to object, but it\u2019s cut off when Morgan kisses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her being 1500 feet tall, her lips all but enveloped you from head to toe. It\u2019s a long kiss, almost smothering\u2014and then she pulls you away from her lips with a deafening *SMACK!* and holds you close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had that much fun in ages\u2026you beat me in my own little spell. You\u2019re a special one, little human. I like you.\u201d She nuzzles her massive snout against you, purring softly. \u201cSo cute\u2026so adorable...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks,\u201d you pant, feeling yourself blush. For a gigantic animal woman, Morgan was a PHENOMENAL kisser. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing too. Didn\u2019t see that wrestling match coming. So, uh; what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we clean up,\u201d Morgan answers. \u201cLike I said, that spell drains a LOT of magic, so I can\u2019t just zap us clean.\u201d She snaps her fingers, calling up a wimpy sparkle that quickly fades. She looks at it with distaste, then gently stuffs you between her breats as she gets up. \u201cSo\u2026it\u2019s bathtime, then<br>\r\nWe go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide. Bath time\u2026? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Morgan? D-do you mean we\u2019re gonna\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens a door into a bathroom big enough to house an airport. An entire wall is dominated by a pink marble counter and GOLDEN sink, and a huge mirror. A chandelier provides light. The bathtub was enormous even by Morgan\u2019s standards, made of marble. Plush rugs cover the floor, pretty-scented candles burning on a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood Lord, this place was like a luxury hotel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBathe TOGETHER?\u201d Morgan finishes, chuckling. Her breasts bounce with her laughter. \u201cSweetie, I may like flattening humans under my big beautiful booty, but I\u2019m not THAT kinky. Besides, it\u2019d be dangerous for you! Nah, you\u2019ll just wash up in my sink. Much safer that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief\u2026and some shameful disappointment. \u201cOh, good\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...but all being said, as a human in a giant\u2019s world who was welcomed with not only the unsolicited generosity of a titan that could\u2019ve let you stay out in the cold as an act of mercy, but also wasted her extended use of her supernatural prowess just to give you a night of fun, you\u2019re aware that her having a little privacy is just the start of your debt towards her, and you bite back any disappointment as she twists the handle to the sink, testing the steaming water with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that it\u2019s a safe temperature, Morgan scrunches her eyes up, her other hand\u2019s fingers joining together to perform a snap. Her muzzle scrunches with concentration twice the intensity of what it took to perform her brain-bending spell from before, but all she has left of her magic is a few little pink electric sparks that snake around the flesh of her arm. Her fingers tense up, she snaps...and a flash and a bang ensues that bathes you in white smoke, a sudden draft encompassing you when your clothes disintegrated, in their place a swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny the spell may have been, Morgan takes some long, winded breaths as she sets you down in the sink, the golden basin\u2019s unscalable walls robbing you the temptation of seeing Morgan undress as she trudges out of view, breathing heavily as she prepares her own shower. \u201cNeed anything, just holler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d You call back, trudging through the water that pools before it can hit the drain. Speaking of, in a twinge of concern, you wade towards the stream of water yourself to see how easy it\u2019d be for you to get sucked away but the drainpipe is thankfully blocked by thick metal bars that allow the water to pass with no risk of you falling in, and observing the tree-trunk thick pillar of water, you test the flow with your head and proceed with scrubbing yourself clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the water feels expensive, purging the dirt from your pores at the mere contact with your skin, even moisturizing your hands\u2019 dry skin. It\u2019s just an average shower\u2019s length till you\u2019re the most clean you\u2019ve ever been since the doctors first wiped you off after being born, but you keep wiping your arms, legs, every nook and cranny with twice the care you\u2019d take on cleaning yourself for even the fanciest of nights, wanting every patch of skin on you to feel rejuvenated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen comes the obvious question: how does it taste? It may be magical on the skin, but that\u2019s not to say anything magical is safe to consume. However, it\u2019s not like Morgan would dare risk anything to hurt her new little playmate, so after regrettably pulling away from the waterfall, you give into curiosity. You cup your hands, easing it in to scoop some of the life-giving fluid to sample...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the stream thins out into nothing, the splashing at your feet muting to allow Morgan\u2019s shower and some, to put it kindly, <i>horrible</i> singing you\u2019d ask from a reality-bending mystic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgan?\u201d You call out, pulling a few wet locks of hair from your eyes. \u201cI think something\u2019s going on with the wa...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your voice snags, seeing why the water had stopped falling into the sink. The faucet is still running; it\u2019s not even clogged. The water is just pooling in mid-air around its mouth in a growing sphere, a current swirling around that swishes some air bubbles inside through a whirlpool. With the water at your feet allowed to be sucked away into the drain, you unconsciously step backwards as the mass of water grows to what would be eight feet to your diminutive perspective, but its globular shape is disturbed by a point forming on one side that extends into a tentacle, which whips out onto the faucet\u2019s handle to increase its flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sink is rapidly filled with water, all of it one with the same bizarre conglomeration, you leap back in fear and tread as far up the sink\u2019s walls as you can without slipping, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from paddling in a desperate attempt to climb as the blob ascends to twenty feet in height. \u201cMorgan?! Morgan!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Morgan\u2019s reaching a solo that leads to her screeching out words in a high pitch that reduces them to horrendous gibberish, and everything plays out with no interruption. The tentacle, much more plump with the growing mass of its host, withdraws, dropping to the mass\u2019 side into a limb that\u2019s significantly fatter and heavier in its unstretched length, but another \u2018arm\u2019 forms on its other \u2018shoulder\u2019 just as blobby as the first. In fact, the entire body of water is taking a shape; if still a gigantic, swelling spheroid, a ridge forms along its equator that resembles a fat belly roll, but its current also flows into its flanks, concentrating the mass to form into an expansive rear that pushes its hips into view from either side of its curvature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, scrambling to escape the sink and screaming \u2018Morgan!\u2019 on repeat is second nature, feeling the massive collection of water grow to pool around your feet, but its wide-ways growth is soon matched as its owner to grow <i>up</i> as well, and its upper hemisphere blossoms with two breast-like hills that expands along the stomach\u2019s roof till it covers its...really her, you can tell, belly\u2019s roof like a muffin\u2019s top. All that remains is a head, a globule forming on top with \u2018flabby\u2019 cheeks forming as the mountain of water becomes tall enough for her head to submerge the faucet\u2019s pipe where her nose and mouth would be, but lacked such as it pulls away and shuts off the flow, her face consisted only of two large, glowing ovals decorated by sharp lashes at the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fifty feet tall, the sapient lake styles the water along its head to form a floating cascade that drapes over it shoulder like a curled ribbon, her glowing eyes shutting in satisfaction as she courses her hands down the horizon of her spheric belly, working the kinks from its arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i><b>MORGAN!!!</b></i>\u201d Comes a particularly loud screech out of you, earning a jolt from the super-sized water creature, its eyes shooting open in surprise. At last, Morgan\u2019s shower turns off, and the top of her head pops into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d She asks, fear clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsent of any words or magic know how to warn her of what\u2019s happening, you dumbly gesture at the water-demon. \u201c<i>That!!!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause, which the water-creature spends eyeing you uncomfortably, but Morgan responds with a casual chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that?\u201d She dismisses. \u201cSorry, I forgot to mention. The water supply here is populated by water elementals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater...elementals?\u201d You repeat in a numb tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut listen, don\u2019t worry none. They\u2019re incredibly friendly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and with no further word, instruction, or warning, Morgan turns her shower back on, her screeching lyrics presuming. Left alone and curled up against the slope of the sink, you just lock eyes with the water elemental, who tilts closer in interest, and you just manage a tiny wave of your hand and a shy smile. \u201c...Hi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the lack of any hostility, the water elemental\u2019s eyes turn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She taps a rippling hand to her mouthless face and swished a downward curve where a mouth would be, sketching in full, luscious lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a second to process that the creature just drew a smile on her face. \u201cHeh, that\u2019s a neat tri\u2014WOAH!\u201d Tentacles of water wrap around you mid-sentence, yanking you up to her face and hugging you into her ample belly. Fear or drowning kicks in, and you thrash to get free, to not sink into this mystical creature\u2019s liquid form\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026For all of one second. You aren\u2019t drawn under. In fact, you don\u2019t sink at all. The water\u2019s surface has become viscous, like a water bed, keeping you safe. You blush and look up at the elemental hugging you tight. She quirks a brow and makes a bubbling sound like a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Silly thing, you think I\u2019d hurt you?</i> You imagine her saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, forgot to mention: that elemental is a hugger.\u201d Morgan supplies, too late.  \u201cShe can\u2019t help herself, especially when I have guests! Sometimes I shrink myself and hug it out with her.

Waggling her brow at you, she extends her free arm theatrically. Water flows across her form toward the limb, pooling at the end and forming into something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tennis racket?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. Why would a creature made of water need a tennis racket? It couldn't be a gift: it was scaled to someone of her fifty-foot height, so you were too small to even hold it. Maybe she wanted to play?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to play tennis, Miss Elemental?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, grinning.<br>\r\nBut she still held you tight against her side, and that grin lingered on you too long to be comfortable. Red flags started going up in your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and decide to tempt fate. \"Um, I don't suppose you could make me a racket? Or a ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a bubbling giggle...<i>and points the giant racket at you.</i> <br>\r\n<i>Oh cutie, YOU'RE the ball! No need for a racket,</i> you imagine her saying. Instantly you start squirming to escape, but her grip...and being squished into her plump form...made it futile. You did manage to tickle the elemental, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Morgan? She's gonna use me as a tennis ball! Little help?!\" <br>\r\nNo answer. Morgan's shower and screeching song drowned you out as the elemental turned the faucet back on and lifted you up for a serve, aiming at the stream of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, this isn't funny! I don't want to be sports equipment! I don't even like tennis, I prefer baseball! Morgan, stop the elemental please! Drink her or something!\" You keep pleading, but your frantic calls go unheard as you're thrown straight up with a yelp, high enough to clear the top of the sink and see Morgan's silhouette behind the shower curtain before gravity reclaims you and you fall back towards the elemental, waiting with racket in hand/tentacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the fear, you glare at the aquatic spirit. <br>\r\n<i>\"I hope you get pumped full of fluoride, you big fat--\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Whack!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watery racket smacks you like a giant flyswatter (though painlessly; she wasn't trying to hurt you), rocketing you across the sink and into the cascade coming from the faucet--and <i>bounce</i> off it back at her, the water suddenly viscous and rubber-like. It seemed the elemental could control water that <i>wasn't</i> part of her form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus began the impromptu game of tennis, the elemental whacking you back and forth across the sink. With surprising skill, too: she was always right where you would be, timing her shots perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have been impressive if YOU weren't forced to be her tennis ball. \"MORGAN, HELP!\" <b>Whack!</b> Topspin. \"This is--\" <b>Whack!</b> Slice. \"--Not funny! She isn't--\" <b>Whack!</b> Backspin. \"--being a good host!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your pleas go unanswered. Morgan still scrubbed herself down, cheerily butchering whatever song she was singing. At least this couldn't get worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly back towards the elemental as she winds up a truly epic lob shot. The racket smacks into you harder than ever before--but still not enough to hurt--and sends you straight into the water. It bends back, more than any other shot you've endured...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sends you rocketing clear out of the sink, over the shocked elemental's head! You jeer at her, happy to be free...until you realize you're flying right toward the shower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, of course, remains oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, your arc peaks over the bar and you get an awe-inspiring look at the colossal, beautiful, and <i>very naked</i> form of Morgan. <br>\r\nYou can't help but grin: the titanic werehippo really was a bombshell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen gravity claims you a second later and you fall towards the shower, you suddenly remember how dangerous bathing with such a giantess could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe being used as a tennis ball wasn't so bad after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlailing and tumbling for a long moment, the roar of the shower and clouds of steam clouding your senses, you finally make impact--making a splash and knocking yourself senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you recover, you realize you've landed....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You weren't a human next to a mountain, you were next to a GODDESS. The rivulets of water streaming down her form were a hundred waterfalls; each a current strong enough to sweep you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there, flat on your back, staring up at the living mountain in awe as the water comes down in sheets; how long you aren't sure.

You're fully aware that the Lovecraftian-sized fortress of pachyderm booty is approaching at a rate and path that would land its most pressurized spot point-blank at your mortal coil, devoid of any of the safety nets from prior; she's not going to show only enough restraint to remain playful, nor does her bathtub follow the same pseudo-sort of reality that enabled your survival in the ring. She's going to allow the full weight of her body to fall onto you with the precise force that gravity can allow, ignorant to the needs and weakness of the human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a nonchalant at would reduce an entire human village and its inhabitants to their utter destruction and pandemonium, but for you, to see a creature who can't be that massive that can't move about at such a size doesn't register the concept of cause-and-effect. A violinist in your head strings away a tearjerking cover of Nearer My God to Thee, and with the foresight of certain impending doom comes an odd sense of closure. Peace, even. Of all the possibilities the multiverse in all its infinity could apply, the countless realms that could've killed you by being slaughtered by cannibals, burned at the stake by witch-hunters, or even just ne beaten in the streets by a gang of ponies you'd gotten on the wrong side of, dying under the rear of a hippo titaness was certainly not one of the least noble ways to die. A sad accident after a night of fun, in fact, not like those who were sick and alone in a hospital, nor trapped and afraid in some collapsing cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underside of Morgan's naked rear hits the surface of the water, the oncoming black globes separated from your form by a roaring tsunami. The water, too, curls over itself in slow motion, the bends in the funneling tidal wall carved and crisp in the natural glassy bends and flows that give a flowing stream its beauty. What hits you first is a cooling mist that gives your last moments a composing chill that takes your skin like a hand taking yours, speaking in some mute, kind voice that everything would be alright. Your arms extend and your head rears in that cliched pose of an action star throwing himself to the jaws of oblivion, eyes shutting to ensure your last sight of the world is Morgan's backside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but what hits you first is the barrage of water. That cleansing cold becomes an icy sting, and in a jolt your eyes bug out towards the matter at hand, the towering, black, corpulent matter that was obliviously barreling your way, and with that comes a sort of spiritual revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE, YOU MORON.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORGA....<i><b>MMMF!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026..</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan milks the act of wriggling her rump into the end of her bathtub, delighted by a certain cracking noise as its ceramic is impacted by the width of her hips. Both by the satisfaction of filling further into her tub's breaking point and the water striking her skin, she blows out a blissful whistle and leans back, stretching out her feet as her hands lay back to feel the two black hide-covered globes that the bathtub is struggling to contain, butt blubber pooling over the rim like a pair of water filled balloons squeezed in the center, forcing its mass upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more bellyfuls of hamburgers for it to smash apart, to need a widening again. Heh...to think it was once a hassle whenever her bathtub needed widening. When her magic-fueled cravings made it a dread to step on the scale and see another third of the previous weighing added on. Just some pesky conditioning from society to worry about her figure and live out in the open like some diva that took a few good looks in the mirror of her ballooning frame to kill it off in favor a new outlook on life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, when she had a knew friend to share it with, who was she to turn back now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of...yeah, him. She observed his sink to see his playmate over there, waving her aquatic arms over her head. Morgan grinned, hoping she wasn't giving him to intense of a date now, but the elemental wasn't performing a one-human juggling match per her expectations. The water-siren's eyes were wild with worry as she flapped about in gestures for Morgan to rise and see the severity of what'd been committed, spinning with grace and vigour a lengthy vocalization of her part in the human's likely demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"BLUB BLUBLUB BLUB BLUBLUBLUB<i><b> BLUB BLUB BLUB!!!</b></i> BLUB BLUBLUBLUB BLUB <i><b>BLUB BLUB BLUBLUBLUBLUB!!!</b></i>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan pursed her lips, calculating the water-lady's drowned words, but settled on leaning back in contentment. \"Hug time later.

You'd always hated the things, finding the elastic bands that stretched over the metal frame uncomfortable. Having a giant hippo woman sit on you in one only reinforced that--the bands stretched so taut they'd had as much pressure as Morgan's meteoric backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? Squashed against cold, unforgiving porcelain? The pool chair seemed like heaven. It at least contoured to Morgan's weight, and didn't crush you back like the bathtub did. And at least then Morgan KNEW you were under her rump and was holding back...wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she laughing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan chortles, unable to contain herself. It was time to have some fun. She looked down at her rear, not seeing the human but enjoying the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it must have been so frightening for you: seeing my naked rear about to flatten you, being helpless to stop it...but as long as you keep it safe a little domination never hurt anyone,\" she purrs, wiggling her titanic cheeks. Her heart races as she feels the grinding motion flattening him even further and drag him along the porcelain floor, his struggles pleasantly tickling her rump. She sighs in bliss, leaning her head back and closing her eyes. \"Mmm...I know I said I'd gotten this out of my system, and to be honest I thought I did. But I've <i>never</i> sat on humans bare-bottomed before. And when you just happened to land right behind me--well, how could I resist? You understand, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan KNEW you'd been launched into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She'd just sat on you on purpose!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're caught between anger, shock...and relief. Looks like you WOULDN'T die by werehippo booty. (Not that your predicament was pleasant--the hard bathtub was far less forgiving than the elastic pool chair she'd dropped you onto the first time she sat on you. The water was cold, too!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an open mouth of hippo-rump, you can barely manage to ask her to just get off you already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled, barely-audible grumble is her only answer. Morgan giggles, fanning herself. She wasn't lying about that part: she'd loved sitting on humans since she was a kid. It was silly, funny, and let her know just how <i>huge</i> she really was; what being 1500 feet tall REALLY meant. And with adulthood came...\"adult desires\". Sitting on a human naked had been a tempting taboo of hers once she became an adult; one that just wouldn't be worth it in her warped reality. Oh sure, she could find plenty of eager volunteers--some humans were into that sort of thing--but she'd never put the word out: it seemed cheap, crass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? A human she'd come to like, even burned out her magic for a while just to have some fun; even beat her at her own game? He was perfect to try out her fancy on. And since he hadn't expected it...so much the better. She bit her lip, enjoying his thrashing. \"Keep it up, that feels lovely! Don't worry, I'm almost finished...\" She wiggled down once more, and got back to showering...sitting down, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost finished\" turns out to mean \"I'll take as long as I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan adds a quick bounce or twist of her rear to every part of her shower routine: lathering shampoo, scrubbing herself down, rinsing off the soap; everything. You're squished, flattened and pulverized under her hulk; splashed anew into the water at every bounce and getting a fresh coat of soap. Sometimes she leans back to put more weight on you before sitting up again, making sure you never adjust to the pressure or weight. And she took her sweet time with everything, enjoying every minute of your entrapment beneath her naked backside. Your impromptu pachydermic dominatrix shows little mercy beyond what's safe to keep from turning you into a pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...you never feel in danger. You're battered and everything hurts, but you NEVER feel like your bones will break or that you'll suffocate. (The bounces free you JUST long enough to get a fresh gasp of air...convenient). You even start to enjoy it a little, like the fist match in the illusory wrestling ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world suddenly tilts, and you're lifted off the unforgiving bathtub--plastered to Morgan's mountain-sized cheek as she leans to the side. Peeling your head back from the entrapping blubber, you wince at the bright light and look over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elemental peeks over the rim of the sink, wincing in sympathy at your plight. She bubbles something that sounds like <i>I'm sorry!</i> before retreating from view. Your gaze is drawn to the gold-rimmed mirror above the sink....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere you see a tiny, barely-visible speck on the vast black expanse of Morgan's ass. You looked like a flea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, that's you!\" Morgan twitters, making sure you see her reflection's wink. She gives her rump a slap, creating a shockwave that jostles you. \"Now then, before we finish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour warning of what's to come is displayed on the mirror. Morgan lathers up a body sponge with some luxuriously-scented soap, then brings it around to scrub her left cheek--the one you're plastered to. A tidal wave of soap washes over you, the sponge pressing you down and slapping against your form with every scrub. It smells wonderful, but the slick soap offers no hope of slipping off. A gush of water rinses off the foam...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you see Morgan wink at you in the mirror; before her rear descends again. The world goes dark as she sits on you anew---and the weight suddenly crushes down as she leans on you, to wash the other cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, with a final thud, she sits up again. The water turns off, its thunderous symphony leaving an ear-ringing silence in its absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That. Was. Amazing.\" Morgan breathes, shaking the water from her hair. \"Finally; I've always wanted to do that...\" She gives one last wiggle for good measure, then stands up to peel you off her booty. It takes a good minute to peel you off, since you're so flattened. You're dangled in front of her smirking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I'd say that's enough fun for one night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a round of apologies from the elemental and Morgan, you towel off and get into a set of human-sized pajamas Morgan has handy. (Turns out she keeps some human clothes around in case she finds one. They're still in their store packaging, so they're fresh.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping you in her hands, Morgan carries you to her bedroom. \"Don't worry, after <i>that</i> lovely bit of fun I think I've had my fill of sitting on humans for a while. You won't have to fear getting flattened under my bum for a long time.\" She winks. \"Of course, if you ask, I'll be happy to oblige.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort a laugh. \"No thanks. I've had my fill of the Butt of Doom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Spoilsport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith surprising grace for such a huge being, Morgan holds you in one hand as she pulls back the covers and sits on the bed, covering herself again. \"One last thing: do you want to sleep on my bedside table? I have a sleeping bag ready for you? Or...well, sleep with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head, blushing. \"Hold up. Do you mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LITERALLY sleep with me, Mr. Hormones,\" Morgan quips, rolling her eyes. \"And nothing else. We just met, silly! I have a sitting-on-humans kink, but I have SOME standards. Anyway, you can sleep on my nice soft belly...or my chest, if you feel brave enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no sleeping on your stomach so I can use your butt as a pillow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I've had my fill of that for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn, feeling the tiring day crash down on you. It was time to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, where?</span></div></div>",

Ignoring your cries of protest, she rudely shoves you towards her snout, sniffing at you as if savoring a fresh pastry. \"Mmmm...yep, you'll be a tasty one. Not even the chlorine can mask you unappetizing. You should be proud.\" <br>\r\nA massive wet tongue snakes out from her lips and slaps against you. It's like getting hit across your whole body by a wet ten-foot think rubber hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs in horrifying bliss. \"Oh, you are a special case! Normally I'd play with you a bit, but for a treat like YOU? I'll skip the foreplay.\" <br>\r\nYour world tumbles as she suddenly lifts you high into the air, letting you slip just enough to dangle upside down by a leg.

The second you land on her massive tongue, her jaws snap shut before you even bounce. Immediately you hear a cataclysmic \"Mmmmm!\" all around you; the werehippo apparently finding you delicious. Her tongue suddenly flails beneath you, tossing you about the dark confines of her mouth. You're slammed against her cheeks and drenched in saliva, getting knocked ass over teakettle as she plays with you in her mouth. More than once you nearly drown in her saliva; have to dodge her Boulder-sized teeth as she \"teasingly\" tries to chew you up. It goes one for what feels like forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while you can hear her moaning in delight at your flavor, giggling at her utter domination of a tiny human...and, faintly, thundering footsteps as she walks to who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a spell of being battered and beaten by her playing, you're left barely conscious and utterly exhausted. Most of your clothes were gone, having been pulled off and sent down into the pit of her stomach.

You feel the pressure of the sucking work on your waist and the tongue sliding across your legs. Your arms try to push away from the mouth, and she giggles. You feel the sucking stop and you pull out just a bit, but then she sucks even harder, pulling to your chest. Her mouth opens up a bit and her tongue crawls around your body until it reaches your face, then tightens its coil. You feel yourself slowly pulled in, your head finally passing the lips and teeth. The mouth closes, and darkness surrounds you. You feel the tongue uncoil, but then it presses against you, tossing you around. You hear the naga moan as it tastes you. \"Mmmmmm.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue rubs against your crotch, and you shiver a bit. The tongue begins to assult that area, pressing you to the bottom of her mouth and her tongue holding you down as it rubs you more. You hear even more moaning, as if she was enjoying just torturing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an hour of licking, the tongue props you on top of it, and you feel pressure forcing you in one direction. you start sliding downwards, and you scream. She had finally decided to eat you. You try and grab the tongue, but both it and your body is covered with saliva, making you slip with every attempt. Another gulp of pressure and you slide down into a narrow chasm, which you can only imagine is her throat. The fleshy walls squeeze against you, and you feel another gulp. The flesh moves arond you and you stop again in her throat, but your legs seem to be free of confinement. As mush as that sounds good, your face goes pure white, knowing that your feet were only dangling from the stomach. You feel one last force of pressure, and you are squeezed from the throat, falling into the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a squish as you hit the stomach floor, the flesh pulsing beneath you. As you squirm around, you feel a dull rhythm of thumps echoing in the air. It's somewhat calming, even when you realise it's her heartbeat. You start to pound your fist against the flesh. \"Let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pounding is returned by a pat, followed by a soft rub. \"Not a chance. You really hit the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to die! Especially die from being eaten!\"</span></div></div>",

However, because of her own fat body, she can't really reach it very well and runs so rapidly that you fall screaming off of her body into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and rub your head. It was a wonder you weren't dead after such a colossal fall, but it looks like the sand acted as a cushion. When you get up you see a shadow over you and look up in terror as the giant sphinx woman is looming over, staring down at you with her large booty in the air. Her tail wagging and her wings flapping as she lets out a purr. \"Well, looks like another human has become lost in the world.\" You try to inch away but the sphinx pins you down with one of her paws and makes you grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where are your manners?\" asks the sphinx. \"After all, you're obviously new her. My name is Mirage and let me be the first to welcome you to Xenodu.\" \"Xenodu?\" you ask nervously. \"The world of giant monsters. Here, we titans rule the roost. There are hundreds of beasts like the ones you've heard of in the myths of your world. Gargoyles, werebeasts, fairies, they're all real. Occasionally there's a rift and humans from other worlds cross into our world. Not that we mind, but personally, I think the humans of Xenodu taste a whole lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and try to run but Mirage just stomps forward and shakes her head. \"It's pointless to try and escape. Even if you get away from me, you'll be eaten by another monster.\" \"Please don't eat me.\" You say. Mirage lets out a yawn. \"Please don't eat me,\" she says mockingly. \"You don't get it. Humans in this world are basically stuck in the middle ages so good luck finding any defense. You're just lucky you ran into a sphinx. \"W-What do you mean Ms. Mirage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage lowers her head and smiles, showing sharp teeth as big as buildings. \"As a sphinx, I'm bound to ask you a riddle, that's tradition for humans. If you answer incorrectly, well...\" Mirage rubs her bloated tummy to give you a good idea for what would happen if you failed and you hoped you wouldn't end up in her belly. \"But I must warn you, the fatter the sphinx, the harder it is for a human to answer her riddles, and I am quite fat. But of course, it gets boring after a while, so I'll make it interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see Mirage's naked breasts bouncing up and down. \"If you answer correctly,\" says the titanic sphinx with a grin. \"You'll be my mate from now on.\" Wow, this sounded like she wasn't giving you a choice. If you answered incorrectly, she eats you but if you answer correctly, you'll be forced to marry a huge sphinx. \"Ready?\" asks Mirage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh. \"Ready as I'll ever be.\" \"Now,\" says Jasmine as she lowers herself to your level and opens her mouth wide. \"Here is my riddle. I appear thrice at the end of time and the end of space, you'll see me at least once at any old place, in the beginning, I appear only twice, but I am one of two links between fire and ice.

Fortunately, you were pretty good with thinking outside the box. You'd HAVE to be if you thought climbing up the tail of a huge hungry sphinx was a better idea than letting her fly off!<br>\r\nThinking outside the box, the riddle itself was actually so complicated, that it was super obvious! The riddle wasnt necessarily describing something metaphorical, it was being VERY literal. As in LITERALLY the words themselves. Thrice at 'thE End of timE' and 'thE End of spacE', see it at least once at 'any old placE', appears only twice in 'thE bEginning', and one of two links between 'firE and icE'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL?!\" Mirage was pretending to be impatient while still giving you that smirk of hers, \"are you gonna answer or what? If you need more time, I can give you plenty of it in my belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt wait to wipe the smirk off the sphinx's face.<br>\r\n\"Are you the letter E?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence. Absolute silence. Even Mirage's tail stopped wagging so the swooshing sounds it made were gone too! Her eyes widened a tiny bit. She did her best to keep a straight face, but being so ginormous as she was, it wasnt that difficult to spot the cracks in her facade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" the sphinx finally spoke, \"what did you say? I couldnt hear that.\" Bullshit she couldnt!<br>\r\n\"I said are you the letter E?\" you repeated, \"JEEZ!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou friggin jumped back when her claws dug deep into the sand, possibly destroying centuries worth of settled earth hidden deep beneath it! Mirage had finally stopped smirking at you. She was clearly at a loss for words! Did you just trump the great mighty big-boned big-boobed and huge-assed sphinx?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D...did I get it right?\" you asked her, \"am I your mate now? ...Er... does that technically mean we're married? Would there be like a traditional wedding ceremony involved? ...W...would one of us have to grow or shrink if we... you know?\" All these questions and more will be answered... hellifIknow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... um.... er....\" she was honestly sweating! Guess she's not use to losing huh? \".....b....BEST TWO OUT OF THREE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" you screamed and immediately regretted it!<br>\r\n\"Y... you heard me, human!\" Mirage was clearly butthurt. And that was a lot of butt to hurt. \"by my pride as a sphinx, I hereby make this game of riddles best of three!\"<br>\r\n\"Y...you cant do that!\" you object, forgetting your place, \"I already answered your riddle, you said-\"<br>\r\n\"I make the rules of this game, human!\" the sphinx looked down her big chubby nose at you, \"you will play by MY rules. If you have a problem with them, I can always send you to my... complaint department!\" she tapped on her wide tummy. Cheating bitch. But you werent in any place to argue. So you had to abide by your predator's rules or be eaten by her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled, \"Fine. Two out of three. What's the next riddle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?\"<br>\r\nThat was a tricky one. It took quite a bit of thinking, but luckily you remember taking a mythology class and learning about some of the riddles that the mythical sphinx said to Oedipus. This wasnt the more well-known riddle (spoiler, the answer to the other is MAN), but you vaguely remember this tricky gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day and Night,\" was your answer. The great sphinx bit her lip. Again, this huge behemoth of beauty and gluttony was beaten at her own game! Her wings began to twitch along with her eyebrows, causing uncontrolled gusts of wind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next riddle!!\" Mirage broke her own rule again, \"A cowboy rode into town on Friday he stayed for 3 days and left on Friday. How was that possible?\" That riddle was completely out of place for someone of Greek (not Egyptian, GREEK!) myth to be asking! Too bad for her, cuz your dad used to tell that one!<br>\r\n\"The horse's name is Friday!\" was your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urggh!!\" Mirage gritted her teeth, sweat dripped down her forehead, her rump shaking nervously causing minor earthquakes, her tail began to flail about, \"Uh... um... A young boy and his father are in a car accident.  The father dies at the scene. The boy is transported to the hospital, taken immediately into surgery... but the surgeon steps out of the operating room and says, 'I can't operate on this boy - he is my son!' WHO IS THE DAMN SURGEON?!\"<br>\r\n\"His mom,\" she wasnt even trying.<br>\r\n\"H-H-How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?!\"<br>\r\n\"A woodchuck could chuck as much wood as it could if a woodchuck could chuck wood.\"<br>\r\nOh dear. Was she on the verge of crying?!<br>\r\n\"I-I-If a t-tree f...falls in the forest... a-a-and n-no one's there to hear it, d-does it make a sound?\"<br>\r\n\"How can a sound exist if no one's there to hear it?\"<br>\r\n\"W-W-WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?!\"<br>\r\n\"Red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw dropped in disbelief and she twitched, possibly trying to fight back the tears in her eyes! Did she run out of riddles? The answer to that question was GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hauled ass, giving the sobbing sphinx ample space as she dropped to the ground in shame! You rode the huge tidal wave of sand that rippled past you and quite possibly destroyed a nearby unlucky village! When the aftershock ended, you turned to see Mirage's head lying in the sand, possibly out of shame and self pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable...\" she sobbed to herself, \"after spending so many years conjuring up so many impossible riddles... a tiny mere human from another world just up and solves them all right then and there? M...my legacy... my pride... *Sniff* destroyed in a single minute!\" Geez, solving her silly riddles caused THIS much damage to her?!<br>\r\n\"M...Mirage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a joke... a failure!\" she sniffed, \"*SNIFF!* a disgrace to my kind! I've let my pride down... I'm sorry, mom.... I couldnt follow in your paw-steps!!\" Man, were you beginning to feel bad. Sure she was gonna eat you and she did try to screw you over in her own game, but wow. You didnt really think she'd be THIS hurt about failing to outriddle you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... d-does this mean you're my mate now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do whatever you wish with me,\" Mirage's eyes lowered to the sand, unable to look at you, \"use me to your heart's content. I dont care anymore. I'm YOUR inferior, now.\" Sheesh. But anything you wish, she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly beaten and broken. You had the best opportunity to flee safely, but you were the victor and you had one sad colossal prize in front of you. And let's face it, her ginormous body did interest you.<br>\r\nHowever, there's that part of you nagging about why you shouldnt abuse a sad broken woman/giant sphinx like her. It was your male conscience telling you to comfort that poor crying giantess.<br>\r\nYou waited patiently while the devil on your left shoulder argued with the angel on your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

Well, what's your answer.\" You gulp and walk forward. \"Air?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage rolls her eyes as she starts to pick her teeth.\"Is that your final answer?\" she asks. \"Yes.\" You say nervously. Mirage gets back on all four of her feet and the earthquake knocks you back. You look up to see Mirage shaking her head. \"I'm sorry,\" she says. \"That is incorrect. Pity, you're really cute and would've made a good husband, but since I'm a sphinx and you failed the riddle, well, it's snack time.\" Mirage licks her lips and you yell out and try to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the bloated sphinx effortlessly puts her paw in front of you to block you path and push you towards her open mouth. \"Pl-Please Ms. Mirage. Don't do this.\" Mirage lets out a yawn. \"You don't get it. I'm a sphinx. We have a code. Well, time to get in my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to run away but Mirage flicks out her tongue and pushes it through the sand before scooping you into her mouth as you scream. You run towards the opening of her mouth as it's closing. But Mirage holds her head up in the air and you're forced to grab and climb her tongue. \"Spare me!\" you yell. Mirage lets out a sigh before shaking her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as the saliva makes you slip and you slide down Mirage's tongue into her throat. You tumble down the giant sphinx's esophagus and land in her stomach with a splash. As you surface, Mirage lets out a loud belch that shakes her entire stomach and nearly blows out your eardrums. \"Oops,\" says the sphinx on the outside as she lets out one more smaller burp. \"Excuse me. Humans always give me a little gas. Most of them go deaf on the spot. CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell and then run to the side of her belly. \"Let me out!\" you yell. \"Let me out! Please don't digest me.\" The fat sphinx giantess lays on her stomach as bulges appear on her love handle as she lets out a yawn. \"Please save it. It's embarrassing. You're not being digested.\" That's when you realize something. She was right, you were neck deep in stomach acid but you weren't being broken down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least you were eaten by a fat giantess so you can move around. Might as well explore Mirage's body.</span></div></div>",

This wasn't some Egyptian or middle-eastern desert. But then you realize something, the cactus in front of you is the size of a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and look up in shock. What kind of world have you stumbled into? If the flora are this big? What of the fauna? Heck, what of the inhabitants. That lake you drank from. It was no lake, it was only a puddle in the ground. Before you can figure out what you'll do next, you hear a rumbling, someone or something was coming closer. Then you see what the cause was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere appeared to be some form of giant stagecoach coming forward, but then you look and see that there's no ordinary horse dragging the carriage. The horse was actually a centaur and a female centaur from the looks of it. She appeared to be very muscular in both her upper body and lower body and appeared to have dark skin and long black hair with a blue highlight and appeared to be wearing nothing but a black tank top and a red jacket. From the looks of it, she had to be at least 1000ft tall. That would explain why she was pulling the cart by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything, the centaurs accidentally kicks you and you scream as you're tossed into the stagecoach.

Last time you check, you were nowhere near the ocean. But it's dangerous to be around open water and decided to try and swim for it to find help. You keep on swimming for twenty minutes, but the waves in this ocean are too big and strong for you to get anywhere. The smallest waves were full on tsunamis and at one point, you almost swallowed some sea water. You cough loudly and then you try to swim up. You gasp and pant. You're so tired you can barely move. That was a dangerous thing in the ocean and it looked like it was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, you see a large shadow under the water. \"What's that?\" you ask. \"A whale? No, not even a whale could be that big.\" What you saw was much bigger than any whale you knew and it was coming up very fast.

Scratch that, a tropical shark. It looked like a red tiger shark, but no shark was that big. Then you look to see that this \"shark\" seems to be five hundred feet long and then you realize as this finned creature was about to come back down into the water, it isn't a shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a closer look forward to see long bright orange hair and a peach skinned human like upper body covered in blue tattoos and realize you were hanging onto the tail fin of a giant mermaid.

But that was a bad thing because the mermaid was about to hit the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale and hold onto the tail tight as the mermaid goes underwater, threatening to make you lose your grip.

As you're looking down, the creature surfaces beneath you, head first as you yell. You look down to see whatever creature this was, it had a long neck that had to reach 1500ft into the air with violet skin and a lavender underbelly. The creature was definitely some kind of plesiosaur but appeared human shaped from under the neck with flippered hands with webbed fingers. The creature was obese in shape, even with the thickness of the neck and from the large E-cup (in scale) breasts, it was obviously a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look to your sides to see large jagged teeth as big as lighthouses and you appear to be on a snout three times as wide as a battleship.

You're frozen in fear, but the woman stares at you with a purr. \"I didn't think I'd see a tiny human around here. Don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see the Loch Ness monster woman's tail extend from under the water and tap as you shiver. Her tail looked like it was 1500ft long as well and it was twirling. The woman then stretched laid back in the water and you could see her enormous belly as it sloshed around in the water. She then places you on her belly as she does the backstroke. You put your ear to the bloated dragonic gut and heard a sound like ocean waves and from the lack of screaming, you were reassured that she didn't get that big gut chowing down on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you hear little guy?\" asks the Loch Ness monster woman as she grins seductively. \"Wh-What are you?\" \"What do you think I am? I'm a Loch Ness monster.\" \"I thought there was only one. And I didn't think it was this big.\" \"Oh, no, no, no. There are tons of us. You are not in your own world. This world is called Xenodu, the land of monsters. Every supernatural creature from mythology; gargoyles, gorgons, yetis, mandrakes, trolls, vampires, all species of monsters live here and they're huge. Humans are the size of insects to the dominate monsters. But don't worry, we monsters have our uses for you. Some monsters keep humans as pets, some as sex slaves and some as food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified. \"And what does that make me to you?\" you ask.

Wars were a thing, sure, but this didn't seem like the usual place for that kind of ocurrence.

As you can see, this city is absolutely destroyed, but not by usual causes\" said the reporter. The camera turned to let the spectators see more of the damage. Buildings toppled, rubble everywhere, smoke, a giant footprint.... Wait, hold on a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. The center of this is not a usual disaster. We hardly could believe it when the distress calls came from this place talking about a giant monster rampaging through their homes and businessess. Even police forces calling for reinforcements. But the source is as shocking as real\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera turned to a particularly smokey area, where blast-like sounds could be heard. You couldn't believe your eyes when you saw it. At this point, you didn't even care if you were gonna run late to your job or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gigantic, but certainly feminine shape could be seen, but the smoke of recently destroyed stuff didn't let you to see much more. She was enormous, easily 500 feet tall if not bigger, and not really human. She didn't look like the average giantess. She didn't look fully human. In other words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a camera trick or staged, this is real life footage. The source of all of this destruction looks like to be a giant, feminine-like monster\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, a gigantic monster girl. What kind? The footage didn't show it well. What it did show was enough to see that a monster giantess was on the loose, and that she was quite attractive. She would turn some heads if she were normal-sized. You knew yours would be one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this wasn't unexpect enough, you weren't prepared for what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, some girls with these auras have the potential to be reborn into titans; mythical beasts ranging to at least 1000 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere exists a secret order called Phantasm that has predicted the event of the titans rising and knows exactly who has the potential to become a titan. As such, their mission is to find women with the titan aura and force their aura to transform these women into the titans and observe what will result. Once the girls become titans, Phantasm is no longer allowed to interfere and only watch what the newly transformed monster will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far in this path, there are two girls with the potential to become titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst is Lily Scarlet, a young Texan woman working on the farm that her family had left her. Lily is a hard working girl and while she seems unsocial, she has a good heart. However, she has been confirmed to be a potential titan and Phantasm seeks her out to transform this Southern belle into a titanic minotaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond is a woman known only as Blaze. Blaze is the leader of an all girl motorcycle gang on the run from the law. Blaze killed the original leader of the gang to take her place and is known for having a deadly temper that has led to destructive and malicious behavior. She especially hates being told what to do. But as much of a wildfire as she is now, it will only get worse when Phantasm finds her and transforms her into a giantess hellhound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich titaness do you seek?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Please remember to leave routes for more titan possibilities)</span></div></div>",

A strange meteor struck the Earth centuries ago, transforming the planet and combining the future with the ancient magical past. However, the meteor caused a side-effect, the entire female human population underwent a bizarre transformation, becoming the monsters from mythology and folklore. The transformation also made them grow in size until the smallest giantess was 1500ft tall. The giantesses could still breed with the tiny human males, however, the offspring would only be human if it were male and only be a monster if it were female. Obviously this meant that women were in charge and all government positions were filled by the giantess monsters. While most of the time, the titanesses got along well with their tinier male counterparts, some titanesses aren't so friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdea 2- The New Nuke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this scenario, several women were abducted and experimented on by a fiendish scientist who transformed them into mutants resembling the creatures of mythology; manticores, pegasi, cerberuses, everything. The mutates were locked up until an experimental bomb went off, turning them to giant size. Now that these monster giantesses were released into the world, they seek revenge for their harsh treatment.</span></div></div>",

All women on the planet were turned into giant monsters based on the creatures of mythology. They ruled the world now. As you look out the window, you see the mail woman, a gigantic pegasus fly down from the sky and just pass your window. You step back to avoid being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a time when this was a man's world, but with all the women turned into enormous creatures, those times were over. Your room was nothing more than a cabinet in the wall of your mother's apartment. She and your sister too were giant beasts. It was hard to be a man in this world, but on the bright side, you got a good look at the gargoyle girl from the apartment across the street taking a morning shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a banging on the wall and then the door to your cabinet and you look up at the bright white furred face of your unicorn monster and see her looking down on you with her long blonde hair and pink eyes. \"Up and at 'em little guy,\" she says with a smile. \"The day's just begun.\" You let out a sigh. After all these years, you'd think you'd be used to this crazy world.</span></div></div>",

She takes off your clothes, rather forcibly as you grunt and hold yourself in pain. \"Come on Mom,\" you say. \"I can take my clothes off myself.\" Your mother just lets out a giggle. \"Where's the fun in that.\" You just sigh and slide into the sink as your mom turns on the water. It was like this every day. No matter how old you were, this happened to you every time you took a shower. Then again, ever since all women on the planet turned into giant monsters, they've become more domineering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bath, your mother takes you down to breakfast and you find your sister waiting. Like your mom she was a giant unicorn, however she was a black furred unicorn with long blue hair. Your sister had just put a few omelets on the table. \"Morning mom,\" says your sister. \"Morning, little brother.\" She lets out a laugh at that and you roll your eyes. \"Luana,\" you say. \"I wish you would stop saying that. I'm older.\" Luana just laughs at you before you cross your arms. \"Okay,\" says your mother. \"Enough arguing at the breakfast table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mom.\" You and Luana both said before digging into breakfast. While breakfast is going on, your mother has the television on to the morning news. As you're eating you see that the gang wars in the city have gotten worse. A groups of griffin girl gang bangers had lately been going at it with a gang of pegasi girls. Luana told you about it because one of her friends was a pegasus. You shake your head as your mother lets out a sigh. \"This jingoism is getting out of control,\" she says. \"Luana, you should be ashamed that your friend is wrapped up in this. Sure we're monsters, but inside we're all humans. It's been hundred of years and...\" Your mother then lets out a sigh before snapping her fingers and turning the television off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, your mother and Luana get dressed; your mother for work and Luana for school. Luana places you in her purse and giggles. \"Okay bro,\" she says. \"We better get going.\" You nod your head and then inhale. As Luana is walking you down to the bus stop, you begin to wonder to yourself. Maybe today was the day you asked out Beth, that hot gargoyle girl from across the apartment. You've been meaning to get around to that but you always lost your nerve whenever the gargoyle giantess was anywhere near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you and Luana reach the bus stop and you both kiss your mother goodbye. \"Have a good day at work Mom.\" You say. \"Thanks baby,\" says your mother as she strokes her head. \"You two have a good day at school.\" You and Luana board the bus heading right for school. It was a bus built for girls and therefore was monster sized. The driver was a large werewolf woman and lets out a slight growl before Luana takes her seat and then the bus drives away. As your unicorn sister is listening to her headphones on the way to school, you notice you're the only male on the  bus, everyone else was a woman and therefore a monster. It was somewhat frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you hear the bus come to another stop. Another girl student had entered the bus and was about to take a seat right next to your sister. But who is it...?</span></div></div>",

Not surprising considering the species of your wife, Ginger. It was 2780, just a few hundred years after a meteor struck the Earth. Half the human race, that is, the female half, were mutated into skyscraper sized monsters with the smallest woman now being 1500ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife was no exception to the rule. She was in fact so enormous that your bed was the navel on her huge and chubby body. The problem was that Ginger was a vampire and as such you had to spend every night shut away in a coffin that was too big for you to open on your own. Your succubus mother warned you against marrying a giant blood sucker but you just had to have that sexy pair shaped body complete with ash gray hair and blood red eyes. You've been married to Ginger for a few years now and you had a good marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the fact that your vampiress wife was completely and utterly oblivious. She was sleeping through the alarm clock, again.

That trip alone takes you thirty minutes as well as another full hour just to climb one of her mountain sized breasts. You had just woken up and you were already exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to doze off again when the vampiress titan snores loudly, shaking your foundation. You grunt and slide down Ginger's boob until you land on her chin. Even that doesn't wake her up. \"Ginger!\" you shout. \"Ginger! Wake up!\" At that point, Ginger snores again and you slip into her mouth with a slight scream. As you slide down her tongue, your vampire wife finally wakes up and grunts before she swishes her tongue around and nearly pushes you against one of her colossal fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampiress then spits you out as you cough up her saliva and stand on her chin. \"Sorry about that, dear,\" says Ginger in embarrassment. \"Overslept again did I?\" You let out a sigh before your wife stretches out her tongue and licks you. \"With ears as big as hers,\" you mutter to yourself. \"You'd think she'd hear the alarm.

The vampire giantess lets out a yawn as she snaps her fingers to make the candles light up the room. It was nighttime when you woke up. That's what happens when you marry a vampire. Even though Ginger was 2000ft tall, your wife was still a vampire and the sun would turn her to ash. Just to make extra sure, Ginger had every window in the house painted black to prevent a single ray of sunlight from coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then grunt as your wife smiles seductively and strokes your head as she shows her fangs. \"Alright, Raum,\" she tells you. \"It's time to slip out of these nasty pajamas.\" \"Hey.\" You say with a laugh as Ginger strips you bare and then takes off her own bra and panties before heading off to the shower. Once inside, Ginger turns on the water and holds you tight. You knew what was coming next and sure enough, the ash gray haired goddess you call a wife grabs the soap and rubs it against you to use you as a living sponge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger hums to herself as she starts with her breasts that you stroke as she rubs you over and underneath them. Next up is her armpits. You nibble underneath her right one to make Ginger jump slightly and moan. \"Oh,\" says the skyscraper sized vampire. \"You are just asking for it now.\" \"Here it comes.\" You say. Ginger then rubs you across her massive love tunnel and jams you inside, where you rub your soap covered body across the walls as your wife screams in pleasure. You even scratch the walls before Ginger yanks you out and then uses you to lather the biggest part of her body and your favorite; her ass. She even leans her ginormous rear into the shower wall as she squeezes you between her massive butt cheeks. \"Work for it, Raum,\" says the sexy vampiress. \"Work for it. Oh, that's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shower is over, you have to help Ginger comb her wet hair. Being a vampire, Ginger couldn't see her own hair in the mirror so she trusted you to brush it and apply her makeup. Once her hair was done, Ginger snatches you up. \"Hey!\" you yell. Ginger then holds you over her open mouth and you look down into the abyss. You knew that Ginger wouldn't eat you. She just likes to have you in her mouth when she brushes her fangs. Ginger plops you into her mouth and then puts the toothbrush in, nearly drenching you in toothpaste. You have to grab the side of her gums so you're not swept away in the current. As you do so, you let out a grunt of pain because you see that Ginger had closed her massive teeth and your hand was between them. \"Ginger!\" you yell. You yank your now bleeding hand out before Ginger's tongue begins to violently assault you and cover you with paste. \"Come, come, Raum,\" says Ginger in a teasing tone. \"You know how much I love your blood.\" \"You're going to drain me dry one of these days, Ginger.\" You say with a sigh right before Ginger spits you and the toothpaste into the water filled sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all that is over, you and Ginger are in the kitchen having pancakes. Given your size difference, you two share the same plate and food. As you're eating a piece of sausage, you see Ginger digging through the fridge, her large booty in view as she's frustratedly searching for blood. Ginger returns to the table and pours herself a glass of some blood from an unknown donor. \"Damn,\" mumbles Ginger. \"I really need to stop at the bank later.\" \"You be careful, Ginger,\" you say. \"Didn't they say the donor had a high blood sugar count. You know where all that blood goes don't you.\" Ginger smacks her hips and smiles down at you seductively as the two of you have breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter which..</span></div></div>",

They could still mate with and give birth to male humans, but all female offspring would be monsters for some reason. Because of the size difference, women were in charge and controlled every position of authority from government to business to education. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reminded because you were dating such a monster and knew from experience that these titanesses could be VERY arrogant. At that moment, you were on your way to Hippolyta High, your high school and your girlfriend was carrying you in a small cage (you had gotten in trouble with her the night before). Your girlfriend, Cammy, was a chimera, a mythical monster resembling a gestalt of difference animals. She had the head of a lion but with the horns of a rhinoceros as well as two extra heads, one was a blue moray eel's head and the other was a red buffalo's head with a pierced nose. She also had the hands of an alligator and the wings of a falcon with the lower body of a hippopotamus from the waist down with a sea snake for a tail. Because of this, Cammy was very heavyset. If she was human-sized she'd weigh at least 1000lbs. However, she knew how to carry her weight as she was the head of the cheer squad. You of course were captain of the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is humiliating,\" you complain. \"Why do you even have this stupid cage? I'll bet none of the other guys in school have their girlfriends lock them up.\" \"It's your own fault,\" says Cammy's lion head teasingly. \"For peeking on me in the shower.\" \"However,\" says her buffalo head. \"If you don't like the cage, I can always carry you in my tummy and cough you up when we get there.\" Cammy's snake tail even hisses at you and opens her mouth in front of you to scare you. \"Cut that out!\" you yell. \"Dang, Cammy. Don't joke about that. I heard that the gorgon vice principal ate her husband for cheating on her. You know, I read somewhere that girls used to be as puny as us guys.\" Cammy lets out a scoff. \"That's a scary thought. Don't forget, the big game with Penthesilea High is today.\" You groan. Those games consisted of both high school teams on a monster-sized table as the girls from both competing schools look down on the tiny athletes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember.\" You say. \"Good,\" says your chimera girlfriend's eel head. \"Wouldn't want you to forget.\" \"After all,\" says Cammy's lion head. \"If Hippolyta High loses, you have to give the entire cheer squad foot massages.\" \"I know,\" you say. \"It's a good thing you're hot, Cammy.\" \"Flatterer.\" Says the 2500ft tall chimera cheerleader as her tail gives you a loving lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cammy walks into the high school carrying your cage.</span></div></div>",

Whoever that student was, he obviously was caught breaking school rules and had to spend detention in the principal's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shutter at that thought. Speaking of which, there was no rule about keeping human males in cages. Cammy was not the only monster giantess who was carrying her boyfriend in such a humiliating manner. There was a purple skinned jabberwock girl who was carrying her boyfriend in a cage attached to her belt. You wave to the sap as his girlfriend is busy fixing her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cammy,\" you moan. \"I'll be perfectly honest with you. I hate this school. All the girls here are so tyrannical. Sometimes I feel like I'm more of your pet than your boyfriend.\" Cammy's snake tail playfully licks you in your cage before speaking. \"That's men's role in today's society, Baby. You may have been in charge centuries ago, but now it's a woman's world. You should know that by now. I'm not the first girl to have dominated you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh. You knew that well. Your mother was a 2000ft capricorn, a monster that was half goat and half sea monster. From the upper body of a bright gold goat with long silver hair but her legs were covered in scales and fins of a bright red fish but with a goat's hooves and udder. She was also on the heavy side. She wasn't as cruel as Cammy could be but she still liked making you feel even smaller than you usually were to her and she made it painfully clear to your father that she was the boss. You swear that he was outright afraid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, that was how it was with men no longer considered the stronger sex. You could just sit in your cage as Cammy walks into....</span></div></div>",

The two spiders even put their four front legs to each other\u2019s chests before Silvia finally realizes something. \u201cOh!\u201d she yells. \u201cJessica! I almost forgot!

In all the years your mother has been married to Silvia and ever since they opened this shop, they\u2019ve never hired an apprentice. The apprentices were obviously going to be a pair of monsters.

It was said to be the king of all land animals and the primal beast of the land like the Ziz was for the sky and the Leviathan was for the sea.

Silvia takes out the employee profiles of both girls and then you look them over and see what the creatures looked like. Daisy, the Behemoth had short pink hair and crimson red skin and resembled a large hippopotamus who looked somewhat like she came from Kenya and was wearing a yellow shirt and black pants. Daisy on the other hand was a bright gold skinned winged manticore with long golden brown hair. She looked pear-shaped and was wearing a green unitard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock at the door. \u201cOh,\u201d says Silvia. \u201cThat must be one of them.\u201d Silvia lets out a door to let in the first of the two new coworkers but which one was it?\"</span></div></div>",

Is everything alright in there!\" \"Don't worry, Buck!\" calls out Sally. \"I'm coming!\" You let out a sigh. It was Friday night and you and Sally were planning to watch a horror movie. Although one would wonder what the point would be. After all, several centuries ago, the entire world turned into a monster movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange meteors crashed into the Earth and turned it into a supernatural wasteland with half the human race being mutated. Specifically, every single female human was turned into a monster from mythology and these monsters were colossal. The smallest size of the monster giantesses was 1500ft tall. They could still breed with tiny human men, but all male offspring would be humans while all female offspring were giant monsters. You and Sally lived in what used to be New York City until the world was transformed. In your particular area, the monster women, including Sally and your family were somewhat on the plus size. Your mother was actually a 2500ft tall gorgon woman who was huge and fat enough to be compared to a sumo wrestler. She had pale pink skin and blonde vipers for hair that were worn in a side lock ponytail. She wore special sunglasses to keep her from turning her friends into stone. You were immune to gorgon eyes precisely because a gorgon gave birth to you. Your mother was very kind but she still treated you like a child even though you were 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your fianc\u00e9e, Sally, she was even bigger and fatter than your mom to the point where she made her look anorexic. Sally was a 3500ft tall gargoyle giantess. She had tealish green skin with fin-like ears, four short stubby horns on her forehead, leathery wings with purple membranes and long bright red hair. She also had E-Cup breasts, a mountainous belly, thunderous thighs with a butt almost as wide as she was tall with a long lizard-like tail and a prominent double chin. You thought she was absolutely gorgeous but at times she wasn't that bright. She's sat on you more times than you can count. You weren't married yet but you were her fianc\u00e9e and as such she legally was your owner. Since all women were monsters that were thousands of feet tall, they tended to treat human men as pets in the best case scenario. The fact was that they let their size and power go to their heads. It's lucky for you that Sally was so nice and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had actually met her at the mall where she was working as a security guard. Your mother was carrying you in her purse as she did errands and forgot the purse in a changing booth when Sally found you. You've been an item ever since and last month you finally got the nerve to propose to her. Your mother more than approved since gargoyles were immune to her gorgon gaze. Right now you were waiting for your gargoyle fianc\u00e9e to get the popcorn for movie night. She had found Blu-Rays of movies from hundreds of years ago, back when men and women were more or less the same size. \"You know, Sally,\" you say. \"I can't believe there was a time when women were as small as men.\" \"That's a horrible thought,\" said Sally as the obese and ginormous gargoyle gets a bowl. \"How did people live before the meteor shower. Oh, popcorn's done.\" You smile and then hear tremors from your fianc\u00e9e's footsteps. However, you then see a shadow above yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and see the two teal loincloth covered asteroids that are Sally's ass as she begins to sit down, forgetting you're on the couch. \"Oh no,\" you groan. \"Not again. Sally! Sally! Wait!\" But it's too late because Sally slams her ginormous butt on top of you and you're pressed into the couch letting out muffled screams from underneath the gargoyle as she puts the popcorn on the table. \"That's odd,\" says Sally. \"I thought I heard Buck in here.\" You let out a moan from under your fianc\u00e9e's rear. \"It's gonna be one of those nights.\" You complain to yourself.</span></div></div>",

It was an all too common occurrence these days. All women were mythological beasts who were thousands of feet tall and therefore the much smaller men found themselves being flattened by the much larger females. Thankfully it was never fatal. Heck, this was especially common in married or engaged couples. Of course, it didn't help that in your neighborhood, the women were fat as well as giant monsters and while soft, Sally's rear was very heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of your gargoyle fianc\u00e9e, she's looking all around for you and is making her eyes glow bright red to better see in the dark room. \"Now where is he?\" she asks. \"Where is that Buck? Men. They're so tiny and cute but it's a pain in the ass to keep track of them.\" \"Pain in the ass?\" you ask through the rolls of your fianc\u00e9's teal green ass. \"Good idea, Sally.\" You don't like to do it but you bite your gargoyle lover right on the right butt cheek. \"Ouch!\" yells Sally as she springs up. Sally feels all around her mastodonic behind and curls her wings into a cape as her clawed fingers search for the source of her irritation and then she peeled your flattened form off of her butt before she realizes what happened and blushes. \"Oh,\" she says in embarrassment. \"I'm really sorry, Buck.\" You let out a sigh. \"It's a good thing for you it's my favorite part of you.\" The gargoyle giantess then sticks your head in between her mountain-sized lips and you get a view of her enormous fangs as she kisses you tight and blows on you to inflate you back to normal right before pulling you out of her mouth. \"Thanks, Sally.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally then places you on her shoulder and then shows you one of the DVDs. \"A Godzilla movie?\" you ask. \"That guy's barely as big as your sister's chihuahua.\" \"I would've bought a copy of <i>Attack of the 50ft Woman</i>,\" says Sally. \"But why watch somebody small enough for me to use to comb my hair romp on an anthill.\" You let out a laugh and then there's a knock on the door. You let out a sigh because you thought that you and your fianc\u00e9e would be watching the movie alone. \"Come in?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens up and reveals...</span></div></div>",

She had Caucasian-toned skin, long brown hair worn in a Greek-styled ponytail and one hundred large eyes all over her body. Like Sally she was very obese to the point where she worn a two-piece purple toga. Seeing the eyes lined up on her thunder thighs, you wonder if she had any on her ass. Of course, you didn't get along well with the hundred-eyed giantess. She was very snarky, especially towards men. You heard that when she found her boyfriend cheating on her with a harpy, she kept him trapped under her foot in her left sandal for 30 days. A horrifying punishment since you smelled her feet before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hera,\" you moan as you stand on Sally's shoulder. \"What are you doing here? Sally and I were going to have a romantic movie night.\" Hera plops her fat ass down on the couch next to Sally's own fat ass and you nearly fall off of your gargoyle fianc\u00e9e. \"Romantic?\" asks the Argus. \"You're watching Godzilla. Can you believe that people actually thought this was scary? I could carry that lizard in my handbag.\" \"Hera,\" says Sally. \"These movies were made before the meteors mutated every human woman into giant monsters. By the way, I thought you and Roland both were coming.\" Roland being Hera's current boyfriend. Hera gives a hiss and all one-hundred of her eyes glare. \"I caught that bastard motor boating a gremlin girl.\" \"Oh man,\" says Sally. \"You have bad luck with men. What did you do?\" Hera gave an evil smirk. \"I handed him over to my little niece. Let her rough him up.\" You let out a gulp. Hera was one sadistic, hundred eyed bitch. \"Geez,\" says Sally. \"You'd think men would stop cheating on you if you keep it up with these harsh punishments. Remember that guy you <i>ate</i>? He's still in the psychiatric ward.\" You shiver at that thought. Another hazard was that men could very easily be swallowed by monster women. Bafflingly, it was extremely survivable but no less traumatizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally then blows on her finger. \"Enough about ex-boyfriends,\" says your gargoyle fianc\u00e9e. \"The movie is starting.\" The movie starts and you can see Godzilla and you lean in front as Sally and Hera have their eyes glued to the set. But you then lose your footing on the gargoyle's shoulder and you yell as you slip down and bounce off of Sally's breasts and roll down the rolls on her stomach before falling into the bowl of popcorn. Each kernel was the size of a large truck to you and you stand atop a piece. \"This is not good.\" You mutter. You hear roaring and it's clear the movie starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you see a shadow coming over and a hand reaching into the popcorn. \"Oh no.\" You mutter.

It's me! Buck! I'm in the popcorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Sally's eyes are glued on the movie and she shovels the handful of buttery popcorn into her mouth with you inside.

This isn't the first time that you were in Sally's mouth. It was actually very common these days for monster girls to carry their human spouses in their mouths and extremely common for the men to be swallowed accidentally or intentionally. Because for some reason the giantesses couldn't digest humans, some men actually enjoyed it. Not you though. But as you stand on Sally's tongue, you slip on the butter and yell as you fall into her esophagus with an avalanche of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land in Sally's stomach with a splash and are sent 10s of feet below the stomach acids and are forced to swim rapidly to the top or you'd drown. You gasp for breath as you surface and have to climb up a piece of donut that Sally ate for breakfast. You let out a groan. \"I can't believe it,\" you grumble. \"My fianc\u00e9e ate me.

You still have to give me away to the bride.\u201d Your mom lets out a snort before she leaves the house with you in her palm. \u201cYou do realize this means you belong to Elisa now? Remember, ever since the meteors struck, the alleged lesser sex has run the world.\u201d \u201cKinda hard to argue with somebody 300 times bigger than you, or in your case, Mom, 1000 times.\u201d Your Mom snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s precisely why I approved this marriage. Of all the girls that showed interest in you, Elisa was the only one as big as me. No way was a twig going to marry my baby. I must say that you chose a winner. I can\u2019t believe your fianc\u00e9e turned out to be a college professor. At least that\u2019s one less thing I need to worry about. Well, I better prepare to give you away, Heath. Good luck. You\u2019re Elisa\u2019s problem now.\u201d \u201cHa-ha.\u201d You laugh sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the church, everything is in place. Elisa is waiting for you. Your bride was a 5000ft tall minotaur. Specifically, Elisa resembled a cape buffalo with thick black fur and bluish raven-colored hair. She had an obese stomach and enormous booty that was almost as big as your mom\u2019s but with muscular arms and legs. She was waiting for you in a wedding dress that was obviously too tight on the bovine beauty\u2019s big body. Elisa\u2019s relatives were mostly females, specifically, minotaurs like her of different breeds of cattle. Elisa\u2019s mother was a large brown-furred bison woman with a large Afro that appeared to be graying and was just as heavily built as her daughter. She was wearing a powder blue dress and white gloves. She was carrying every male guest at the wedding in her hands. Since the meteors struck and mutated all women, it became a tradition for the male wedding guests to observe the ceremony in the palms of the bride\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa was waiting for you and smiling as her tail was wagging. \u201cYou better brace yourself, Elisa,\u201d says Elisa\u2019s best woman. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to deal with Susan Spade as a mother-in-law.\u201d Elisa\u2019s best woman was an enormous and very pear-shaped gargoyle woman with aqua-colored skin and pale greenish blonde hair worn in a spiky style. She was also wearing a pair of thin glasses along with her bridesmaid outfit. \u201cCome on, Aqua,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cSure, Heath\u2019s mother may be a pain at times but she\u2019s a behemoth, it\u2019s to be expected. They\u2019re as territorial as actually hippos.\u201d Elisa turned to see her mother smiling at her and fighting back tears right before Elisa herself looked down at her finger to see the ring you bought her. It was definitely no picnic to buy wedding rings in this day for men. Especially since the wedding ring that would fit around a girl\u2019s finger was the size of an arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door opened up and your mother came in walking you down the aisle. You smile at Elisa but your mom looks nervous as the minister is showing up. You really hope that everything goes off without a hitch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was yet another Tuesday at the parlor you worked at. You had arrived bright and early when you felt tremors and looked up to see your employer Beth. Beth was a 4500ft dark green-skinned and red-striped werelizard with bright red triceratops-like horns, long black hair, long claws and jagged teeth. Like most women you knew, she was quite plump, especially below the waist. The titanic reptile looks down on you with her bright red eyes before speaking. \u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cThe first one here as always. Get on.\u201d Beth holds out the big toe on her left foot and you climb on the lizard giantess\u2019s long and sharp toenail before she stomps off to the front of the salon. \u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d says the titanic lizard. \u201cMrs. Colt is coming in to get her shoes hammered in.\u201d \u201cYes, Beth. I got it.\u201d Beth ran a beauty parlor and your main job was working on women\u2019s feet, whether it be working on toenails, massaging soles or in the case of centaurs like Mrs. Colt, hammering in horseshoes. You didn\u2019t mind. You were one of the men in society who accepted such a position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was how life was in 2780. Centuries ago, magic meteors struck the Earth, causing it to change drastically. The Earth expanded in size as magical energy returned to the planet, creating a world where the Dark ages of magic combined with the scientific age of the future. However, the most dramatic effect of this spell was that half the human race was transformed. All women were transformed into colossal versions of the monsters of mythology from around the world. And from then on, every male baby born would be a normal sized human while every female baby a great beast. The smallest giantesses stood at least 1500ft. In the new world, the standards of beauty changed drastically in regards to these titans. If you were a giantess, the bigger you were, the more beautiful you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, women were in charge of the world and every country and major corporation was ruled by a titaness. Your mother was no exception. The fact was your mother was a fat cat; both because she was a CEO of a successful TV studio but also because she was a titanic 5000ft tall albino sphinx who would weigh as much as a sumo wrestler if she was normal-sized. She had pale cream-white fur and hair and bright red eyes. She didn\u2019t look half bad for a woman her age and in spite of her massive weight, her wings were big enough to allow her to fly. Being a sphinx, rather than walking on two legs, she walked on all fours like an animal. At that moment, she was pacing around her office rather troubled as your father rode on her head behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it easy, Lydia,\u201d your father says. \u201cThe meeting went well. What are you worried about.\u201d Your mother let out a sigh. \u201cJames,\u201d says your mom. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s irksome that works all day at women\u2019s feet and yet he hasn\u2019t asked one of them out even once?\u201d Your mother starts to growl in frustration as your dad gives a look of worry. \u201cLydia, it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Your mom then glares at your dad as she gives a slight meow. \u201cClaire is already married and she\u2019s younger than James.\u201d Your mother was of course talking about your sister who while three years younger than you was married first. She resembled her mother, except she had longer hair and gold-colored fur. You and Claire got along fine but you didn\u2019t care much for her husband. For that matter, neither did your dad. \u201cOf course, Claire got married first. She\u2019s your heir. Money and power are very attractive. Uh, that isn\u2019t to say Claire isn\u2019t attractive, Dear.\u201d Your mother just lets out a sigh. \u201cIf Tyler doesn\u2019t find himself a girl but soon, I\u2019m going to take matters into my own paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom plops her enormous rear behind her desk as she grumbles to herself. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame when the parent is less picky than the child. How am I supposed to give our son away to a nice girl if he isn\u2019t even trying.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try and hook him up with one of your employees?\u201d \u201cYou think I haven\u2019t tried that? The only one that was interested was Sasha Scales, the night guard.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Sasha?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a naga! Tyler has no interest in girls that don\u2019t have feet.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s used to being at women\u2019s feet with the type of job he has. Why don\u2019t we try a mail order bride.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding? There hasn\u2019t been such a thing as a mail order bride since the meteors hit. Nowadays it\u2019s all about mail order grooms.\u201d \u201cMy aren\u2019t we extra negative today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a buzz from your mother\u2019s secretary. \u201cMrs. Catseye,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody here to see you about the show that\u2019s replacing Diagon Abbey.\u201d \u201cSend him in, Lucy,\u201d says your mom. \u201cDang. That\u2019s gonna be a tough act to follow. We\u2019re going to need something really good to stay on top.\u201d Your dad rolls his eyes. \u201cAt least we\u2019re doing better with that channel with that teen superhero team.\u201d Your mom just gives a gag. \u201cHow a show that terrible stays on the air is beyond me.\u201d It was there another giantess entered your mom\u2019s office. She was a titanic 3000ft high  and very fat and chest heavy werebat with bright silver fur and long red hair as well as a tuft of fur on her chest that was bright red and in the shape of a bat. Her clawed hands were attached to her wings and she was completely naked except for a pair of glasses (some monsters were able to get away with not wearing clothes, provided they had fur to cover themselves up).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat woman gave a confident smile as she flapped up to your mother. \u201cLydia Catseye I presume? I am Barbara Blood and boy do I have a good idea for a reality TV show for Channel 5.\u201d \u201cReality TV?\u201d asks your mother with a scoff. \u201cUgh.\u201d Ms. Blood gives a shrieking laugh. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that. This one\u2019s actually good. I call it Starlight Hearts.\u201d \"And what may I ask is the premise?\" asks your mom as your father scratches her behind the ear and makes her purr. \u201cLower.\u201d Ms. Blood gives a smirk. \u201cMy idea is a matchmaking show. Every month, we select 1 eligible bachelor and then select 3 eligible monsters. He dates all 3 for the duration of the month until he picks 1 of the 3 to go steady with. I\u2019ve already set up a website where these girls can apply.\u201d Ms. Blood opens up her computer and shows files of dozens of young monster girls that catch your mom\u2019s attention. Your dad gives a whistle. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the number of people rely on dating websites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your mom gets an idea from the pitch for the show and scratches her double chin. \u201cSounds interesting, Ms. Blood. You know, I might just give your show a chance.\u201d Ms. Blood lets out a shrieking laugh. \u201cYou won\u2019t regret this, Mrs. Catseye.\u201d But then your mother holds up a paw. \u201cOn one condition; the first bachelor on the show will be my son.\u201d Ms. Blood looks at your mom in confusion. \u201cYour son?\u201d Your dad gives an uneasy look. \u201cLydia, what are you doing?!\u201d Your mom then covers your dad with her paw before speaking. \u201cMy son is at the age when he should be married but I\u2019m having no luck finding him a wife. All day long he works on their feet and he can\u2019t ask one girl out on his own!\u201d Ms. Blood nods her head. \u201cI see. And what is your son\u2019s preference?\u201d Your mom gives a purr. \u201cLarger girls, like yours truly of course. But they have to have big feet to go with their big bodies.\u201d Barbara gives a smile. \u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed, Mrs. Catseye.\u201d Your mom gives a purr as your dad gives a look of worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, you were busy working on Mrs. Colt\u2019s feet and the centaur giantess was busy reading the newspaper as you were hammering in the last horseshoe. Suddenly, your cellphone rang and this caused you to hammer too hard and the centaur giantess screamed in pain. You answer the phone and see that you have a text from your mother. \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Got Three Potential Wives Waiting for Him.\u201d You let out a groan. \u201cAw, Mom.\u201d Beth overheard the scream and went to check up on you. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cNothing, Beth,\u201d you say. \u201cJust my mom meddling in my life again.\" Beth lets out a sigh and then rolls her eyes. \"Just get back to work. And try not to give the customers arthritis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, boss.\" You say nervously. You then give a groan. \u201cThis is not going to be easy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You weren\u2019t touching your own food and it made Claire stare at you. \u201cTyler?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d You don\u2019t answer and the golden sphinx has to tap you on the head slightly. \u201cHey, big brother, I\u2019m speaking to you.\u201d Your brother-in-law, Phillip, just gives a scoff. \u201cLeave him alone, Claire. If he wants to waste Emily\u2019s hard work on tonight\u2019s dinner, let him.\u201d \u201cShut up, Phillip.\u201d You say. Claire then turns to your parents and your mom lets out a sigh. \u201cTyler, don\u2019t be like that. You might just meet a nice girl.\u201d \u201cWho knows?\u201d asks your dad. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll end up with a big beautiful sphinx like I did.\u201d Your mother licks your father after hearing that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to go on one of your station\u2019s game shows to get hooked up with a girl I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s your own fault,\u201d says Claire with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who isn\u2019t really... proactive about finding a... mate.\u201d Your sister\u2019s train of thought slips as Phillip uses a laser pointer to distract her as she swats at the red dot on the table. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask Beth or one of your customers out, Tyler?\u201d \u201c1) Many of our customers are already married. 2) Beth has a girlfriend and 3) This is a terrible idea! Mom, everybody knows you\u2019re the CEO of Channel High 5. You\u2019re basically inviting a bunch of gold diggers to take their pick at your other offspring.\u201d Phillip gives you a glare and holds up his fork in a threatening gesture. He knew the very reason you didn\u2019t like him that much. You suspected he only married Claire for your mom\u2019s money. Not that he could try anything against your mom or Claire given he like all men was less than a breath mint to both his wife and mother-in-law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler,\u201d says your mom. \u201cBe reasonable. This could be your last shot at getting a girlfriend. Think about this real hard.\u201d You bite your lip but you knew there was no use arguing with a 5000ft tall albino sphinx who also happened to be your mother. \u201cFine, Mom. I\u2019ll go through with it.\u201d Your mother smiles and bends over to give you a kiss, painting your entire body in her lipstick in the process. Your dad then climbs into her ear as she drinks a glass of wine. \u201cI just hope our future daughter-in-law isn\u2019t a hydra. Those multi-headed girls give me the creeps.\u201d Lydia gives a scoff. \u201cJames, you worry too much. That must be where our son gets it. I already spoke with Barbara and she\u2019s the manager of a hostess who will throw our son like a bouquet to get him a bride.\u201d Your mother then eats another fish with one gulp and begins to gag because she ate it too fast. \u201cEmily,\u201d she calls out to your maid. \u201cCould you be a dear and please bring me more water.\u201d Claire lowers her head and purrs. \u201cGood luck, Tyler,\u201d your younger much huger sister says. \u201cJust wait until you get a taste of marital bliss.\u201d Claire then lower her jaw for Phillip to climb into her mouth and then closed it as they proceed to tongue kiss. You shiver at the thought of what your sister and brother-in-law are doing right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Barbara Blood, the vampire bat giantess who pitched Starlight Hearts to your mother was meeting with another giantess. She was a chubby Frankenstein\u2019s monster girl with three miss-matched eyes, long pink hair reaching down to her large butt and patchwork skin that was different shades of gray. She also had bolts sticking out of her shoulders and wrists and was wearing a patchwork bikini with heart designs on it. \u201cGood news, Veronica,\u201d says Barbara. \u201cStarlight Hearts is about to be an actual thing.\u201d The Frankenstein\u2019s monster giantess put on her makeup before she gave a smirk. \u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cNow the world gets to see Veronica Valentine on live TV. Who\u2019s the lucky man I\u2019m setting up on a date first.\u201d Barbara bites her lip. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing. Mrs. Catseye wants your first customer to be her son. His name is Tyler.\u201d Veronica\u2019s three eyes all but pop out of her head. \u201cTyler?\u201d she asks. \u201cHold on, I think I know somebody with that name. Tyler, Tyler. OMG, that\u2019s the guy at Beth\u2019s Boutique. That toe cleaner is Lydia Catseye\u2019s son? Who would\u2019ve guessed.\u201d \u201cPlease take this seriously,\u201d says Barbara with a hint of annoyance in her voice. \u201cIf we jump through this hoop, Starlight Hearts will be the biggest show on High 5. Do not blow this.\u201d Veronica gave a yawn. \u201cOh please,\u201d said the pretentious patchwork lady. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d Barbara just bit her lip and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you walked into work and heard loud stomping. Beth was glaring down at you and you look in shock. \u201cWhat are you doing here!?\u201d yells the lizard giantess. \u201cYour mom called me and told me that you were taking the day off.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d you ask. \u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve... ugh!\u201d The lizardess grabs you in her claws before she lifts you up to her face and shrieks. \u201cWhat are you doing standing around here? You\u2019re needed at the studio. They\u2019re shooting the first episode of Starlight Hearts in an hour!\u201d \u201cWait!? So sudden. But the show was only approved yester...\u201d Beth squeezes you and then storms out to take you to the studio. \u201cOh good grief,\u201d you moan to yourself. \u201cJust what has Mom gotten me into?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say another word, Beth reaches the studio and Barbara flies down and snatches you up. Barbara then stares down at you with a smirk that makes you very afraid. \u201cYou, little man. Are about to make me the most successful agent in L.A.\u201d You give a gulp as the show is just about to start.</span></div></div>",

The men on the catwalk adjust the lights as the audience gathers around in their seats. Barbara is very pleased with the turnout right before she sees your mother taking her VIP seat to watch the first episode of Starlight Hearts as it airs. \u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed, Mrs. Catseye. I guarantee it.\u201d Your mom gives a scoff. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about the ratings. I just want to see what kind of girls you\u2019ll be trying to pair Tyler with.\u201d Barbara nods her head just as a heart-shaped pink light shines on the stage and out walks Veronica with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, America!\u201d yells Veronica as she stomps her large foot. \u201cI am Veronica Valentine and you are watching the first episode of Starlight Hearts! Yayzies!\u201d The crowd cheers and several men watching from the monster women\u2019s purses focus on Veronica and the skimpy outfit she\u2019s wearing. If they only knew what she was like off the camera. \u201cEvery month,\u201d says Veronica. \u201cWe\u2019ll present you with an eligible young man and 3 carefully selected monsters from a list of online applicants will get their chance to play to be the steady girlfriend to the tiny eye candy of the month. Now, let\u2019s meet who these gorgeous gals are fighting for this month!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more lights turned on, one of them focused on you inside of a pink cage decorated with hearts. You let out a sigh as you hear the crowd roaring and Veronica gives a smile before picking up the cage, giving you a good view of her stitched up face. You swear that her mouth would be bigger if certain stitches came undone. \u201cThis eligible bachelor is Tyler Catseye, a beautician with a thing for women\u2019s feet and another plus, is the son of studio owner, Lydia Catseye. Meow! And what better way to get the ball rolling by finding our leader the perfect daughter-in-law. F-W-I, Big Mommy says sonny boy likes big gals with big feet. So we narrowed our search down to three lucky ladies who we\u2019ll be following for the next month as they court Tyler and we\u2019ll know by the end of the month which final girl will win.\u201d You grunt as Veronica shakes the cage. \u201cAnd without further adieu,\u201d says the Frankenstein monster giantess. \u201cLet\u2019s introduce our three lucky bachelorettes.\u201d Not only are you nervous but your mom is watching the first episode and stuffing her face with shrimp as she bites her claws and your dad holds on tight to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the first contestant came in. You look in shock. From the looks of it, she was a 4000ft tall baku, a yokai resembling a fanged tapir. She had bright copper skin with a white spot on her back. She was very obese with long golden blonde hair and a pair of pink glasses. As you sat in your cage, you couldn\u2019t help but notice her enormous hooves. Each toenail was big enough for you to build a house on. The baku woman just smiled as she looked at you. \u201cTyler,\u201d says Veronica. \u201cMeet our first bachelorette, Maya Ruiz. This beautiful baku hails from New Mexico and before that, actual Mexico, and works as an agent for the Worldquest Travel Agency while in her spare time building model planes.\u201d You could almost swear that Maya was smirking as she looked at you, as if there was more on her mind than just love. However, you were paying more attention to her lovely hooves. \u201cAhem,\u201d grunts Maya in a Latin accent. \u201cMy eyes are up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond, the second contestant came in. The second giantess to come forward was just as tall and fat as Maya. She was a gigantic turquoise-skinned kappa with short rose-colored hair and a gray shell. She resembled a sea turtle. The first thing you noticed about her was her webbed flippers. Those weren\u2019t the type of feet you were used to. The kappa girl flipped her hair and showed her sultry eyes as she stared at you and you even had to clutch your chest. \u201cBachelorette Numero Deux,\u201d says Veronique. \u201cIs Shelby Aoyama, a kappa who\u2019s been in L.A. from Tokyo for 1 year. Been out of college for 6 years and yet she\u2019s just recently turned 18. Has a degree in marine biology and works at a laboratory that\u2019s part of the national seashore. Her favorite pastime when she\u2019s not monitoring the activity of the ocean blue; surfing!\u201d Shelby then walks up towards you and leans down to get a good look at you. Your jaw drops. This goddess with perfect flippers was a college graduate and she was barely older than a teenager? Were they insane giving her a chance to date you. Shelby just winks at you. \u201cMy,\u201d she says. \u201cAren\u2019t you so cute, I could just sit on you.\u201d As she says this, she wiggles her large butt cheeks that appear to be too big for her shell to even contain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028\u201cAnd now!\u201d yells Veronica. \u201cBachelorette No. 3!\u201d The last giantess to walk out was just like Maya and Shelby; 4000ft tall and fat. This young woman was an enormous violet red-skinned gargoyle with long black hair reaching down to her massive rear. She had large leather wings with bright violet membranes and six large horns on her forehead. But what you were interested in was this gargoyle women\u2019s long and sharp bird-like talons. \u201cBonjour.\u201d Says the gargoyle giantess in a French accent as she raises one of her goddess-like talons. \u201cOur last bachelorette is Gabrielle Delacroix. Gabby if you\u2019re nice. Born and raised in Paris France as a peinture extraordinaire whose naturalistic and surreal works of art hang in the collections of the most influential titanesses in Europe. And to sweeten the deal, she doesn\u2019t speak a word of English.\u201d Gabby stares at you and then blows a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya, Shelby and Gabby walk up as Veronica gives a smile. \u201c1 of these lucky 3 will win a brand new husband. Will it end with  You could not believe the three girls you got stuck with. You had a month\u2019s time to decide if you wanted to marry a girl with talons, a girl with flippers or a girl with hooves. Maya, Shelby and Gabby were looking down at you with lust as you backed up in your cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was going on, your mother was watching the display and wagging her tail. Your father sitting between her pointed ears and biting his nails just as Veronica is about to continue. \u201cNow,\u201d says the Frankenstein giantess. \u201cAll we have to do is decide which of these lovely ladies will take this bite-sized hunk out first.\u201d Veronica then gestured to a table with three cards carefully placed face down. \u201cBeneath these cards, there is a triangle, a square and a star. Whoever draws the star will get the first turn. The square will grant the second turn and whoever gets the triangle will get every third turn. Now, without further adieu, let\u2019s light up some hearts!\u201d\u2028\u2028You look out as Maya the tapir titaness, Shelby the colossal kappa and Gabby the ginormous gargoyle walk up to draw their cards. This month will give you the chance to know all three giantesses. But this draw will decide who gets to date you first. The audience cheers and watches while your mother focuses on the three girls. \u201cThose three are the best girls Barbara could find?\u201d asked your mother to yourself. Your dad then blows into the titanic sphinx\u2019s ear. \"It's starting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow who exactly will be your first date for the month?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year is 2780...The world changed. I don't know how to describe it because this is the only world I've known. We don't necessarily know how it happened. What we do know is that it all began with a meteor-impact. Somehow this impact caused the future and the past to collide. Technology seemed to be made obsolete as a powerful force that we only took to describing as \"Magic\" had been released from the Meteorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magic seemed to pour out of the rock, like radiation. We at first tried to harness it to use for our own purposes. But we soon found out that the Magic had some rather poisonous side effects. It was a slow process but all the women in the world began to change. They exhibited strange mutations, and before we could find a cure, most women had completely changed and were no longer human anymore...they were monsters. Specifically the women had all changed into strange anthropomorphs of mythological creatures from fairytales and legends. And that's not all...<br>\r\nThe radiation caused the women to grow larger as well. It got to the point where the monster women could no longer be contained; we couldn't cure them anyway. This plague had spread throughout all of the planet. The entire female population changed, becoming towering monsters. But the men were oddly immune to it all and remained unaffected. I heard there were experiments to test what caused this; if maybe estrogen was the catalyst and testosterone could be the cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got worse from there; the new gigantic monster women were an odd epidemic to deal with. Ordinarily I'm sure certain people would enjoy looking up and seeing a giant woman standing above them. Not so much in this world. You see, the larger a woman in this world becomes...the more monstrous she becomes. Before long, the entire female population was made up of feral giantesses. They would go completely wild after breaking loose from the quarantined area. Cities were devastated in the attacks to stop them. What's worse is that they would often fight each other for territory. Civilization was left in ruins and the problem apparently wasn't going away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was centuries ago. The government was certain that mankind would face extinction; considering that all of the females in the world suddenly turned into giant feral monsters and the men were so tiny compared to them, it's not like we had opportunities for breeding...But we soon found out that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMankind had to shelter itself into tiny pockets and corners of the world to get out of sight of the monster women. But every so often the women would come and raid the colonies, scooping up handfuls of men at a time. At first we thought they were going to eat them; after all we are considered their favorite snack. But the truth is a bit more disturbing. Every so often, the giantesses will go into heat - so to speak. The men they abduct are taken back to their lairs where they try to mate with them. And as disturbing as it sounds...they succeed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow or another, men are still essential to these giant bitches for reproduction and it's still possible. The man isn't really expected to survive the ordeal - after all can you imagine having sex with something the size of a sky scrapper? A female still has a chance of producing a male or female offspring; only the females that are born...well they grow up to be like their mothers in almost every way. But males are still born human. It's how our numbers stay relatively sustainable; otherwise they'd have chomped or fucked us to death by now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the maternal instincts for the monster women are incredibly strong and never seem to run out; which is lucky to say that they don't eat whatever male offspring they produce. In fact they're actually more maternal with their sons than their daughters. Hell some of them keep their human offspring inside of them for safe-keeping; almost like preventing them from being born. I should know; I was told that I spent the first few years of my life inside my mom before she was killed by a rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI joined up with a colony that exists in a nice peaceful valley far away from monster territory. It's how I learned about all the fucked up stuff in this world; course I didn't know how fucked up it was until I learned that there was once a time before this. For me this is just life...For me, I live a meager existence, working wherever and with whoever I can to make a life for myself...all the while wondering of what will happen when I find myself in some girl's shadow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's talk about the colony of developing weapons and technology to combat the huge broads. I honestly think its hopeless. We don't stand a chance; this problem not only isn't going away but it's also getting worse. It was somewhat doable centuries ago back when the ladies were only about 200 feet tall...The last recorded sighting of what was considered a \"small\" giantess had her in at about 1500 feet tall...<br>\r\nWe've gone from being insects to microbes in their eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hell...the world is doomed anyway; we used to be able to hear them from far away. We could hear that they would struggle with each other; punching and trying to break each other, fighting for dominance. But its been years since we've heard anything outside our borders. Some of us think that they've managed to wipe themselves out...<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for the sausage fest I find myself apart of...that only means its only a matter of time before we're all gone, snuffed out like a candle in the wind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now is; what to do about it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ever since that uneventful day, ever since that strange meteor struck the Earth, nothing...and literally NOTHING has EVER been the same. For one thing, all females around the world changed into giant towering anthropomorphic monsters from various fairytales, myths and legends. However, what truly made this day stand out was, not how it affect the opposite sex, but how it affected YOU. You were near the site when the asteroid collided with our planet...and you were there when humanity tried to harness the \"magical energy\" from that chunk of space rock, plus witnessing the changes and the following events that have happened soon afterward. You have recently come to terms how life has changed in the future, still there are days when you hope that these events will go away and wake up in a dream. But enough now, it is time to talk about you and your \"abilities\", so to speak, that you have \"gained\" from that day which changed everything and everyone you knew.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your first memory is hazy, but you were going out for a walk one night, when you noticed a bright light shining from the sky (you can't remember why you were outside in the first place, because you weren't very active in the past. As a matter of fact, you don't know much about your past at all.) At first, you thought it was a shooting star and stopped to make a wish. Unfortunately, you should have kept walking or running, since that \"star\" kept falling straight toward you at an enormous speed. You eventually did start running, but it wasn't enough, because the meteor soon crashed on the ground and you were quite a ways from the impact zone. However, you still felt that collision and feeling the ground breaking apart when it struck down. Before you got struck down on your head and passing out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Afterwards, probably about maybe... you don't know a few weeks or years (you lost track when you were out cold.)  You wake up in some sort of super secret government bunker, like the ones in a movie. It had everything from people in white lab coats and security personnel to computers hooked up to fancy gadgets and gizmos. Except for one thing,  a \"MOW MOW MOW\" sound was going off, red lights were blinking and filling the facility periodically, plus all the staff that worked there were all  MALE; young and old, dark skinned and light skinned; tall and short; muscular, skinny and even some men that were pudgy at best, were all running around screaming, \"It has escaped...ESCAPED!\" \"KILL THE B****, RIGHT NOW!\" \"WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE!\" etc. You even saw a security member grab a handgun and started shooting some lab members..but they didn't flinch or protest, after the final scientist was shot in the head, the officer with the gun in hand was about to do himself in, when all of a sudden...a giant claw like that of a lion or some other giant jungle cat, reached down and picked the man up. You sort of remember that the guy looked like he was in his thirties, pretty muscular, and he had dark skin (again you don't know.) The one feature that you can clearly remember is not the colour of his eyes or anything about his face, but what STATE it was in...FEAR, HELPLESSNESS and everything else associated with those feelings and/or thoughts. At that moment, you felt...YOU FELT.....ANGER......HATRED and more than anything to help him right now. Fortunately, out of nowhere, a bolt of energy came surging out of your body and destroyed the console that held you prisoner, you then ran straight toward the hapless officer but was too late. He was gone and nowhere to be found. You fell on my knees in defeat, which didn't last long, since you soon started running out of the facility, your prison, the nightmare you woke up in, only to enter another one. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The past following years and you do mean years were absolutely crazy. They were spent hiding, scavenging, and trying to help any male human you could find to some haven or sanctuary, all the while you were gaining more powerful, extravagant abilities. You are also pretty sure you're immortal or seem to age at an INCREDIBLE slow pace, because it was the year 2780. Not only that, but you were incredibly strong, durable, fast, phase through solid matter and even shoot out some energy shots out of your hands or \"lasers\" from your eyes, plus many, many more yet to come you think to yourself. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite this \"gift\" and your occasional assistance from time to time, the giant behemoth monster \"women\" appear to be winning, hell, some of them were put in positions of power of government and were even running companies or businesses around the world. If any other human saw this, they would most likely give up and surrender (which they did), except for YOU. This is motivating you to try even harder, you are tired of your \"kind\" being used for breeding, livestock and many other things. Yes you are aware, that there are male humans who are happy with their new lives and are married to some of these giantesses. That doesn't matter to you though, you are still going to find a way to take down these things (perhaps the ones that are most troublesome) and help anyone who requires assistance. You were there when this all began and are aware that the old government ARE responsible for these creatures. However, to you they are thieves who stole your past life and have changed the world for better (or most likely) the worst. Plus you need to do right now, so this could be your purpose, a self-proposed \"destiny\" to work for, because if you don't do it, who else will? Maybe you'll even find some allies to help you along the way and \"fight\" back against this new and (supposedly) cruel, dangerous world you are now residing in.</span></div></div>",
