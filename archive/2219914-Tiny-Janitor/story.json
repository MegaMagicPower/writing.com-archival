He grabs the wrong chemical and as soon as they hit each other there is a small explosion, not big enough to alert anyone. Grant gets thrown back against the wall and knocked out.

At least the smell wasn't as bad considering that all he could really smell is pizza. Soon a shadow loomed over Grant and the pizza below him shook as it was lifted up high into the air.

He got up and could now see that he had landed on a kids shoe, more specifically a sandal. He looked around the sandal and saw that he was right in the center of it with the toe divider and straps ahead of him. But what Grant failed to notice was that the sandal's owner had returned to put it back on, soon a shadow appeared over him and he turned around to see the owner. It was an 8 year old boy who looked to be Indian due to his tan skin, he was also wearing tan shorts and a plain blue t-shirt. It seemed the boy had no clue to Grant's presence as his lifted up his foot and proceeded to put on his sandal. Grant had no time to react as the boy's tanned foot landed on top of him and slightly dragged him as the boy made sure his foot was fully on the sandal. Surprisingly to Grant that even though a child's foot was currently on top of him he was unharmed and not dead. But that didn't mean he couldn't feal the pressure and weight of the boy on top of him, he also noticed he couldn't move. So now Grant's only hope was that the boy would notice that there is something between his foot and his sandal. </span></div></div>",
