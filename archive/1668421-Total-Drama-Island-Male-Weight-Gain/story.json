Being the hottest male at a summer camp wasn't really anything new for the male, as he was usually recognized first for his looks. As soon as the other guys at the camp laid eyes on him, they were instantly filled with jealousy. I mean, could you blame them? Being able to make all the girls swoon with just a passing glance really was a special ability. Despite being incredibly handsome, Justin was empty on the inside; literally and mentally. The male longed for someone to understand him and love him the way he loved himself. And, although he'd never admit it, he always had a secret fetish for being stuffed. He would dream of being fed and blowing up to an unimaginable size, eventually not even being able to move. Justin would never really do it if he was given a choice, he'd lose his wondrous six pack and natural charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host of the show, Chris McLean, gathered all of the campers together to speak to them. He gave a short introduction of himself and explained the basic rules of the island; what to do and what not to do. After finishing his explanation, he told the campers to get unpacked and head into the dining hall, as it was time to eat. Justin felt relieved at that statement, having not eaten for several hours now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin unpacked his belonging quickly and rushed into the mess hall, first in line to receive his food. Chef eyed him oddly as he dropped a huge load of what Justin could only hope was a sloppy joe. Despite the food looking like it belonged in a garbage can and not on his plate, the male happily accepted the food. He took a seat at one of the tables and eagerly began feasting on the burger, even more hungry then what he was before. The other male members filed in around him with their food, also starving. Through making idle chat with a boy sitting next to him named Trent, he found out that the females wouldn't be joining them for the meal, as it would take them a while to unpack everything they had brought. Justin continued talking with the other boy until he swallowed the last bite of his meal. \"<i>That wasn't so bad and hey, this guy's kind of cute.\"</i> Still incredibly hungry, Justin approached the service counter and asked Chef for some more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some more food muscle man?\" Chef asked, giving the teen a questioning eye. \"Sure, come on back and I'll get you some more food.\" He nodded, smiling deviously. Justin, uncaring, stepped back through the push door and took a seat on a chair Chef guided him to. \"Now just sit tight, I'll be right back.\" Chef told the male, grinning even wider now. Chef walked through another door off to the side of the kitchen and walked through it, leaving Justin alone. Justin looked around the kitchen for a brief second. It wasn't exactly what he would call sanitary, but hey, a kitchen was a kitchen. A few moments later Chef returned with his hands behind his back, quietly tip-toeing his way behind the chair Justin was seated. Without warning, Chef grabbed Justin's arms and whipped them behind the back of the chair, tying them together and around the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\" Justin shouted, causing Chef to grin. \"You're about to get everything you want, just sit tight and I'll be right back.\" Chef stated, happily strolling back into the room he was previously in. Now that Justin's alone, he...</span></div></div>",

Just as Justin was about to call again, the push door gently glided open and in stepped the male Justin was talking with earlier, Trent. \"Trent! Thank god you're here! I need you to untie me, the crazy chef has me tied.\" Justin pleaded, getting no reaction from Trent. \"Uh, are you going to help me?\" Justin asked, wondering what the other teen was thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door that Chef had gone through busted open; Chef stepping out of it with several trays of food loaded in his arms. \"Ah, looks like we have some help.\" Chef laughed, staring at Trent. \"You going to help me or not?\" The cook asked, approaching Justin. \"If not, you'll just get to watch me feed this kid until he can't eat anymore, and then I'll feed him until he can't move.\" Justin gulped, hoping Trent would actually help him instead of assisting Chef. \"Fine then, I'll get started on my own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChef picked up some of the grub he had piled on one of trays and forcefully shoved it in Justin's mouth, making the boy swallow it. \"What're you doing?\" Justin choked, coughing  from the food he had just been fed. \"Isn't it obvious boy, I'm gonna be feeding you until you can't move anymore.\" Justin's eye grew wide, but he wasn't nervous or scared. In reality, this is actually what he had been dreaming about. He just wasn't sure if he was ready for it. \"Open wide, here comes more.\" Chef announced, now picking up two pieces of food and forcing them down Justin's throat, causing him to cough again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can swallow it on my own.\" Justin choked out. \"Oh, we have a willing one do we? Fine, it's not as fun that way though.\" Chef obliged, smirking. \"Hey, tall kid. Get over here and help me stuff this kid.\" Chef called, facing Trent. Trent nodded slowly and stepped over to the male, grabbing two handfuls of food and tossing them into Justin's mouth. <i>\"Is he into this too?\" </i> Justin thought as Chef and Trent began taking turns force feeding Justin food. He had to admit, he really was enjoying all the food. He could feel his stomach growing larger and larger, just waiting to bust of the shirt he was wearing. The feeding continued for several more minutes, Justin's stomach not even being close to full. Just as his shirt was about to shoot up past his lower belly, Chef and Trent stopped giving Justin food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're out of food. Wait here and guard the boy until I get back with more.\" Chef ordered, standing up and walking into that back room again. Now that Trent and Justin are alone, Justin...</span></div></div>",

His ass and entire body shook violently, as did the entire house around him. Fortunately nothing in the house was damaged or fell off, but it was still close. The outside was less fortunate, as the entire planet was rocked with the intense shaking as the roads, buildings and glass were hit by the powerful shock-waves of the smelly fart and even began to crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were screaming and crying as for them, it felt like the end of the world for them. But for Owen, it was only the beginning. This was also just the shock-waves, the actual smell was just as bad if not worse as all the plant-life withered and rotted away into nothing for miles. Even hours away, the smell was nasty but not as deadly as the epicentre of it all where Owen's smell was similar to the smell of a sewer that had never been cleared out and the waters mixed together over the years, creating a smell that could kill anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Leshawna and Owen didn't care about that, as Leshawna was in front of Owen and therefore couldn't smell it and they had a massive grin on their face. Their love just made the equivalent of a fart as powerful as a bomb and did all this just by holding it in? To them, that was incredible. Leshawna even felt a little hot all over their adult body, a feeling they never felt before with Harold. This was the action that made Leshawna realise that they made the right choice with Owen, he would now be the centre of Leshawna's attention going forward and they were okay with it. They even ripped a loud fart in response that tore a hole in their pants and they just moaned before going over to Owen and kissing his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So big boy, what happens now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duncan was a man and a bad-ass. He could handle whatever anyone threw his way and would never back down from a challenge. Which is why he found himself agreeing to this absurd challenge to bulk up for a few months and then lose all the weight, if he could. That might not have been such a good idea since his friend/rival/enemy/sometimes lover Alejandro (they had a very complicated relationship that nobody could figure out) posed it and then claimed to full control of everything Duncan was going to eat for the next 6 months and when. Of course Alejandro was going to bankroll it being rich so at least Duncan had free meals for the next while but that left Alejandro in charge. Duncan could back down but that would leave his reputation in tatters and no one would ever take him seriously or fear him again and after working so hard for all that, no way is he going to let that happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro first took him out for breakfast and ruthlessly ordered the 4 pancakes with a side of sausage, bacon, and eggs special. He wasn't going to start easy and a meal didn't actually count as complete unless it was eaten in its entirety. This made the contest even more tricky because it wasn't just 6 months, it was 6 months of meals that required full completion and any that weren't would have to be redone at a later date until finished. While Alejandro was keeping record, Duncan was also keeping meal records to make sure Alejandro wouldn't at a later date cheat and order more than the original meal to be made up since Alejandro did do stuff like that in other contests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Duncan couldn't do it all the way, only able to eat 3 and a half pancakes and most of the sausage/bacon/eggs before being too full to manage anymore which made Alejandro smirk as he circled it as a redo like he planned. Duncan could see where this was going and Alejandro was going to play it to do nearly inconsumable amounts of food to greatly extend the deadline and how much Duncan was going to eat. He was going to need to figure out a way to stop that as he doubted Alejandro would show any mercy and there was no way he was going to back out against this guy. </span></div></div>",

Al plans on leaving my house at ten.\"  Duncan hung up his phone just as Alejandro exited the bathroom and walked over, \"So, are you ready to go?  We're moving on to the lunch meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan bit his lower lip nervously.  He was still stuffed from the meal he just had.

Well, we'll see you make good on your boast now,\" he taunted and Duncan pushed him off. <br>\r\n\"You bet I will,\" Duncan said confidently although inside he wasn't so sure as he never had big meals so close together before and he was still stuffed with his breakfast meal, let alone with soon to be at the very least a hamburger or two of some size. But he wasn't going to let Al have the pleasure of rattling him. <br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" and with that Alejandro and he remained quiet for a few minutes until they got up to the cashier. Alejandro gave a bright smile to the cashier girl and she was start-struck. 'Big mistake lady' thought Duncan as he watched Alejandro flirt a bit, smiling all the while as he pretty much walked off without paying and not even noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't pay for that,\" Duncan said once they sat down at a table and Alejandro laughed a bit. <br>\r\n\"Neither do you all the time. I don't see why you care.\" <br>\r\n\"You can afford it even easier than I can.\" <br>\r\n\"It's so much more fun this way though,\" Alejandro said, smiling that disarming smile again that continually fooled the unwary into doing stupid things. <br>\r\n\"Whatever. Let's just get this over with you weirdo.\" Alejandro tutted but said nothing in reply to that although Duncan knew he was angry. Maybe he shouldn't piss him off so much but he couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two double quarter pounders, large extra fries, and large drink,\" Al intoned, placing the objects in front of you. Duncan groaned and Alejandro smiled again. <br>\r\n\"Remember, throwing up is also immediate failure to complete meal,\" he said smugly. Duncan just sighed and rolled his shoulders back. <br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it, but you're going to have to leave a reasonable time to digest, not just skip from one meal straight into the other.\" Alejandro shook his head smiling. <br>\r\n\"Very well, I promise to most of the time leave some room to digest more and space the meals out-most of the time.\" <br>\r\n\"Why most of the time?\" <br>\r\n\"Because every now and then I want to have fun in watching you squirm and struggle a bit.\" <br>\r\n\"You already get to see me struggle every meal.\" <br>\r\n\"True, but extra. Nonetheless, I promise not to do it very much. After all, if you throw up before you even begin, I don't get anything out of it.\" Al really was evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan looked at the food, feeling a little sick. Despite what Al said, he was sure Al wouldn't mind at least making him do the indignity to throw up every now and then. This was a meal he could probably comfortably do on an empty stomach and really hungry. But since he was still stuffed full of pancakes, sausages, eggs, and bacon, this was definitely going to be a bit hellish. Damn his manliness and inability to refuse dares. Alejandro just smirks at him watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you give in?\" he asks, needling. \"A wimp who can't even eat a measly couple of burgers and fries?\" Duncan was tempted to throw them at him but refrained because he wasn't going to lower himself down to that level. That and Alejandro would make him pay for it later probably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just catching a second wind here,\" Duncan said trying to calm his unhappy stomach. He dipped the buns in his drink and Alejandro looked at him curiously. <br>\r\n\"They go down easier if wet,\" Duncan explained and Alejandro shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever. It doesn't really matter what method you use as long as in the end, everything is gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he managed to finally restrain the urge to puke, he took a bite and moaned in delight at the taste. No matter how evil Alejandro was, at least he got good food. He might actually be able to do this! Maybe anyways. Taking a few more bites, he took a sip of his drink. \"Thank god for Dr. Pepper,\" Duncan murmured as he continued. Dr. Pepper made everything better. Already the pain in his belly was receding to the background of his mind as he munched on his hamburgers and absently scratched his belly at the other end. Alejandro maintained the blank pokerface which would have been creepy if Duncan payed any attention to it but he was too busy with his food. Alejandro couldn't but help lift a corner of his mouth when he saw Duncan's  white belly poking out which Duncan paid no mind to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first burger went down pretty easily thanks to the bread trick and Dr. Pepper and how delicious it was but it was definitely harder now with his pants digging in against his stomach. Undoing his skull belt, he paused and undid his pant button at well, sighing as the pressure disappeared. Giving a loud burp, he continued on his task of the next burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely more difficult and he was taking many, many sips of his drink with it while Alejandro seemed to be paying no attention at all, texting on his phone. Bastard. When he finally finished, Duncan was panting a bit rubbing his stomach furiously, trying to ease the pain and keep from throwing up. It was pretty close. Alejandro got up and bent over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help?\" he asked and Duncan really wished he could have spat at him but it hurt too much and Alejandro was amazing at massaging his aching belly. However it felt so amazing that he burped in Alejandro's face. Sadly, he was more amused rather than disgusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot darling. Still have room for more though so get to it,\" he said nodding at the remaining drink and fries. Duncan flipped him off which did nothing but cause Alejandro to laugh again and left Duncan frustrated that almost nothing bothered that guy. Grunting, Duncan steeled himself for the next part and stuffed his face with fries as fast as he could, barely chewing and stuffing more in. If he left his mouth empty for even a second, he knew he would be unable to finish and he was not going to let that happen. Sooner than he thought, the fries were gone and grinning (or rather, grimacing) in victory, he chugged the rest of the drink which was mainly empty from his frequent sipping earlier, and slammed it down for emphasis letting out a massive belch that caused people to turn and look at them and finally knocked Alejandro out of that calm emotionless appearance, looking rather turned on and surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrpppppppp, ah yeah, I win.\" Duncan said, thumping his chest. Alejandro gave a shaky nod before going into sexy overconfident. <br>\r\n\"True but you still have many more before you even coming close to the war, And trust me, it's not going to be easy.\" Duncan belched again, crossing his arms behind his head and showing his bloated belly, <br>\r\n\"I look forward to it.\" </span></div></div>",

The mohawked teen signed and just rubbed his stuffed belly, letting the car ride soothe him, \"So where are we going now?  Out to stuff me to the point of bursting again?\"  Al chuckled, \"Nonsense.  You're obviously to full for that, so I'm taking you back to your house to rest that full stomach of yours.\" He said, patting Duncan's bloated belly.  Duncan rolled his eyes and kept to himself the rest of the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl dropped Duncan off at his house and drove off to his new place in town, leaving Duncan alone to drag his tired, stuffed body to the front door.  He fished his keys out of his pocket, opened the front door, dropped his body onto the couch, and passed out.  Hours passed as Duncan slept off his two meals, but he was woken up by a loud knocking at his front door.  He lifted himself off of the couch, stretched, and yawned, before walking over to the door and opening it to see Alejandro, \"Well, you look well rested.  Your face no longer matches that shade of green on your mohawk.\"  Duncan scoffed, \"Yeah, I'm feeling better.  Where are we going next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin spread across Alejandro's face, \"A steak house.  Your dinner meal are going to be VERY large.  Let's hope that little stomach of yours can handle it.\"  Al's eyes traveled down to Duncan's stomach and he grinned, \"Look's like your stomach isn't as little as it was before.\"  Duncan looked down and lifted his up his shirt to see that Al was right.  His once bloated stomach and shrunken down, and he had a very small curve to his abdomen.  His abs were still visible, but were slightly less defined.  Al reached down and pinched a small bit of Duncan's new belly, \"It's actually kind of cute.\"  Duncan swatted his hand away, \"You sure are getting some weird kick out of this, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shrugged and turned around, headed back to his car.  Duncan sighed and followed, his stomach already growling.  He wasn't sure if it was for food or if it was because it knew it was about to go through hell.  The two reached the steak house soon and parked, heading inside.  The interior of the place had an old western theme and the smell of steak and beer filled the air.  Duncan and Al were helped to a booth, where their waitress came over and set down a large basket of buttery dinner rolls.  \"What can I get you two boys?\" She asked, pulling her notebook out of her apron and clicking the end of her pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl leaned forward and smiled, \"I already ate, but my friend here would like The Frontier Special with a Dr. Pepper.\"  Duncan raised an eyebrow, and looked at the waitress, \"What is that exactly?\" he asked.  The waitress finished scribbling down the order and looked at Duncan, \"The Frontier Special is a 12 oz steak, fully loaded baked potato, corn bread, and a 40 oz soda.\"  Duncan's eyes turned towards Al, who had his usual cock smirk on.  The waitress walked away and Al sat back, \"Don't forget, you have to eat everything I get you.  Including that basket of rolls.\"  Duncan frowned at Al, who wasn't kidding when he said that the dinner meal would be big.  Without saying another word, Duncan grabbed the basket of rolls and pulled them closer, shoving the first one into his mouth.  Once he tasted it, he had completely forgotten he was angry at Al.  The rolls were so buttery and sweet that he began to devour them like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smirked the entire time as Duncan stuffed his face with the dinner rolls.  The large basket was empty in a matter of minutes and Duncan pushed it away and grinned at Al, \"I can handle this.\"  Al chuckled, \"Really?  Cause your order is here.\"  The waitress set the large plate down in front of Duncan, along with his massive soda and another basket of rolls.  Duncan stared down at the plate in front of him, a little intimidated.  The steak was large and took up half of the plate, the other half covered up by the baked potato, which had butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon bits on it.  Duncan lifted up his fork and knife and cut into the first bite of steak, putting it in his mouth and quickly began chewing the tender meat.</span></div></div>",

It had come at a price however, by the time he'd finished the steak his belt had snapped clean off, being stretched to the limit by his overstuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro had been watching him this whole time but was still completely astonished. He never realised just how driven Duncan really was, let alone how big his apetite could go. Snapping out of his daze he got up and helped lift his large friend out of his chair. He kept an arm around him as they walked slowly out to Al's car, and he couldn't help but sink his fingers into Duncan's soft flesh while the poor guy was still out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half an hour later and the two had arrived back at Duncan's house. Duncan was still deep in his food coma so Alejandro had no choice but to carry him up to his bed, bridal style. Even for a strong guy Al felt a little winded by the time he'd put Duncan to bed. 'He's really letting himself go...'  By this point Alejandro made a rather risky decision:</span></div></div>",

However, it wasn't in Duncan's nature to let anything go without trying, Carpe diem and all that. However, the meal was simply too big right now and he'd never eaten so much food in his life in a single day before. He used to consider himself a fairly big eater but man after only a single day, that idea had been pretty much blown to shreds. Maybe a big eater compared to the average person but by no way and means truly a big eater like those mass monsters or even the slighter yet still hungry as heck dudes that one wonders exactly where the food goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd truly, he got farther than he thought. He finished those bread rolls (both baskets) which were oh so good and yummy and delicious. And he ate about a third of the meat and made a decent dent in those mashed potatoes and drink before finally throwing in the towel (again unfortunately) for the day with his again stuffed and bloated belly. Alejandro chuckled in sympathy as he moved over again and started again rubbing Duncan's poor belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know it hurts. But consider it a pretest. By the next time you do this, you'll easily do this and possibly still be hungry afterwards. Won't that be fun?\" Duncan nearly shuddered by the thought of how big he would probably have to be in order to do that easily but admitted it did sound kind of fun if he could do it. \"It's only your first day and you're well on your way to becoming sexy.\" Duncan blinked his eyes blearily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er-what was that last part?\" he asked and for a second he thought he saw Alejandro blush. <br>\r\n\"N-nothing! Just considering what torture I'm going to put you through tomorrow.\" Duncan burped a bit as he struggled to his feet, looking down at his again exposed growing belly. 'This shirt isn't going to fit much longer,' he thought as he struggled to again pull it down but kept riding up. Alejandro helped him to the car as he was a bit too full for much activity right now and Duncan was fairly sure there were many who were staring at them as they went by, or rather at his again bloated belly. Alejandro pinched his belly all of a sudden and grinned cheekily at Duncan's glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and big,\" he said and wasn't that such an obvious statement? Alejandro took him back to Duncan's house and helped him to the couch where Duncan once again parked himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow,\" Alejandro said tipping his head and back out the door he went. Duncan just vegetated for a while, taking a quick nap when all of a sudden the doorbell rang. Confused, Duncan got up and stretched with a big yawn and shuffled to the door and opened it, ready to give whoever it was a big piece of mind. He was shocked when he saw Geoff at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geoff, wha-\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Duncan, I'm here to help you with your problem. Did you forget or something?\" </span></div></div>",

He'd been asleep for a good four hours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan reached down and grabbed the bottom of his shirt, lifting it up over his stomach.  It was still bloated and digesting, but it wasn't as hard as it was before.  <br>\r\nGeoff looked down and chuckled, \"Wow, D.

You ready?\"  Duncan rubbed his and thought about it.  His hand drifted down to his bloated belly and pressed against it.

I'm still pretty stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help with that.\"  Geoff said as he took Duncan by the shoulders and lead him to the couch.  He had Duncan lay down and Geoff sat the other end.  The party boy cracked his knuckles before pressing both of his large hands on Duncan's bloated stomach and rubbing it in slow circles.  Duncan was so surprised at how good Geoff was at this that he let out a low groan before belching loudly.  Geoff chuckled and the two talked for a good ten minutes while Geoff rubbed Duncan's stomach to help his digestion.  Duncan sat up and grunted, \"Thanks, Man.  I'm feeling a lot better now.

They get bigger through use. You getting me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of. Although I'm really not following where you're going with this. I know the stomach will get bigger, trust me on that it's not as fun, but...where are you going with this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're stretching your eating capacity so you'll be able to eat more, more often, and even when you think you can't go on any more. Like building your pectorals with hard work.\" <br>\r\n\"Have you done this before? Because you seem to be knowing a lot\" Duncan asked. Geoff turned a bit shifty, looking away and changed the subject. <br>\r\n\"I thought about it-now lets go on,\" he rushed out somewhat uncharacteristically and Duncan wanted to probe him but Geoff would probably bolt and leave him to Al's (fairly non for the most part)existant mercy alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Alejandro seems to be doing is bombardment and throwing you in the deep end right away. Of course, he himself has nothing to lose doing this so it's okay for him but man, it's going to be hard for you. No practice except his harsh learning curve and you'll probably be stuffed to near capacity everytime very heavily which unfortunately will have to continue. But what I'm going to do is help build endurance and make you enjoy being this full with classical conditioning so the pain will hurt less and less.\" Duncan just stared at Geoff, blown off his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what have you done to Geoff? Those are a lot of sentences, words, and classical conditioning? I didn't even know such a thing existed,\" Geoff broke into a grin and tapped his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so stupid D-man, I've been practicing. It makes me sound so much smarter doesn't it when you use words like those?\" and just like that, Geoff was goofy Geoff again. <br>\r\n\"Kay, so let's get started. Take off your clothes.\" Duncan just stared at him again, shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean your shirt and pants, not your underwear because that would be just inappropiate right now, but I mean it is always easier and more comfortable to do this in just your underwear. And honestly, your shirt is approaching done for at this point and too small to cover anything anyways and just would get in the way. Hell, it was small on you before you started this so now it's getting silly.\" Geoff did have a point. Even with his relaxed stomach, it still wouldn't go down all the way, showing off his softening middle. It looked less bad removing it than it did with it squeezing against him like that. Geoff reached over and undid the belt taking it as Duncan unzipped and took off his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would probably stop wearing this. The way you're going to be stuffed all the time is going to make this redundant and only cause pain for wearing unless you like the thought of having to undo it all the time or something. Whatever floats your boat but it isn't necessary. By the way, nice choice of underwear, I have some just like those,\" Geoff said nodding at Duncan's striped boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you're going to eat as much as you can take of this pizza. Any amount is fine but you really have to try. Any leftover could be used as extras for later but for right now, just focus on eating as much pizza as you can take. I am going to help you do this in whatever way you want or if you don't know, I'll choose. But against Al, you need to get used to being constantly stuffed and not feel ill. He is not going to play easy or very fair so you're going to need to be able to have this stretched capacity which is only going to happen if you eat all the time. And yes, it sounds contradictory and painful. You'll probably hate this soon enough as it does hurt although it will hurt less for when Alejandro tries to pull fast ones on you. Your body will constantly need to be bloated with food, kind of like a body builder which we're also going to have to work on if you want to win this bet but more importantly to even be mobile after all this is over. And eventually, despite all this extra food, you'll still be hungry and enjoy it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff came and sat down on the couch, next to Duncan and opened the box letting the smell of cheese pizza peforate the room and Duncan's belly begin to growl a little. Geoff smiled a bit. <br>\r\n\"See? You're hungry already as you become used to eating. Alejandro is kind of follwing a similar principle but definitely meaner and continually adds more for his enjoyment of making you intake it twice or multiple times. Now start eating.\" Duncan relaxed on the couch on the couch eating pizza, enjoying the dripping and hot cheese as he and Geoff talked about random things and topics jumped all over the place and sometimes became encouragement and admiration of what Duncan was doing. Whenever the last of a slice disappeared, Geoff thrust another into his hand. Geoff even occasionally massaged Duncan's belly and easing the pressure that was building as Duncan belched. Soon enough, the sensation of fullness came back and Duncan slowed although Geoff massaged and talked him into a few more pieces that Geoff generously fed him bit by bit by hand. When all was said and done, about 2/3 of the pizza sat resting in Duncan's belly. Duncan belched again and rubbed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-uuuuurrrrrrrppppp, ah, that feels so much better. You're right Geoff, the pain has gone down a bit. Yeah, it's still there, quite horribly, but earlier I would have probably puked and that was definitely more pizza than I thought I could have. But damn, I feel so friggen huge,\" Duncan said as he poked the once again the bloated belly that didn't even have a hint of his abs anymore and jiggled it slightly although it didn't move much from content in it.\" Geoff moved behind him and massaged again as Duncan leaned back tiredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, so tired. I am going to hate breakfast tomorrow. But thanks for doing this. You're like a life-saver as I would hate to do this unaided against the plotting mastermind that is Alejandro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem dude. That's what friends are for.\"<br>\r\n\"If there was any way I could repay you...\" <br>\r\n\"Speak no more of it right now, we'll talk later. But if you feel tired, you should sleep. I'm not going anywhere until you are.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Duncan said yawning and closed his eyes, dead asleep and didn't even feel the removal of Geoff's hands as he took the remaining pizza with him and drove off. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duncan was enjoying a nice quiet slumber on the couch when all of the sudden his phone went on full blast, startling the gaining punk and making him fall off of the couch.  Duncan sat up and pressed the answer button, holding it up to his phone, \"Hello?\" he asked, irritated.<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Duncan.  Is that the kind of tone you should be taking with the man who's feeding you?\"  Alejandro said in his usual cocky tone.  <br>\r\n\"Oh... what's up?\"  Duncan asked, lifting himself back onto the couch.<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way over and I wanted to make sure you were ready for your big breakfast today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan blinked the sleep out of his eyes, \"Lemme jump in the shower first, okay?\"  <br>\r\n\"I'm almost there so make it fast.\"  Al said before he hung up the call.  Duncan lifted himself up and walked into the bathroom, flicking the light on.  Once his eyes adjusted to the lights, Duncan saw himself in the mirror and looked himself over.  He was still fairly fit, his chest and arms retaining the muscle definition he's always loved, but his abs were almost completely gone now.  His stomach curved out now, a little tiny bit past his pecs(which weren't as big as say, Geoff's or DJ's) and when he smacked it, it jiggled.  Duncan liked the thick, manly sound it made, and he squeezed his new belly fat, enjoying the way it jiggled.  He remembered what Geoff had said the last night about how Duncan was going to have to start working out his muscles along with his gaining.  Duncan instantly started thinking about all of the super beefy athletes who were super muscular, but also had some serious fat on them.  Duncan liked the idea of getting like that, \"Maybe this gaining thing isn't gonna be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan showered fast, leaving his mohawk flat today, and quickly brushed his teeth to get rid of the pizza smell.  He didn't want to take the chance of Al finding out about Geoff's training him.  Once he made sure his breath was minty fresh, Duncan put a piece of gum in his mouth, just to be safe, and went to go get dressed.  Duncan groaned as he looked over his t-shirts.  Not a SINGLE shirt was big enough to fit comfortably over his new belly.  Duncan sighed as he pulled a shirt over, which clung tightly to his stomach, and threw on his shorts and sneakers just in time.  Al was honking his car horn from outside.  Duncan hurried out and sat down in Al's passenger seat, \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiled and leaned over, rubbing Duncan's new belly, \"Hey, <i>Gordito</i>.  That shirt sure is looking tight on your new belly.\"<br>\r\nDuncan raised his eyebrow, \"What the hell does <i>'Gordito'</i> mean?\"<br>\r\nAl smirked as he pulled out of the driveway, \"Chubby.  It's my new nickname for you.  Now, since you weren't able to finish the breakfast that I had ordered you yesterday, we're going back today to see if you can finish it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Al were seated at a booth and Al ordered the same special that he had gotten Duncan yesterday: 4 pancakes with a side of sausage, bacon, and eggs.  The order came quickly and Al put his hands behind his head and smiled, \"Eat up, <i>Gordito</i>.  You've got a big day ahead of you.\"  Duncan picked up his fork and knife and dug in, hoping that the training from last night works.</span></div></div>",

Alejandro was very surprised at this turn of events. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked concerned. \"I mean, you ate less than you did yesterday of this. You aren't sick or something are you?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not really,\" Duncan said, rubbing his aching belly. \"Just full from yesterday,\" he said and added 'and full of pizza from training with Geoff' in his mind. Yeah he was f-ing full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" Alejandro said shrugging. \"You'll get used to such large amounts of food eventually so that it wouldn't even be a struggle to get something like this down\" Duncan was amused by how similar that sounded to some things Geoff said. Alejandro turned back his usual cocky irritating self. \"Failed. So we're going to do this again at a later time. So having some time to kill while we wait for your belly to digest enough to be good to go for lunch, what do you want to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alejandro,\" Duncan asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes gorditio?\" Alejandro said amused and a smile playing on his mouth and Duncan gritted his teeth a bit. <br>\r\n\"Two things I need to know. Do you even eat? I have yet to see you eat once since we started this. And also, I was thinking to help get get the food to serve a better purpose that I would be allowed to work out and lift weights and stuff which will keep me in shape and also burn off energy for more eating. I'd still be beefing up quite a bit but in a sexier more manly and attractive way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro looked thoughtful for a moment as he glanced Duncan up and down although Duncan wasn't sure what it was Alejandro was thinking. Then Alejandro smiled hugely and he nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing buddy!\" he said punching Duncan's arm jovially. \"As I said, whatever method you want to use to do this is allowed as long as you eat everything and you don't actively try to lose weight for at least 6 months, probably more. So no cardio and running, heavy weights only but otherwise yeah, it's fine! And honestly, you'd look phenonomenal as a big and beefy powerlifter, so you have no complaints from me if that's what you want to do.\" Duncan smiled in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good. I was worried you were trying to turn me into an out of shape fat slob who didn't do much of anything.\" Alejandro looked shocked. <br>\r\n\"You? Never! Not an immobile lazy slob. Possibly fat and lazy, but not immobile. I'd have staged an intervention before we got to that point.\" <br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this anyways? What's in it for you? Duncan asked curious.\" Alejandro gave a mysterious grin and chuckle. <br>\r\n\"Na-ah. That's a secret you have to earn. Just know I am only having your best interests in mind.\" <br>\r\n\"Clearly,\" Duncan said sarcastically and Alejandro laughed as he reached out and patted Duncan's bloated belly. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry amigo, you are perfectly safe. I am a man of my word and honor, much as you are.\" <br>\r\n\"But for my other question, why do you never eat around me?\" Duncan asked curious. <br>\r\n\"Oh, that's to prevent me from unintended consequences of doing this with you.\" <br>\r\n\"Consequences?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Many people who work at feeding others tend to be fat or start becoming so while working at such good food. If you were eating at the same time, you'd eat the same thing as your partner and not only that, would try to match them or forget just exactly how much you've eaten.\" Duncan smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're worried about gaining weight with me as well because you don't trust yourself to not give into temptation.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much.\" Alejandro said. <br>\r\n\"Coward. It's fine for me to be stuffed like a hog but not you.\" Duncan said bitterly. <br>\r\n\"No, I'm not a coward. Just smart. And you look good with the extra weight, I always did think you were a bit too skinny.\" Alejandro wrapped his arms around Duncan. <br>\r\n\"Amigo...Duncan...never forget I mean the best for you, always.\" Stunned, Duncan watched as Alejandro straightend up and his face changed again. Alejandro gave Duncan's belly a big slap and Duncan burped as it jiggled the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot. Well, let's get going. We have a lot of work to do. I'm going to go drop you off at the gym for you to do your weight exercises, and remember only such and no cardio, while I do some errands and prepare for later. We're going to have so much fun you and me and it's only just getting started. </span></div></div>",

We're gonna skip lunch today and go straight into a BIG dinner.\"  Al reached over and rubbed Duncan's belly, patting it a few times before putting his hands back on the wheel, \"You have fun beefing up, Amigo.\"<br>\r\nOnce Al was out of sight, Duncan pulled his phone out of his pocket and and punched in a quick number.  He let it ring a few times before he heard the other end pick up, \"Geoff?  Hey, it's Duncan.  Can you meet me at the gym?  I wanna start these workouts now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"97... 98... 99... 100!\"  Geoff called out as Duncan lifted worked at the bench press.  Duncan put the heavy weights back on their holster and sat up, wiping sweat from his forehead.  Geoff walked away from the bench press and towards the dumbbells, \"So, lemme get this straight.  Al doesn't eat around you when he's stuffing you like crazy, cause he's afraid he'll get fat?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  Duncan said, picking up two 50 pound weights and started working on his arms, \"He said that I would look good with extra weight on.  I think that he thinks that he doesn't have the body type to work a gut.\"<br>\r\nGeoff laughed, picking up a set of 75 pound dumbbells and working the same as Duncan, \"Probably.  I have to agree with Al, though.  Ever since you started putting on weight, you've been looking better.  You're belly is small, but all these workouts are gonna make you massive, D-Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Duncan an idea, \"Hey, Geoff.  Since you're helping me train to eat more, maybe you can help me build muscle mass too?\"<br>\r\nGeoff grinned, \"Sure thing, dude!!  You wanna do that eating training again tonight?\"<br>\r\nDuncan kept working out as he thought, \"We'll see about it.  Al said he has a \"BIG dinner\" planned for me tonight.  I'll call and let you know after.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, thing, dude.\"  Geoff set his weights down and walked over to Duncan, who out his weights down also.  Geoff squeezed Duncan's bicep with his large hand, \"Damn, dude.  I can already feel these getting bigger.\"<br>\r\nDuncan flexes, \"You think so?\"  He looked himself over in the large mirror on the wall; his stomach was stretched out farther than his pecs, but Duncan knew that would soon change, \"I think I wanna go do more bench presses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Geoff spent the rest of the evening working out, taking short breaks through out to get their stamina back.  When Duncan's phone went off, he recognized Al's ring tone, \"Looks like Al's here.  I better go.  I'll call you and tell you if we're still on for training.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, dude!!  I'll be here!!\"  Geoff called as Duncan headed out.  Duncan tossed his bag into Al's back seat and plopped into the passenger seat, \"Hey, Al.\"  Duncan noticed Al wasn't talking, which was odd since it was Al, \"You okay?\"<br>\r\nAl had this look of surprise on his face, \"Wow Amigo...  You look bigger already!\"  Al reached over and squeezed Duncan's bicep, before doing the same to his pecs, \"Oh, yeah.  You're definitely bigger.\"  Al reached down and squeezed Duncan's belly, which was soft now that he had digested all of his food \"We're gonna make this little thing bigger, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan chuckled, flexing his arm, \"Thanks, man.\"  Al pulled out of the parking lot and to Duncan's house, waiting in the car while he showered and changed clothes.  Duncan came back out wearing, once again, a shirt that clung to his new frame.  The shirt stretched tight over Duncan's pudgy belly and was snug across his slightly bigger chest and arms.  Once he sat back down, he and Al headed out to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Man the temperature really dropped and looked like it was going to rain soon. Alejandro wrapped his arm around him and Duncan snuggled against him, glad for his warm body although he'd smack anyone who'd suggest that to him. Duncan DID NOT cuddle thank you very much! Alejandro chuckled lowly so that Duncan did not hear him as he was well aware of Duncan's distaste of anyone thinking he was soft despite Duncan being an internal marshmallow despite his bad-assnessitude as Duncan called it. He drew Duncan closer and slid his hand down to that soft growing man gut he was assisting to grow and rubbed it. It was very nice and suited Duncan well along with those sexy muscles. He couldn't wait until he was even bigger and beefier which Duncan would be incredible at and much better than that skinny frame. Playing with Duncan's vanity and ideal concept of him being macho was a bit underhanded but it would teach Duncan a lesson as well and the results...the results were so worth it. Grinning he subtly rubbed Duncan's belly and muscle while Duncan was focused on the warmth Alejandro seemed to exude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a place that I found by accident and surprisingly few people know about it which is a good thing. It's one of those all you can eat places where you can get as much as you want.\" <br>\r\n\"You mean a buffet? And it looks kind of dirty and suspicious.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, that also tends to detract from people going in most likely but you should see the inside.\" Alejandro and Duncan walked into a somewhat drab waiting room and Duncan raised his eyebrows at Alejandro and he just smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, just wait for it.\" Alejandro went up and paid the $10 a person entry fee and conversed with the bored looking cashier over who knew what. Duncan looked around at the dirty wallpaper and crooked paintings and sad looking potted plant in the corner. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is the right place?\" Duncan asked Alejandro when he came back with their tickets. \"I don't mean to be a judger and all but this place seems a bit fishy to be a buffet. Are you sure this is safe or I don\u2019t know, healthy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ye of little faith, I would not risk you or your health if I thought the food here was in the slightest bit dangerous for consumption or this place suspicious. Just come inside and take a look.\u201d Alejandro led Duncan through a side door and what Duncan saw on the other side made him stop and gape in surprise. The interior of this room was way different than the outside or its surroundings. He felt like they were transported into a different dimension or something as it was a huge spacious room dimly lit for ambience and subtle mood, portraits and pictures covering the wall and statues and plates of armor lining the perimeter. It looked like a medieval castle banquet hall complete with said banquet and Duncan was stunned at the amount of food on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly fu-er crap,\u201d Duncan breathed. \u201cNo f-ing way.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWay dude,\u201d Alejandro said smugly.<br>\r\n\u201cHow on Earth did you discover this place again?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy a mixture of accident and information obtained by network. Trust me, I was surprised as you. Very few people know of this place\u2019s existence. But you must promise to not tell anyone that you wouldn\u2019t trust with your life. Possibly not even then.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re going to find and kill you?\u201d joked Duncan and felt a chill when Alejandro\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. <br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that. It\u2019s very\u2026select clientele sworn to discretion and secrecy.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of food for a place that has such a small number of customers,\u201d Duncan said. Indeed, there was only one other couple there in the whole spacious hall and the amounts on the banquet said it could feed hundreds, easily.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the food does get reused elsewhere. This is just its first stop. It often will go to other restaurants and charities or elsewhere. But anyways, let\u2019s dig in.\u201d Duncan was surprised. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re eating too? I thought you weren\u2019t going to.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s this place and I have my own way of getting rid of what I don\u2019t eat,\u201d Alejandro said pointedly looking at Duncan\u2019s gut. Duncan rolled his eyes but was strangely a bit flattered. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s just do this already,\u201d Duncan said as he headed up to the long tables that held all the food, Alejandro following behind him. <br>\r\n\u201cHow is this going to work?\u201d Duncan asked and Alejandro smirked. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what you\u2019re going to eat. How bout we start with those mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, biscuits, rice, pork, bread\u2026\u201d said Alejandro as he loaded up <br>\r\nDuncan\u2019s serving plate which was quite a lot as the plates they used here had to be twice the size of regular plates. <br>\r\n\u201cand we could come back for some spaghetti, ham, chocolate cake\u2026\u201d Duncan was both looking forward to and dreading this as not only did he have to eat his plate, probably a lot of Alejandro\u2019s who had gone on and filled his plate as well, winking at him, as well as dessert\u2026ugh, this wasn\u2019t going to be good for his stomach. Alejandro was grinning and smiling at him and Duncan gave a weak smile back as Alejandro poked his belly.<br>\r\n\u201cYep, we\u2019re going to feed this little thing till it aint so little anymore,\u201d and Duncan felt his belly growl in agreement with that. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Al finished loading up both of their plates, the two sat down.  Duncan didn't know what he was going to do.  This is three times the amount of food that Al had ever tried to feed him.  Al smiled at Duncan and he picked up his fork, \"Eat up, Gordito.\"  Duncan picked up his fork and took a deep breath, preparing himself before diving in.  Duncan started with the large portion of mashed potatoes, knowing how good they were for bulking up.  He finished the potatoes fast, shoveling in the Mac and Cheese quickly as well.  Duncan stopped for a second, taking a large drink from his soda, before quickly eating a biscuit or three.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan slowed down after the biscuits, realizing how fast he was eating and how sick he'd feel later for eating like that.  The mohawked teen went back to eating after catching his breath, finishing off his last few biscuits before eating the rice and pork.  Duncan sighed happily and leaned back in his seat, the very bottom of his belly poking out from under his shirt, \"Done.  What next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiled as he pushed his plate towards Duncan.  Though Al had eaten a considerable amount, and was very full, it looked like he hadn't put a dent in the plate.  Large portions of fettuccine alfredo, fried chicken, biscuits, and of course, mashed potatoes, over flowed the plate, \"Here.  I'm too full to finish this.  Can you finish it for me?\"<br>\r\nDuncan raised his eyebrow, \"What happened to eating with me?\"<br>\r\nAl scoffed, \"I just did.  I'm too full to finish.  Can you finish this or not?\"<br>\r\nDuncan smirked.  He had expected this the entire time, and picked up his plate, \"You bet I can.\"  Just like before, Duncan started out by shoveling down the mashed potatoes and biscuits, before moving on to the fettuccine alfredo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl grinned, \"I guess letting you rest and work out was the best way to go.  You have such a big appetite now.\"  Duncan didn't hear him, which have Al an idea.  He stood up and walked back towards the food, filling another plate up for Duncan.  When he returned, Duncan was relaxing in his seat, rubbing his bloated stomach, \"Awww, look who's full.\"  Al said as he patted Duncan's gut, \"Only two more plates, okay, Gordito?\"  Al set a plate down in front of Duncan, who was surprised by it.  It was nothing but a large mountain of mashed potatoes, \"I know how much you love these, so eat up.  Once you finish this, you can have dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan looked up at Al, \"Are you trying to make me explode or something?  This is way too much now.\"<br>\r\nAl shook his head, \"Not for you, big guy.  Once you finish this and desert, I'll drive you home and let you sleep it all off.\"<br>\r\nDuncan sighed, \"Fine.\"  He picked up his fork and dug into the large pile of mashed spuds, but he was moving much slower now.  Even though he slowed down earlier, he was still going to fast, and now he was full.  But he knew that Al would make him eat all of this again, so he sucked it up and kept going, despite the painful feeling in his bloated belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good 15 minutes of slow eating, the plate was clean, and Al grinned, \"Good job.  I knew you had it in you.  Now, for dessert.\"  Al pushed a large slice of chocolate cake to Duncan, who stared at it like it was the most evil thing in the world.  Duncan re-adjusted his seating and unbuttoned his pants, sighing at the feeling of relief.  Once he was ready, Duncan consumed the slice, finally falling back into his seat and groaning, frosting on his cheeks.  Al chuckled as he sat next to Duncan and wiped the chocolate off his cheek with his finger, licking it off, \"Delicious.  Now, lets get you home so we can get you some rest, big guy.\"  Al helped a bloated Duncan back to the car and drove him home.  Neither talked, but Al rubbed his belly with his right hand the entire way while he drove.  He helped Duncan into his room and laid him down on his bed, \"You rest up, okay, Gordito?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan adjusted himself slightly, \"Uuuugh... yeah.  I wi- UUUUURP... will.\"  Duncan rubbed his bloated stomach as Al left, and once he heard the front door lock, he pulled his phone out and called up Geoff, \"Hey, Geoff.  Do you think you can come over?  I'm super stuffed and in need of some relief.. you will?  Okay.  Just use the house key I gave you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes went by and Geoff came into Duncan's room, \"WOW.  When Al said he had a big dinner planned, he wasn't kidding.\"  Geoff sat down on Duncan's bed carefully so he doesn't upset his stomach and began to rub it for him, his fingers working like magic.<br>\r\nDuncan groaned, \"Man, dude.  You're the best best friend ever.\"<br>\r\nGeoff laughed, \"Don't mention it.  Now just relax.  I'll be here for as long as you need.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Geoff rubbed Duncan\u2019s belly comfortingly as Duncan moaned in pleasure and pain of his way overstuffed belly that kept rumbling ominously, but not in hunger. Geoff was upset and impressed with Alejandro and Duncan because he was surprised Duncan managed to eat that much and Alejandro forcefully threatened, bribed, whatever it down. Geoff was sketchy on the details and Duncan wasn\u2019t spilling as he was \u2018sworn to secrecy\u2019 or something. Geoff moved over besides Duncan, continuing his ministrations as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD, you don\u2019t have to do this you know. This whole thing with Alejandro\u2026isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019m sure Alejandro would understand if you backed out and at times like this, it seems like it\u2019s going a bit too far. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s trying to get you bigger or cause you to explode from overeating but are you sure you want to continue with this?\u201d <br>\r\nDuncan nodded. \u201cI gave my word and I don\u2019t ever back down from a challenge nor am I planning to from a bit of mild discomfort-\u201d Duncan groaned and let out a long belch and Geoff rolled his eyes a bit, \u201cor let him intimidate me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is it so important to prove your awesomeness to him? The fact you even agreed and started this should be proof enough.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just do, I can\u2019t really find the words to explain.\u201d Geoff shrugged. Duncan was so stubborn when he wanted to be which was both admirable and irritating as heck at the same time. It was one of his many charming qualities, as Duncan would put it. Geoff massaged a bit harder and Duncan stopped talking and turned back into sounds of pleasure. Sometimes Geoff did not entirely get his friend and had to wonder about his friend\u2019s sanity at times, like that time he dated that Courtney chick. At least this was somewhat saner and reasonable compared to that. Also, Duncan was certainly putting on the weight and beefing up which was actually pretty hot and despite Al\u2019s almost cruel methods of doing so, it certainly had results. Although Geoff would never tell Duncan this and respected him to much too, Duncan had been a bit scary skinny earlier and had Geoff not seen him eat (which was actually pretty much nothing compared to now!) he would have suspected the punk of being anorexic. Whatever Geoff felt about Alejandro and he wasn\u2019t entirely sure, he admired Alejandro\u2019s resolve and ingenuity at this. That and Geoff got to touch Duncan\u2019s bloated belly, feeling how stuffed it was and listen to it rumble and getting to massage it and give pleasure to Duncan as well\u2026well, it was all good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Geoff saw that Duncan was by now pretty much asleep and although Geoff knew he should go, he just wanted to stay. His mind was made up when Duncan started to twitch and groan in his sleep, either from dreams or indigestion and Geoff laid right back down beside him. Lifting up one of Duncan\u2019s arms, he laid his head next to the punk\u2019s and wrapped his arms in a hug around Duncan and grinned as the breathing slowed into a more natural rhythm. They slept peacefully like that for quite a while until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan\u2019s cellphone started playing a tune that was familiar as his own and Geoff\u2019s. It was Alejandro, checking to see what was up. Duncan\u2019s eyes sprang open instantly as he reach out and picked up the phone from the side table. <br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Duncan said nervously, looking down to see Geoff still asleep, cuddled besides him. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, how\u2019s my big gordito? I just wanted to see how you were doing and if you were feeling any better and stuff.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, I\u2019m feeling pretty great actually,\u201d Duncan said as he carefully picked up Geoff\u2019s heavy arm and tried to move it off but it just went back around him as soon as he did. Darn it Geoff, let go!<br>\r\n\u201cOh good. I\u2019m coming over in a few minutes because I\u2019m eager to see you.\u201d Duncan cursed in his head although some might have slipped out when Alejandro said \u201cwhat was that? I didn\u2019t quite catch that.\u201d Duncan panicking tried to kick Geoff off him who was still asleep. \u2018Damn, why is he such a heavy sleeper?\u2019 thought Duncan as Geoff refused to let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, how long until you get here?\u201d Duncan asked, his voice shaking a little as he tried to again push off Geoff\u2019s arm around him. <br>\r\n\u201cAbout 10 minutes. I can\u2019t wait to see you love,\u201d Alejandro said, almost cooing although Duncan was too busy trying to silently yank Geoff off to hear that part. There was a click as Alejandro hung up and Duncan breathed a sigh of relief before again panicking when he realized Geoff was still asleep and refusing to move from letting go of Duncan. Suddenly, Duncan was struck with inspiration on how to wake up the party boy. Grinning, he moved besides Geoff\u2019s earlobe and gently brushed some of the luscious blonde hair aside. Then taking a deep breath, Duncan paused and then yelled as loudly as he could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019VE GOT ICE-CREAM!\u201d startling Geoff so much Geoff slammed his arm back against Duncan\u2019s nose as he looked for ice-cream. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the ice-cream?\u201d he asked, sounding confused and Duncan glared, feeling his nose to make sure it wasn\u2019t broken. <br>\r\n\u201cThere is no ice-cream, although you did hit me,\u201d complained Duncan rubbing it. Geoff reached over to help but froze when Duncan glared. \u201cAt least it isn\u2019t broken or whatever, ow. What are you still doing here?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI stayed with you through the night,\u201d Geoff said and Duncan gave a grin before remembering the trouble that was coming. <br>\r\n\u201cUh, Geoff, Alejandro is coming and\u2026\u201d they both fell silent as a car parked outside and a knock came at that door and then the door opened and there was footsteps coming up the stairs and the door was suddenly thrown open and-<br>\r\n\u201cHey amigo! I was just thinking of and wanting to see you so I-\u201d Alejandro stopped and stared in surprise. He looked from Duncan to Geoff and back to Duncan. <br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Alejandro asked completely, utterly stunned. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duncan decides to tell the truth because he knew it had to have come out at some point eventually since secrets didn\u2019t stay secret long, he just hadn\u2019t expected it to be so soon and of course at such an awkward moment. He also didn\u2019t want to lie since he, rather strangely, felt guilty and he doubted if he could lie to Alejandro anyways since Alejandro was scary good at reading people and when they\u2019re lying and caught Duncan numerous times before when he lied. He just had to hope Alejandro wasn\u2019t mad or going to take it out on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlejandro, this is my buddy Geoff and he\u2019s been helping me train for your challenges a bit,\u201d Duncan stated nervously and waited for the yelling or beatdown or whatever to begin. A few moments passed and Duncan looked up at Alejandro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d Duncan asked Alejandro and was utterly confused when Alejandro let out a little chuckle which seemed uncalled for. <br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, I did\u201d Alejandro said, laughing again although the corners of his mouth tightened and his eyes seemed to blaze at Geoff causing him to scoot back a bit since the way Alejandro was looking at him, not only would he be dead but there\u2019d be bloody nothing left of him. Alejandro\u2019s glare intensified when he saw Geoff and Duncan shirtless and Geoff cringed back more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is just for the challenges, right?\u201d Alejandro asked, locking his eyes back with Duncan\u2019s. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is all. He is just helping me through the hell you put me through.\u201d Duncan snapped back and Alejandro winced a bit. Okay, he deserved that a bit. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, you guys aren\u2019t together?\u201d Alejandro asked and Duncan shook his head. <br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, and even if we were, it isn\u2019t any of your business.\u201d Alejandro ignored the pang that went through him at that and just focused on the relief on hearing they weren\u2019t together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d Alejandro said, startling them all and Duncan looked at him in shock. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Duncan asked, scarcely believing that Alejandro was just fine with this and truthfully, Alejandro was a bit as well that he just said so. Going with it, Alejandro settled on a shrug of the shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure, it\u2019s cool. I mean if you guys aren\u2019t together and as long as you still play by the rules of our agreement, it\u2019s all good. I did say that you could use whatever means you wanted to use within the parameters was fine and a training partner is totally okay as long as you eat my stuff as well and as long as I can watch you guys.\u201d Duncan was shocked, having expected Alejandro to freak out a lot more over this than he was and Geoff was as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind me helping?\u201d Geoff asked and Alejandro shrugged. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, not at all, it\u2019s cool dude. Just don\u2019t touch Duncan outside of it and I won\u2019t rip your balls off and mail them to you.\u201d Alejandro said with a straight face and Geoff blanched. Duncan was shocked and he grabbed Alejandro. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare threaten my friend,\u201d Duncan said, breathing hard. Alejandro looked down into Duncan\u2019s eyes for a moment and then shrugged again. <br>\r\n\u201cAs you want. So, what is his main purpose?\u201d Duncan blushed a bit and looked at Geoff and Geoff replied fearfully. <br>\r\n\u201cWell I rub and take care of Duncan\u2019s stuffed stomach and make it feel good,\u201d Geoff said, wincing as he expected a blow to come. Instead, Alejandro looked at Duncan and he looked at Geoff. Alejandro sighed, shaking his head. <br>\r\n\u201cFine, you could still do that and everything else.\u201d Both Geoff and Duncan were shocked at that. <br>\r\n\u201cReally? You don\u2019t mind?\u201d Duncan asked. Alejandro sighed in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know you need comfort and it helps and I am not good at that type of physical touch and even if I did, Geoff does it better since you keep going back to him. But we can make it work. I feed you, you eat, Geoff and I get to take care of you. Sounds reasonable?\u201d Duncan totally happy with this outcome and that Alejandro did not kill someone quickly agrees and Geoff leaned back, watching the two, thinking there was something going on but he couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. He was glad he could still be of assistance to Duncan since something was going on and that way he could watch Alejandro and see just what was up between the two\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Roughly pushing Alejandro against the wall, Geoff bravely glowered at the bigger man as he growled harshly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, talk. What are you doing with my friend?\" Geoff said, gritting his teeth. Alejandro gave him a dark look and then smiled, it not quite reaching his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be careful if I were you. Don't want to have to hurt you, you being Duncan's friend and all. I also promised Duncan I wouldn't. Otherwise, I would beat the crap out of you for doing this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your angle in this? I am a bit confused in that why it matters so much to you. At first it just seems like you're an obnoxious asshole bent on torturing him and the next you act all nice to him and crap. So what's the deal?\" Alejandro looked at Geoff for a moment, and Geoff saw the calculating look as Alejandro figured exactly whether it was worth it hurting him. Apparently deciding that at the time it still wasn't, Alejandro shrugged and a different look came on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never told anyone this but I...\" Alejandro leaned over and whispered it in Geoff's ear. Geoff was startled for a moment. <br>\r\n\"No way, you like Duncan?\" Geoff all but shouted, letting go of Alejandro. Alejandro hissed at him, slapping his hand over Geoff's mouth.<br>\r\n\"Idiot! Don't shout it out like that! I don't want him to know yet.\" It all made sense to Geoff now on Alejandro's obsession with Duncan but there were still things he couldn't seem to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you like Duncan, why are you torturing him like this?\" Geoff asked.<br>\r\n\"I can't really say, he doesn't like me, he's fun to mess with, he's sexy as hell when mad...\" Geoff interrupted Alejandro there. <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get your point. It's so weird to have Duncan my friend described like that, especially by you but you really do like him. I did kinda figure that, or that you really hated him. One or the other. Your way of showing it is a little odd.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I know how to get to him. And you can't deny he looks good.\" <br>\r\n\"It's still weird talking about my friend like this but yeah, Duncan is a good looking dude. I may not be interested him in that way but it's not like I don't see it.\"<br>\r\n\"He looks even better with some meat on his bones, to say the least\" Alejandros said, his mouth quirking a bit. Geoff rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Yes, that too.\"<br>\r\n\"Far too skinny earlier, looked almost unhealthy. But now he's fine with a capital F and only getting better.\" <br>\r\n\"This really is weird talking about this but yes again. I always did think he looked a bit unhealthy and anorexic before.\" <br>\r\n\"Can't say that now.\" Alejandro said with a self-satisfied smile.<br>\r\n\"Nope. But you still suck for putting him through hell\" Geoff said, a bit harsher. <br>\r\n\"I guess. It was a bit extreme. But it was and still is worth it. Besides, he did survive.\" <br>\r\n\"No thanks to you,\" Geoff said crossing his arms. Alejandro shifted a bit guilitly. <br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" <br>\r\n\"It was admittedly a clever plan,\" Geoff said gruffly. \"Knowing as well as I Duncan can never resist a challenge, especially when his manhood is called into question.\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n\"Does he know?\" <br>\r\n\"Know what?\" Alejandro asked confusedly.<br>\r\n\"That you know...you like him.\" Geoff said awkwardly. Alejandro shrugged.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I haven't told him, too nervous to. I'm hoping for him to figure it out.\" <br>\r\n\"By mercilessly stuffing him?\" Geoff asked a 'you're kidding me' look on his face.<br>\r\n\"Okay again, point taken. I just can't help myself. You know it's hot when he's all full and bloated.\" <br>\r\n\"Again awkward and I'm not into my friend Duncan in that way but yes.\"<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing you aren't. I would have beaten you if you were,\" said Alejandro.<br>\r\n\"I know that as well,\" Geoff said. \"But no worries dude. Since now it all finally makes sense I can leave you guys alone.\" <br>\r\n\"Nah, you can help. Duncan really likes to do it with you as well. And why not? Since we both have the same goals and care about the same guy, we could work together.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess that's okay.\" <br>\r\n\"Good.\" <br>\r\n\"Man, you really did a number on him yesterday. What was it that he ate?\" <br>\r\n\"Let's just say a lot.\" <br>\r\n\"No really, how much?\" Geoff asked curiously. Alejandro leaned in and whispered everything and Geoff's eyes widened. <br>\r\n\"Holy crap that's a lot of food!\" <br>\r\n\"Even I was surprised,\" Alejandro said smirking. <br>\r\n\"How far are you going with this?\" Geoff asked curious. Alejandro shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I actually don't know. I haven't planned that part out yet. I'll stop it at some part but for now, I'm just letting nature takes its course.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, okay, I guess.\" Geoff said. Suddenly they heard Duncan's voice raise.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you guys doing?\" Alejandro and Geoff looked at each other. <br>\r\n\"So, amigos? Friends? Eh, partner?\" Alejandro said putting out his hand. Geoff looked at it and thought briefly for a monent. <br>\r\n\"Eh, sure dude. Amigos are nice. Let's go in and see Duncan.\" <br>\r\n\"Exactly what I had been thinking,\" Alejandro says with a smirk. \"He must be starving.\"<br>\r\n\"Pfft, as if anyone can be starving after that feast last night,\" Geoff said shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"Okay, that might be pushing it. But definitely hungry at least.\" Both Alejandro and Geoff entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what took you guys so long?\" Duncan asked curiously. \"Also, I'm surprised there was no yelling or trying to kill each other for that matter.\"<br>\r\n\"We discussed a few things and came to a consensus,\" Alejandro told Duncan. Duncan looked sceptical and looked at Geoff for confirmation. He relaxed when Geoff nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay cool. So, uh, now that we're all aquainted, what do you guys want to do?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Breakfast sounds great!\" Geoff said. Geoff and Duncan joined Alejandro in his car and they were off.<br>\r\nAfter 25 minutes of driving, Duncan began to complain.<br>\r\n\"Alejandro, I'm really getting hungry...\" Duncan said. Alejandro's heart raced. He felt his 'amigo' get harder at the thought of Duncan voluntarily gaining weight, and then he remembered his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there amigo. Only 5 more minutes.\" Alejandro said and stepped on it. In 5 minutes the boys arrived. \"Here we are!\" Alejandro said. The building looked like a normal breakface place, which confused Geoff for the long wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress lead the party to a booth. \"Can I get y'all anything to start with?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah - some water. And we already know what we'd like to order. The Belly Bulger.\" Alejandro said.<br>\r\n\"Alrighty!\" The waitress said and was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the belly bulger...\" Duncan asked, a little afraid. Its a 15 pound breakfast of pancakes, eggs, sausages, waffles, bacon, donuts, cookies, everything you can imagine for breakfast.\" Alejandro explained. \"If you eat it in then 2 hours, its free! And you better finish it because I didn't bring emough money to buy it.\" Alejandro smirked. Duncan would usually feel scared right about now, but with Geoff by his side, he wanted to show him that their practicing was helpful: and that he was greatful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, the belly bulger comes out and the plate is huge. It takes up the entire table, and the waitress sets a timer on the table. \"Even more stress - great\" Duncan thought. The timer started and Duncan started chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Duncan! You can do it bro!\" Geoff said. Alejandro, in response tried to updo Geoff.<br>\r\n\"Amigo you can do it! Imagine how great you'd feel if you finished it!\" Alejandro cheered.<br>\r\n\"You're not helping!\" Duncan said, with a mouthful of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan's belly got bigger and bigger with each bite. It had really swelled up, and his belly sat in his lap. His shirt couldn't cover the monster even before they started. Althought the slight feelings of being full started to arrive, Duncan kept eating at the same pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes, Duncan was 1/4 done with his plate - just on time. He finished the pancakes and waffls, and started on the bacon. He didn't use his fork, he just used his hands. He took handfuls of bacon and stuffed it into this mouth. The grease dripped into his gote and down his double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthought he finished a large amount of food already, his hunger was still im his belly. He felt ridiculous, still being hungry even after eating that much. Maybe Geoff's 'tutoring' helped him out. He stuffed another donut into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and 15 minutes had passed, and Duncan hadn't finished. He had finished all the bacon, sausages, pancakes, waffles, donuts, and cookies. However, he still had the eggs and toast to go. He was halfway through the eggs and he couldn'f eat anymore. Yet, he still fought on. He grabbed a part of the egg with his fork and stuffed it in his mouth, and he had to hold himself from gagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this eating made Alejandro unresistant. He just wanted to get on the table and feed Duncan, but he held himself. His big amigo throbbed in his pants, and he also couldn't resist. Seeing Duncan get so big, Alejandro excused himself and rushed to the bathroom, to uh... do the unmentionable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Alejandro was in the bathroom, Geoff grabbed the toast and eggs and started stuffing them in his face.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Duncan said, with his a piece of scrambled eggs in his mouth.<br>\r\n\"I know you can't pull through that much longer, I'm helping.\" Geoff said, swallowed, and ate another piece of toast. Geoff ate about 1/5 of the entire plate, while Duncan rested. 2 minutes remained, Geoff was still eating, and Alejandro would be coming back soon. Geoff shoved the last slice of toast in his mouth and Alejandro left the bathroom. Once Alejandro sat down, and timer rung, and the waitress came over to the empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job! Your meal is free! Congrats!\" she said, and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of you man!\" Geoff said, while he rubbed his own tummy. That small 15 minute eating session gave Geoff a baby bump, but he didn't feel full. Duncan on the other hand, was the opposite. He was huge, and beyond full. He ate 13 pounds of breakfast in 2 hours, and his belly ached. Duncan laid down on the back seat of the car while they drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Duncan awoke, ____ was sitting next to him.</span></div></div>",

It was really hard, but me and Alejandro carried you to the couch. Man you're really heavy.\" Duncan rolled his eyes. \"Then Alejandro left to go get some huge dinner planning, and I stayed here. I was going to start our training early, but I couldn't resist myself dude.\" Geoff said. Duncan looked over at the 2 empty pizza boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geoff, Thanks so much man back at the breakfast place.\" Duncan said<br>\r\n\"No prob dude! I could see you were struggling and I was getting hungry.\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could come with me everywhere me and Al go to eat! and help!\" Duncan pleaded.<br>\r\n\"Id love to! But we gotta make sure you eat enough, we still want your appetite to grow so that this will be easier.\" Geoff said. Duncan felt relieved. Less eating = less pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your stomach doing?\" Geoff asked Duncan.<br>\r\n\"It feels a lot better, I'm actually kinda hungry.\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"I'd offer you some pizza... but I ate it all!\" Geoff laughed, as did Duncan. Their laugh was cut short when they heard Alejandro's car reel up. Duncan sighed. Time to eat his heart out - again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro came in the door with 10 boxes of pizza piled high. <br>\r\n\"All for you amigo!\" Alejandro told Duncan. Duncan sighed, sat down, and started eating.<br>\r\nGeoff and Alejandro watched Duncan savage through the pizzas. After a half hour, all of them were gone. Duncan was shocked he ate all that, maybe his appetite was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still hungry?\" Alejandro asked.<br>\r\n\"No!\" Duncan said, half lying. He wasn't hungry, but not full either.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry to say, that theres 10 more.\" Alejandro smirked. Duncan groaned. Alejandro returned with the boxes and placed them infront of Duncan. Duncan took a deep break, and started earing the pizza again. He ate at rhe same rate at first, but once he finished the first 2 boxes he slowed down dramatically. After another half hour, he finished 6 boxes, and Duncan struggled to finish the 7th. Duncan came up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alejandro, is there amy more pizza?\" Duncan asked. Alejandro was shocked.<br>\r\n\"No... but I could get you some! Why?!\" Alejandro asked excitedly.<br>\r\n\"I'm only on my 7th box and I know I can eat way more.\" Alejandro danced inside. \"Could you get it now so by the time I finish it will be ready?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes my good friend!\" Alejandro said, grabbed his keys, and leff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan sat back. Geoff came in and started eating pizza #7, 8, 9, and 10. Geoffs belly stuck out foreard, but only a pebble compared to Duncans. Duncan was glad to have some time to relax, at least another 10 minutes til Alejandro would come back. What he would do with those pizzas? Hopefully Alejandro would go to the bathroom and Geoff could fill in. Duncan was suprised about how Geoff could eat so much in so little time. While Duncan rubbed his belly, thepain eased. Once the pain felt almost 100% gone, Alejandro came in with the new 10 pizzas. Alejandro placed them infront of Duncan and got a trash bag to collect the old boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan fed himself piece after piece slowly, as to ease the pain, but at box #6, Duncan couldn't finish.<br>\r\n\"Alejandro.. I can't...\" Duncan started to say.<br>\r\n\"Its okay amigo! I'm very proud of you! 25 boxes in that large belly.\" Alejandro said and grabbed Duncan's belly. Duncan pushed his hands away and laid back down to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some pizza Geoff?\" Alejandro asked, and handed a box to Geoff. Alejandro and Geoff sat down, and started to eat from the 5 boxes that Duncan didn't finish. Alejandro didn't eat all day, and suprised himself when he finished a whole box. Alejandro was even more shocked to see that Geoff finished the other 4. Geoffs belly had swollen up a lot today. But it couldnt just be from those 4 pizzas...<br>\r\nAlejandro dismissed it, and the trio fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Duncan woke up around 9 am. Geoff had gone, Alejandro had gone, Duncan could relax. Even before he could do anything, the phone rang.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Its Alejandro! today we're gonna focus on having some dessert!\" Alejandro said. \"I'll be home in a few!\" He hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan was kind of excited, he loved desserts. Before he could get hyped up, he called Geoff to help him with his eating today, although he was confident he could finish his favorite sweets.</span></div></div>",

Infront of Duncan were a lot of cakes and other assorted sweets. Duncan , for once, was excited to eat. Even before Alejandro's feeding, Duncan couldn't help himself around sweets. Right away, even before Geoff came, Duncan dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the cake to his face, ate all of the chocolate cake, grabbed some chocolate bars and shoved them in his mouth. He grabbed the cupcakes, 2 in each hand, and ate them in bites. Duncan stuck his hands into another cake, and took out pieces and put them in his mouth. He put chocolate donuts around his fingers and ate them each. Duncan really didn't hold back from the food. Duncan picked up another cake and ate from it again, and in no time at all, all the dessert was in Duncan. belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duncan I'm glad you ate all of that! I expected you to be a little more full after rhis and to fall asleep, but do you want more now.?\" Alejandro asked.<br>\r\nDuncans belly rumbled.<br>\r\n\"I guess rhats a yes!\" Alejandro said, and was off.<br>\r\nDuncan was still hungry after the dessert. He wanted more. He never felt like this before, he was enjoying stuffing his face. Soon Geoff came over, and Duncan filled him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! Our training has been working out! We should confinue tonight. And since you love sweets so much, we need to practice with them. You like and theres less pain with more food!\" Geoff explained. Duncan nodded, and in a bit Alejandro came back wirh rhe same amount of dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan again stuffed his face, and all the sweets made Duncan want to eat more. While eating, Duncan's shirt began to tear. Fat replaced the ripped parts of the shirt, and soon all of Duncan's shirt was gone. Duncan stopped eating and saw the damage. Alejandro stared at Duncan's bare hairy bare belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan's short buttons popped off a while ago, but this is the first time he was full aware of the effects on his body. He was too focused on either eating or the pain in his belly to notice his shirt's tightness. <br>\r\n\"Duncan, lets weigh you.\" Alejandro said. Duncan felt proud to say he wanted to finish eating. Alejandro happily let him, and once he finished again, the 3 went into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro's well toned abs remained, and even though he also ate a lot, Geoff's abs were still there. Duncan's old abs were old news, and his fat belly was huge. Duncan remembered his weight was 180 pounds of pure muscle before the weigh in. He stepped on the scale and it was 265. Duncan gained 75 pounds of all fat. Alejandro inspected Duncan's body. His love handles poured over his teared shorts, his thick arms and hands were fat, and his huge butt was amazing, but above all his gut was huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro didn't know what to do with this information. He was overly excited to know Duncan weighed 75 pounds more. Although, Alejandro wanted him bigger. While Alejandro thought this, Duncan asked, \"anymore dessert?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro was happy dessert worked for Duncan, it was more fattening then the other foods. \"I'll go get you some more!\" Alejandro said. Just as he was about to leave, Geoff asked something that puzzled Alejandro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too?\"</span></div></div>",

Its horrible, and I need your help, and you can't if ur full!\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"I dont think Alejandro is gonna fatten me up, you saw how long it took him to give an answer.\" Geoff responded. \"But if ur so worried I won't do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alejandro came through the door with the cakes. he put two aside for Geoff, and the rest for Duncan. Geoff and Duncan started eating, and Geoff hardly felt full after his cake, so he just sat back. Duncan tore through his food at a much slower pace, and when he finished, he held his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro leanred that Duncan was starting to eat in more amounts, so he had to prove more food. His appetite was growing, as was Geoffs hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro sat next to Duncan and he rubbed his belly. Geoff decided this was a good time to go, and he let the two have their space. Duncan wanted Geoff to stay, and he was sad to see him leave. Geoff went to his car and drove off. His stomach grumbled in hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff stopped by a burger place and got himself 4 burgers. His hunger needed to be situated. He ate the four burgers happily, and although he wasn't full, he didn't feel the need to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Duncan called Geoff.<br>\r\n\"Hey do you want to train soon?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure! Where's Alejandro?\" Geoff replied.<br>\r\n\"He had some personal stuff to do, I sas his phone say something about Heather.\" Geoff could hear Duncan's belly rumble over the phone. <br>\r\n\"I'll be there in a bit!\" Geoff said and drove towards Duncan's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff came in with multiple boxes of pizza. He set them down.<br>\r\n\"For every 2 slices you eat, I'll eat 1. We can do this training session together. Think of it as with every step you take, no matter how big or small, you're getting close to finishing the box! Geoff said.<br>\r\nDuncan knew he was trying to be inspirational, even though it wasn'f, be he played along. Duncan grabbed the first two slices and chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff showed Duncan a technique by putting the 2 slices ontop of each other and eating it was a whole. His logic was it would take less time, and Duncan found it to be efficient. And Geoff did was he said he would: eat a slice for every 2 Duncan ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they had gone through 12 boxes of pizza. Geoff ate 4, Duncan had 8. Geoff was starting to slow down, and Duncan kept eating at his pace. After they finished the 13th box, Geoff had to sit back and his rub his swollen belly. He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its harder than it looks, isnt it?\" Duncan said and grabbed another slice. Duncan felt more motivated with Geoff. Instead of being forced to eat with Alejandro who would yell at him, Geoff and him would tell jokes. Duncan grabbed another slice, and Duncan finished that 14th box by himself and then he couldn't go on, and they were left with another box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can eat it bro! Its only 1 more!\" Geoff encouraged Duncan.<br>\r\n\"No, you eat if, I can't.\" Duncan rubbed his belly. Geoff grabbed a slice and put it in his mouth. He grabbed 2 more and fed them to Duncan. Another slice in his own mouth, 2 more in Duncan. He grabbed one last slice for himself, and there were 2 more for Duncan. Duncan couldn't get them down, so Geoff ate the final 2. The two sat back, feet up, and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro walked in and was....</span></div></div>",

Both of them were smiling, with bulging bellies and empty pizza boxes were everywhere. He was outraged. He wanted to do nothing more but drag Geoff out of the house and lock the doors (even though he might be too heavy now with that belly) but he held himself.<br>\r\n\"I can't break this up yet, Duncan likes eating when hes with Geoff and has more motivation. Once Duncan is big enough, he'll come back to me.\" Alejandro thought. He angrily stormed into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro prepared a 24 oz steak, some fries, chips, and mashed potatoes. While waiting for the steak to cook, Duncan woke up. He sas a glimpse of Alejandro in the kitchen, and pushed Geoff off of him. He worried if Alejandro had seen them. 'No, he would've said something if he did.' Duncan thought. Duncan got up, his belly grumbling for food. Geoff still laid on the couch and Duncan went into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my big man!\" Alejandro said and hugged Duncan. \"You hungry?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Actually yeah...\" Duncan said, patting his belly. \"Its funny becaue I just had a ton of pizza before I fell asleep.\" <br>\r\n\"Thats good, I'm cooking you up something right now!\" Alejandro said. He pulled up Duncans shirt and his fat belly popped out, with hair coming from his deep belly button. \"Lets feed this thing!\" Alejandro said. The steak was ready, and Alejandro served it to Duncan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How big is this?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n24 ounces.\" Alejandro replied.<br>\r\n\"24 ounces?! A normal person can barely eat 16!\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"Eat as much as you can,\" Alejandro stated nicely. \"Push yourself a bit, and with that appetite of yours you can finish it. If you don't thats okay... but please eat as much as you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words rung in Duncan's ear. \"Eat as much as you can.\" Alejandro was acting different. He must've saw us sleeping on the couch, hes probably pissed. He told Geoff not to do this.' Duncan thought. He needed to ease Alejandro's anger. He was determined to finish the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan ate bite after bite, and to his surprise he was't feeling full yet. He had finished 17 oz's, and could keep going. Around the 21 oz mark, Duncan began to feel full. His belly was obsorbing the table and he sat back, rubbing his belly. He wanted to finish the steak. Alejandro looked at him kindly, but Duncan felt the power to continue. He finished the steak, being full to the limit, and shoved the chips and fries into his face. With the last bit of energy, Duncan ate the mashed potatoes, he sat back in pain and rubbed his belly. \"Ughhh...\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ate it! He ate the whole thing! Maybe his thing with Geoff is helping him eat!\" Alejandro thought. He rubbed Duncan's belly, and Geoff woke up. His small belly had lowered and he barely had evidence he stuffed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up guys!\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n\"Duncan just ate a 24 oz steak!\" Alejandro stated confidently. Geoff looked over and saw Duncan closing his eyes, rubbing his belly. He felt sympathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff sat down next to Alejandro and all 3 of them rubbed Duncan's belly. Duncan, even though it was easing the pain, NEEDED Geoff to leave. He saw Alejandro glare at him, and Duncan didn't Alejandro to be more mad: he didn't eat 24 oz of steak for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geoff... go get something to eat... I know you'rs hungry.\" Duncan said. Geoff wasn't hungry. He was starving.<br>\r\n\"Okay man, I'll see you guys later!\" Geoff said and drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro hoisted Duncan up, and brought him to Alejandro's car. He sat him down and the car jumped down on Duncan's side, due to his weight. Alejandro sat on the other side and they drove to the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"You'll see, you can fall asleep, it'll be a long ride.\" Duncan, desperate to please Alejandro, fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff sped to the nearest fast food place. He was desperate to eat, he felt starving. Ever since coaching Duncan, Geoff noticed his own appetite doubled. He always felt hungry. Geoff pulled up to the McDonads drive thru and ordered 6 McDoubles, 2 Big Macs, and 2 DoubleMcchickens. Geoff pulled over with his meal and began unwrapping burger after burger, and soon all 10 were in his belly. Geoff unbuttonef his shorts, and his belly bulged out even more. Geoff felt satisfied, but he wasn'f full. He had the urge to order more, to stuff himself. Geoff turned the car back on and re entered the line to Mcdonalds. He ordered the same meal, and pulled over to eat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half way through he felt full. But he pushed himself to finish the last half, and when he was done he felt exhausted. He decided to drive back to Alejandro/Duncan's house, and he found they left. </span></div></div>",

It was the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Alejandro walked in, and everyone here was at the least 300 pounds. Everyone, mainly men, were fat, and they kept on eating. Alejandro was 6'2, muscled up, and no one would ever miss with him. But in this place, Alejandro was a toothpick. He was skinny compared to everyone else. Duncan, too, felt small. He was 6'1 and 275 pounds of fat (and gaining!) but everyone here was so big he felt small. A host, who obviously used to be a young good looking boy, now filled woth fat, brought them to a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be your first time here.\" He said and patted Alejandro's rock hard abs. \"I remember when I used to have those...\" he said. \"We got to get some meat on your bones! Like your friend here!\" he said, and patted Duncan's fat belly, as it almost ripped out of his shirt. The fat teen, at least 20 years old, walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n\"Its a place I googled up, its the most fattening restaurant in the area and it serves massive amounts of delicious food!\" Alejandro explained. <br>\r\n\"I feel small in here...\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"So do you want to get bigger?!\" Alejandro urged for Duncan to say yes.<br>\r\nDuncan did want to get bigger, he felt the need to be bigger than all of these fat men. Ex jocks, preps, dads, everyone in here was bigger than Duncan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, a server, bigger than the host, approached their table.<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'll be your server tonight\" he said, and in one hand he held a pad and paper, and the other was eating a cookie. Alejandro noted this guy must've played football in high school and college; and now he was at least 375 pounds. <br>\r\n\"What can I get you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro began to order before Duncan could say anything.<br>\r\n\"6  triple bacon burgers, 5 thick crust pizzas, an 8 oz steak, 3 dozen donuts and 4 slices of cake for dessert\". Duncan looked up to the waitor, excpecting him to be disgusted, but in fact he didn't look surprised at all. The waitor only had one reaction.<br>\r\n\"We don't serve 8 oz steaks, our smallest size is 12 oz if you would like that.\" Alejandro nodded. <br>\r\n\"And for you?\" the waitor turned to Duncan. <br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Alejandro said and the waitor was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't eat that much!\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"Save the steak for last; if you can't eat that, its okay. Everything else I'm positive you'll be able to finish.\" Alejandro said and smiled.<br>\r\nThe waitor, placed down the donuts first as the 'appetizer.' Duncan ate every single one with no difficulties at all. He didn't feel like he ate anything, however they were rhe best donuts he had ever had. He wanted to order more, but he knew he had a meal fit for an elephant coming so he held himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the burgers came, and they were massive. He expected a triple bacon burger to be big, but they were piled high. He began to eat the first one, and it tasted delicious. He wanted more, and luckily he had more. He finished the first, and the second, and the third. He was stuffing himself with a fourth and realized Alejandro wasn't eating anything. He finished his bite, and offered Alejandro a burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're the best thing. Ever. Have one.\" Duncan slid the plate to Alejandro.<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm good. I want you to enjoy yourself.\" Alejandro smiled. Duncan shurgged and finished the fourth burger, and rhe fifth, and he had eaten all 6 burgers, and again he wanted more. He felt the food in his stomach but was surprised he still wanted to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the pizzas. Duncan excpect 5 slices of the pizza, but he was wrong. It was 5 boxes of pizza, and they were all thick crust and sizzled. They looked amazing, but no human could eat this much. He saw a few tables over 2 big guys, both wearing their football jerseys (which they were ripping out of) eating the same thing; each. Duncan started on the first slice and had the same feeling, and began tearing through all the pizzas. He had a slice in one hand and a slice in the other and he shoved both into his face. He chowed down all the pizzas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro watched as Duncan's belly grew while eating. It had yet to touch the table, as they booths were made for huge men, but by the rate Duncan was eating, Duncan was going to touch the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan was almost done with his last box of pizza and his shirt finally ripped. It had been under stress for so long, and it finally ripped. Duncan finished his last pizza and no longer felt hungry. But the food was so good, he knew he could eat more</span></div></div>",

Duncan always had a thing for desserts, and when the four pieces of cake arrived he dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know 4 pieces isn't much, so if you'd like more tell me.\" The host told Duncan. Duncan ended up getting 2 more servings, and he was ready for the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 12 oz steak arrives, and like earlier, he dug in. However, this steak was much better than Alejandro's. Duncan plowed through the meat, and when he finished he finally felt full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncans gut had hit the table, and Alejandro had got what he wanted. \"You ready to go?\" Alejandro asked.<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Duncan said. Alejandro was puzzled. Duncan called over the waitor. \"3 more dozen donuts.\" Duncan said, and the sumo sized waitor left to get the food. Alejandro smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm full. Not stuffed.\" Duncan said, and the waitor handed Duncan the plate and he stuffed the donuts in his mouth. He shoved the donuts down and called for another 3 dozen, finished those, and he was satisfied enough to leave. Alejandro had to haul Duncan up out of his booth, and Duncan's growth was really shown. He was huge, moobs, belly, ass, everything. Alejandro felt a boner starting, and he quickly paid the bill and ran to the car as to not show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan fell asleep in the car, and Alejandro creeped his hand over to Duncan's belly. He squished it, and played with it, and he began to cum. Alejandro held himself, since he was driving, but loved watching Duncan grow. He remembered back when Duncan was only around 170. Now he must been a little over 300. He wanted Duncan to get so much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro woke Duncan up when they arrived home, around 2 am. Duncan and Alejandro walked inside and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan woke up first, and called Geoff over to tell him about the wonderful night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont remember what it wascalled, but the food was wonderful, there was so much, i barely felt full. We have to go sometime\". Duncan said, and chowed down on a donut.<br>\r\n\"Cant wait bro!\" Geoff said and grabbed another donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro woke up, and was mad to see Geoff here already, but he cooked breakfast. 3 pounds of bacon was for Duncan, and he made a good amount for Geoff too. They both easily finished their plates. Alejandro noticed Duncan's appetite had been growing a lot. He remembered when Duncan could barely have a pound of bacon. With that he gave Duncan another 4 pounds of bacon. Alejandro wanted to push Duncan's food intake even more, hoping it would increase his appetite like it did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan fought hard to finish his plate, but could only eat 2 more. This food wasn't as addictive as the restaurant from the night before. Geoff finished Duncan's plate when Alejandro left the room, and Geoff belly bulged out a great bit</span></div></div>",

You look like you gained 100 pounds from the restaurant.\" Geoff said, examining Duncan's larger belly.<br>\r\nGeoff helped Duncan up, and they walked to the scale. Duncan stepped on the scale.<br>\r\n\"309 pounds!\" Duncan called for Alejandro to come in. Alejandro saw Duncan and his girth, and felt his dick throbbing. \"309.\" he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro and Duncan cheerifully left the bathroom with the scale, and Geoff wanted to weigh himself. He remembered he was 175 just a few weeks ago. Geoff stepped onto the scale and it creaked loudly. Geoff anxiously looked over his gut to see the number, and it was 202. Geoff was shocked. He gained 27 pounds. However, he wasn't a bad shocked. He loved eating. He went back to the room with Alejandro and Duncan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we PLEASE go back to the restaurant!\" Duncan begged Alejandro. \"Please that place was amazing!\" Duncan added. Geoff came in, and Duncan glanced at him. \"And Geoff wants to go too!\" Duncan said.<br>\r\nAlejandro didn't want Geoff to come. But it would offset Duncan if they just left without Geoff. Alejandro had full intention to bring Duncan back, but the question was about Geoff. Alejandro sighed. \"Lets go... with Geoff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long car ride, both Geoff and Duncan regained their hunger. The 3 of them all walked back into the familiar large restaurant, and Geoff noted all the fat men. They were seated at their booth, which felt uncomfortablly small to Geoff. Duncan filled up his side of the booth. Alejandro saw Duncan's belly on a few inches away from the booth's table. The waitor came over, a different one since last night, but he also looked huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6  triple bacon cheeseburgers, 3  dozen donuts, 3 plates of cookies, 8 pieces of cake, 5 pizzas...\" Duncan started. Geoff stared in disbelief. How could he eat all of this? When Duncan finished his order, Geoff added \"and I'll have all of that too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro glared at Geoff. He was going to eat all of this?! Did Geoff want to gain weight? What was he doing? Was he gaining weight as to get closer to Duncan? Alejandro sat in his seat angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came, this time all at once, and Geoff and Duncan dug in. Duncan had a burger in one hand, 2 donuts in the other, while chewing 2 cookies. Duncan was in bliss and he kept on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff, however, was shocked to taste how good the food tasted. He kept eating, and eating, but not as fast as Duncan. Half way through, Duncan's gut touched the table, and Geoff's belly was growing big as well. He tried hard to keep up with Duncan, but 3/4 way through the meal he couldn'f finish. He was way too full. He handed his plate to Duncan, which he didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating, Alejandro's eyes never left Duncan. Duncan ate and ate, and sometimes he'd look up to see Geoff's belly. Alejandro dismissed it at first, found it odd rhe second time, was mad the third, and was furious the fourth. Duncan obviously had a feeling about Geoff, and his belly, and he wasn't gonna let Geoff take Duncan from him. Geoff slowly dug back into his plate and ate again, but Duncan didn't seem like he was gonna stop. Alejandro planned his way back to Duncan.</span></div></div>",

Both of them waddled to the car, and fell asleep instantly. This gave Alejandro time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Geoff have that he didn't have? Sure Geoff was a bit nicer, but Alejandro could be nice. He examined Geoff. He saw a big fat belly, an ex jock surfer. Could that be the reason why Duncan liked Geoff more? He was fat? Maybe he could put this idea in a test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, Alejandro woke the 2 and prayed they were hungry. They were always hungry, and he needed that to help him test his idea out. Alejandro put 5 boxes of pizza in front of the 2 teens. \"Eat up! I'll be right back.\" Alejandro said and left the room. He had installed a camera in a plant in the room and watched from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched Duncan and Geoff pick up a box and shove pizzas in their face. They finished and took the next box, and again finished. He expected the last box to go to Duncan, he was bigger and hungrier. Instead, Duncan gave it to Geoff, and Geoff ate it in minutes. He belchec loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man, I needed that.\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"Your welcome, besides I wanted Alejandro to give us more, i still feel hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"You gave me food so you would be starving? Thanks bro!\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro saw what he needed. Duncan liked Geoff more because he was getting fat.<br>\r\n\"I can do that...\" Alejandro said and rubbed his 6 pack. \"I'll miss you, but you're worth sacrificing for Duncan.\" Alejandro said. Alejandro ordered 10 boxes of pizza to split between the 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whos hungry??\" Alejandro asked. Geoff and Duncan turned around excitedly, and both of their bellies rumbled.<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I eat with you guys?\" Alejandro asked. Alejandro hadn't stuffed himself... ever, so he started with 2 boxes of pizza, giving 4 to the others. </span></div></div>",

He had to admit, it did taste good, but he didn't see how Duncan and Geoff could go wild over it. He finished the slice and reached another. He ate at the same pace. He then ate a 3rd. And then a fourth. After his fifth slice he began to feel full.<br>\r\n\"I'm only half way through this box, and I still have to eat anoher one!\" Alejandro thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Geoff and Duncan on their final boxes shoving pizza into their mouth. Alejandro thought he could finish his box, and give the remaining one to Duncan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro ate his 6th slice, and his 7th. \"3 more...\" Alejandro thought. He reached for another and groaned while eating it. He ate 1 more and and finished his last abd let out a huge burp. He undid the button on his jeans and sat back rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already full Alejandro?\" Duncan asked, joking.<br>\r\n\"Yes amigo, you can have the last box.\" <br>\r\nDuncan leaned over and picked up the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan thought back to when he couldn't eat a single box, much like Alejandro. Now he ate everything he could, and he couldn't even remember what being full felt like. Duncan looked at his tan, hairy, huge belly which had ridden up his shirt. He then heard snoring from both Geoff and Alejandro and he realized they were sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan now had time by himself, he didn't have a lot of that lately. Duncan wanted to do something just by himself, and he had an idea. Duncan got into the car and sat down. His belly overlapped the steering wheel, so he pushed the chair back and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour after driving, Duncan was so hungry. he pulled over and got a bag of burgers, and ate them while driving. He ate 10, and he was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours, he was there. He was back at that fat restaurant. He got out of rhe car, and it basically jumped up from the compressed weight. Duncan got inside and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan ordered a huge meal, even compared to other times. He didn't feel the constraint of Alejandro anymore. He ate a huge burger, a slice of pizza, a few cookies, a piece of cake, a donut and repeat. Food piled up in his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished his huge feast, 15 of everything on the menu. Duncan definitely wasn't full. His stomach hurt due to the enormous feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan looked around the room and saw the waitor that served him the first time here. He looked bigger; as if he gained 75 pounds. The waitor was eating a cookie, and he got another, and another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan decided to drive back home. When he got back, Alejandro and Geoff were...</span></div></div>",

If this is someone's idea of a joke, I swear I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light clicked on, blinding the punk for a moment. When his eyes adjusted, he saw Harold sitting in a chair nearby, a pizza box in his lap. \"Have a nice nap?\" he asked, a faint smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, Doris?\" Duncan asked. \"And why the hell are my arms tied up?!\" He added, pulling at a thick rope binding his wrists. He also noticed he was sitting on something, but didn't think much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired of you bullying me, Duncan!\" Harold snapped. \"Always humiliating me, and pushing me around just because you're bigger than me! Well not anymore...\" the tall boy opened the box, revealing a large pepperoni pizza, glistening with grease and emitting a delicious aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're gonna feed me a pizza as revenge?\" Duncan scoffed. \"Lame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just THIS pizza\" Harold clarified. \"THESE pizzas!\" he waved his arm around the room, and the punk's gaze followed. Stacked everywhere and high were mounds of pizzas, which explained why the odor of grease, cheese, and meat was so strong. Dunan's stomach rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so where-\" before Duncan could finish speaking, Harold bolted forward and crammed a slice into his mouth, rubbing Duncan's neck so as to force swallowing. The nerd repeated the process until the punk's belly was tight and swollen, making a slight bulge in his black skull shirt, and the first box was empty. Here Harold paused to rub his palm into the gut, helping it convert into soft fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Duncan burped, and Harold took this as a sign to start with the next pizza, occasionally pausing to force some kind of gainer shake down the punk's throat.\"I'm gonna keep feeding you until you can't move!\" Harold laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeding continued for hours until Duncan's clothes began to feel quite snug. A soft bulge pressed against his waistband and the ropes, which he had given up struggling against after Harold pointed out he was a master at knotting, where starting to chafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had begun, the nerd had weighed Duncan on a special scale he had borrowed from Owen that had a max of 1000 pounds, and found that he weighed 170 pounds. When Harold paused to check Duncan's current weight, he now saw 200 pounds even. \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Duncan asked, shifting in place.<br>\r\n\"You've put on thirty pounds!\"<br>\r\n\"THIRTY?!

Six, you will wear this in your ear.\" Harold shoved what looked like an earplug in Duncan's ear. \"It's how I'll let you know when it's time to come back.

Carrying the outfit to a full-body mirror, he began exploring his new reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost predictably, the first thing Duncan's blue eyes were drawn to was his stomach. It stuck out from his middle and hung down like an apron, almost completely obscuring his underwear with help from a large pair of love handles. His tree-like legs were beginning to brush against one another, and his flat rear had swollen into a plump bubble butt. Sinking his fat fingers into bulging biceps, Duncan could find none of the hard muscles that had once been present. Every bit of them had been covered by thick flab that drooped down slightly when he stretched his arms up, an act the punk quickly aborted due to the effort. His chin had doubled and his rounded chest had morphed into squeezable moobs that unwittingly brought a faint smile to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think I can get used to this... Duncan commented, recalling his epiphany from yesterday as he slipped into his new clothes. Surprisingly, they covered his whole body rather well, though there was no denying that he had gained a great deal of weight. Sighing briefly and giving his gut a pat, watching as it jiggled slightly, he finished his morning rituals and left the room, snatching his gainer shake thermos as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he strolled along the hallway, the criminal was briefly startled by a loud gurgle. \"Man, I'm starving!\" he moaned, clutching at his girth and making a beeline for the Playa's buffet at a fast waddling pace.</span></div></div>",

Digging in to a fried chicken leg, Duncan looked up at who was sitting across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Harold, Noah, Cody, and even Ezekiel (who still had a faint green to his skin but looked otherwise normal).

The bookworm had fallen into a habit of eating while he was reading, and vice-versa. This mindless consumption, combined with his constant laziness, had naturally resulted in a thin-but-growing layer of pudge on Noah's skinny body. \"I'm okay with it.\" he shrugged, going back to his book and food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody ran his hands over his belly. His weight had climbed the quickest of the four, having put on over 50 pounds. The tech-geek gave a small, gap-toothed grin. He had wanted to gain for some , but while Total Drama was running, he had had few opportunities to try. Now, with a several season break for everyone, he felt free to do so with a little encouragement from Owen. \"I kinda like it!\" Cody added, happily patting his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold however barely looked any different. His lanky height making it hard to tell he was any fatter unless one was actively looking for it. His middle was barely pushing against his shirt, creating a faint bulge under the blue fabric. \"You're rubbing off on me, I guess.\" Harold finished. The skater nerd had apparently been sneaking some of the pizzas he had been feeding Duncan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatter male nodded. \"Looks like it!\" he replied, chuckling as he resumed eating. Duncan occasionally glanced back up at the other four, who had drifted off to the buffet table and refilled their own plates before sitting back down and following his cue. The punk began to imagine each of them at his own weight. In his mind's eye, each of them began to grow bigger and softer. Smiling at the daydream, he cleaned his plate leisurely. \"Hey, uh... wanna go play a video game in the lounge?\" The four agreed, finishing up as well and following Duncan out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lounge room, Duncan began teaching Zeke how to play against the three nerds. Once the prairie boy stood a chance at the fighting game, he stepped back and sat in a nearby chair, drifting off to sleep. His dreams of vandalizing things were interspaced with visions of food and being fed. The punk watched in his mind's eye as he grew bigger and bigger, moving around less and less. Somehow, the idea was intriguing. He had never thought about being that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Duncan woke up to...</span></div></div>",

Slowly Duncan pulled his gelatinous body up out of his seat, giving himself a moment for his stomach to stop jiggling before following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival, he saw the quartet had piled an entire table full of fatty foods, with Harold setting out glasses of the gainer shake at each of the five seats. Duncan raised an eyebrow at the ginger, who simply nodded in reply. Nodding, he sat down next to Ezekiel, giving him a congratulatory pat on the back. \"Good job, Zeke. You did good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" the toque-wearer smiled as he reached for his drink. Duncan watched as the others drank some of their smoothies and began to eat, slowly at first, but gradually picking up the pace. He could practically see them, as well as himself, getting bigger and bigger with every bite. Chairs began to creak slightly as their burdens increased, and loose clothing grew snug. Noah and Harold moved past slightly pudgy and into fat, their clothing highlighting their new curves. Ezekiel looked like he was in bliss, his hoodie stretching over his growing gut as he stuffed his face. Cody seemed to balloon outward as he ate, his body swelling up in every direction but up. Duncan could feel his own body converting just about whatever he ate into ounces of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the five males had emptied the table off food, their bellies were almost painfully stuffed. Shirts had ridden up and pants opened to make room for the engorged mounds of their bellies. One by one, each of them slowly stood up, trying to be careful not to jostle the sloshing stomachs and wincing in pain when it happened. They made their ways to bed, with Duncan following Harold. The ginger waved him off to bed, saying that there wouldn't be a stuffing that night, and that they were just gonna alternate it. The punk was surprised that he had been expecting to be stuffed again, and more so that he was disappointed when it wasn't gonna happen. Frowning, he nodded and went off to bed.</span></div></div>",

Harold led Duncan outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yesterday you said we'd change things?\" Duncan asked Harold.<br>\r\n\"Yep, this time I'm not gonna feed you - You are..\" Harold said. Duncan glazed, confused.<br>\r\nHarold led Duncan to a large room, filled with food piled high and all around. The room was the size of a warehouse and it was absolutely full with food. Duncan stared in amazment, hoping he could eat all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heres 5 pills.\" Harold started and handed them to Duncan. \"1 increases appetite, another decreases metabolism, another is an addictive stimulant, and the last is a pill that prevents you from feeling full.\" Harold explained.<br>\r\n\"You're going to take one of these every hour. You will eat as much of the food in the warehouse as you can eat, and 10 hours later I'll get you so we can go to bed.\" Harold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where will you be?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n\"Thats none of your business. Now get eating!\" Harold said. He pointed to a camera in the corner of the room and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan swallowed the pills started feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started with the pile of pizza boxes. He opened a box and stuffed pizza after pizza into his mouth. He finished thay box and opened the next, and the next. Duncan was englufing the food and wasn't even feeling the pain. After 45 minutes of eating nonstop pizza, Duncan decided to move to another food. He got up to start with the burgers, but stammered forward, now noticing his huge gut. His belly was as big as last night already, and it wasn't even an hour yet. In addition, he also still felt starving. He sat back down in front of the burgers and started eating, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes passed and a speaker came on. \"Duncan take the next pill!\" Harold said.<br>\r\nDuncan opened the jar and swallowed the pill. He then wondered what would happen if he had 2. He skimmed the jar and he decided to take another 5 pills. He then countinued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan noticed that the slow sense of feeling full disapeared, and he was hungrier than ever. He ate the burgers for an hour straight and was interrupted by Harold to take another set of pills. Duncan double dosed again and moved to the dessert section. He stuffed cake, donuts, cookies, cupcakes, and other sweet desserts into his mouth and was mesmorized by the tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan was in the midst of eating when he was again interrupted, but not by Harold. A loud ripping sound echoed the room, and Duncan looked down to see his bare body. His shirt had ripped and Duncan examined the damage of the hours of fillinh himself. His belly was huge, along with his moobs. His happy trail led down to ripped pants as well, and his ass and legs were so strained by his underwear. Duncan felt his stomach, and if growled. He was still starving! He grabbed another full cake snd brought it to his face and chowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours of stuffing food, and Duncan had eaten 5/6 of the entire warehouse. Harold came in, also looking a bit plumper, approached Duncan.<br>\r\n\"woah Duncan... I didn't expect you to eat almost the entire warehouse!\" Harold said.<br>\r\nDuncan didn't respond as he was too stuffed. Duncan weighed 3 times as much as he did than before Harold started stuffing him. He got up and they walked through the hallways.</span></div></div>",

Cody quickly matched Duncan in weight at 330 pounds, with the latter only surpassing the brunet in height. They began getting closer to each-other as time passed and Cody spent more time with Duncan. The delinquent developed an appreciation for Cody's tech skills, while the geek grew to enjoy Duncan's prank knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold had put on quite a bit of weight as well, up to 301 pounds. His body had grown wide and chunky due to eating the leftover slices that Duncan didn't eat. Noah and Ezekiel had also grown rather fat, the former's 290 pound gelatinous frame almost glued to his chair, while Zeke's 280 pound one was still barely mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day the ginger designed and made a pill that decreased one's metabolism to a near-crawl while boosting their appetite sky high. \"Okay Duncan...\" Harold commented after giving it to the punk. \"Follow me.\" The 310 pound teen led the slightly larger one to a warehouse-sized room, occupied by an equally massive vat of high-fat lard. \"I want you to try and finish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it?!\" Duncan replied incredulously. \"But it's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and so's your appetite now!\" the ginger responded. \"I'll be back in a couple hours to see how you're doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\" Duncan asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to know.\" Harold answered before leaving and waving. \"Bye!\" He shut the door behind him. Duncan sighed and sat down in front of the vat, resting his head on it. He grabbed a nearby hose, stuck one end in his mouth, and turned on the valve at the other. With a gurgling noise, the fluid began its journey down his throat and into his cavernous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting a hand on his belly, he could feel it getting bigger and fatter with every swallow. His larger-sized pants, which had started out snug, quickly grew very tight and suddenly ripped at the sides and back. 'Aw man...' Duncan thought, 'those were my last pair!' His shirt was thankfully more resilient, and simply rode up to nearly his chest, though still extremely tight. Even his favorite studded collar was growing too tight, but before Duncan could attempt to remove it, the snap on it popped open, causing him to make a moaning sound in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Harold return to find...</span></div></div>",

He was wearing Duncan's collar on his wrist and rubbing the punk's now-immense stomach lovingly. Duncan, having turned off the flow for the time being, was breathing heavily and smiling over at Cody, an affectionate look in his blue eyes. The look was matched in the brunet's own. Harold smiled at the scene.He had to admit, the scene was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold looked up at the vat to see almost half of it was gone. He was clearly impressed; Duncan had consumed more than he thought. Calmly, he approached Duncan with a new pill and a glass of water in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... that one... do?\" Duncan puffed out, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supposed to help your body handle the weight.\" Harold answered. \"Won't help ya walk much, but you'll be able to breathe a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Duncan opened his mouth for the pill, which was promptly inserted and swallowed alongside the water. He took a deep breath and exhaled, sounding like a massive set of bellows. \"Much... better...\" he panted. \"Thanks...\" Inside Duncan's body, the pill's chemicals burned away any clogs in his arteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold smiled. \"No prob.\" he replied with a shrug before turning to Cody, who looked about to doze off. \"And how long have you been in here?\" the nerd asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour or so.\" Cody responded, yawning. \"Wanted to spend some time with Duncan and went lookin'. Found him in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude just... started cuddling me.\" Duncan added, gently rubbing Cody's back. \"C'mon dude; lemme get to bed. We can go to sleep there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Cody moaned, getting up. He and Harold watched as Duncan slowly got to his feet. His gelatinous body rippled as he wobbled unsteadily before he found his balance and settled, panting slightly. The other two could see just how big he had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a doubt, Duncan's belly was the most massive part of him. It hung out of his too-small shirt and over his waistband along with large love handles, with his belly button stretched until it was almost a line. His moobs were splayed on top, looking like large pillows. Duncan's thighs looked like tree trunks, and the seat of his pants had torn open wider from the effort of containing his rear when he was getting up, which revealed that his boxers were hugging his butt rather nicely and causing Cody to blush. His arms hung limp at his sides, massive, heavy, and filling his sleeves snugly. Duncan's face had completely lost most of its angular shape for a plump round one, with chipmunk cheeks and double chin. Even his usual hard, aloof smirk had relaxed into a soft, kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was surprised at just how big Duncan had gotten. It was almost hard for the ginger to believe Duncan had been a fairly muscular teen over two months ago. He had wanted Duncan big, but this was far and beyond his plans. Cody on the other hand was excited. He enjoyed larger guys, as well as being big himself. And now Cody was gonna get a whole night to spend with Duncan.</span></div></div>",

That is not to say that her other cooking was less and it wasn't as on many nights when he stayed at his friend DJ's house, a lot of her food would find its way into his stomach, sometimes a bit too much. Just that DJ was a sandwich making God, if there was such a thing. How he could take ordinary ingredients and make such delicious sandwiches, even plain ones, was scary and there were many including him who wondered what DJ's secret was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, the sandwiches were addictive. At least that was what he thought. It would explain how they always tasted so good and why whenever DJ made a tray, he couldn't help but taking a few. Oftentimes just one or two but then he'd get bored or hungry or forgetful or the smell would waft over...and he would get a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, whatever until next thing they knew, the serving tray was empty and this was a pattern that repeated often. And DJ's ingredients were not the most healthful oriented. He used full calorie, none of the low calorie or diet stuff, DJ said they made food taste like crap which in comparison was kind of true. And DJ was a big guy and oddly with very little fat which was odd considering all the ingredients he used and the fact that he actually wasn't a serious exerciser. Yeah he went to the gym and stuff but that was mainly with him and Duncan and generally socialized more than anything and didn't stick to a straight routine. So he was all natural with ridiculous luck and genetics that many people would have killed and sold their souls to the devil and such things for and he never had to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed between the whole sandwich thing and DJ's mom's cooking which again is fantastic, what happened would have been inevitable one way or the other. One day Geoff had woken up and when he dressed in front of the mirror he saw something that chilled him. His sexy six-pack abs (admittedly done with only slightly more work than DJ although with DJ he was muscle all over while Geoff actually had to work the other parts, but at least his abs had always been natural) were not as toned as they were before and there was a few inches of flab that covered them. He supposed he shouldn't have had so much to drink the night before and stayed away from DJ's sandwiches but this had never happened before. He was actually getting...he couldn't believe it, fat. At least it was only a little bit. </span></div></div>",

I think you'd look super manly if you did!!  In fact, I can help you out if you want.\"  Geoff grinned, \"Alright, bro.  Let's do it!!\"  Duncan and Geoff spent the rest of the day at the gym talking about ways to help Geoff beef up.  They decided on...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I mean yeah I like my abs a lot but bigger and stronger, being huge and beefy is way better when you think about it.\" Duncan flickered his eyes down to Geoff's belly for a second and then back up so quickly it wasn't noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't mention it, what else are buds for? I'm honored to help you. Asking DJ to help was a pretty good idea and we might incorporate that later because face it, he and his mom are fantastic cooks and make lots of good things that could help in our, uh, your quest. However as an all natural, he wouldn't really know how to properly feed and train you. Heck, he doesn't really exercise except when required which is so bull that he's got muscles like those but whatever. He's one of those rare gifted people so whatever he does/doesn't do won't really apply to you anyways.\" Geoff nodded. That made total sense of course so asking DJ for help (at least initally) would not have been a good idea. DJ probably wouldn't get it and freak out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still get to eat their food right?\" Geoff asked and Duncan gave him the 'duh' look. <br>\r\n\"I just said that, just that we aren't solely going to be relying on them.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" <br>\r\n\"Very good. Well before we start, we're going to need some time getting some fuel and packing more mass onto that skinny frame of yours.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey, I resent that. I am NOT skinny!\" Geoff said pouting, crossing his arms. <br>\r\n\"If you want to be really big, yes you are. So we're going to add some weight on of course.\" <br>\r\n\"How?\" Geoff asked and Duncan smirked. <br>\r\n\"Food of course. The all-food diet.\" <br>\r\n\"What's that?\" <br>\r\n\"You're going to eat whatever you want when you want and not care about such things like calories or fat, as long as you exceed a certain amount of calories per day\" <br>\r\n\"So even junk food?\" Geoff asked salivating. Duncan smirked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. All the pizza, hamburgers, icecream, chips, chocolate, whatever, that you want.\" <br>\r\n\"That sounds exciting! This will really help?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, absolutely. You'll be packing on the pounds in no time and I'll help you the whole time,\" Duncan said grinning. </span></div></div>",

Duncan wasn't the kind of guy who wanted to have massive, bulging muscles, but he did like being muscular.  He body was defined, but not overly so, as opposed to Geoff, who was spent most of his time on the bench press working on making his pecs and arms bigger.  When the two were finished and ready to go, Geoff took his shirt off for the first time and examined his body.  His arms and chest were still pretty big, but not as big as he wanted, and his stomach curved out slightly, but they didn't go farther than his pecs.  Duncan gave Geoff's pecs a hard punch and it made thick, low, manly THUMP, \"Nice.\"  Duncan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left the gym and headed to a pizza place that Duncan knew.  It was the kind of place that just had rows and rows of pizzas under heat lamps, and you just take what you want then pay. When they got inside, the two of them grabbed a tray each and started filling them up with Pizza.  Duncan had six slices on his tray, but he only planned on eating two of them  The other four where for Geoff, who had grabbed six slices himself.  When Geoff and Duncan payed and grabbed their seats, Duncan went to get drinks, leaving Geoff to his own work.  The party boy picked up the first slice and took a massive bit out of it, his mouth watering at the taste.  He was so into it that he didn't even notice when Duncan came back with their soda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan finished his two slices quickly and pushed the other four pieces of pizza at Geoff, who had just finished eating his last slice from his plate.  He leaned back in his seat and rubbed his stomach, letting out a long belch before sighing contently and sipping his soda.  \"What, you're done?\"  Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff nodded, \"Yeah.  I'm really full and I don't think I can eat those other slices.\"<br>\r\nDuncan frowned and leaned forward, \"Geoff, as your eating coach, I think it would be good if you DID eat those last slices.  How else are you gonna gain weight if you don't pig out at every meal?\"  <br>\r\nGeoff scratched his bloated belly, \"Good point.\"  Geoff sat back up and picked up the first slice, shoving half of it into his mouth and eating quickly.  After a few minutes, Geoff pushed the plate away and flopped back in his seat, \"Done.\"  Duncan pushed the two large soda glasses towards Geoff, the one that Duncan had seemingly untouched, \"Those too?\"  <br>\r\nDuncan nodded, \"You're gonna eat everything we get you, no matter what.\"  Geoff sighed and gulped down the two sodas before the two decided to head home.  After dropping Duncan off, Geoff went straight to his bedroom and crashed, his stomach bloated from all the pizza he had eaten, but he knew it would all help him turn into a beefy, sexy man.</span></div></div>",

This had better be important or he would be very unhappy. Geoff was usually a pretty chill guy with a lot of patience, but not even he could appreciate being woken up randomly from sleep at such a late hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he said curtly and he heard Duncan's voice answer jovially. <br>\r\n\"Hey Geoff, how's my big bear feeling?\" <br>\r\n\"D-man, you're confusing me for DJ. And why are you calling so late?\" Geoff said, trying to keep from being irritated at his friend. <br>\r\n\"Nah, that's soon to be you, although DJ certainly is and should be. Anyways, just wanted to know how you were doing and to confirm you were okay with this.\" <br>\r\n\"Tired. I'm tired. And yes, I am okay with beefing up. Now if that's all...\" <br>\r\n\"No, no. But that's good that you're okay. Had to make sure there was no postmortem guilt or you changed your mind or something. But since you haven't, I have another task for you to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now?\" Geoff asked a bit more awake. <br>\r\n\"Yeah right now. Constant feeding really helps to both slow down your metabolism a bit and also pack on the weight necessary. Especially at night. Studies have been done about this you know that those who also eat at odd hours of the day gain more weight.\" Geoff was fully awake now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I want you to go down to your refrigerator. Are you there?\" Duncan asked as Geoff walked down the steps. Geoff nodded his assent when he got there before he realized Duncan wasn't actually there and couldn't see him, as far as he knew although that would be pretty creepy if Duncan was spying. And there would have been no need to as Geoff would have either let him in or Duncan would invite himself in as he often did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm there.\" Geoff's voice trembled in excitement. <br>\r\n\"Open the refrigerator. I left you a little present earlier when I dropped you off. I want you to eat it.\" Geoff opened the refrigerator and pulled out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Geoff was surprised when he pulled out the huge chocolate cake Duncan had left him in his fridge.  He set it on the counter and leaned against it, \"D-Man, you want me to eat this whole thing?\"<br>\r\n\"Not the whole thing,\" Duncan said on the other end, \"Well, if you can, then yeah, the whole thing.  But, if you can't, just eat as much as you can fit into that growing gut of yours.  You don't have to worry about slicing it.  Just dig in.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, man.  You wanna stay on while I eat or are you gonna go?\"  Geoff asked, pulling a fork out of a kitchen drawer.  He buried the fork into the cake and pulled off a big chunk, pushing it into his mouth.  Geoff let out a long groan of satisfaction at the taste, and started chewing fast, wanting more.<br>\r\nDuncan chuckled, \"If you keep on moaning like that I might just stay on to see if you can finish it.  No, I gotta go.  I need to get up early tomorrow and think about your meal plan.  Hope my big bear enjoys the cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a click, and Duncan's end went silent.  Geoff wondered why Duncan had started calling him \"His Big Bear\", but this cake was so mesmerizing that as soon as he took another bite, all he could think about was eating more.  After maybe his third or fourth huge bitch, Geoff was starting to realize how thick the cake and frosting was.  He set the plate down and went to the fridge to get a glass of milk, but when he saw that it was half empty, he decided to save a glass and drink straight from the jug.  Geoff took five large swigs before going back to the cake, which he had already finished a 1/3 of it.  Geoff set the milk on the counter and went right back to the cake, devouring it at an incredible speed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff's extreme weakness for chocolate was his downfall in this.  He could feel his stomach becoming bloated and tight, but the gooey taste of the chocolate cake was so good, he couldn't stop.  After every few huge bites, Geoff would gulp down some milk to wash it down, before digging back in.  After 15 minutes of eating, Geoff had eaten the entire cake and emptied the jug, and his stomach was so full that it stuck out past his pecs.  The party boy threw the empty cake container and jug away and walked back to his bed slowly, rubbing his bloated belly the whole way.  What he wouldn't give to have Duncan rubbing his gut right now.  Geoff realized he was still dress from the day, and stripped down to his boxers.  As soon as Geoff hit the bed, he passed out for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Geoff was woken up by a loud knocking at his front door.  Geoff forced himself out of bed and walked to the front door to see Duncan, grinning.  \"Morning, big guy!  How was that cake last night?\"  Duncan said, walking in and headed towards the kitchen.<br>\r\nGeoff yawned and rubbed his eyes, \"Mooh- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH... morning.  Oh, D, you don't even know.  I finished that whole thing last night before I went to bed.  It was SO good.\"<br>\r\nDuncan set the bags he had in his hands down and walked back over, patting Geoff's bigger stomach, \"I can tell.  Looks like that cake alone helped this thing get even sexier.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Bigger.  It helped it get even bigger.\"  Duncan put both hands on Geoff's bigger stomach and rubbed it, his hands traveling to the bottom of his belly and squeezing the newly formed fat, \"You're already looking huge, Dude.  I hope my big bear is hungry now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple thought of food made Geoff's stomach grumble, \"Yeah, I am.  What did you bring over?\"<br>\r\nDuncan walked back into the kitchen and opened the first of four bags, pulling out several wrapped breakfast sandwiches, \"I stopped by a fast food place on the way over here and bought a bunch of their breakfast sandwiches.  Egg, two sausage patties, bacon, cheese, on a burger bun.:  Duncan reached back into a different bag and pulled out a smaller bag, \"Plus I bought you a bunch of hashbrown sticks.  Potatoes, especially fried ones, are GREAT for putting on the pounds.\"  Duncan put these back in the bags and set all four of them on the coffee table in front of the TV, before grabbing Geoff by his wide shoulders and setting him down, \"You start on those.  I need to go get the sodas I bought you to go with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Geoff couldn't say no to his coach, he pulled out the first sandwich and started chowing down.  Duncan came back with 4 large cherry cokes and sat down next to Geoff, ready to help him eat.</span></div></div>",

Plus, he had eaten that giant cake earlier and an enormous amount of pizza earlier than that all within the last 24 hours, not even a whole day by time standards. He leaned his head back and moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hic-sorry coach, I-ugh,\" Geoff released a huge belch and moaned rubbing his stomach and Duncan shifted Geoff's hands off and continued rubbing and Geoff moaned with relief this time as Duncan had magic fingers and oh that was so good....\"uh, oh yeah, I don't think I can finish,\" Geoff said sadly, watching the tv and not Duncan to spare him the disappointment of seeing failure. \"I really did try...\" Duncan smirked, leaning his head closer against Geoff, tickling him with his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know. I know you did try which is what's important. And I did feed you that cake last night so it's really unrealistic to expect you to actually finish. In fact, you finished way more than I thought you would. In fact, I'm proud of you my big bear as you ate far more than I or anyone could have expected you to. Now lay down, I want to give you a treat.\" Gently pushing Geoff down, Duncan proceeded to really massage Geoff's swollen protesting gut which really, really felt good as he sighed and moaned appreciatively letting Duncan know he was doing a good job. And Duncan was impressed. Geoff's belly was absolutely huge compared to normal and felt so hard (from being stuffed so much) yet soft at the same time as he pinched and kneaded it, kind of like dough. Geoff's body was on full hot alert and he could feel Duncan's hands touching and playing. Geoff pointed out spots that needed attention and Duncan gave it and it was sooooooo good that he had Duncan as a coach because wow, he was amazing at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big bear is getting so cute and beefy,\" Duncan said complimentingly as he moved up fondly playing with Geoff's pecs. <br>\r\n\"But not big enough,\" said Geoff and Duncan just smirked. <br>\r\n\"No, but well on the way to becoming huge. After all, we've only just begun.\" Duncan shuffled out to the kitchen. <br>\r\n\"Where you going?\" Geoff asked. Duncan turned and grinned mischieviously. <br>\r\n\"Plotting lunch and dinner big bear. You just stay there all cute and rest your manly belly a bit while I work. I'll take good care of you.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Geoff turned watching the tv, scratching his belly at subconsciously as he watched a show on wolves and it went well as he nodded off to sleep which was so cute, Duncan had to smile. </span></div></div>",

He no longer felt painfully bloated like before, and he could feel the pressure on his belly get a little stronger, but in a good way.  Geoff lifted his head up so he could see over his beefy pecs and saw that it was Duncan who was rubbing his belly.  Duncan had both hands on it and he was kneading into it happily.  Even with the added pressure, Duncan's hands worked like magic on his tummy.  Every single movement made Geoff groan happily and occasionally sent chills up his spine.  Duncan laughed softly as he squeezed Geoff's squishy belly with both hands, \"Morning.  Did my Big Bear have a nice nap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff smiled, \"Sure did.  I think I slept off that cake and those sandwiches.\"  Geoff sat up and pushed against his stomach, which smooshed inward and there was hardly any pressure on his stomach.  He smiled, happy to see that he could eat even more now for Duncan, \"So how long was I asleep for?\" Geoff asked.<br>\r\nDuncan ran his hands in circles on Geoff's belly, \"A few hours.  It's already two in the afternoon and you feel asleep at.  Lunch should be done in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, cool.\"  Geoff said, happy to know it was time to eat again.  He looked up at Duncan and smiled, \"You sure do love rubbing my belly, don't you, Coach?\"<br>\r\nDuncan smiled, squeezing it with one hand and rubbing it with the other, \"I really do.  Watching it grow and rubbing it are my two favorite things about coaching you while you grow.  I hope you don't mind but whenever I had to wait for food to cook, I would come back in here and rub your big belly for you, since you looked so uncomfortable and stuffed while you tried to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff smiled, \"Hey, Coach, no worries.  That's what you're here for, rub and grope it all you want, whenever you want.\"  Geoff said, smacking his soft belly hard, making a loud smack and causing it to jiggle.  <br>\r\nDuncan grinned and patted it a few more times, before reaching up and punching one of Geoff's thick pecs, \"We'd better start working you out soon.  We don't want your pecs to get soft.\"  There was a loud DING and Duncan stood up, walking to the kitchen, \"Looks like lunch is ready.\"  Geoff sat up on the couch, adjusting his boxers(the only thing he was still wearing), while Duncan put together his lunch.  Geoff sniffed the air and he heard his stomach growl as he smelled something greasy.  Seconds later, Duncan walked back in with a big plate of chicken strips and french fries, setting them down on the coffee table in front of Geoff, \"Lemme go grab my Big Bear his soda.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan came back quickly from the kitchen with one of the large cherry cokes he had bought Geoff for breakfast that he never got to drink.  The green haired teen sat down next to his huge best friend and rubbed his shoulders, \"Eat up!!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Coach.  Man, this smells SO good.\"  Geoff reached down and grabbed the first strip in the pile of twelve, tearing it in half and dipping it in ketchup before shoving it into his mouth, groaning happily at the taste.  Geoff happily started eating as he and Duncan watched TV, Duncan's hand rest on Geoff's growing belly the entire time, scratching it absentmindedly and enjoying the show they were watching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes passed by quickly and Geoff had managed to drink the entire large soda, eat all of the fries, and eight of the twelve chicken strips.  He groaned loudly as he sank into his couch and put his hands on his bloated belly.  Duncan smiled as he held one chicken strip up to Geoff's mouth, \"Just one more and you can rest.\"  Duncan said, trying to sway Geoff his way.<br>\r\nGeoff shook his head, \"No, way, Coach.  I'm way to full.\"<br>\r\nDuncan smiled, \"If my Big Bear eats this last piece, I'll give him the best belly rub of his life.\"  Geoff sighed, thinking if over.  He was really full, but the way Duncan called him his \"Big Bear\" really made it hard to say no.  Geoff opened his mouth and bit off half of it, chewing slowly as Duncan smiled, \"I knew you could eat another one.  Just one more bite.\"  Geoff swallowed the chicken in house mouth before letting Duncan feed him the last bite, Duncan's fingertips being pulled into Geoff's mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan pulled them out and Geoff chewed the last bite swallowed, letting out a loud belch, \"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp!!~\"<br>\r\nDuncan smiled and patted Geoff's bloated belly, \"Now THAT is what I call manly.\"<br>\r\nGeoff grins, \"Thanks.  Man, it feels so good to have that out. Now, what about that belly rub again?\"<br>\r\nDuncan smiled and moved Geoff into a laying position, putting both hands on Geoff's bloated gut and working his magic.  Geoff was so comfortable that it didn't take long for Duncan's rhythmic motions to lull Geoff back to sleep.  Duncan relaxed on the couch and rubbed his sleeping Bear's hard belly as he watched TV and waited for Geoff to wake up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stretching, Geoff got to his feet and instinctively rubbed his belly which made Duncan grin a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my big bear doing,\" Duncan asked and Geoff opened his eyes and smiled. <br>\r\n\"Really good D! Feel like I'm ready and pumped for anything!\" Geoff said flexing and posing a bit causing Duncan to laugh a bit as he got up and placed his hands on Geoff's pecs and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say big guy,\" he whispered and Geoff felt really good and warm at the way Duncan said it as he trailed his fingers down, again playing with the new softness which he never seemed to tire of. Duncan then straightened up and seemed to be replaced as he snapped a command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geoff, get your workout outfit on, we're going to work on your arms, chest, and legs to give you good support for your big frame and prevent such important necessities from getting to soft,\" Duncan said thumping Geoff's chest, pleased at the thumped thick sound it made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, yes sir!\" Geoff saluted as he bounded heavily up the stairs to his room to get his workout clothes.The tanktop was a bit of a struggle to get on, getting stuck at his beefy pecs and then stretched by his expanded belly but he finally did manage to get it on right before Duncan came up wondering what was the holdup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking so damn-oh,\" Duncan said, staring at Geoff's shirt and Geoff felt a bit self-conscious as it barely fit and showed a bit too much, unable to completely cover his belly after struggling to contain his wide chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry coach, just having trouble getting this on,\" Geoff said a bit confused. \"It fit much better before but now it was a bit of a struggle to get on.\" Duncan licked his lips.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll get more fitting things later. For now, let\u2019s just go,\u201d Duncan said, grinning as he walked behind Geoff and he got to watch his bear from behind with those thick beefy shoulders, gorgeous golden locks of hair, wide back, and nicely bouncing butt which it had not done before. Geoff was already beefing up before their eyes and Duncan loved just how big his bear had gotten already. The gains would eventually slow down but for now were clipping along at a fast pace with the major sudden changes in eating and Geoff clearly had gained a bit more than either had thought which was exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the gym, Geoff could really feel the eyes on him and Duncan holding his hand and glaring at anyone who stared for too long, causing people to look away. While Geoff was committed to gaining and beefing up, he still was a bit shy of being stared at like that and the faint looks of disgust at his belly like he was some ex-jock who let a bit too much go and gone to seed did not make him feel particularly well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIgnore them, they mean nothing,\u201d Duncan said under his breath squeezing Geoff\u2019s hand as they took their usual spot of workout that was known to be theirs. Although Duncan was not the biggest or strongest person in there, and actually kind of far from the league of DJ, Geoff, etc, no one dared mess with Duncan whose bad-ass attitude, reputation, and death stare kept most people afraid of him which Geoff thought kind of funny because Duncan was one of the nicest people he knew and a bit of a sweet heart, although that might be only to people he liked. On the other hand, he did see Duncan go nuclear on someone once and he never wanted to see that again as Duncan really was scary. <br>\r\n\u201cHey amigos,\u201d came the sultry voice of Alejandro, one of the very few people who was not terrified of Duncan. Alejandro leaned against the wall watching them his bright green eyes glistening innocence although all three were aware Alejandro was far from the angelic being people often took him to be. They had a weird relationship with him and Duncan and Geoff were never really sure if Alejandro really wanted to be friends or was just messing with their minds so they sort of considered him a friend although Duncan withheld trust in that department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Alejandro,\u201d Duncan said carefully and Alejandro smiled a bit flashing teeth as he was well aware and understanding of their reluctance. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you guys have gone through a few changes,\u201d Alejandro said, his eyes flickering to look at Geoff and then back to Duncan. Duncan crossed his arms and looked edgy, trying to figure out what Alejandro\u2019s angle was, if he was insulting them or like what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to ya?\u201d Alejandro shrugged his shoulders and Geoff was a little nervous. Alejandro was a pretty big guy and although not to the same extent as Geoff or DJ, easily outweighed and outmuscled Duncan, and was potentially even more vicious should he choose to be as Alejandro was legendary at their school\u2019s hockey and wrestling team. Duncan had to be careful in how he dealt with Alejandro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. I just wanted to say that Geoff looks pretty good like this,\u201d he said, surprising both of them. <br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Duncan and Geoff asked startled at this unexpected comment. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, very much so. His frame had always been more of a powerlifter or beefy guy anyways. I always had been kind of disappointed that he had abs to be honest so think this is a good turn of events.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cUh, thank you?\u201d Geoff said confusedly while Duncan fumed. Alejandro smirked at Duncan. <br>\r\n\u201cDown boy, I was just giving a compliment, no need for the stare. I just wanted to say congratulations and finally for you doing what should have been done earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoes everyone think this?\u201d Geoff asked interested. If Alejandro thought this then maybe other people did too and he was just paranoid. <br>\r\n\u201cAlas no. We three are among a minority in this respect.\u201d Alejandro gave Geoff a longer look over, running his eyes up and down appreciatively. <br>\r\n\u201cCan I touch?\u201d and Duncan growled but did not stop him as Alejandro put his hands on Geoff\u2019s exposed belly and trailed up to his beefy chest and back down rubbing it.<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Alejandro said, his voice having a tinge of warmth for once.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s mine,\u201d Duncan said and Alejandro turned and looked at him as they engaged in a stare off, Duncan glaring and Alejandro looking back almost blankly before Alejandro finally turned away from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Alejandro said looking back at Geoff. \u201cAs pretty as you are, I can see you\u2019re taken. That\u2019s okay, I have someone else in mind.\u201d Alejandro looked across the room and they both followed his gaze and saw him looking at Tyler who was clumsily trying to shoot a basket and fell on the floor. Duncan and Geoff both looked at each other and back at Alejandro. Alejandro noticed their looks and he shrugged almost dejectedly. \u201cYes, I know, Tyler really? But there\u2019s just something\u2026\u201d they all winced when Tyler epically fell on the floor again. \u201cabout him\u2026ugh, I\u2019m going to go help him. See you guys later.\u201d With that, Alejandro went across the gym to where Tyler was and helped him up, whispering something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho would have thought?\u201d asked Geoff when it was safe. <br>\r\n\u201cI know. That is just\u2026unexpected,\u201d Duncan replied. <br>\r\n\u201cI mean Alejandro and Tyler\u2026?\u201d Geoff said and Duncan finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. Let\u2019s just get to working out.\u201d Duncan put him through a very rigorous routine of benchpress, curls, squats, deadlifts, and variants. By the time Geoff was done, he was sore in every part of his body and sweat drenched his ill-fitting uniform. That was probably the hardest workout he\u2019d ever done in his life but also highly successful as his muscles were pumped and bulging which Duncan admired, rubbing them as he cooed compliments in Geoff\u2019s ear about his Big Bear which Geoff could barely understand over the blood rush in his head and how tired he felt. Duncan was a bit tired as well but he held back a little just so he could get the nice rushing pump and feeling of exhilaration but not to exhaustion as he knew he was going to need to help Geoff out. Struggling, they went back out and Geoff slid into the car with a groan as Duncan buckled himself in and they drove back to Geoff\u2019s house where Geoff was walk-dragged to the couch and collapsed there, not wanting to move. Duncan leaned down and tried to peel off Geoff\u2019s uniform for him but it was so attached to him that Duncan got irritated and got out his knife and actually cut it off him which felt like such a relief to Geoff as air hit his bare skin. Duncan leaned down and rubbed him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later my big bear. Have nice sweet dreams.\u201d Geoff yawned and Duncan rubbed his head as Geoff closed his eyes sleepily. <br>\r\n\u201cNigh Duncan,\u201d Geoff mumbled and was out like a light as soon as his eyes closed. Duncan stood there for a moment, and then went up to take a shower. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duncan walked back in from his shower dressed in only his skull boxers and saw Geoff's massive body passed out on the couch.  His right arm across his growing belly while the other arm hung limp over the side of the couch.  Duncan smiled warmly at his big, sleeping bear and knelt down, rubbing the bottom of Geoff's bigger belly.  He smiled at how soft it was, and he squeezed it, his smile widening as he felt it.  He stood up and gave Geoff's broad shoulders a shake, \"Geoff.. Geoff, wake up.\"  Geoff groaned slightly, but didn't budge.  Duncan chuckled, \"I guess you're to tired to get up.  That's okay, I'll just make sure to feed you more to make up for missing dinner.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan yawned and stretched his lean body, feeling his eyes getting heavy with sleep.  He considered getting his clothes back on and driving home, but he soon realized how sleepy he was and knew it was a bad idea.  The last thing he wanted was to wrap his car around a tree because he fell asleep.  Duncan started to walk back upstairs to Geoff's room when an idea came to mind.  Duncan walked back over to Geoff's sleeping form and moved the one thick arm on his stomach, lied down, and placed his head on Geoff's belly.  A sleep smile spread across his face as he felt it sink into Geoff's squishy gut.  He placed Geoff's hand around his shoulders and wrapped his arms around the blonde's wide body before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff groaned as his eyes opened slowly, blinking a few times to try and get the sleep out of them.  He raised one large hand up and rubbed his eye, yawning loudly.  Geoff tried to sit up but quickly realized there was pressure on his lower torso.  He leaned forward slightly so he could see over his chest and a warm smile grew across his face.  He never would have thought Duncan was a cuddler, or that he could look so cute asleep, but he was and did.  Geoff rubbed Duncan's back as he laid his head back down, ready to go back to sleep, but his stomach let out a loud gurgle.  Geoff sighed, 'I'm sleepy, but I'm also really hungry.  I don't wanna wake up Duncan though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\"<br>\r\nGeoff lifted himself up with his elbows and looked down at Duncan, who still had his arms wrapped around Geoff's wide body.  His eyes were half open and he had the biggest smile Geoff had ever seen on Duncan.  Geoff smiled back, \"Morning, Coach.\"<br>\r\nDuncan sat up and placed both hands on Geoff's fat belly, squeezing it, \"Is my Big Bear hungry?  I heard your belly grumble.\"<br>\r\nGeoff laughed, rubbing the back of his head, \"Yeah, I am.  What's on the menu for today?\"<br>\r\nDuncan rubbed Geoff's belly happily before his hands slowly slid up to Geoff's thick, beefy pecs, which Geoff flexed and bounced as Duncan groped them, \"I'm not sure yet, but my Big Bear missed his dinner last night.  I'm gonna have to feed you extra today.\"<br>\r\nGeoff nodded, \"Okay.\"  The two sat there in silence for a bit, Geoff enjoying the feeling of Duncan's amazing hands exploring his new beefy body.  As Duncan's hands was fondling Geoff's thick thighs, Geoff cleared his throat, \"Hey, Duncan.  I have a question... I mean, you've been calling me your 'Big Bear' for the last few days and we've started holding hands and everything, and what you said to Al yesterday at the gym.  Are we a couple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan smiled at Geoff and his hands slid back to Geoff's belly, looking up at him, \"Well, if you want to be.  Cause I kinda do.\"<br>\r\nGeoff blinked, \"What about Courtney?\"<br>\r\n\"We broke up MONTHS ago.  About a month before you and Bridgette did.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... So, do I have to come up with a cute pet name for you now?\"<br>\r\n\"You can just keep calling me coach.  I like it a lot.\"<br>\r\nGeoff gave off one of his big, goofy grins and Duncan couldn't help but smile back.  He patted Geoff's belly, \"I just want to make one thing clear, okay?  Just because I'm super cuddly with you, does not mean I'm not a badass anymore.\"<br>\r\nGeoff laughed heartily, \"I never once questioned your bad-ass-itude, Coach.\"<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now, I think it's time I feed my big bear his breakfast.\"  Duncan pushed himself off of the couch and walked into the kitchen to start cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, cause I'm gonna go shower up.  I stink from last night.\"  Geoff said, pushing his large body off the couch.  As much as he wanted to admire his big muscles and belly, he was starving.  Geoff pulled his boxers off, washed up quickly, dried his body off, and put on a clean pair once he was in his bedroom.  Geoff had intended to get in and out so he could eat, but he was having a hard time finding clothes that fit his new physic.  He smiled as he finally found something he could wear, a pair of shorts that he bought a few sized bigger.  He slipped them on and was surprised at how perfectly they fit him now.  Geoff threw on another skin tight tank top, much like the one he wore yesterday, and went down stairs to meet Duncan for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Duncan saw Geoff in that snug tanktop, his face instantly lite up.  He loved seeing his new boyfriend's massive pecs and big belly stuffed into tight shirts like that.  He eyed Geoff's bouncing belly, which was barely covered by the tank, as he walked over to Duncan.  Geoff looked over his breakfast and grinned, there was a large stack of 6 pancakes, a plate with huge portions of scrambled eggs and bacon, and a separate plate for just hash brown. \"Wow, Duncan, you're a really fast cook!!\"<br>\r\nDuncan chuckled and patted Geoff's belly, \"You were gone for an hour, Bear.  I was about to come find you.  Now, since you missed dinner, you have to fit all of this into this.\"  Duncan said, smacking Geoff's belly and loving the thick sound it made, \"You're allowed to take breaks, but all of this has to be gone.  How else will my Big Bear get bigger if he doesn't eat?\"<br>\r\nGeoff smiled at his boyfriend, \"Sure thing, Coach.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Disclaimer: Does not go further than flirty making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan smiled as he watched Geoff dig hungrily into his breakfast. Up until a short time ago, Geoff wouldn\u2019t have ever done that, well without complaining of carbs and fat, almost like one of those annoying girls. But now Geoff would probably eat everything put in front of him, even vegetables although that would certainly get a (rather cute) nose wrinkle and snort. He\u2019d seen it done before a few times although that had been earlier although he bet Geoff still did that now\u2026he was going to have to test that out later. Anyways, Geoff was becoming a hale hearty eater and Duncan approved very, very much as he saw that shirt squeeze tighter as his belly peeked out even more than it already was, which was a lot. He couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t thought of this before, the results were marvelous on his big bear. Geoff looked up for a second, smiling before realizing he still had food in his mouth that spilled out and Duncan giggled. Yes, he actually giggled and Geoff was frozen, fork in midair, just staring at him in shock. Duncan laughed even harder and Geoff looked like he thought Duncan had lost his mind while the laughter died down and Duncan took in a few shuddering breaths, getting back under control.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t just sit there and stare, keep eating!\u201d Duncan snarled and Geoff blanched as he started shoveling eggs into his mouth. <br>\r\n\u201cYef coach, mmf sorry,\u201d Geoff said terrified which was both amusing and irritatingly guilt inducing as Duncan wrapped his arms around his bear. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, didn\u2019t mean to snap at you\u2026\u201d Duncan said, trying to apologize and Geoff paused between his bites. <br>\r\n\u201cI know, just felt like messing with you,\u201d he said grinning and Duncan for real wanted to punch that smirk off his face although he got an even better idea as he took Geoff\u2019s spoon and shoved it in his mouth and forced him to swallow, Geoff choking a bit. <br>\r\n\u201cJust keep eating,\u201d Duncan said sitting abruptly down onto Geoff\u2019s lap causing a \u2018whoompf\u2019. Duncan reached over and began caressing Geoff\u2019s chest and slipping mouthfuls of food in while Geoff sat there stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, so big and beefy and manly,\u201d Duncan continued seductively running his fingers slowly up and down. \u201cYeah, I do love me some beef, don\u2019t you? Such a BIG bear like you...\u201d Geoff was almost drooling when all of a sudden, Duncan got off his lap and returned to the other table. <br>\r\n\u201cNope, you haven\u2019t finished all your food yet,\u201d he said smirking at Geoff\u2019s crestfallen expression. \u201cDo be a good bear and eat it all for your big hibernating bulk.\u201d Geoff rolled his eyes but continued eating, a bit faster, keeping his eyes on Duncan as Duncan looked on in fascination and amazement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Geoff began to slow and feel a bit full as he slowly scraped up the remaining bits of eggs and bacon. Duncan looked confused at these actions as he came back over. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Big Bear?\u201d Duncan asked and Geoff painfully pointed at his stomach which caused Duncan to smirk. Leaning down, he undid the button of Geoff\u2019s pants for him and there was an audible sigh of relief from that direction as Geoff\u2019s belly spilled out to fill the place. The tank could no longer really contain his belly at all right now. Suddenly Geoff let out a big rumbling belch which caused Geoff to blush when Duncan said \u201cbetter out than in which means more room in my Big Bear\u2019s tummy,\u201d grinning mischievously the whole time as he rubbed the bloated gut a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill more to go, those 3 remaining pancakes and hashbrowns are waiting for you, calling out \u2018Big Bear, Big Bear, eat us to fill your sexy gut Big Bear!\u2019\u201d Geoff gave him the evil eye for a few seconds before moaning in pleasure as Duncan started massaging his belly with his quite talented magic hands as they moved over, kneading and playing. Duncan leaned closer, whispering in Geoff\u2019s ear. <br>\r\n\u201cSo what is your response?\u201d and Geoff grinned as he took his fork again and dug in with renewed vigor. <br>\r\n\u201cAye aye coach! This food wants to be in my gut and there in it it shall go!\u201d Duncan smirked as he patted Geoff\u2019s belly fondly. <br>\r\n\u201cGood boy, that\u2019s the right decision, easy does it now, don\u2019t want you to be sick\u2026\u201d Duncan continued massaging Geoff\u2019s belly while Geoff finished off the rest of the food before leaning back and sighing happily as he gives out an even more humongous belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrppppppppppppppp, aw man that feels good! So glad it\u2019s just us dudes. If there were girls, I\u2019d never have been allowed that.\u201d Duncan grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, we couldn\u2019t have that could we? Not from such a manly stud like you. That is so manly and impressive and a sign of great enjoyment of my cooking, that I did my job correct in filling up a Big Bear like you. How full are you Big Bear?\u201d Geoff was confused by the question before looking at Duncan and realizing Duncan was playing a game because Duncan had the game face on. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, Big Bear is very full coach. Big Bear is stuffed from all your delicious food.\u201d Duncan grinned wider, his eyes with humor and amusement as he gave Geoff\u2019s belly a quick jiggle and squeeze, it remaining solid. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, Big Bear really is stuffed like real bear. Big Bear\u2019s coach likes a lot.\u201d Duncan nuzzled his head against Geoff\u2019s wide back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig Bear so big, he needs new clothes in although for now, we could do without,\u201d Duncan said slyly, and Geoff chuckled even sounding like a bear which almost made Duncan laugh and lose the game as Geoff and Duncan struggled to get Geoff\u2019s tight shirt off and pulled down his pants so he was just in boxers. Geoff gave him a look and Duncan smirked as he with agonizing slowness unbuttoned his button shirt until Geoff got so frustrated that Geoff pretty much ripped it off him (it was worth the loss of his shirt, he didn\u2019t like it and was getting to get a new one later anyhow) and wavered as Duncan pulled down his pants as well . <br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Geoff asked and Duncan smirked. <br>\r\n\u201cWanna make out?\u201d Geoff gave a big smile at that. <br>\r\n\u201cHeck yeah, party on.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had started to get a little heated when all of a sudden the doorbell rang, causing Geoff to look towards the door and Duncan to sigh in annoyance and want to kill whoever it was that dared to interrupt what had been beginning to look like at the very min a freaking hot makeout session if not further. Geoff was blushing a little and Duncan stomped to the door and slammed the door open, as he glared at who was standing there. For the love of all that was good, it had to be HIM that interrupted like always. Duncan had to physically restrain himself from launching at the guy and he still might have had Geoff not gone up sensing the oncoming commotion and knowing how Duncan was when seeing Alejandro. The Spanish guy leaned in the doorway, nonchalant and admittedly Geoff wanted to let Duncan go and have a swing at him. But only for a moment. Still, what was he doing there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al, what are you doing here?\" Geoff asked since Duncan wasn't going to as he was too busy staring death glares at Alejandro right now for interrupting their activities. <br>\r\n\"I want what you're doing,\" Alejandro said, taking the time to ogle Geoff which made Geoff uncomfortable and Duncan possessively jealous. But then what Alejandro admitted sunk in the silence and both Geoff and Duncan looked up surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Geoff asked, surprised. This was a surprise. Seeing the stunned, disbelieving looks on their faces Alejandro groaned as he realized how that sounded. <br>\r\n\"No, not for me numbskulls, I meant for Tyler. I've just been noticing how...big Geoff here is lately and it does have quite considerable charm if I do say so myself,\" Alejandro rolled his eyes at Duncan's renewed struggles to get away from Geoff and launch himself at him. \"Geez, can you be any more obvious? I mean really. Geoff is cool and all and if he was single, I wouldn't mind getting a piece of that hunky man but I do respect relationships despite what you may think. And as it is, I want Tyler at the moment so no need to go all wild man on me.\" Duncan calmed down slightly at hearing that and a whispered promise Geoff gave him if he promised to be good and not do anything stupid. Geoff warily let go, ready to grab Duncan in case Duncan tried to start fighting again because Duncan never was predictable around Alejandro or vice versa. Duncan gave a smile to Geoff and stepped aside a bit and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is this about Tyler?\u201d Duncan asked, his eyebrows lifting a little. Alejandro blushed, his tan face darkening a little. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I kind of like him as you know\u2026course, he\u2019s kind of oblivious as you can probably understand and I\u2019ve never really been good at exposing myself to others\u2026\u201d Duncan gave a snort and Alejandro looked up, a bit pissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry dude, it\u2019s just that, you being afraid of exposing yourself\u2026\u201d Geoff said, struggling not to laugh himself and Duncan couldn\u2019t help but do so. <br>\r\n\u201cYou danced naked with only those straps for the entire school once during bloody lunchtime and you say you\u2019re scared of straight out telling Tyler you like him? That\u2019s hilarious,\u201d Duncan said laughing and Alejandro just sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, it\u2019s embarrassing! But that\u2019s different and I really like him\u2026and before you ask, I don\u2019t know why, I just do and I feel all different around him compared to everyone else and he is freaking oblivious and it just hurts so much\u2026\u201d Alejandro trailed off and Duncan and Geoff were surprised because Alejandro genuinely seemed to really like Tyler which admittedly they thought was a bit of a joke or boredom since Alejandro had a reputation of buzzing around but looking at him now\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cBack on track, what is it you need from us again?\u201d Geoff asked and Alejandro looked at him hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know Tyler and how he always wants to be good at sports but never really seems to do them very well? I was thinking maybe you could talk him into doing something, oh I don\u2019t know, with the heavy lifting. It would not only capitalize on his strengths but do everyone a favor since it would get Tyler away from the sports arena and injuring everyone and himself? And he always says he wants to be bigger and stronger and well, I just thought of you guys and how well it works for you and I want that with me and Tyler. And, not that he isn\u2019t sexy right now but can you imagine how awesome it would be to bulk up a bit?\u201d Alejandro\u2019s eyes brightened at the thought and Duncan understood totally and emphasized. Maybe Alejandro wasn\u2019t so bad, he was acting differently from how he used to be all snooty and high almighty. He rather liked this change and Alejandro actually wasn\u2019t so bad when he didn\u2019t act all superior all the time (though Duncan grudgingly admitted Alejandro was in many areas compared to most people, it still was irritating to be reminded of it). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, how can we help you?\u201d Duncan asked and Geoff had the gall to actually look shocked as did Alejandro. Alejandro blinked in surprise, then pleasure. That was easier than he thought, he thought that it would take a lot more than that to win Duncan over considering their past relationship. A bit too easy\u2026Alejandro kept calm as he cast a critical look over Duncan. He wasn\u2019t sure if this was a trick or not but for now, he was just going to keep watch until he knew for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe you, Geoff, me, and Tyler could go on a friendly outing?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cA double date?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like that,\u201d Alejandro said. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Duncan said thinking about it. A double date with Alejandro and Tyler? That might or might not end in disaster. Alejandro straightened up and shrugged his shoulders. <br>\r\n\u201cJust think about it. You know how to contact me,\u201d Alejandro said, winking a little as he strolled off.

Duncan chuckled and unwrapped his arms, \"You should go get dressed, big guy.  We need to go shopping for food before we go out tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Coach!!\"  Geoff gave Duncan a kiss on the forehead and headed towards the bedroom.  Duncan smacked Geoff's bubble butt as he walked before grinning and pulling his cellphone out to text Al.  Geoff made it into his bedroom and he started to go through his closet, trying to find something to wear, but Geoff quickly realized that almost nothing he had fit him.  Everything was too tight on him; his button ups wouldn't button, his thick arms tore his t-shirt sleeves, and he could barely fit a pair of his shorts on around his wide waist.  After about ten minutes, Geoff was finally able to find an outfit that fit him; a black and pink striped tank top that clung to his chest and belly, and a pair of cargo shorts that showed off his bubble butt nicely.  Geoff sighed, \"Well, it's still tight, but at least it covers everything up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff walked into the front room and a grin spread across Duncan's face instantly.  Geoff rubbed the back of his head and laughed, \"It's uh...  It's a little tight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan put both his hands on Geoff's belly and rubbed it, \"Just how I like it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff felt his face flush, \"You know, D, maybe we should get me some new clothes?  This is kinda the only outfit I have that fits anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan smiled, \"Sure thing, Baby.  While we're at the mall we'll feed this belly of yours first.  That way we'll know what size to get you when you're stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of driving, Geoff and Duncan reached the mall and headed inside, \"Where do you wanna eat first, Bear?\"  Duncan asked as he interlaced his fingers with Geoff's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff scratched his chin as they walked towards the food court, but once they got there the intoxicating scent of cheeseburgers took over.  Without even saying anything Geoff headed straight towards the burger place and Duncan followed, being pulled along by his big bear.  Duncan pulled out his credit card and smiled, \"Go ahead and order anything you want, big guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wide, goofy grin spread across Geoff's face and he made sure to make a big order so he could get even bigger for his coach.  Geoff ordered two triple cheese burgers, a large order of fries, and an extra large Dr. pepper.  Duncan paid and as soon as the order was up, the two sat down and Geoff dug in.  Duncan sat next to him the whole time, rubbing his belly and encouraging his bear to eat more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes, Geoff leaned back in his seat, rubbing his stuffed belly with his massive hand, \"Oh man, that was so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan smiled, patting Geoff's solid stomach, \"Look at you.  A few days ago you would have stopped after just one burger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff grinned, \"YEP.  To be honest, Coach... I'm still hungry.\"  Those were three of Duncan's favorite words.  He rubbed the bottom of Geoff's belly, which was peaking out of his tank top, and told Geoff to wait here while he went and got his Big Bear a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan comes back with...</span></div></div>",

Amazing discounts for a newly opened store. Anyways, I know how much you love chocolate.\" Duncan grinned a little at Geoff, remembering the cake he left him. Man, if only he could have seen or gotten a tape of it. Oh well, he'll just do it next time. Geoff looked up at the treat and wasn't sure whether to drool, cry, or both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mountain of vanilla icecream covered with chunks of fudge and chocolate sauce, sprinkles, and of course the cute little cherries on top like little flags. Geoff looked over at Duncan and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach, you're amazing but I don't know if I can eat all that,\" Geoff said, his smile turning into a frown at the but. \"Not if I want to have dinner tonight. Plus, I may still have room left over after that absolutely delicious lunch but not that much.\" Duncan shrugged as he affectionately rubbed Geoff's belly. Now that they were together, Duncan was very touchy-feely with Geoff which was different than when he used to be more aloof hands-offish not wanting to touch anyone longer than necessary. Geoff found it cute and adorable how his coach took such good care of him and others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I was hoping to share anyways. It does look really good you know, just like you.\" Duncan said playfully. Geoff widened his eyes in mock hurt. <br>\r\n\"I'm a large bowl of icecream to you?\" Duncan smirked, as he trailed his eyes up and down Geoff's body for him to see. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Large, sweet, and deliciously good. I just want to eat you up, metaphorically speaking.\" Duncan added. \"Except of course you don't melt, unless I make you.\" Geoff smirked back; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone should wash your mouth out with soap you dirty talker you,\" Geoff said and Duncan cocked his eyebrows seductively. <br>\r\n\"You can clean my mouth anytime with yours.\" Geoff looked around at some people who were beginning to stare at them. It wasn't like they were exactly keeping their voices down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's just stop talking about this, people are beginning to stare.\" Duncan grinned and pulled Geoff closer to him. <br>\r\n\"Hey everybody, this is Bear, and he's my-mmfff\" Geoff covered Duncan's mouth. <br>\r\n\"Ignore him,\" Geoff said and people broke away bored now that there wasn't anything interesting going on. When they were gone, Geoff let go of Duncan. Duncan grinned at Geoff and Geoff despite himself grinned back. Duncan took out two spoons and gave one to Geoff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, there's a big sundae waiting for us to eat it,\" Duncan said looking at it.<br>\r\n\"Okay Coach,\" Geoff said getting ready and on Duncan's signal, they both dug into the sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as everything that it had been promised, better in fact.Duncan thought it was one of the most delicious things he ever tasted and Geoff was sure enjoying it because of the moanings and groanings of pleasure. Despite the large size, it was soon gone the lion paw's majority of it of course in his bear's belly but a decent amount in his as well and if Duncan felt stuffed, he couldn't imagine what Bear was feeling. Duncan looked over to see Geoff nearly passed out, his eyes glazed and unfocused and totally in pain as he rubbed his showing belly. The tanktop had rolled up even further and Geoff's belly looked and felt completely solid, about to explode at any moment.Duncan forced himself over and started rubbing Geoff's belly soothingly as well. Letting out a massive belch, Geoff moaned again opening one eye weariy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrpppppppp, Oh god, I think I'm goimg to explode. This is the end for me.\" Duncan rolled his eyes as he continued to apply pressure causing Geoff to do another series of belches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit, that might have been overdoing it and a bit of a mistake but that sure was good wasn't it?\" Geoff slumped his head in agreement of Duncan's comment. It was good, so could he couldn't have stopped himself if he tried. Which he had no desire for, he just didn't think he'd even eat that much. When one thought about it, he'd never thought he'd eat this much or do what he was doing and Duncan was right, in only a matter of days he had changed his whole life around completely and it was like something was unlocked inside him. The beast, so to speak. Geoff groaned in pleasure again as Duncan rubbed and massaged his way overstuffed belly and belched a couple more times in relief. Duncan was phenomenal, he had no idea how but Duncan was gifted at this. Opening his eyes, he grinned weakly at Coach, dully noting the irony which would appear much funnier later but right now, Geoff was too focused on his pain. Coach's belly was also bloated a little and peaked out of his tight shirt as well. While the bloat wouldn't last for long, it was still weird to see Duncan even sporting a little gut compared to the fact that most of the time his stomach was flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you go,\" Duncan said all of a sudden and Geoff felt himself being pushed up out of the chair and with a groan Geoff was standing but he wobbled a little before Duncan supported him although both were a little too wobbly for nomal walking. Geoff groaned, wanting nothing more than to take a nap and not get up for a while but Duncan kept him up with his shoulder and was preventing him from falling asleep and it kept Duncan awake as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Geoff, we need to get you some clothes,\" Duncan said as he began walking them towards the shopping part of the mall. Geoff groaned even more in reluctance and Duncan nodded in commiseration. \"I feel you but it's best to do it now as we'll probably forget to do it later or won't have time to. After all, that tight tanktop is all you have right now and I see a lot of your beautiful sexy gut as does everyone else which is not what we need right now. I might as well buy new clothes for myself as well.\" Duncan patted Geoff's stuffed belly as he also rubbed his own. Geoff drew Duncan closer to him and despite feeling absolutely crappy (understatement), he was just happy to be with his wonderful coach. </span></div></div>",

Duncan chuckled and patted his boyfriend's stomach, \"You feeling better?\"  Geoff smiled down at Duncan, \"Yeah.  I'm still incredibly bloated but I'm better.\"  Duncan rubbed his bear's belly lovingly, \"That's good.  Now, let's get you some new clothes, bear.\"  Duncan, who wasn't very knowledgeable when it came to this brand of clothing, let Geoff pick out everything he wanted.  After about forty minutes of looking, Geoff was holding a large pile of clothes as the two headed towards the dressing room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan, unfortunately, had to wait outside while Geoff got dressed, \"Dumbass store rules...\" he mumbled, wishing he was in there dressing his big bear.  Geoff separated the pile of clothes into two different piles; shirts and pants.  He grabbed the first thing on the top of the list, an extra large tank top, and put it on, \"I thought so...  It fits the same as the one I was already wearing...\"  Geoff went through the pile of t-shirts, patterned button ups, and tanks, keeping the one that fit over his bloated belly - XXL - before handing the pile that didn't back to Duncan, \"Babe, can you go get all of these but one size bigger?\"  Geoff asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan sighed, \"Only for my big bear.\"  Duncan went back to shopping while Geoff tried on the pants and shorts he'd picked out.  He had better luck with those, only finding a few pairs that didn't fit.  The cargo shorts he wore when they came in were a size 38 in the waist, and they fit him just fine, but he knew he'd need bigger soon, so Geoff decided to get the 40s.  He walked back out just as Duncan came back with the bigger shirts, \"Are you done?\"  Duncan asked.  Geoff nodded and Duncan pouted.  He really wanted watch his bear get dressed.  Geoff gave Duncan a kiss on the forehead, \"I'll make it up to you.  Tonight, you can stuff me with as much food as you want.\"  Duncan's face light up with excitement and the two went to go pay.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan used the credit card his parents had given him to buy the clothes that Geoff had picked out, as well as some boxers Duncan would love to see Geoff in, and the two left.  \"So,\" Geoff asked while carrying the bags, \"When are having that double date with Tyler and Al?\"  Duncan rubbed the back of his neck, \"Tomorrow night.  Al's gonna tell Tyler about the whole thing before hand.\"  Geoff smiled and wrapped one thick arm around Duncan's shoulder, \"I'm fine with that.  So, what next?\"  Duncan shrugged, \"I don't know...  What do you wanna do now?  You're still too full to eat yet.\"  Duncan said, rubbing Geoff's slightly softened belly.  Geoff thought about and decided...</span></div></div>",

I just want you.\" Geoff blushed a bit. <br>\r\n\"Aww, really? All I want is you too. But I still want to treat you as well since you've done so much for me. I insist.\" <br>\r\n\"Well if you must...\" Duncan said giving in. Geoff smiled brightly. <br>\r\n\"Awesome! You're going to love this!\" <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Duncan asked, raising his eyebrow. Duncan was always suspicious of surprises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet but I'll find something!\" Duncan shrugged and followed behind Geoff admiring the new clothes although he certainly had enjoyed the ones that clung to him. Fortunately he had convinced Geofff to keep them until he couldn't get them on at all and the only thing better would be to take them off. Mmmh that would be good. He loved his bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff was leading them on a merry trail through the mall looking at various stores and Duncan wondered where it was they were going until suddenly Geoff went into a fancy clothes shop. Duncan stopped in surprise and Geoff looked backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"You're not serious are you?\" Duncan asked looking at the clothes. \"I always hated dressing up. I always threw a fit whenever my mom put me into fancy clothing.\" <br>\r\n\"I think you'll look good.\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know you knew what a store like this is, you're like the epitome of casual.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I've worn suits before. And yes, you're right, they are awful but they look awesome.\" <br>\r\n\"And your point?\" <br>\r\n\"You'd look good in a suit. Like really good.\" <br>\r\n\"No.\" Duncan said automatically. <br>\r\n\"No really I think you would.\" <br>\r\n\"No, no, no, I will not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff ended up buying Duncan a black jacket, hat, shirt, and jacket despite Duncan trying to say no but Geoff used his own money and then employed the look that made Duncan melt from cuteness that Geoff pulled out whenever he really felt like it. He also got cool fingerless gloves so it wasn't all bad. It wasn't like the clothes were awful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they aren't terrible,\" Duncan said grudgingly when he saw them. \"It'd be better not to get any at all but I guess if I must wear something...and anything but that green monstrosity you wanted me to wear earlier.\" Geoff just grinned because Duncan had really hated that green jacket and thought it looked like puke. Geoff did too but he wasn't going to tell Duncan that and it managed to convince him to accept things that would look better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to do something for else for you,\" Geoff said and Duncan stopped. <br>\r\n\"If it's more clothes, the answer is no.\" he said brusquely. \"You already bought some for me.\" Geoff chuckled. <br>\r\n\"No, I was thinking something else. Something I know you'll prefer.\" Duncan looked at Geoff more interested. <br>\r\n\"Oh? What would that be?\" Duncan asked and Geoff caught Duncan. Leaning down he gave a big kiss and just as soon as Duncan started responding, he pulled off. <br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" he said smirking. <br>\r\n\"Only one?\" Duncan asked questioningly. \"That seems...skimpy. I want another.\" Geoff grinned widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command Coach,\" he said, squeezing Duncan against him and kissing him harder. Duncan responded tightening against him and inserted tongue which Duncan won. Geoff moaned into the kiss as Duncan took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good,\" Duncan panted against him. \"I love you.\" <br>\r\n\"Love...love you too Duncan,\" Geoff said breathelessly. Duncan slipped his hand under Geoff's shirt before stopping. <br>\r\n\"I changed my mind. Let's go somewhere more private. The things I want to do to you...\" Duncan said looking around. <br>\r\n\"Really? In a mall?\" Geoff said rolling his eyes. \"Anyone could come in at any moment.\" <br>\r\n\"Let's go home,\" Duncan said, his eyes dilated as he looked Geoff up and down. \"You look so incredible.\" <br>\r\n\"Uh, thank you? Should I drive?\" <br>\r\n\"If you want,\" Duncan said as he eyed Geoff.<br>\r\n\"Okay, we should go before you literally undress me instead of undressing me with your eyes.\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n\"But you look so sexy,\" Duncan purred. Geoff rolled his eyes and pulled Duncan with him to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, let's go home.\" Squeezing into the seat, Geoff's belly came pretty close to the wheel and he almost banged his head. Okay, he liked growing but there were certain disadvantages like this and clothes. Oh well. He managed to keep Duncan off untill they got home and as soon as they got in the door, Duncan growled and tackled him to the floor laying kisses as he yanked Geoff's shirt off surprisingly fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Bear,\" Duncan between breaths. <br>\r\n\"I love you too Coach,\" Geoff said stunned. Duncan was going slower now as he started biting and sucking. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n\"Marking and worshipping you.\" Duncan said as he licked at a spot that made Geoff jerk. <br>\r\n\"Hah, more like tickling.\" Geoff said and felt fear as an expression came onto Duncan's face.<br>\r\n\"Ticklish when I do this?\" he said licking again and grinned as Geoff groaned and did it again. <br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't,\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n\"I would,\" Duncan said before continuing to lick and tickle as Geoff writhed under him laughing helplessly. </span></div></div>",

He stirred in his sleep and slowly opened his eyes, blinking them a few times before sitting up and pulling himself out of bed.  Without thinking, Geoff put on his pajama pants and his skin tight pink and black tank top -his belly now sticking out of the bottom no matter how much he tried to hide it- and walked into the kitchen, following the scent of amazing food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Geoff reached the kitchen, he smiled sleepily at Duncan, who was cooking a big meal for Geoff, \"Mornin'...\" He said sleepily.<br>\r\nDuncan turned around, smiled, and walked over, wrapping his arms around Geoff's wide middle and kissing him softly on the lips, \"Morning.  Did my big bear sleep well?\"<br>\r\nGeoff chuckled, \"After everything we just went though, of course I did.  What's all this?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm making my big Bear a special dinner!  All of his favorite foods: ribs, a few burgers, a LOT of mashed potatoes, and for a dessert a nice big chocolate cake.\"  Duncan said with a bit of mischievous in his voice.  No matter how much Geoff ate, Duncan knew Geoff couldn't say no to chocolate cake.<br>\r\n\"Not fair.\" Geoff said jokingly, \"I could never turn down your chocolate cake, Coach.\"<br>\r\n\"That's the point.\"  Duncan's hands trailed across Geoff's large pecs and down his big, soft stomach, pinching the bit of flab that poked out of the bottom of his tank top,  \"God, Geoff you have no idea how much I love this tank top on you..  It's so snug.\"<br>\r\nGeoff smiled and flexed his big arm, which made Duncan lean in and kiss his bicep, \"Tomorrow before our double date we'll go to the gym and get you a work out.\"  Duncan said, patting Geoff's belly, \"But lets give fill this up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan set Geoff down at the table and brought in two massive plates: one with a huge stack of barbeque ribs and mashed potatoes, the other with a couple double cheese burgers with fries.  Duncan set down a full bottle of soda and sat down next to Geoff, who had picked up a burger and just started chowing down.  Duncan watched, mesmerized by his big bear's big appetite.  Geoff finished the first burger and moved onto the second one, eating a few fries in between bites, and before he knew it, they were gone and in his growing belly.  Geoff opened the soda and put the bottle to his lips, chugging half of it before setting it down and letting out a massive belch, \"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP.\", before going right back into eating.  He tore into the stack of bbq ribs and just started inhaling the meat off of the bones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan watched, completely in love with Geoff, as he gorged himself on his cooking.  The ribs were gone and Geoff devoured the mashed potatoes just as quickly, picking up the soda and and swallowing the last of it before slouching back in his seat and letting another huge burp, \"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP....  WOOH.\"  <br>\r\nDuncan leaned in and rubbed his hands on Geoff's bloated, solid belly, \"My big bear is getting to be such a good eater.  I'm gonna have to start making even more food.\" he said as he massaged Geoff's growing, stuffed belly.</span></div></div>",

You're going to help me do the same with Tyler.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't you do it yourself?\" Duncan asked. \"I mean, I'm fairly sure he'd do whatever you want if you asked him to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Alejandro said. \"Plus, he considers himself an athlete in training which means he won't which is why Geoff is going to help convince him the wonders of bulking. A little friendly competition to get his competitive spirit going you know? He's going to want to as big or bigger than Geoff when he sees just how strong he is,\" Alejandro squeezed Geoff's bicep. \"This is rock hard solid power,\" Alejandro said. Geoff blushed a little but was pleased with the compliment. Alejandro then let go and softly punched against Geoff's gut causing him to give out a medium belch. \"Mixed with a manley belly, just utterly gorgeous.\" Alejandro sighed. \"Imagining Tyler like this...big and strong like he always wanted, it's just beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it seems kind of mean you're going to trick Tyler into doing this,\" Duncan said. \"Are you sure he's going to be okay with getting bigger?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course he will, once he sees the power results. Plus, I'm not forcing him or anything, he's going to want to get bigger when he sees Geoff. You're just there to be a different ascetic eyecandy.\" Alejandro scanned Duncan slowly. \"Yep, also hot, in a completely different kind of way.\" Duncan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any plans?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n\"I have some but was curious what you thought of,\" Alejandro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that new buffet that opened? Geoff here is going to require a lot of food to keep this sexy tank full and I imagine Tyler will too,\" Duncan slapped his hand against Geoff's stomach releasing another pent up burp. Geoff otherwise remained quiet because strictly speaking, he actually wasn't all that hungry after the massive meal he had earlier and the past few days. He didn't want to embarass or disappoint Duncan though so he was going to try his best. He couldn't imagine Tyler eating all that much anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, sounds good,\" Alejandro said. \"I can't wait to see them go at it,\" Alejando winked as he patted Geoff's massive stomach. \"See you later big guy and be sure to impress Tyler for me.\" He started gneading and rubbing the gut. \"Though I don't think you will have any problems there. You're a fucking beast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he is,\" Duncan started rubbing too and Geoff groaned in bliss as two extremely hot guys started massaging and rubbing him down. \"So, are you going to pick up Tyler or what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I will in a bit,\" Alejandro said. \"First I want to appreciate the nice work you've done for Geoff.\"<br>\r\n\"It's so weird that you like this but are so fit yourseff.\"<br>\r\n\"What about you? I don't exactly see any weight on that frame of yours either.\"<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Alejandro and Duncan both fell into silence for a bit as they both rubbed and felt all over Geoff. After a while, Alejandro straightened up and turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you guys at dinner tonight,\" he said cheerily and turned and walked out the door.<br>\r\n\"Well that was weird,\" Geoff commented. <br>\r\n\"So how you feeling now?\" Duncan asked. <br>\r\n\"Better,\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n\"Good. I can't let my Big Bear suffer or miss any chance of being able to keep down food because he was sick.\"<br>\r\n\"You're such a good coach helping Alejandro with Tyler,\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n\"I know, I am aren't I?\" Duncan laughed. \"It will be interesting to see Tyler with a big gut like yours.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Geoff had a small small belly, and Duncan didn't gain any weight in last nights sandwich party. They entered the front door and the smell of cooking filled their noses. They entered rhe kitchen to see Dj caught up in all his food. He was baking tons of stuff, cake, pies, other desserts, while cooking burgers and making sandwiches and other foods. Dj looked very stressed.<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Geoff asked.<br>\r\n\"Yesterday I forgot that next week was the begginning of my cooking competition. I'm gonna be on TV!\" Dj said.<br>\r\n\"You were already on TV!\" Duncan laughed. Dj smiled.<br>\r\n\"Well anyways, I need you guys' help in testing all this food. I need to make 3 courses and I don't know which ones to make, can you guys help?\" Dj explained. Geoff and Duncan were up for the job, especially since it involved Dj's amazing food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff and Duncan sat down at the table, and Dj served them a plate of 6 sandwiches. <br>\r\n\"Now only eat one, I don't want you to get full and not eat anything else!\" Dj said, but it was too late. Geoff had eaten 5 sandwiches and Duncan ate the other. The next dish was a full pizza, and again Duncan ate a slice and Geoff ate the rest. Duncan noticed Geoff's increase in appetite, and didn't mind it at all.<br>\r\nThe next dish was of 2 burgers, and Geoff was disappointed when he couldn't eat another. Next Dj brought out the desserts.<br>\r\nDj set a plate of 12 doughnuts in front of the boys and they were delicious. Duncan couldn't help himself but to eat 5 more, and Geoff ate the other 6. <br>\r\nDj next gave the boys 2 pies. They were gone as well. Lastly, Dj brought out the cake. It was a huge cake, look like it was made for a wedding. Dj served Duncan 3 pieces and 3 for Geoff. They both finished their pieces and asked for more. They got the same amount back, but Duncan couldn't finish his last piece.<br>\r\n\"Dj the food was great .... man, but I'm stuffed!\" He rubbed his belly. Geoff reached over and took Duncan's plate and finished it for him.<br>\r\nDj had one more plate left, and it was of a chocolate cake. Geoff ate 5 pieces of the 6 and turned in.<br>\r\n\"Man that was great!\" Geoff said, \"but I can't eat another bite!\"<br>\r\n\"There's only one more piece!\" Duncan encouraged. Geoff sighed and ate the piece in a minute. Geoff lifted up his shirt and exposed his big hairy tummy. His abs were barely noticable now!<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Duncan stared in amazement. His belly was bigger than he thought. He wanted it to be bigger, he wanted his to be bigger! Duncan lifted up his shirt and his hairy abs were still there, but hiden by a layer of fat. Dj thanked the boys and they waddled out of his house.</span></div></div>",

The day had finished and the 3 were walking home. Geoff, desperate for more of Dj's food, suggested an idea to Dj.<br>\r\n\"Dj, you should host an end of the year party!\" Duncan liked the idea as well. <br>\r\n\"But I have my cooking thing,\" Dj said, even though he did want to have a party.<br>\r\n\"You've been working too hard on that, give yourself a break!\" Duncan convinced.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day of DJ's party arrived and Geoff and Duncan were excited, both because it was a party and also that DJ was providing the food. There was going to be a lot of people there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, thanks so much for doing this!\" Duncan told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're the best!\" Geoff added. DJ nodded and stretched his arms, letting out a big yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man I'm tired. I was up all night cooking, again. I don't know why I let you guys convince me this was a good idea. On the other hand, I will get to have more opinions and reviews for my cooking to decide what to send in for the contest so there is that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! Speaking of, we should probably set it out, people are going to be coming in an hour.\" Duncan, Geoff, and DJ set out all the tables, each one containing platters of all different sorts and drinks. Geoff and Duncan each had a couple samples of it while doing so, a hotdog here, a roll there, some of DJ's delicious mayo splattered sanwhiches there, etc. They were still eating a sample when the first people to arrive came. It was Tyler, his girlfriend Lindsay, Geoff's on-off ex(?) girlfriend Bridgette (Geoff wasn't at all sure what their status was at this point), and Leshawna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! I see you already got started on the snacks! I'm starving, and I know this is going to be good,\" Leshawna said hurrying over. Spooning some chilli into a bowl she brought the spoon to her mouth and tasted it, letting out a long sigh. \"This is so good,\" she moaned. Tyler, Lindsay, and Bridgette got other things and made similar moans of pleasure. Tyler loved the ribs, Bridgette loved the salad, and Lindsay shared some of Tyler's ribs. Soon other people started arriving as well: Alejandro and Heather, Cody, Brick, Scott, Eva, Lightning, and all sorts of people, known and unknown. Some of those people were there because they heard there was a party with free food and decided to crash it. Once the flood started, DJ's lawn and house became filled with people. Geoff turned on the music and everybody danced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a lot of people that hung out around the food tables and they were very crowded. It was a good thing DJ was experienced at making a lot of food on short notice since everyone actually managed to have enough. More than enough actually as when people weren't dancing or talking, people were stuffing their faces with DJ's food. Even health fanatics Alejandro and Brick were stuffing their faces with anything they could get their hungry hands on. When a tray of food ran out, DJ just ran to the kitchen and brought out a new one. He also made sure to ask everybody what they thought about the food which generally got responses of \"amazing,\" \"fucking amazing,\" \"heavenly,\" etc. Nobody had anything bad to say and everybody was in awe of DJ's cooking skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it became an eating party more than anything else, various food competitions broke out like who could eat the most hotdogs in five minutes or consume the most burgers or mac n' cheese. Surprisingly, Alejandro won the hot-dog eating competition. When Alejandro lets loose, he lets loose, and he was a very highly competitive person. Heather taunted him about all the sausages he must have sucked to enable him to eat all those hot-dogs so fast but was shut up when he deadpanned back that he did. No one was sure if or how much Alejandro was joking about it. While it was fairly obvious to all but the most astute that Alejandro was head-over-heels for Heather, he was a known swinger who went both ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff crushed the sandwich competition though Brick came pretty close. Geoff however was more used to eating them consistently though and he was a sandwich eating machine. Eventually, all the food was consumed by the party-goers and they milled about, occasionally rubbing their bloated distended bellies when they thought no one was watching. Everybody was pretty full and were all thus surprised when DJ brought out multiple dessert trays that had various pies and cakes sitting on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I think I'm going to explode,\" Cody moaned, even as he eagerly cut himself some slices of cake. There was a lot of agreement with this statement as people ate their dessert, although more slowly than they had the earlier meals as they were already full. Geoff was one of the few who was not yet suffering from an aching belly because he was getting used to crazy amounts of DJ's food, especially after the feast he had eaten when DJ had him and Duncan test before. Now that had been a struggle on how to not explode so this was nothing yet. He just kept opening his mouth and chewed, enjoying the rich sugary delicious flavor of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst one by one and then groups eventually stopped eating once they became too full to continue eating anymore. There was still a lot of cake and pie left but they simply couldn't handle it anymore. With a lot of burping and shifting of positions, trying to subtlely open up pants to allow room, groaning, and rubbing of guts, everybody laid down. Geoff eventually stopped too when he got tired and his pants felt constrained around his massively bloated gut, which was strange considering he had only just gotten new pants recently. With a thunk, he sat down next to Duncan and just unbuttoned his pants sighing in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUURRRPPP oh man, that feels so good,\" Geoff groaned and Duncan was again amazed to see how big Geoff's stomach had expanded with no hint of six pack abs anywhere. It looked like a big solid ball underneath defined pecs. Of course, Duncan had been noticing that Geoff's famous abs were beginning to smudge but as Geoff put on some weight, but this was no longer subtle once they got a taste of DJ's food. Duncan stretched back his arms and smiled as his own shirt rose up, exposing his bloated stomach which pushed forward a bit. It went out a little bit further than when he and Geoff had tested food out with DJ which was awesome and meant he must be gaining some weight which was great! Slapping his stomach he let out a burp in relief. DJ's food was so good but so filling. How on earth was DJ not incredibly fat if he could cook like this? It was just so odd to think about so Duncan changed thoughts as he rubbed his full aching belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, Duncan saw Alejandro who was also leaning back, his normal six-pack washboard abs gone and buried under a highly distended belly that forced his red shirt to rise over. It wasn't quite as big as Geoff's but it was pretty dang big, especially compared to earlier. Weirdly, Heather was being nice and rubbing and soothing it and it was obvious Alejandro was getting a lot of pleasure from that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce people could manage to make themselves move again, they got up and waddled off, bellies swaying. <br>\r\n\"Well that was fun,\" Geoff said sleepily. <br>\r\n\"Yeah it was,\" Duncan agreed. <br>\r\n\"I don't want to get up,\" Geoff groaned. <br>\r\n\"Me neither,\" Duncan said. \"But we don't want to sleep out here tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh fine,\" Geoff grumbled as he tried to stand up. He couldn't and kept slipping, belly too off-balanced. \"Uh, a little help?\" Duncan smirked as he reached out but it disappeared when the first time Geoff accidentally yanked him down because he wasn't ready. Getting back up, they tried again and eventually after a few tries, Geoff managed to get up, belly-swaying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Duncan said, poking Geoff in the gut. <br>\r\n\"Hey don't look at me, you're pretty big too.\" Geoff said. Duncan rolled his eyes because that was kind, but an exaggeration. His was a mere bump compared to Geoff's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey DJ, can we stay the night?\" Duncan asked when they waddled slowly up to the back kitchen door.<br>\r\n\"Of course you can,\" DJ said as he put them into the guest bedroom. \"Stay as long as you need to.\"</span></div></div>",

They knew Dj needed his sleep, so they'd keep him up all night of the competition. The next 2 days went as usual, at least now it was usual. Duncan and Geoff always ate whenever Dj needed \"help\" and enjoyed every single bite. Duncan's belly was getting big, but it was an ant to Geoff's huge stomach. Both boys were also getting fatter in other places. Geoff's butt was big, and Duncan was forming a double chin. They ate endlessly and only slept for a few hours and ate the rest of the time.<br>\r\nDay 2 Duncan had invited some of the other boys from the party to Dj's house, for a \"good-luck\" for Dj. Dj fed the beasts of Geoff, Duncan, Alejandro, Brick, Lightning, Cody, Tyler, and Trent. They ate hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches, pies, cakes, and other fatty foods. Alejandro's gut stretched out a lot, with Lightning and Tyler not far behind. Brick, Trent, and Cody weren't far behind. Duncan's gut was double the size of Alejandro's and his shirt was about to rip. Geoff, however, ripped his shirt in the middle of the feast. His huge gut was bare to the air, and his dark happy trail was blowing in the wind. Geoff never realized how big he had gotten. He knew he gained a few pounds, but not enough to rip his shirt. He couldn't get up, and neither could Duncan or Alejandro. The other boys left with huge guts bouncing as they walked. Alejandro knew Duncan and Geoff were using Dj for his food and he wanted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so, Geoff asked Dj for more food. Alejandro was shocked he wanted more, since he had gotten so huge, but didn't blame him for wanting more of the delicious taste. If he was gonna use Dj, he wanted to use him to the fullest. Alejandro and Duncan joined Geoff in the beg, and Dj gave each boy 3 huge cakes. They dug in and Geoff finished first, Duncan next, and Alejandro last. Alejandro had trouble keeping up with the other boys, but still finished his cake. Duncan asked for more, and Alejandro groaned to himself, but ate on anyways. After another hour or 2 of little \"snacks\" Duncan's shirt had ripped as well and Alejandro's shirt barely covered his belly. Alejandro couldn't get up, but with the help of Dj's strong arms he was able to waddle home. Alejandro's gut hurt, but he was definitely coming back for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan noticed Alejandro wanting to get into their group. Duncan liked Alejandro and didn't mind, but he didn't want him taking more of Dj, but then he realized Alejandro could help their plan. He could help keep Dj awake all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan filled Geoff in on his idea, and Geoff agreed. The nexg day when Alejandro came back, with a shirt that didn't cover his belly button, Geoff and Duncan filled Alejandro in on the plan. Alejandro liked their mischievous idea, and was up for it. Dj came out with a plates and plates of hot dogs to see if they were good enough for the show, and after 50 had been consumed they liked if. More and more food was stuffed into their faces and Geoff and Duncan didn't fit in their new shirts either.</span></div></div>",

The boys ate that quick. They had huge cakes and pies next. Then they had doughnuts, cookies, brownies and other treats. They had ribs, steaks, hot dogs, and more food than you can imagine.

They needed to keep him up for another few hours so he would keep sleeping and sleep right past the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff was surprisingly quiet all night. He had always been the loud one, but his mouth was never full of food. He ate like a machine, everything given to him was eaten. He ate the most of the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 8 am and Dj saw the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!!!!! I can't believe I didn't get any sleep! Oh my god. I wont have any time to sleep then.\"<br>\r\nDuncan's dreary eyes lit up.<br>\r\n\"No no! You need sleep! Remember presentation is a part of the competition. You need at least an hour of sleep!\" Duncan campaigned.<br>\r\nDj thought, and decided he would take a rest. He set an alarm for one hour and crept into bed.<br>\r\nAlejandro, being the lightest of the 3, crept into his bedroom and turned off the alarm. The boys celebrated their victory of keeping Dj awake and had a celebratory sleep.</span></div></div>",

Duncan agreed, and so did Geoff.<br>\r\n\"So do you guys need me to like, feed you?\" Dj asked. The boys again looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dj, everyone thinks your cooking is amazing. We want to always eat it, so if you don't mind, but could you cook for us?\" Geoff asked formerly. Dj thoughh about it, and decided to do it.

After finishing a mountain load of food, the pain in his belly started to cry. He rubbed his belly, while eating some more cookies. The pain was almost numbed by the taste of the food. He ate and ate and ate, and then the boys woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hydye Gueyd\" Dj said, with a mouthful of food. The boys were impressed that Dj ate this much!</span></div></div>",

The 4 skinny boys sat down on the floor since the couch was broken, and the 4 fat boys told them about their situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chef, Dj's cook, is an amazing chef, better than Dj!\" Alejandro told the 4. Alejandro enjoyed seeing Duncan Geoff and Dj gain, and 4 others eating would be great. <br>\r\n\"I don't know... can you guys even move?\" Trent asked.<br>\r\n\"How will I do sports if I can't move?!\" Lightning added.<br>\r\n\"Will Lindsay be ok with this?\" Tyler continued.<br>\r\n\"Dudes, the food is amazing, and try some! That'll make ur decision.\" Geoff said. Although Geoff was huge he could still group everyone together.<br>\r\nThe 4 boys took a smal bite of a full cake given to each, and in seconds after touching their tongues, they dug in. They ate until they finished the cake, and started on another full cake. The bellies they worked so hard to get rid of from Dj's end of the year party grew back in minutes. and they were hooked onto Chef's cooking like magnets</span></div></div>",

Trent really liked Gwen, from the moment he first saw her, and had no intentions of stalking her but when he passed by the window and saw her and Duncan eating together and looking like they were having a fun time, he couldn't help but come in to the restauraunt. To make sure she didn't get hurt by that creep Duncan and amittedly just a bit curious to what they were talking about since he did not often seem them together, hanging out in different circles one being a punk and the other more gothy. He frowned as heard that laughter as Gwen laughed at some dirty joke Duncan told her as he made a face. He couldn't believe Duncan thought telling Gwen stuff like that was funny or that Gwen laughed at it although maybe she was just being friendly. Letting an outrageous belch, Duncan leaned back, his thumbs resting on his belly, a dopey smile on his face that Trent really wanted to smack off his face, especially with what he said next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uuurrrp, aw Gwen, you really know how to treat a guy. That was delicious. We should do that again sometime.\" Gwen smirked a little and Trent couldn't believe it when she said \"any time big guy.\" Duncan smirked back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt. I know how you love your big guys that can eat. Kind of cooky if you ask me but I'm not complaining.\" Trent was now confused by this. What the heck was going on here? Gwen rubbed Duncan's stomach as he moaned in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you next time and hope your session goes well,\" Gwen said and smacked Duncan's butt as he walked away, almost causing him to stumble but he just laughed it off as he gave a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya next time darling!\" Gwen waved goodbye and Duncan stumbled out. Trent just stood there confused and didn't realize it when Gwen came up to him. <br>\r\n\"Uh, hi Trent, when did you get here?\" Trent looked up confused at Gwen's concerned face. He blushed and backed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay long, gotta go, nice seeing you,\" Trent said nervously as he ran out leaving Gwen confused before she shrugged as she sat back down and took out her sketchbook drawing a new picture. Outside, Trent stumbled as he continued down the street, his head reeling at what he had just seen and learned in there. Duncan was having secret sessions with Gwen? More importantly, she liked big guys? That was a shocker. Stopping, Trent smiled as an idea came to him. He knew how to get Gwen's attention away from Duncan. He was going to eat more than him and win Gwen over that way. She'd drop Duncan in a heartbeat if she saw him bigger. Normally, he would have considered this a bad idea but Gwen was worth it. What was a little weight anyhow? Decided, Trent went to find something to start him off. If he was going to beat Duncan, he was going to need to eat and eat a lot. Trent wasn't ready for that and would need to get practice. What was he going to do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alejandro was the perfect physical male specimen. Good height that was much taller than the average but not to freak size, toned arms and legs, a gorgeous six pack, and a fairly big chest. Now he granted that there were people bigger than him, but none were as clever or perfectly proportioned or handsome as he was. He could have anybody and anything he wanted just by asking and flashing a smile or a blink of his eyes. He was never used to anybody telling him no and one of the few things he loved was football. As quarterback, Alejandro lead his team to victory many times and kept expecting to do so and so he was surprised one day when he was called into coach's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Alejandro asked pleasantly and a bit confused. \"You wanted to see me?\" Coach Hatchet looked at him and spat. <br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed in you.\" Hatchet said and Alejandro blinked, not sure if he heard that right or if he was dreaming or what. <br>\r\n\"Ex-excuse me?\" Alejandro said startled and more than a bit offended. <br>\r\n\"You haven't been bulking up like I recommended for everyone else. Everyone here has gotten at least a bit bigger except for you. What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't see why I have to. I mean, why is this necessary?\" Alejandro shot back.<br>\r\n\"Wh-why! Because this year we're facing the biggest high school teams I've ever seen in years who make you guys look pathetic, that's why. They'll eat you alive.\"<br>\r\n\"But I've always did my job with admirable performance without complaint, even against some pretty tough teams,\" Alejandro said pissed. <br>\r\n\"Burromuerto! I don't care how good you are, if you play these guys at your current weight you'll be destroyed and our team will suck because of your refusal to do what your told. If you don't bulk up you're off the team and that's that. I can't get sued for hospital damages that might happen to you.\" Alejandro was shocked. Off the team? But that was his life! His friends, popularity, chicks...no! Alejandro straightened and glared at his coach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll get big. I'll bulk up so much you'll eat your words. Those other teams will go down and I will remain champion, understand? You will not cut me from the team.\" <br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, whatever. Just do it already. Burromuerto, dismissed.\" Alejandro marched out of the office, pissed as hell and other people shrank away as Alejandro in a bad mood was never a good thing. He walked up to his friends and grabbed their big shoulders turning them around and they gulped, thinking they were in trouble.<br>\r\n\u201cDuncan, Geoff,\u201d he snapped out and they straightened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir?\u201d Geoff asked warily as they watched Alejandro pace around them angrily. They loved their friend but when he was in one of his moods, even they were terrified of him as he got nasty even to them at times. Still most of the time, he was a very good leader and they liked him, just not when he was like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoach threatened to cut me off the team,\u201d Alejandro said angrily. Duncan looked up in shock. <br>\r\n\u201cHe did what? Why?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cCoach is convinced I\u2019m not big enough and wants me to bulk up or I\u2019m off the team, even if I\u2019ve won numerous games that without me you guys would have had no chance of winning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t do that! Why would he threaten one of our best players with such a threat? We need you!\u201d Duncan said upset. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know. There were so many things I wanted to say about this but it would definitely have made Coach decide to cut me and I am not doing that. I\u2019ve decided to bulk up like required and see where it would go and I need you guys to help.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Duncan and Geoff together. \u201cYou want us to help?\u201d Alejandro nodded. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You guys are my friends and I\u2026I\u2026I am not quite sure how I would do this without you,\u201d Alejandro admitted grudgingly. \u201cNot with any speed. Muscle? Possibly. But not fast or to the appropriate mass necessary. So I am going to need you two to help me.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you want boss,\u201d Duncan said, tipping his mohawked head.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll help you dude,\u201d Geoff said putting his arms around Alejandro and Duncan joined him and Alejandro rolled his eyes as his friends group hugged him. Tweedle dumb and tweedle dumber and he wasn\u2019t sure which one was which at times. However, they were the best friends anyone could ask for and among the few people Alejandro liked. They knew who and what they are and did not hide it like most and they were always such fun and a hoot to be around. Feeling better he smirked as he pushed them off. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay okay guys, enough with the hugging. We have work to do. So, ideas? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was Duncan's big idea? <br>\r\n\"That doesn't really help me, I already do that,\" Alejandro said, shaking his head at his friend's stupidity. Duncan smirked and Geoff cocked his head in confusion as well. <br>\r\n\"No, I mean EAT, and not all that boring crap you usually do. You should live a little and enjoy food. I don't know how you can eat the same bland boring things all day.\" Geoff eyes widened in realization and he nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Duncan's right man, how do you eat all that chicken and rice and fish everyday and not get tired of it? I mean, there's nothing wrong with those foods and as a source of lean protein but really, every day? How can you do that and not get sick of it?\" Both of them were looking at him and Alejandro felt he was on the defensive. He shook his head and walked out of the locker room, the two following on his heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why you guys are overly interested in what I do and don't eat. I eat healthy to be both muscular and cut and have enough energy to maintain function and health, no more, no less. It is a bit boring I admit, but necessary. Besides, do you see these?\" Alejandro lifts his shirt up exposing his perfect deep cut 6 pack. \"That bland diet and exercise allows me to have these babies and chicks dig the abs and guns,\" he said flexing his abs and biceps. Duncan shrugged a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself. If you want to get kicked off the team...\" Duncan trailed off as Alejandro grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him close. <br>\r\n\"Don't you dare finish that sentence,\" Alejandro said harshly and Duncan nodded fearfully. Alejandro dropped him. Geoff decided to say something. <br>\r\n\"Hey, not all chicks like abs.\" Both Duncan and Alejandro looked at him confused, wondering what planet he was from. What chicks didn't like perfect abs and muscles, at least ones who weren't freaks? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" <br>\r\n\"Not all chicks like abs, some happen to like more normal sized people.\" Alejandro laughed. Normal? Who wanted normal when there was extraordinary? Although, it made sense since there could only be so much extraordinary to go around and girls would have to make do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some even prefer guys with weight on them.\" That was weird but if that was true...<br>\r\n\"Besides, coach did say you need to bulk up and that simply isn't going to happen on the diet you're on. As of right now, you're eating with with us.\" Duncan said, grinning. \"So, I was thinking pizza...\" Geoff interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I wanted hamburgers tonight!\" Duncan rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Whatever. Since I want pizza and Geoff here apparently wants burgers, what do you want to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I guess...\" Alejandro started to say. </span></div></div>",

In a few minutes Geoff came back with 3 extra large cheese pizzas in his hand and he set them on the table.<br>\r\n\"And who's going to eat thjs?\" Alejandro asked.<br>\r\n\"Us!\" Geoff said and he set the boxes so one was in front of everyone.<br>\r\n\"How do you expect me to eat this whole thing? Theres 16 slices in there!\" Alejandro asked.<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you wanna stay on the team...\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"Me and Duncan eat this everyday, why can't you?\" Geoff added.<br>\r\nAlejandro opened the box and the smell was tempting but he wasn't used to eating like this. Geoff sat down and Alejandro watched Duncan and Geoff eat like pigs. Geoff and Duncan always had big appetites, but Alejandro couldn't eat this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly took a bite out of the first piece and understood why Geoff and Duncan ate this everyday. The taste was so good, he hadn'f eaten something so good for so long, he plowed through the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone finished their pizzas and Alejandro rubbed his swollen belly. He saw Duncan and Geoff undo the buttons on their jeans and Alejandro do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff called over the waitor and she came with the check, and Geoff said:<br>\r\n\"No, no, we'd like to order more.\" <br>\r\n\"What??\" Alejandro said aloud.<br>\r\n\"Another extra large pizza!\" Geoff said.<br>\r\nWhen the waitor left Alejandro was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys not full?\" Alejandro asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm not full, but you gotta eat to stay on the team.\" Duncan sais.<br>\r\n\"You can eat 4 pieces, me and Duncan will eat the rest.\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza came and the smell made Alejandro's hunger cease. He took another bite, and before he Geoff and Duncan could have a piece, Alejandro had eaten the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said you were full!\" Geoff said and smacked Alejandro's bigger belly, his shirt riding up. Alejandro blushed. \"It's really good pizza....\" <br>\r\n\"I know!\" Duncan started, and he called over the waitor. \"3 more extra large pizzas!\" Duncan called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the pizza's came, and Geoff and Duncan plowed through their boxes. Alejandro ate 4 slices of the 3rd box, and Geoff and Duncan ate the rest. Everyone at around 2 &amp; a half pizzas, and they were stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so full...\" Alejandro said and he couldn't feel his abs anymore. He hoped it was just bloated not going to stay that way. Alejandro saw Duncan and Geoff's bare bellies also bloated with no abs, which they all had before.

He set his plates down at the table and Duncan  stared at Alejandro.<br>\r\n\"You're going to eat all of that?\" Duncan  asked in awe.<br>\r\n\"Well you said we have to eat!\" Alejandro said and took a bite from the hotdog.<br>\r\n\"Dude that's a lot...\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n\"Well, you're eating it too!\" Alejandro said and Geoff  came back with just the same amount of food as Alejandro. Duncan  left to get more food on his plate to keep up with the other 2. <br>\r\nAlejandro ate each hotdog with care, he fell in love with every bite.

He finished his plate and took a bite of his pizza and again was mesmorized. He ate slice after slice until the 8 on his plate were gone. Alejandro ate the 5 triple cheese burger and was onto the cake. Before he could start the cake, he felt his hard stomach digging into his jeans, he undid the button, and the zipper flew down, exposing Alejandro's happy trail. He took a bite of the cake, and this was his favorite from everything he had eaten. He ate another slice, and another, and another. By the time he finished his first piece, he was eating with his hand. He grabbed a piece wifh one hand, and another piece from the cake in the other. He brought it to his mouth and ate it fast. He did that with the remaining 2 pieces, and Alejandro reached and grabbed Duncan's pieces which he had not eaten yet. Alejandro ate Duncan's 4 pieces and reached over to Geoff, but he had finished his as well. He joined Geoff back up at the counter taking the full 10 piece cake back with him to the table. Geoff and Alejandro dug in, in slme trance by the food. Duncan watched, and his belly felt hard as stons. Duncan was full, but he saw how the others ate the cake, and figured why not join them. He brought a cake back and realized why Geoff and Alejandro were eating like pigs. The chocolate cake was deliciously addiciting and there was not one bad thing about if. Duncan dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff's belt snapped and everyone went back up for seconds</span></div></div>",

Let's go to my room and see what we're working with first.\" Harold suggested, picking up his plate. and leading the way. Cody followed the tall male to his room, where Harold set up a large scale like one might find in a doctor's office. \"Kick your shoes off and stand on the scale.\" Harold ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody did as he was told and Harold deftly manipulated the scale. \"Four feet... and 150 pounds...\" Harold muttered, writing the information down in a notepad that he promptly labeled \"Cody's weight tracker.\"<br>\r\n\"Aw man... I'm even lighter than I thought...\" Cody muttered, getting off and sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n\"Well, we did need a starting point!\" Harold reasoned. <br>\r\n\"True...\"<br>\r\n\"So... let's start with these burgers and sodas. You eat those while I order a few things.\"<br>\r\nCody nodded as he started eating, stuffing as much as he could chew into his mouth as Harold wrote down a list of stuff they needed. Protein shakes, fatty carbs, digestive aids, and other things. He also took some time to look up some feedee/feeder tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harold?\" Cody moaned after a while. \"I... can't eat anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dude, I looked this up!\" Harold smiled and began rubbing Cody's tight, swollen tummy, accelerating the transition to flab.

But before we hook you up to this beauty, time to measure up!\" Harold announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Cody kicked off his shoes and removed his dull yellow shirts. Without them, it was clearly obvious how much the small teen had grown. A fairly large belly pooled over his pants, along with a pair of growing love handles, giving him a muffin top until the jeans were removed. A pair of chubby cheeks had graced Cody's face as well as his ass, which flubbed out of his undies. His arms and thighs had grown from twiggy to large and soft.

And thanks again for helping me!\"<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" he grinned as Cody left.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nAnother week passed, and the brunet continued to gain. Drinking two shakes a day, coupled with his increased appetite, had resulted in around twenty pounds of fat scattering across his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's belly, now covered snugly and peeking out from beneath a larger version of his normal shirt, sat comfortably in his lap and his moobs were splayed equally so on top of the girth. His tree trunk legs were wrapped in a fairly tight pair of cargo pants, currently unbuttoned out of habit. When he walked, his thighs began to rub together, causing the inner pant legs to fray. His face was now almost completely round and was developing another chin, although it was still identifiably Cody's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tubby boy waddled to Harold's rom, where the feeding machine stood waiting, along with Noah. \"Hey Harold! Hi, Noah. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm here to...\"</span></div></div>",

The dark yellow garment barely went down over the top part of his stomach, and its sleeves barely passed his elbows. His striped over-shirt on the other hand covered just his ample chest, an action Noah now blushed heavily at. Cody yawned and stretched his arms out tiredly. \"Well, I'm gonna head off to bed.

Sierra went back to writing copious amounts of fanfiction on Cody, Courtney went back to being a snobby overachiever in high school and Scott went back to the farm in the country. Problem for Scott is that despite all the horrendous stuff he was put through on the island there were also some good parts he missed.<br>\r\nSunday night and Scott is looking through the empty cupboards for some decent food. 'Papi, when are ye ever gonna get in some good grub? If I ever won a task on the island I would be in a comfy bed and treated to a mighty fine meal in the morning with pancakes and proper swell toast for a whole pigpen to live off for life\" exclaims Scott. His father has not been enamored by Scott's attitude since he was booted off the island, he seems to have become far to pretentious for the family's lifestyle. <br>\r\nSuddenly, there is a loud knock on the door which causes Scott to clumsily bang his on the cupboard door causing him to let out a loud yelp. \"Now who could that be at this hour?\" asks Papi. Papi opens the door to which he sees Chef Hatchet. All Chef Hatchet does is look at Papi and hands him a letter. Scott comes up behind Papi and they both mutter the letter to themselves.<br>\r\n<b>Dear former Total Drama contestant, I have cordially invited you to come to Pakitew Island where you will be reunited with your friends and take part in another set of fun and sometimes grueling tasks. By the way this is not a real invite, it was in the fine print of your contract that I could force you to come back in a year. Sincerely Chris McLane.</b><br>\r\nWithout having the chance to say bye, Chef Hatchet grabs Scott and throws him in the jet. Reminding himself of the good parts like decent food, Scott does not retaliate.<br>\r\nHe arrives at the island, eagerly hoping to win every task which hopefully will be as good as last time. On the Island joining him are Noah, Mike, Justin, Owen, Cody, Trent, Duncan, Lindsay, Heather, Gwen, Dawn, Courtney, Bridgette, Leshawna and Izzy.<br>\r\nBefore everyone can catch up properly, Chris informs them of what will entail their stay on the Island. <br>\r\n1st, Eliminations are the same as before<br>\r\n2nd, There is a million dollar prize<br>\r\n3rd, Boys and girls sleep in seperate cabins<br>\r\n4th, Lawyers say their are not enough health and safety untencils, so I went out and bought a pair of scales<br>\r\n%th and finally....</span></div></div>",

Like Brody, Geoff had a big appetite tol. However, Brody could eat more, and faster. After 20 minutes, Brody and Geoff finished their meals and were still a bit hungry.</span></div></div>",

Brody called the waitress over. She said how only one person could take the meal, they couldnt share, so Geoff and Brody ordered there own each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacks and stacks of pancakes filed out, and a few stacks were placed in front of the starving boys. The timer started and Brody shoved in pancake after pancake, trying to beat the time. After less than a minute he finished a stack and was on the next, and to the next. He ate ravenously, and after 20 stacks, he still didnt get a sensation of being full. Geoff was just a few stacks behind, statrting to feel a little full, but he continued on, not wanting to spend the money on the meal, even though they just won 1 million dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had past, and Brody finished 60 stacks and was just starting ti slow down. Geoff was at 50 pancakes, taking much effor just to fit another stack in. Geoff and Brody both unbuttoned their swollen bellies and it started to ride up their shirt. Brody still ate at a good pace and loved the taste of the pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only 20 minutes remaining, Brody ate 85 pancakes and Geoff had 65. Geoff was laying back in his seat rubbing his belly. Brody felt really full, but he only had 15 stacks left to go. Brody pushed through, and with 10 minutes to spare, Brody finished the pancakes! He didn'f call the waitress over just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"psst, Geoff, slide me some stacks.\" Geoff looked over at Brody and his empty plates.<br>\r\n\"You finished?!\" Geoff said. \"Shhhh! I'll help you!\" Brody said. Geoff still had 30 pancakes left and Brody started chowing down. Geoff was amazed that Brody could finish 100 stacks, plus his 15. Geoff took this as encouragement and finished 20 more pancakes, and Brody ate the other 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" They said, called the waitress over, and they learned they were 2 minutes before the timer, and they got their meal free.

He looked at the clock which read 12:30. On que, his stomach rumbled.<br>\r\n\"Time for lunch!\" he said. He looked down to see most of the swelling from breakfast had gone down, but his belly still stuck out a great deal. He adjusted himself and got up to wake up Geoff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff woke up and Brody asked if he was hungry.<br>\r\n\"I know we just ate a ton, but man im hungry!\" Brody said patting his belly.<br>\r\n\"Me too man! But we have to watch our weight, we cant ger fat! We just won a million dollars and we're going to be in headlines, we need to stay looking good!\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah and we can upgrade our gym membership before we get bombarded, we need to relax a bit. We just got home yesterday!\" Brody said. Geoff looked down at his still big belly, and back at Brody's.<br>\r\n\"I bet wr just gained a pound!\" Geoff said. Brody cheered and they got ready to go in sweatpants and a bigger t shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we go?\" Brody asked walking down the stairs.<br>\r\n\"I.. I don't know.\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"We had burgers ... burritos .... pancakes .... what else .... have you been .... craving.\" Brody said.<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Geoff said and stopped. He held his hands on his knees and bent over breathing heavy, Body leaned against the wall breathing heavy.<br>\r\n\"Stairs weren't a good idea...\" Brody said. The boys lived on the 8th floor and they had only walked down 4. Geoff and Brody entered the nearest hallway and used the elevator of their appartmenr building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about pizza?\" Brody asked, in the cab.<br>\r\n\"Sounds good man!\" Geoff said. They drove off to the pizza place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, they ordered 2 large pizzas, one for the each of them.<br>\r\n\"Now we can't overdue ourselves. We don't want to get more than our normal amount of pizza, a full box each, okay?\" Geoff said. He didn't want to fall into a food coma like earlier.<br>\r\n\"Got ya!\" Brody said as he eagerly waited for the pizza to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizzas came and Brody and Geoff both used the full box of 12 slices of pizza as a plate and started eating.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n\"What?\" Brody asked, with a mouthful of pizza.<br>\r\n\"I missed pizza so much! This tastes amazing!\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"Yes dude!\" Brody replied. Geoff ate slice after slice of pizza, and he even finished before Brody.<br>\r\n\"Dude I know I said no more, but I missed pizza so much! I gotta have more!\" Geoff begged Brody. Brody smiled.<br>\r\n\"Only if I can have some too!\" Brody was glad Geoff wasn't going to be nagging him for the rest if the meal, he could eat however much he want. And it was going to be a lot. Large Pizza boxes came and came and came to the hungry teens. Brody devoured each one so quick and Geoff couldn't have enough, they couldn't hold themselves. Brody and Geoff's larger shirts slid higher and higher up, snd the sweat pants moved lower and lower down trying to make room for the growing belly. Around pizza 12, Brody and Geoff were full, but the pizza tasted so good! They kept eating until they finished 18 large pizza boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody and Geoff sat down with huge guts smudged against the table, and the two felt tight in their booth.<br>\r\n\"Brody...\" Geoff began. \"That was so good...\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah man, but im stuffed.\" <br>\r\n\"me too\"<br>\r\n\"Wanna eat 2 more to make it an even 20?\" Brody said.<br>\r\n\"Thats what I was thinking!\" Geoff said. They ordered 2 more pizzas, and they finished the first one fast. Brody finished the next one, and Geoff could only eat one slice. Brody ate the other 11 slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I can eat a lot more than you!\" Brody said, teasing Geoff.<br>\r\n\"Nah man I'm just full.\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I can eat more than you anytime.\" Brody gloated.<br>\r\n\"I bet you can't\" Geoff complied.<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet?\" Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"10 dollars tomorrow after we're starviving again I can eat more than you!\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Brody said. The 2 shook and they got up to go.</span></div></div>",

He was a little shocked, but was glad it wasn't as much of a difference as his belly. He rubbed his stomach and it felt hard.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully it will go down...\" Brody said. He then pushed that thought aside. Brody always ate a lot, not this much, but still he had a huge appetite. \"I can work off if I gain anything!\" Brody thought.

The 2 went to the weights and started with 20 pounds. Easy. They went up to 30, easy. Before they could lift 75 pounds. They found they could lift the same amount of weight, but they were so tired afterwords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brody ... Bro ... I'm so tired ...\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"Me too man \" Brody panted.<br>\r\n\"I think we're done for the day...\" Geoff suggested, hoping Brody would agree.<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, lets get something to eat!\" Brody said.<br>\r\nGeoff and Brody called a taxi and decided to go the burrito place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We deserve to eat after working that hard!\" Brody said, after catching his breath.<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, we deserve a treat. We probably lost all the weight we gained just today!\" Geoff added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the burrito place, they ordered their usual 10 burritos. <br>\r\nAfter being so tired, Brody kept eating and eating, not paying attention to what he was grabbing af. He finished his 10 burritos and ended up eating 2 of Geoffs, since he had not yet finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you ate some of mine!\" Geoff said annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Geoff! I'll get us some more!\" Brody said. He ordered another round for each of them. When Brody got the burritos he brought them back to their table and they continued eating. Geoff tried to eat faster, so Brody wouldn't eat his burritos and hopefully eat the 2 that Brody took, but ended up eating the same amount as him: 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, are you still hungry?\" Geoff asked, worried if he could eat more.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in fact I'm very hungry!\" Brody replied, Geoff relieved it wasn't just him. Together they ordered another 2 rounds, and after that, their hunger had set. They weren't full, not at all, but full enough so that they could last another hour without eating. </span></div></div>",

They wanted something sweet, so he ordered 2 large cakes for the both of them, it arrived at their door and they started the movie. Geoff and Brody ate straight from the cake, and by the time the movie was halfway done, the cake was finished. Geoff, without thinking and focusing on the movie, ordered another cake for each of them. The cake was chocolate, rich, thick, and extra frosting; extra fattening. The 2 enjoyed the movie and weren't getting full, they weren't thinking about eating they just kept filling their mouths with delicious cake. When the movie finished, so did rhe cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way we ate that one huge cake...\" Brody said.<br>\r\n\"Bro we ate 2...\" Geoff said. \"And I'm still hungry.\" <br>\r\n\"Me too!

We should order some more cake...\" Brody begged.<br>\r\n\"I want some too, but we really have to watch these\" and he lifted up his shirt and a fat belly plunged out. Brody lifted his shirt and he had the same amount of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right, we should go to bed.\" Brody said and Geoff went to his room to fall asleep. Brody waited until he heard snoring, and then he ordered 2 more cakes: both for himself. When they arrived, he ate all of them quick. When Brody finished the last piece, Geoff came out of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to brush m-\" Geoff saw Brody finishing his cake, and before any other thought, Geoff became jealous.<br>\r\n\"Bro, you shouldv'e woke me up, we could eat together!\" Geoff said, and called up the cake bakery.

We're never full! We deserve tonight.\" Geoff said, and the cake arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff and Brody stuffed the cakes into their mouths, and on the 2nd cake, Brody's button popped off.

He took it and brought it to the table. <br>\r\n\"You still wanna eat?\" Brody asked Geoff, rubbing his big hairy belly. Geoff didn't answer, and he continued eating. Brody shrugged, and grabbed 3 burgers. They finished that bag, and moaned in pleasure of being full. They stood up to leave, and both their shirts ripped off.

This had been the first time where he could say \"*I ate too much.\" Eating 13 boxes of pizza, 80 burgers; he was in pain. He rubbed his hard belly, and he felt how big it was. It was huge, and he knew Brody's was huge too. However, Brody ate more than him. Geoff knew Brody ate 100 burgers and 17 boxes of pizza. He looked over at him, sleeping. \"That must ease the pain\" Geoff thought, and took an hour long nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff woke up to find the pain gone, but not the belly. His huge, hard, hairy belly didn't swell down, even though Geoff wanted to. With a lot of trouble, Geoff got up from the couch to use the bathroom. Once he finished he saw the scale in the bathroom, and decided to weigh himself. Last week, Geoff weighed 197. But 7 full days of being full, and today being the fullest, he figured he gained some weight.<br>\r\n\"As long as i don't weight 207.\" Geoff said, hoping not to gain 10 pounds. He stepped on the scale, and it read 212. Geoff groaned in agony, and Brody heard it. He walked into the bathroom, eating 3 chocolate bars, and Geoff told him of the situation.<br>\r\n\"15 pounds in a week! Is that even possible?!\" Geoff asked Brody. Brody tried to say something, but the sticky chocolate in his mouth blocked it off. Geoff pushed Brody towards the scale, and Geoff felt Brody's fat on his back. Brody stepped on the scale. It read 223. Geoff looked at Brody and he couldn't find an expression. Brody got off the scale and walked off.<br>\r\n\"So?\" Geoff asked.<br>\r\n\"If we weigh ourselves constantly, we're just gonna discourage us! Besides muscle weighs more than fat, maybe its muscle.\" Brody said, and he grabbed another chocolate bar. Geoff sighed, and took a chocolate bar too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, the 2 didnt do much. They did some chores, watched some tv, and didn't eat.<br>\r\n\"Man, I know we ate huge earlier today, but i I'm already hungry.\" Brody said. Geoff agreed.<br>\r\n\"I'm really craving burritos too!\" Brody added. <br>\r\n\"There's a problem... they don't deliver.\" Geoff said Brody didn't understand.<br>\r\n\"We can't leave naked!\" Geoff said, and Brody now understood. Since their clothes ripped off, they didn't bother trying to put on clothes, and they've been naked the entire time. Their big bellies covered their junk, but that was it. <br>\r\n\"So what are we gonna do?\" Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"We can get new clothes!\" Geoff said.<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry now...\" Brody said. <br>\r\n\"We can start eating 5 boxes of pizza right now, and after that we'll leave. They ordered the pizza, and when it came they finished it, but not as fast as before. They looked through their clothes hoping to find sonething big, but they ended up wearing shorts that felt like it belonged to a 5 yr old, and tgey couldn't zipper up, and t shirts that only covered their moobs. </span></div></div>",

Brody was selfish when eating, and he ate so much more than Geoff. The taxi dropped Brody off at the place snd Geoff conintued home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, Geoff got all the desserts he could get ahold of in the house. Chocolate everything was everywhere. Geoff, not being able to resist himself, had a few cakes, but then he left to get Brody. Brody handed Geoff the bags, he checked the reciepts to see he was right about Brody eating, and he started eatibg his burritos. When they arrived home, Geoff showed Brody the place and they started eating.</span></div></div>",
