He is quite book smart and learned in magical tomes. However with his intellect comes arrogance: he never admits to his wrongs. He is not the tallest in stature, nor is he the shortest, standing eye-level to Roy. He is the third heaviest koopaling, though he hates to admit it. His weight is a sore subject he wishes to change -- but will his denial lead him to greater sizes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLemmy Koopa: <br>\r\nA goof ball through and through, Lemmy takes not a care in the world. He passes time with fun and pranks. He prides himself on his acrobatics and lives to entertain. Lemmy though second oldest, is the shortest of his siblings. While plump for his size, is the lightest still. He is happy with his size, but this is subject to change when he pranks the wrong person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy Koopa: <br>\r\nRoy is calm and disciplined, he revels in his strength of mind and body. He can come across as cold, maybe even a bully, but is somewhat insecure himself. Roy is not the tallest in stature, he is however the second heaviest. A solid mass of muscle too. The biggest, the strongest, he wants it all. Of course, if he wants to get big, he needs to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIggy Koopa:<br>\r\nA mad scientist that may or may not suffer from permanent chemical fume damage. According to all his siblings, he was a little crazy to start with. He finds himself more at home among machines and formulas. He stands the tallest, and is also the thinnest. All his time spent with technology might just change him if he's not careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, Roy was totally off base.  Now Morton -- Morton was Fat. With pendulous gut swaying, he practically shook the ground each laborious step toward the castle kitchen for sweet rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ludwig? He twisted and sighed at his rounded rump and touching thighs. Well, he wasn't thin exactly. Granted he was royalty, and a scrawny Koopa noble wasn't much of a noble at all. Prosperous people expected a prosperous representative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd prosperity meant...plumpiness, Ludwig scratched his chin, pleasantly plump? He could tolerate that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his idle gut gurgles, his mind wanders elsewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>1.) The Kitchen: The Hedonist Path</b></u><br>\r\nDecadence and indulgence, with a dash of arrogance and denial, make for hefty consequences. As Ludwig pushes his weighty woes to the back of his mind, he only further kindles a strange desire that can only be fed by rich desserts and heavy meats. So he makes his way to the kitchen. J-just to check on Morton, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>2.) The LIbrary: The Jinxed Path</b></u><br>\r\nLudwig could tolerate being plump for now, but what happens when he fully bulges over that line into dreaded...Fat. Is it finally time to change his eating and exercise habits? Don't be ridiculous. A magic solution is in order, and the library might have just the thing. But magic does have a funny way of working in these sorts of stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>3.)  The Common Area: The Feedee's Path</b></u><br>\r\nLudwig's always been a tad too snooty for his own good -- a snide comment here, a rude remark there. Siblings and minions alike are annoyed. It's about time someone knocked him down a peg, or perhaps nudged him up a shell-size...or ten. As Ludwig ponders Roy's jab, he enters the Common Area, and a servant approaches him with cupcakes and a letter. A gift from his \"biggest fan.\" Now how could he turn down something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say Wendy O. Koopa had a sedentary lifestyle would be a polite way of putting it. The sole female Koopaling was vain to a fault, and would hardly ever engage in the mindless brutishness of her siblings. She was the least muscular out of all of them due to her hatred of exercise, though she still matched (and exceeded) most of them in weight. Even Ludwig, who wasn't as bad as the others, showed more aptitude for roughhousing like a hooligan than she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he only had to have done it once in his life to have her handily beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy considered herself a more elegant creature. Classy, dignified, even beautiful. She'd only ever get physical when forced to, usually by a meddlesome sewer rat in obnoxiously bright clothing- and even then, she preferred using magical attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerally though, she preferred to spend her days maintaining her beauty, revelling in her innate nobility, and enjoying the praise and reverence so deservingly heaped upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why she'd been laying sprawled out luxuriously in her satin queen sized bed for three days straight now, surrounded by a small mob of higher ranking koopa servants, who would continuously tend to her needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't put on her shoes in three full days, her claws being given pedicure after pedicure even though they didn't have a chance to get dirty. In between pedicures she was essentially receiving one long continuous foot massage, again- even though her foot muscles couldn't possibly be tense since she hadn't stood up in three days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, her golden scales and hot pink shell were polished and re-polished and re-re-polished, gleaming more cleanly than any coin. Eye shadow and mascara were carefully applied over layers that had been put in place hours ago, and her great big puffy lips, bulbous and juicy looking like a ripe tropical fruit, had so much lip gloss they looked chromatic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least unlike almost all her other body parts, she was actually using her mouth for something. In between applications of lip gloss, she was eating. Constantly. Without lifting a finger, koopas would dutifully wheel in carts directly from the kitchen- loaded with mostly pastries devoid of any real nutrition. Wendy merely had to part her plush lips, and an \u00e9claire, or a bon bon, or a tart would be hand fed to her. What few dishes weren't just sweets were decadent and savory- spiced meats or warm gooey aligot, chased exclusively with a fine wine or a fruity soft drink- unless it was a milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding the princess's particular preferred diet and exercise regime made her figure suddenly make a lot more sense.  She was shorter than most of her siblings, and had barely any muscle mass- Muscle being heavier than fat and all- yet she was amongst the heavier of them, and certainly the plumpest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer great big belly hung low on her small frame, nearly below her knees when she stood- sloshing and swaying like an apron- though it stuck out nearly as much as it hung down, round as it was. Her fatty chest rested on her belly somewhat comfortably, the size of her breasts greatly enhanced by the fat on her form. She also sported a great big rump- the biggest out of all the Koopalings if you were to line them up and compare, big enough that her tail, when at rest, was raised up a bit. Even her face had some broad tender cheeks- and her huge lips were probably also enhanced in size by fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough soft and doughy, she was quite rotund overall- really giving off an 'overstuffed' look. From her head to her toes, everything about her was plump and puffy. To the untrained eye, she looked fit to burst any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she ate- happily accepting the ceaseless onslaught of pampering from loyal servants who wouldn't question defying her. Being cleaned up and massaged and fed for hours and hours straight, napping frequently and only continuing to be fed in her sleep, her squishy overfed form growing more and more with each moment. Wendy, of course, found absolutely no problem with staying there for that long. She was comfortable, and wanted more! And more kept coming, as it ought to. After all, from her perspective, every single crumb that passed her plush lips was richly deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough naturally, if you called her \"fat\" she'd kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u><i>Uninterrupted indulgence</i></u></b><br>\r\nThough it may take another day or two of this, Wendy does get bored sometimes. And she ends up actually getting out of bed, to find somewhere else to be pampered! A spa, or maybe the banquet hall?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Can't get a MOMENT to herself...</b></i></u><br>\r\nWell, when you live in a big ol' castle with five brothers, privacy is bound to be infringed on. Someone, for some reason, walks in on Wendy- wanting to tell her something after three days of no contact. But who walked in? And what could be so important as to interrupt her ongoing hedonism?</span></div></div>",

Mario laughed a little- as obnoxiously chipper as ever- as he pointed to the wand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You want-a your wand back, mm?\" He asked. Wendy didn't reply, scowling at the plumber- wary of just what he was planning.

She started to puff up- more and more- even as she recoiled in horror, that wretched plumber held the handle of the wand up to her belly- Close enough for the magic to still be absorbed into her, but out of her reach!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled- kicked- flailed- tried to get up or curse him out- stop him somehow! But it was useless. By the time Mario dispelled the large, glowing ring, and stepped back, Wendy was simply too large to move! Mario laughed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go! I'm-a thinkin' you're not gonna be causing any kinda trouble anymore like that!\" He said triumphantly. Wendy growled- infuriated by the helpless state she'd been reduced to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost like a big round ball, stretched taut and nearly perfectly spherical- her head was poking out of the top, face squished in between two big puffy cheeks. Her hands were poking out, sunken up to the wrist, and her gold bracelets which had once hung loosely were now tight on her. Her feet also poked out of her big round body- having gotten so puffy that they'd burst out of her high heels- her toes wiggling and kicking, unable to touch the ground or move her. Her pink spiky shell, which once covered her entire back, was now comically small on her body- as was her tail, dangling off just above her butt. She was huge now- bigger than an extra-large chain chomp, and about as round- but she couldn't do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you!\" Wendy snarled, struggling to move or get up- roll over Mario and crush him maybe. \"When I get you you're gonna wish you never-...\" Wendy's empty threat trailed off as her eyes widened in horror. Mario had positioned himself right next to her, and was holding her wand like a golf club- swinging up, back- over his shoulder. \"Wh-what are you...no- no no no! Don't you dare! Don't you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long-ay Wendy!\" Mario happily sang out, as he swung her own wand directly into her gut- displaying merciless and incredible levels of strength- He sent the swollen spherical princess flying, just like an oversized golf ball, screaming her lungs out all the way! Laughing, Mario took the wand- to bring it back to the Mushroom Kingdom. \"Now, onto the next-a castle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, meanwhile, landed in the middle of a grassy field- dancing flowers and pipes strewn about, broken bricks and question blocks. She rolled for a bit- but eventually came to a stop. She was hysterical- infuriated, humiliated, disgusted- What a horrible defeat! This was a million times worse than just getting beat up- she couldn't even move!!! She'd need to wait for a Koopa or Goomba patrol to come by, and roll her back to the castle in shame. How would she ever undo this? Could she even? Wendy turned her head- wiggling her hands and feet helplessly, she tried to figure out if there was anything she could do to help her situation...</span></div></div>",

Their ages relative to each other is unknown and their actual relationship with Bowser is foggy. Nintendo confirmed that his only child is Bowser Jr., which contradicts previous game-manuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to plug the holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll we know is that Larry is the youngest and Ludwig is the oldest. Since we encounter Larry first and Ludwig last, general consensus is that the order of encounter is the order of age. A flimsy explanation at best, but for the purposes of this interactive it will suffice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can someone be a father, and not a biological one, all at once? Adoption, of course. Short and simple answer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir personality? Well that's for elaboration in the interactive proper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another expansion interactive?<br>\r\nI wanted to \"scratch an itch\" of sorts. Even if this is a niche itch. I don't expect this to be flooded with updates, but for anyone reading expect some quality control. Which goes for anyone adding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouse Rules -- as the author of this interactive I reserve the right to delete or edit any chapter that is either poor in quality or violates the following rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No character under the age of 18 will have fetishy stuff happen to them.<br>\r\nI get it, a weight gain/expansion interactive is weird and fetishy. How dare I be a hypocrite. Well, no one went to jail for getting too big. I will leave it at that. To make ages easy, the \"siblings\" are all a year apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Keep it weight gain/growth themed -- i.e. getting fatter, muscle growth, inflation, macro, or some combination of it all.<br>\r\nIf you must fine tune your chapters for your own \"itch,\" then I do not mind minor deviations. Just warn us and make it the \"B\" option. Railroading your own fetish into my interactive is going to get your chapter edited or deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Don't worry too much about realism.<br>\r\nReaching massive sizes using magic and science-fiction tech that emphasizes \"fiction\" is no issue with me. Keep it at a decent pace, though. No need to blow your whole wad in a six sentence chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. \"How much does he weigh now\" chapters are frowned upon.<br>\r\nStop me if you've heard this one before: \"After he was done eating he weighed...\" and then your choices are a couple of meaningless numbers like 230 or 300. No two people look the same after putting on thirty pounds. Flex your creative muscles for once and actually show me what the character looks like with the added weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Likewise, excessive choice chapters are frowned upon. <br>\r\nIt's fine for a chapter or two, but it gets ridiculous when there are six chapters trying to start the story. \"Is he chubby, fat, obese, or other? Other. Is he humongous, gigantic, or other? Humongous. How big is Humongous: massive, planetary, or other?\" and so on and so forth. Stop being lazy, no one is going to write the character at gigantic sizes for you. Foot the bill and just write a chapter. Different options are what the \"B\" path is for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's my rule-set for now, but it is subject to change or expansion if I deem it necessary. With that in mind, let us enter the story.</td>",
