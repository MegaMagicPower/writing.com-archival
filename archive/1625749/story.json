Ben and Kevin were both out in the desert, attempting to follow up on a lead of alien sightings, while Gwen was away for the week. Before she left, she told them it was a good time for them to bond, as she was sick of their fighting/niggling at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin hummed while he concentrated on driving, trying to ignore the annoyance in the seat next to him. Ben had a way of grinding Kevin's nerves, leading Kevin to subconsciously wonder whether it was his attraction to Ben that was leading to his reluctance to make a serious move with Gwen. But those were thoughts that were never pulled from his deepest voids. Hostility was a good choice for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ben sat twiddling with the Omnitrix, seeing if he could mess with and find the master code again. Unlocking the watch's power would certainly help towards the coming battles, especially with more and more powerful forces working their way into the dealings with Earth. But so far the Omnitrix isn't behaving, it refuses to release the secrets contained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin pulls over to the side of the road, they're there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are they?</span></div></div>",

It looked alien in design, and appeared to be giving off a weird sort of radiation, it was messing with Kevin's car's instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA screech is heard cutting across the night, and suddenly Kevin and Ben are both surrounded by a gaggle of DNAliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Kevin exclaims. \"We drive all the way out to the middle of nowhere to be caught instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not caught yet\", Ben replies, hitting his wrist. \"SPIDER MONK - what? I mean JETRAY!\"<br>\r\nThe omnitrix hadn't obeyed the command, and instead switched to Jetray. However since this happens frequently, Ben put it down to the watching being weird. As he transformed, he didn't notice the screen of the device flash orange for a second, before returning to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin kneels down and absorbs the rocky ground of the desert, and they start to fake. It was as if it was any other fight with the DNAliens, easy and ultimately pointless. The DNAliens were completely outclassed. Unfortunately for Kevin and Ben, the DNAliens didn't want to beat the boys, they wanted to delay them. The tower would be activated, and the radiation released should react to the Omnitrix, eliminating the threat of Ben once and for all. The whole thing had been a setup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower begins to glow...</span></div></div>",

Upon hearing this the DNAliens all flee, leaving Kevin  and Ben looking bewildered at the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever that is, it can't be good\" Ben yells down to Kevin, while circling the Tower as Jetray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I can tell is it is giving off insane readings, something I've never seen before. The radiation seems to be on the level of the Omnitrix\" Kevin replies, checking his dashboard instruments. \"I can't make any sense of it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humming stops, and for a moment it looks like nothing happens; but only for a moment. A burst of orange light appears at the tip of the tower, the ball of light expanding instantly and bathing the surrounding regions in the glow. Like a flash; it's there and then suddenly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Omnitrix starts to react on Ben, and in a flash Jetray crashes to the ground. Ben morphs back to normal, but an amazing thing happens that has Kevin staring up in disbelief. Ben is glowing like he does when he morphs, but he's expanding - by a lot. By the time the morph has finished Ben is twice as tall as the 200 foot tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DNAlien plan backfired, instead of eliminating the Omnitrix and Ben, it altered how the Omnitrix works. Now whenever Ben returns to normal after morphing, his human form will alter in size. A 400 foot tall teenager is hard to hide, so what should they do?</span></div></div>",

He kneels down to get closer to his tiny friend. For his part, Kevin takes the size change quite well. Sure, Ben (who used to be shorter than Kevin) could now fit Kevin quite comfortably under his big toe, but that wasn't anything to be scared of. It was in a way, erotic. Kevin never expressed it before, but there was a definite spark between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT\" Kevin yells, trying to make himself heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I can hear you fine. Actually, I can hear a lot of things. I think I've got superhearing from this size\" Ben replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing back and stretching his legs out, Ben smiled happily. Meanwhile Kevin walked over to the titan's shoes and compared himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, look at the size of you. Your shoe is a house! I bet I'd be smaller than your toe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grinned, and reached down to untie his laces and slowly slide the shoe Kevin is standing next to off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see if you're right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin gulped, but also started to get aroused by the massive foot emerging from the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen finished pulling off the shoe, and then moved his leg towards him, so his knee was pointing in the air and his socked foot was flat on the ground. Kevin walked over to the big toe, and then laid down next to it, as close as possible. It was difficult to see through the sock which was longer, the toe or the teenager. Either way, Kevin closed his eyes and breathed in the scent from the socked foot, he was definitely enjoying this. Meanwhile Ben looking down was also enjoying it, measuring the once powerful Kevin against his foot. Of course, with his size the evidence of his arousal was much more obvious. Whatever his fault, the Omnitrix wielder was definitely not lacking in that area.</span></div></div>",

The heat radiating out from Ben's body was intense, but oddly relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really working Ben\" Kevin said, \"I can't tell if I'm longer or not with your sock on. Why don't you take it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was a little surprised. \"You mean you want to be next to my bare foot?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it isn't my first choice of surrounding... but it isn't my last choice either\" Kevin replied, winking at Ben in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning (and finding himself getting even more aroused from Kevin) peeled off of his sock, and then placed it on the other side of Kevin's body. Then Ben slide his foot over so Kevin was lying directly next to it. Kevin was happy, on his left was the massive toe of Ben, while on the right the soft white cotton sock. On comparison, Kevin was slightly longer than the toe. Of course, Ben's toe was much wider and had a greater mass, so a fight between the two (teenager vs giant big toe) there is no doubt where Kevin would end up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen teasingly raised his toe, and hovered it over Kevin's relaxed body.

The large feet bursting out of the boots and bursting through the walls as if they were made from paper, as Kevin continued to swell filling the room. The rest of the goop was smothered by his growing body, and absorbed as well. This set off an even larger reaction, and Kevin burst into growth. In a few seconds his clothes were nothing but scraps on the ground, while he'd outgrown the large room and was expanding through the entire facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up his head ploughed through the floors above, until he managed to stand still. His growing feet consumed the lower levels, the weight of his growing body crashing through floors as he filled the facility from top to bottom, expanding from the middle.

It was quite a big change, going from a 2000 foot dinosaur alien back into his rather twiggy, kind of short, human body. To Kevin, it was like Ben had simply disappeared as his tiny human body was far too small for him to see. Luckily he had managed to drop Ben onto his shoulder. Unfortunately for Ben he transformed back just as Kevin let go of his body. The fall, therefore, was quite long and rather horrifying. When Ben made contact with Kevin's shoulder he was thankful that Kevin's skin, despite his humongous size, was quite soft and he was relatively unhurt; he just had a few bruises. Just as Ben stood up and looked around, Kevin started walking. With every earth shaking step Ben found himself tossed around on the shoulder. After nearly getting tossed off the shoulder Ben desperately cried out, \"KEVIN!!\" as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin didn't hear even a squeak. Ben was totally incapable of conversing with Kevin at his current size. Kevin's ear, from Ben's position, was high, high above his head. Even if Kevin had heard Ben he would probably find it hilarious that his size was so great that just walking was upending Ben's whole world. His cock was already rock hard from this whole experience, bobbing in front of him. With another step, Ben found himself tumbling off the front of Kevin's shoulder and falling down into the void. Ben quickly started cycling between aliens, getting ready to slam the Omnitrix and transform when he felt himself smash into something even softer than Kevin's shoulder. He shook his head and looked around. He had fallen a, relatively, short distance onto Kevin's nipple. The soft pink flesh extended around him and made a decent perch to sit on. The vibrations from Kevin's steps was less noticeable here, allowing Ben to stand freely. He sighed and looked behind him. Kevin's muscular pec rose before him, taking up his whole field of vision. He craned his neck back as far as he could and could just make out Kevin's face beyond the swell of his pec, a smirk firmly in place. He was enjoying this.</span></div></div>",

Luckily the nipple was large enough to be comfortable, and as long as Kevin didn't start moving violently (like running) then there should be no danger of falling off. However Ben didn't want to stay on the nipple, he wanted to explore. This was the perfect chance to get closer to Kevin, and it was painfully obvious that both Ben and Kevin found this entire situation hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Kevin decided to take a break from walking, and so he sat down on a forest, his massive body flattening the land all around. Relaxing back his feet ended up in the middle of a (now half-destoryed) village a couple of miles away, while his head used the side of the mountain as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Ben's opportunity, he could now explore the body as it was lying down. Leaving the nipple Ben slid down the mountainside that was Kevin's pec, reaching the top of the massive abs. Kevin's muscular stomache appeared to be large, long and flat hills, with wide valleys in between. Due to Kevin's breathing the abs were constantly moving, in a way that caused the bulge in Ben's pants to get even harder (if it was even possible).</span></div></div>",

Ben directed his attention to the task immediately before him. Crossing the abs was going to take a long time, but Ben was in no hurry. He wanted to savor this experience to its fullest extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy reached down and removed his shoes and socks wanting to feel Kevin's hot skin underneath is bare soles. He walked onto the top right ab and and slowly made his way down. It moved up and down as Kevin breathed, Ben moving up and down. Ben looked behind him and saw that Kevin was leaning back, his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if he can feel me...\" Ben thought to himself. He reached down and rubbed his hands over the skin. It was smooth, with no imperfections or bumps. In a word, perfect. Ben rubbed his bulge absently as he rubbed his other hand over the skin. He thought about stopping right here for awhile and releasing himself all over the abs but he didn't want to rid himself of these feelings just yet. He moved on, over the constantly moving landscape, and came to the first valley between abs. He slid down the side of it, the temperature increasing with every foot he slid. Soon, he had reached the bottom of the valley. He looked up and saw the sky between the colossal muscles and felt his heart pound. This was beyond anything he had ever experienced or had ever hoped to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben continued his over the massive body Kevin was staring up at the sky. He knew Ben was walking over him somewhere and that idea filled him with lust knowing how much power he had over this whole world. His cock twitched as he imagined what he could do.</span></div></div>",

Unable to reach his omnitrix in time, Ben slid down the bottom of the monolithic abs until he crashed into the massive tangled forest of Kevin's pubes. Luckily for Ben he landed somewhere soft where he could hang on. Unluckily for Ben he landed somewhere he found incredibly hot, which would be distracting now that he had to hang on to survive. Being so close to the massive cock and balls was definitely intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kevin, the landscape below him was surreal. The entire world seemed flat, void of anything taller than the edge of his toes. Entire forests were nothing more than a gentle mossy surface against his soles. The only possible thing of interest was a mountain range in the distance, although it wasn't too far away or too large. From a distance Kevin couldn't tell how tall the range was, however it would be too far away for any mere mortal to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking steps that cover thousands of feet (if not more) at a time, Kevin strides towards the mountains. Farms, villages, forests, anything that falls beneath the massive feet of the titan are obliterated without thought. </span></div></div>",

It wasn't until he heard things begin to shatter that he started running to Kevin. But before he could get to his friend, a huge foot burst through the wall. Ben was shocked. He and Kevin were the only humans in this mountain so that meant....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen quickly ran for the entrance to the tunnels, hoping he wouldn't get squished by his friends growing body. He threw the door open and ran outside and down the slope, just as he heard the floors inside the mountain collapse. He kept running until he heard the sounds stop. Slowly turning around, Ben couldn't have imagined the sight before him. Kevin's head had bursted through the side of the mountain and his bare legs were out as well. Ben was expecting his now giant friend to get rid of the crumbling mountainside around him, but instead Kevin kept looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben?\" Kevin asked, looking around, wondering where his friend is. He wanted to burst out of this mountainside badly, but he knew he had to make sure Ben was safe before he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen slowly started walking up to Kevin. He passed the huge feet and was now walking in between his friends legs. \"Kevin!\" Ben yelled, hoping the giant would hear him. Thankfully, he did, as Kevin looked down to where Ben was standing. He burst his arm through the house and moved his hand towards Ben, telling him to jump on. Ben did and felt himself rising up until he got to Kevin's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Ben asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin smirked, \"Give me one second to answer that, this house is killing me\". Standing up, Kevin felt the remains of the facility break and fall off of him until he was standing up. It wasn't until Ben looked down that he realized Kevin was naked. He couldn't help but blush. He had secretly liked Kevin for a while, but never had a chance to see him naked.</span></div></div>",

Reasoning: They create confusion, specially when names are misspelled and such. This story is about Ben 10 Ultimate Alien, so keep it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll characters are out of character! There is no way Ben really would rampage ect (although Kevin might).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosts: Please keep posts to do with the story. I don't want any chapters added complaining about things. I'll just delete them. Chapters are for stories, not rants. (I've seen good stories ruined by ranting).</td>",
