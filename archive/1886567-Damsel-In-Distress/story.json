Call me later.\" Eric says.<br>\r\n\"Sure, later.\" you say as you hang up and put the phone back in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk down the dusky street, you notice that today seems a lot duller than usual.  The streets are quiet as the clouds brood in the distance.  A faint rumble can be heard from them.  A calm before the storm, perhaps.  Fearing rain, people must have ended their routines prematurely to go home and stay dry.  \"Wimps.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass an alleyway caught between two bricked buildings, something catches the corner of your eye.  There is a large man hunched over a woman and it looks like there struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it, just take it!\" The woman pleads, panic and strain are heard in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even thinking you burst into action.  \"What's going on here?\" yell.<br>\r\n\"Call the cops!\" the woman shouts.<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!  Shut up bitch!\" the thug says to you before turning back at the lady and finishing his thoughts.<br>\r\n\"I called them thirty seconds ago!\" you lie, holding up your phone.  It's a newer model, and maybe the man in front of you won't know what's going on.<br>\r\n\"Shit, you can keep it.\" says the man as he turns and races away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash over to the girl.  \"Are you alright?!\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Please, I'm fine, thank you, go.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, did he hurt you?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, please, stop.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her, she struggling right now, something internally is going on.  You're too chivalrous to leave her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know him? What was he trying to do you you?\"<br>\r\n\"He wanted to rob me.\" she says.<br>\r\nYou look over her, she has some earrings, a tiny necklace, and a bracelet.  The bracelet seems to be the only thing of any value.  She's not even carrying a purse.  You examine her quickly in your head and realize she has almost nothing worth taking.  She's wearing some provocative clothes, which really bring out her curves, and abnormally high platform shoes, which you assume cost some money, but knowing nothing about women's fashion, you assume the mugger didn't either.<br>\r\n\"He wanted this.\" she says holding up the bracelet, so tight it seems like it's hugging her wrist.<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful.\" you think as it shines off of some unseen light.  \"Why didn't you just give it to him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to, you have no idea how badly I wanted too.\" she says tugging at it.<br>\r\n\"Is it stuck? Do you need me to help pry it off?\"<br>\r\n\"No, don't!\" she says as you start to pull on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's tight, it almost looks like she grew into this bracelet.  After a moment of tugging, you and her make eye contact.  There is a look of lust in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really trying, aren't you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd pull harder but I don't want to hurt you.\" you boast.<br>\r\n\"Let me thank you.\" she says with bedroom eyes.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts seem to almost pop out of her top as she goes in for the kiss.  Barely thinking of it, you return her motion, and your lips lock.  For a second, you are in complete ecstasy.  No doubt she feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly pulls back and suddenly seems to awake.<br>\r\n\"What did we just do?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"You just gave me a kiss.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh god, this will only end in sex!\" she says, almost sounding horrified.<br>\r\n\"What? Whoa! Slow down sister, I was only making...\"<br>\r\n\"No you don't understand.\" she says as she backs away from you.<br>\r\n\"No I don't.\"<br>\r\n\"I doesn't matter that neither of us want this.\"  She says before tripping on her heels.  She's about to fall when you throw yourself in her way, and she tumbles right into you as her momentum knocks you both to the ground.<br>\r\nSomehow her breasts are right in your face, and you're possessing a massive boner which is being squeezed between her legs.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" she says.<br>\r\nYou try and say something back but only let out a muffled sound from beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go now.\" she says as she gets up.<br>\r\n\"Hey can you help ME up?\" you ask as you grab her hand.  Accidentally grabbing her bracelet.<br>\r\nShe looks at you almost helplessly.  Sh looks too weak to do anything but provide balance.<br>\r\nBoth hands grip, covering her bracelet as she pulls you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say as you let go of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a moment of surprise she looks down at her wrist and sees it bare.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" she gasps.<br>\r\nYou look down to see that you somehow undid the bracelet.<br>\r\n\"Drop it quick!\" she warns you.<br>\r\n\"I swear, I wasn't trying to steal it.\" you say putting your hand out to give it back to her.<br>\r\n\"No, I don't want it!\" she says.<br>\r\n\"You're being confusing.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Please...too late.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see that the bracelet is around your right wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have slipped on.\" you say not sure at what just happened.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, this is bad.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'll just take it off.  I swear I have no idea how it did that.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"It's...\"<br>\r\nYou tune her out as before your eyes, the woman starts to look less glamorous. <br>\r\nHer hair looks a bit shorter, her curves less voluptuous, there is a clear tomboy look about her.<br>\r\n\"Did you just change?\" you ask.<br>\r\nShe looks down and sees her breasts have clearly reduced in size.<br>\r\n\"I don't have much time.  Listen and listen close, you need to look up something called Lana's Legacy.\"<br>\r\n\"Say that again?\" you ask, still staring at her breasts.<br>\r\n\"I have to go. You need to get to someplace safe!\" she says as she runs down the alleyway, her balance improving with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was strange.\" you think as you start to walk out of the alleyway.<br>\r\nThere is no point in actually calling the police, since you have no clue what actually happened.</span></div></div>",

Sure the girl was a bit strange, but there is no doubt in your mind you did the right thing.  You saved the girl, just like the comic heroes you used to read about when you were younger.  Every inch of you brims of confidence.  You don't even mind the feminine looking bracelet on your hand.  You tug on it a bit, but it's too tight.  You'll have to soak your hand with oil when you get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" you say in a sly manner as you pass a decent looking woman walking towards you on the sidewalk.  She can probably tell by your expression and body language that you're planning on hitting on her.  She looks at you disgustedly.<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you cross the street, you walk towards a girl waiting for the lights to change.  She's not as hot as the other two you passed, but you're feeling in the mood to celebrate.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say in your smooth ways.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" the girl replys nervously.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to cut to the chase, I saw you from across the street and was stunned by your beauty.  I wondered if you wanted to get dinner sometime.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm flattered, but I don't do scissors.\" the girl says as the light changes and she crosses the street.<br>\r\n\"What the hell does that mean?!\" you think.  You can feel your newly acquired confidence leaving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pace of your walk has slowed.  It's a 40 minute trip to your apartment by foot, and you're feeling tired for some reason.<br>\r\n\"Hey good looking.\" a tall man says as he gets near you.<br>\r\nYou look around before pointing towards yourself.  \"Me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I own a club just down the street.  I was wondering if you'd want to, inspect it, with me.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I don't swing that way.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" he asks.<br>\r\nYou just walk away, your heart racing.  You don't like it how your body is responding to the attention, and you want to get away from him before it gets really awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the guy is out of sight, you slow down once again.  You have no idea why you feel so tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see the reflection of someone walking behind you in the window of a bakery.<br>\r\nYou quickly turn around, only to find that there is no one there.  Either she's really fast or your mind is playing tricks on you.<br>\r\nAs you walk past a clothing store you see the same lady's reflection.<br>\r\nYou casually turn around to see that there is no one behind you.<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" you think.<br>\r\nYou look around once more to see her reflection still in the window.  Is she on the other side?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk closer to the window as the woman in it grows bigger with each step.  Her actions mirroring yours.<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" you gasp with the revelation of her identity.  A bracelet on her left hand shining off some unseen light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's wearing nylon stockings and two inch high heeled sandals.  Her midriff is showing as her white top is tied on around her rather large breasts.  Long red hair flows to her shoulders part of her face.  Her rich, light skin makes you surprised that no freckles have formed on it.  You can see her lashes curve up in a doe-like manner, as a soft pink lipstick graces her mouth.  You touch your face to confirm your discovery and see that her nails have been painted a dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's me.\" you quietly say as you look down at yourself and wondered why you didn't notice your voluptuous body before seeing it in the window.</span></div></div>",

Now that you are aware of the changes, you are more aware of things, like the feeling of your breasts bouncing and the air moving across you legs and under your skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are only a couple blocks from home when a car pulls up to the curb and a man says, \u201cHey babe! Do you need a ride?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are very tired, so you agree, \u201cSure! That would be great! These shoes are killing my feet!\u201d You get into his car. You put on your seatbelt, and as soon as it is on, you feel a hand go around your mouth. There is some kind of cloth there and it has a funny smell. You struggle, but soon feel sleepy, then things go dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up wondering where you are. After a while, you realize that you are tied to a bed, your arms and legs tied to the posts. You realize that this is a very bad position for a girl! You also realize that there is a gag in your mouth! The guy who offered you a ride comes in, \u201cAh! You are finally awake! Now we can get started.\u201d He sits next to you, reaches under your skirt and begins to rub your crotch through your panties. As you struggle, he says, \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like that? You will learn to.\u201d He moved his other hand and begins to squeeze your breasts. \u201cYou will learn to love me, or you will die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to scream, but the gag is in too tight. You are completely helpless! Just as he began to reach down your panties, the bedroom door bursts open! A tall, very rough looking man comes over and, with strong arms, grabs the man on the bed and throws him across the room! The new man says, \u201cI saw you bring her in here you pervert! Let her go!\u201d A fight goes on, but not long. The man who burst in may not have been handsome, but he was a construction worker and very strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he had knocked out the first guy, the new man comes over and begins to untie you, \u201cSorry I did not get here sooner. I couldn\u2019t convince the cops that I saw you being carried in. I knew this guys was a sleaze ball! So I decided to come in on my own.\u201d He tied the first man up with the rope he took off of you. \u201cBut now we better call the cops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all over and the police had taken the first man away, one officer offered you a ride home. You looked at your rescuer. \u201cThank you officer, but I want to thank the man who saved me.\u201d You heard him tell his name to the police, \u201cWould you take me to your place for a cup of coffee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure why you were doing this, but you convinced him to take you home. As soon as you were in the door, you found yourself saying, \u201cPlease let me thank you for help.\u201d Before you knew what you were doing, your arms were around this sweaty man, kissing him passionately, then sliding one of your hands down you started rubbing his crotch! You couldn\u2019t stop yourself! Soon he was carrying you to his bed, and you got to experience sex as a female for the first time! You moaned and panted and thanked him over and over! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, and had dumped his load inside of you, he collapsed and fell asleep on top of you. It took you a while to fee yourself, but when you did, you cleaned up the sticky mess and got dressed. You kissed the sleeping man again to thank him and slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now a long way from your house, and you had to go through Chinatown to get home. As if everything that had happened was not bad enough, you realize that you are changing again! You look at yourself in a store window to find that\u2026</span></div></div>",

Now what? As you walk down the street, you begin to notice something else. You can\u2019t even read the signs around you! If you didn\u2019t know this town as well as you did, you would have no clue where your house was! You stop and listen to some people around you. Most of them you can\u2019t understand. It takes a while before you realize that the ones you do are speaking Chinese! So you don\u2019t even speak English now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have only traveled about two blocks when you hear a man say, \u201cMi! There you are!\u201d He grabs you roughly and drags you behind him. When he stops, it is in a back alley. \u201cI told you! You work for me now!\u201d He grabs your throat and begins to choke you! You are too small and weak to stop him! As he chokes you, he says, \u201cEither you do what I tell you or you are dead! You are a hooker now! Do you work for me or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp out yes as well as you can. He tosses you to the ground. \u201cThat is your first lesson. You will not survive a second, so do what I tell you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that you are this man\u2019s sex slave, and you have nobody to turn to. For two weeks, you live the life of a prostitute in great shame, but you have no choice. You are a hooker or you are dead. Just when you begin to wonder if this is your new life for good, one of the men who paid to spend time with you talks to you. Not only does he not have sex with you, but stops you from undressing. After learning your name, he says, \u201cMi. I am from a group working to rescue girls like you from this life. I can\u2019t come back a second time. If you want your freedom, says so and come with me. If you are happy with your life as it is, tell me now and I will go away and never bother you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to cry. \u201cYes! Please take me away from here! I don\u2019t want this life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, though there were some close calls, he gets you out and into his car. He takes you to a house and shows you a room. \u201cThis is your room. The others must be out somewhere now, but when they come back, they will help you get a legal identity and find you a new home where that man will never find you. You are safe now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry, \u201cThank you!\u201d You begin to kiss him. Soon, you are in bed and making love passionately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it is over, the man seems upset. \u201cMi, I want you to know, I did not rescue you for that reason. I don\u2019t know what came over me. You are better than that Mi. You are more than a woman just meant for sex. Take care of yourself.\u201d Then he awkwardly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what came over him. Somehow, you are always a woman in distress, and the man who rescues you seems to get a very good reward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to leave before someone comes home. You are actually only a few blocks from your house now. After failing to remove that bracelet, you begin to feel yourself changing yet again! In a window you see\u2026</span></div></div>",

You look down and realize that you are wearing a very shabby dress. You wonder who you are now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are wondering what is next, a pickup truck with two men pull up next to you on the street. A man jumps up and says, \u201cThere you are Mary Lou! Don\u2019t you dare run off on me like that again! If I wouldn\u2019t have found you fast, I might have missed my deadline!\u201d The man is like a giant to you, and you find yourself too terrified to resist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know what is going on, you are pulled into the truck between the two men. The truck pulls up to an eighteen-wheeler, where the man who drug you into the truck now drug you into the cab. Before your confused mind knows what is going on, you are on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, sitting as far away from the strange man as you can, you muster up the courage to ask, \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs, \u201cHome of course! Your daddy is pissed off at you girl! He told me that if I found you and brought you back, you were mine. So when we get back to Alabama, we will be hitched.\u201d He smiled, \u201cI look forward to seeing that little belly of yours swell up. And I don\u2019t see any reason to waiting to get him to start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the truck stopped, he made good on his promise. He took you in for something to eat, then when you were back inside, he threw you into the sleeper and had his way with you. You discovered that you were a virgin until that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two days, you were never far from him unless you went into the women\u2019s bathroom, and he always waited outside. He was always rough with you, in or out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, in a truck stop, John, who\u2019s name it took you two days to learn, said, \u201cI am going to take a shower. You stay right here until I come back. You will be sorry if I have to look for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a young man came up to you and started talking to you. He was very nice, and you found out that he was in the Marines. You had hopes that he might be the one to rescue you from John, but he was not nearly big enough to fight someone like John. You did enjoy his company for a while. At last you said, \u201cLook, Paul, you are a great guy. But you should leave before John gets back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked sad, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Is that your boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \u201cNo. Not exactly.\u201d Paul persisted until you told him the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took your hand, \u201cCome on. I will take you somewhere he can\u2019t touch you. I have some friends with a nice family. They will help you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then John came and what you feared happened. The two men went outside. Only, to you shock and pleasant surprise, Paul had John down and out in moments after they started. Paul grabbed you hand, \u201cCome on!  I think some of his friends are getting ideas!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right about being out of John\u2019s reach. Paul signed you in as a guest and took you onto the Marine base! There he took you to some base housing. He knocked on the door and a woman answered. Paul said, \u201cI really need to talk to you and Gunny ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe explained the situation, and they took you in and gave you a room. They left to get some extra food. You knew what was coming next as you said, \u201cThank you Paul.\u201d You began to kiss him, and soon you were making love to him. Odd, but you were getting to enjoy this part!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other times, for some reason, you stayed in Mary Lou\u2019s body for a week. It was not until you left the base alone and were walking in town that you felt the changes start again. Now what? And thanks to John, you were now thousands of miles from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a store window and walked over. This time you saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

Well, this was different. Even as a Chinese girl your skin had been lighter. You did not mind it. Skin color meant nothing to you personally. It was a much bigger change going from male to female than from white to black. But not everyone felt that way, and you wondered if your next dilemma might be caused by some kind of racial tensions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for now it seemed. A woman walked up to you, \u201cTiana, if you want that job, get in here now!\u201d You soon found yourself a waitress at a local restaurant, and you swore that, when you got out of this curse, would never be a jerk to a waitress again! You had your ass grabbed, breasts felt up, and were propositioned more than you thought possible, and that was just your first night! Now you wondered if some man would rescue you from this? No such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Friday was payday, and that was worthwhile. What you were doing was working double shifts to earn enough money to show that you could take care of your brothers and sisters. You had to get them away from your drugged out mother and abusive step-father! In the little time you had to think each day, you began to wonder about this curse. Were these things you were being forced to do just random? Were they made-up just to torment you? Or was it more? Were you taking the place of a real woman for a while? You were beginning to think so. Each name was different, and you had memories in each body. You spoke with a different accent. Hell, you once couldn\u2019t speak English! But no matter what, your actions seemed guided. You did what that woman would do, not what you would have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, you tried everything to remove the bracelet, but you couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, as you were walking back to your apartment, Leon, a local punk and gang member, grabbed you as you passed, \u201cYou know Ti, I am getting tired of you ignoring me!\u201d His grip on your arm hurt! \u201cI see where you are living slut. I think it is time we got to know each other better! I am moving in with you, right now!\u201d In spite of your screams and protests, nobody did a thing as he drug you to your own door and made you give him the key! As soon as the door closed, you had no doubt where things would go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had his way with you, he went through your things, found the money you were saving, and took everything you had! Your tears meant nothing to him. Worse, he made it clear that you had two choices. One, quit your job and be his girl, or two, be found dead somewhere. If this had been your life, you might have asked, \u2018Why me?\u201d, but for you, this was more like what you came to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief came from an unexpected source. While you were at the gang\u2019s \u2018club-house\u2019 one day, a fight broke out between Leon and one of his lieutenants. Knives were pulled, and Leon lost. The winner, who you only ever heard called Bumper, grabbed you and took you into a private room. He stared at you, \u201cTiana, I know what you were trying to do before Leon grabbed you. I already have a woman, so you are free. Take Leon\u2019s money and get out of town tonight. I can protect you that long. Leave, and get your family out too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to cry, \u201cOh thank you! You may have a woman, but please, let me thank you before I go!\u201d You tried hard to give him the best sex he ever had! And there was no denying that you enjoyed it! Afterward, you got cleaned up and headed home. Leon had used your apartment to hide his share of the money from the gang\u2019s various activities. You never saw it, but you knew where it was. You gasped when you saw enough to by a home and start a new life! You packed only enough to get out, and left as fast as you could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a small town where you got off of the bus. But the change happened when you got off of the bus. In the Ladies room at the bus station, you saw you were now\u2026</span></div></div>",

Long, coal black hair, a spiked dog collar, your whole outfit screamed goth. Not to mention the black makeup and black polish on your nails! What was this about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask yourself anything else, two goth girls burst into the bathroom, \u201cThere you are Lynn! Let\u2019s go! the guys are waiting and we will be late for the concert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let them drag you along until you got to three guys. Since they went to their guys, your date was easy to pick out. You did not resist when he took your hand, and from the way he touched you in the car, you figured you were his girlfriend, so you determined to enjoy things while you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long ride, and soon you were necking with the guy who\u2019s name you had not even learned yet, but even when his hand was on your thighs, you did not stop him, but just enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to whatever was causing your changes, you seemed to enjoy the music at the concert, even though as a man, which seemed like an eternity ago, you hated anything goth! From the others talking to him, you learned that your boyfriend\u2019s name was Cal. You really liked him and began to hope that, whatever happened, it would wait until you had a chance to make love to Cal at least once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat idea when out the window when you went alone to get a drink. As you passed a stand, someone grabbed you from behind, covering your mouth! You were drug out into the parking lot, and thee huge guys easily lifted you into the back of a pickup truck. It was three redneck boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader pushed you onto your back. \u201cSee guys?\u201d As he squeezed your breasts, \u201cThese freaks have real parts!\u201d You were infuriated by the freaks comment, but too terrified at what you knew was coming to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they had done more than open your top and expose your breasts, a new voice said, \u201cCraig, I warned you to leave them alone. Especially Lynn. Let her go and we won\u2019t have a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another redneck guy, and somehow you knew his name was Mike. Two of the guys backed away, but not Craig, \u201cLook at her Mike! She ain\u2019t good for nothing but a good lay! And barely that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was not slowed down. He looked at the other two, who seemed to fear him, \u201cI don\u2019t have a gripe with you boys. This is between me and him. Why don\u2019t you take a walk?\u201d\u201d To your surprise, they left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two guys were fighting. Mike took is share of hits, but he won. He opened the tailgate of the truck and offered you his hand. \u201cCome on Lynn. I will take you back to your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled up at him, \u201cThank you Mike, but can we go somewhere private?\u201d You really enjoyed making love to Mike in the cab of his pickup truck that night! When you were done, you realized that you could not remember what it was like to be male anymore, and you didn\u2019t care!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all over, you walked through the parking lot to go back to your friends, anticipating having sex with Cal!

I am so glad you are back!\" She then took you into her arms and kissed you passionately, right there in public! And to your surprise, you were kissing her back with equal passion! As she took you home, it did not take much to realize that you were now a lesbian!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman's name was Anne, and you were soon in bed with her. Over the next couple of days, you not only felt that you loved Anne, but you were getting comfortable with the whole lesbian thing. That was incredible since, before all this happened, you would have been disgusted to see the displays you were now making in public!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went well for a week, until one day after heading back to your car after lunch with Anne, you were grabbed from behind with a rough hand over your mouth. You were being pulled into an alley, and the man was much too strong to escape! You heard a rough voice say, \"You can't keep going the way you are! You body is meant to be used by a man, and I am going to show you what that means!\" Even as he was talking, he stuffed a rag into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had ripped your panties from you and you had pulled up your skirt and forced your legs apart. You were resigned to the idea that you were going to be raped, when suddenly something happened. Something hit your assailant on the head. There was a scuffle, and there the man was, laying unconscious next to you you! A large, black man was standing there looking at you, \"Ma'am, you might want to cover yourself up.\" He looked around nervously. \"And we should get out of here. This is a not a good place for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took you to his apartment to clean up. As always, you rewarded your rescuer, but it was different this time. You actually did not enjoy the sex, but instead pretended to. And the worst part was wondering if Anne would still love you if she found out how you thanked this man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you left his place, it happened again. No surprise there.

She lowered her sunglasses to check you out. \"Joanne? Is that you?\" she expressed, hopefully. \"Uh...yes?\" you replied. She grinned, grabbing you into a warm embrace. \"The curse sucks, doesn't it, John?\" she expressed. You pulled away, stunned. \"Y-You know???\" She nodded. \"Yep! I'm Anne's sister! I....I knew what would happen to her, but I couldn't stop it. Hannah and Anne got married, the sex with Major Bob never happened because well it happened to you! You actually prevent a lot of pain for women. Let's walk and I will explain the rest.\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took your hand and you followed her. \"Okay, now in the reality; you are Joanne Hill. You will find yourself taking the place of another girl who will be kept in a cage. You will be subjected to the worse horrors. After that, you will be rescued by Billy!\" she explained. \"But why?\" you gasped. \"That's the curse, I'm afraid! Oh, I'm Billy by the way. I'm kinda transgender. So I will be the one, you'll be thanking! You see I am cursed with foresight. I have been able to get men to come to your rescue. And I hear how you have loudly thanked them. My strap-on, that I am wearing now, longs for you!\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....\" \"Its\u2019 okay, Joanne! You see that raven haired girl ahead. That's your roommate Heidi! Go to her, she is waiting for you!\" she interrupted. \"But what about...\" You looked around for Billy, but you couldn't see her. You felt a different kind of terror. You were heading into a situation that you yourself knew about. But there was nothing you could do as Heidi hailed you over. Heidi was wearing a black tank top and shorts. Her smile didn\u2019t hide the mischievous eyes. She wrapped around her arms across your belly. You give out an involuntary giggle. \"Feeling ticklish?\" she teased. You turn red at that. \"So let's get something to eat!\" she declared. You could only nod with Heidi. She beamed at you, keeping one hand across your ribs. You bite your lips, why is she deliberately tickling you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks you over to a strange door underground. You feel your breath quickening. Is this where you end up in a cage? A man opens a hole in the door, his grey eyes watching you both. \"Password?\" he demanded. \"Ticklish!\" Heidi replied, giving your ribs a squeeze. You squeal, giggling a little. The door opens and you can see tables everywhere. \"What do you think hon? A restaurant based on the slave-master mentality? Now let's eat!\" she declared. You weren't sure at all about this. But you didn't have much option. You ate the salad, surprised at how nice it tasted. \"So Joanne, let's talk about your submission. I am selling you to Samuel Johnson!\u201d she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can gasp, she declares \u201cStrip!\u201d You lose the dress straight away, not a stitch was on your body as you follow it up with your sandals. \u201cNow we have agreed that as part of the transfer from me as your Mistress to Samuel; I will tell you what you are in for. He will sodomise you like I do; though I know he lacks my skill! You will spanked, tickled, itched, tickled, dusted, tickled, teased, machine screwed, tickled; all the basics for a proper submission. He has several rape fantasies that he will explore with you. He is far less disciplined and skilled than I am; but he will compensate with far more violence. He will push you further I think. I am pleased to have had a time with you, but that time is past! Lick me to orgasm!\u201d she commanded, dropping her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel great horror as you dropped to all fours and began pleasing her womanhood. It tastes pleasant and you are relieved that she is shaved. \u201cThe bottom I ownnnn\u2026.\u201dhuhuh\u201d isn\u2019t beeeing pumped! Pump it!\u201d she ordered. You feel your hand spread out before your index finger penetrates your back entrance. You are amazed at how good it feels as you continue pleasing her. \u201cOhhhh! Good girl! To-tomorrow you will enjoy your 19 with Samuel! Right nooooowww, I command you\u2026make me orgasm!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue seems to speed up as you force your head further between her legs. You kept up the thrashing feeling the softness of her nether lips contrast with the harsh action of her thighs trapping your ears. Your swollen hole was starting to buck as you furiously pushed it wider. You didn\u2019t know how to feel, only that you had to make her orgasm. It was actually very fast. She began to gush and you felt something shoot down your throat. It tasted salty, but nice. You didn\u2019t stop though, your eyes were closed to protect yourself from the wetness that lay between her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t made a sound since she gave you her orders. Her legs were as stiff as they had been since you started. Your lips began to suck as if you had to clean and dry her as well. She didn\u2019t move though as you pushed more liquid from her into her mouth. You craved this liquid, its taste was becoming more and more enjoyable. The burning sensation in your backside didn\u2019t subside, it almost slowed down to keep from release. Oh, how you wanted release. It was like some porn movie, where the submissive couldn\u2019t climax without permission. Was that was this was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d she declared. You separated from her, still on all fours, while she pulled up her jeans. \u201cYou will learn to love c***. I am told it is far less pleasant than p****, but that isn\u2019t my concern.  Apparently Samuel is far less experienced than me and thus hasn\u2019t learnt to control himself. I trust you enjoyed that I grant you the chance to taste me again and actually hear me express enjoyment?\u201d she exclaimed, her voice imperially and with a strong tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mistress Heidi! I enjoyed sampling your core! I am glad that you granted this sl** the chance to taste your honey!\u201d you replied. You felt your body\u2019s desperation, but you could do nothing about it. You feared what it would be like with this Samuel Johnson psycho. \u201cThe bottom that I own is dirty! It needs cleaning!\u201d she states, like she is talking to a disobedient dog. Like a good b****, you rise unto her lap. She reached into handbag, taking something out. You wanted to see but you couldn\u2019t. \u201cI forbid you from releasing your fluids unto my thighs!\u201d she commands. \u201cYes Mistress!\u201d you respond, before you felt a burning on your left cheek that made you gasp. A second did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaughty!\u201d she expressed. You could hear it before it struck your firm seat. It was agonising as it began its motion. \u201cSweeping away dust and liquid of the bottom I own, is important to keep it clean!\u201d she declared as she continued with the horrible duster. You couldn\u2019t tell if you were shrieking, crying or screaming with laughter or cackling. All you knew is that your r*** was sensitive to tickling and you couldn\u2019t take much more. All that followed was more torture as your water leaked from your eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cSamuel! Sit down, we have work to discuss!\u201d She stopped to lift you up. He didn\u2019t look very old. You weren\u2019t even sure he was a man, he had acne and thick glasses. \u201cNow where is what you promised me?\u201d demanded Heidi. He nervously clicked his fingers and a beautiful redhead walked towards you both, naked. \u201cIs this my new Mistress? Thank God, because this\u2026\u201d \u201cFloor NOW\u201d commanded Heidi. The girl dropped to the floor like a shot. \u201cI can see that she was too much for you. Joanne is far more broken! She will do absolutely anything you want. Any fantasy you have. I understand you like to beat girls?\u201d she enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but Diana\u2026well I\u2019ve struggled\u2026\u201d \u201cSamuel, dominance takes control. The submissive has it, you must convince and cojole her for it to stay that way. While the submissive can always end it; the true Dominant ensures they willingly surrender all control to you! Now here is Joanne! Command her to do whatever you want!\u201d she declared, moving you to the ground. You feel such terror. He is going to put you in a cage. \u201cSo what should I do?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat is not my concern! Let\u2019s go Diana!\u201d she declared, clicking her fingers. Diana went willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel looked at you as terrified as you felt. \u201cYou\u2019ll do anything?\u201d he stammered. You can\u2019t stop yourself from nodding. \u201cYes, Master Samuel!\u201d He paused, before getting angry. \u201cYou stupid, f****** bit**!\u201d he declared, punching you in the nose. You fall with a thud! \u201cWhy are you so worthless?\u201d he cried, kicking you in the belly. You double up, unable to defend yourself. He grabs you up by the neck and hurls you into the wall. \u201cI hate you!\u201d<br>\r\n(Joanne's ordeal in his home is fast forwarded due to personal revulsion and character restriction)<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of you! Now you die!\u201d he declared, moving a knife to your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was very fast. He fell back, his face hit the ground. Two officers held him down, while Billy lifted you in her arms. While she still looked like a woman, you felt that familiar urge. \u201cLater. He has already killed three women.\u201d She whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This part is fast forwarded due to character limit)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 3 months to recover from the ordeal. A new process was used to restore your teeth and bring you back to general health. Billy smiled at you as you woke up. \u201cHow can I thank you?\u201d you asked. She beamed at you. \u201cStrip and turn around!\u201d It\u2019s hard to describe how it felt. You had been denied for what felt like an age. It felt snug, but nice in there, pumping away inside you. You feel that feeling as you got closer to climax. \u201cRelease!\u201d she ordered. You must have been heard by every attendant in the hospital by the noise you made. She got out and turn you around. \u201cWhen I enter you, orgasm!\u201d she commanded. It was like a dam being filled or a donut receiving jam. You made guttural sounds as you bucked, shook and felt drained by the constant joy. \u201cNext time, John!\u201d she giggled as the world faded away. </span></div></div>",

Just when you begin to wonder if this is your new life for good, one of your new teachers talks to you. Not only does he not send you home straight away, but stops you from making an excuse to get home fast. After learning your name, he says, \u201cYuki. I am from a group working to rescue girls like you from this life. I can\u2019t come back a second time. If you want your freedom, says so and come with me. If you are happy with your life as it is, tell me now and I will go away and never bother you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to cry. \u201cYes! Please take me away from here!

You manage to regain your balance before your ass hits the ground, but your legs are clearly shaking.  Your proportions have changed, and you have no idea how to properly move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking tiny steps, you stick your ass out backwards as you hunch close to the ground.  It looks more like how a duck walks than a lady, but right now you don't care.  You need to find a store that sells more sensible close than the bimbo's outfit you're wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the store beside the bakery, you stand up to see that it's a ladies fashion boutique.  \"Prefect.\" you think as you look at the racks for close that might fit your, um, rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss.\" you say to one of the attendants, \"do you have one of these blouses in my size?\" you ask, just realizing how different your voice now sounds than it did a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n\"Probably, what's your size?\" asks the attendant.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, you manage to find sensible shoes, a stylish pair of ladies pants, and a shirt with a matching jacket.<br>\r\nThe redhead looks at you in the change room mirror with a smile on her soft pink lips.  \"Not bad.\" she says as she mimics your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the clothes you came in with.  The nylons and heels and useless top.  You decide to leave them as you walk out into the main part of the shop.  You reach into the pocket for your wallet when it hits you that you don't have one.  No money, id, or even a purse.  Your heart races and it creates his an odd sensation on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to play this right.\" you think as you walk towards the door.  \"Maybe no one will notice me leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the second step you feel yourself almost fall over.  Your heel's have returned with vengeance.  They're still the same height at last time, but skinnier on the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your legs in horror as you see the nylons have becomes some sort of fishnet socks, that go up to your knees. Straps hold them up to something under your skirt.  The skirt itself seems to be less than two inches beneath your crotch.  If you still had a set of balls, they'd be seen hanging right under it.  There is a definite draft from the stores air conditioner.  You feel it in your limps, exposed stomach and between your legs.  You're not even sure you're wearing any panties, but you're too scared to try and find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top is little more than a vest, which stops just beneath your ribcage.  A push up bra accentuates your breast size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and take another step as you slip and grab the rack, it comes down crashing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay with you back facing the ceiling, feeling to numb to move.  Somehow this position feels right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, you hear running footsteps stop beside you as the store's manager learns over ans speaks to you.<br>\r\n\"Miss, are you okay?\" he says, trying to hold the fear in his voice.<br>\r\nThe poor guy has a receding hairline and a pencil thick mustache.  It's a dumb look but right now you can't take your eyes off his face.<br>\r\n\"Miss?\" he asks, hoping for a response.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm hurt, I just can't get up.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" he says as he tries to pull the rack from the back.  There is no luck.  He throws the remaining clothes on it to the side of you and grabs the bottom, of the rack, which is located right next to your chest.  His hand grazes your breast as he pulls the rack back to it's feet.  Your heart jumps a beat.  You're not sure it it's because of the contact, or your reaction to his display of strength.  Maybe it's both.<br>\r\nHe grab both your hands and pulls you up.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he asks again.<br>\r\n\"I am now.\" you say without thinking.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I was looking at a shirt, and it just fell.\"<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do for you?\"<br>\r\n\"Money, you need money for a cab home.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"I can think of some things.\" you say as you feel your tongue slide against your top teeth as it pierces through your lips for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager looks offended and intrigued.</span></div></div>",

Your body won't let you.  You feel as you are more your part of a subconscious now than your consciousness, hearing crude thoughts louder than your own, trying to drown you out.  The office is just a desk, a filing cabinet, three shelves, and a tv in the corner seeing 4 simultaneous camera feeds.  There is a coat rack too, but it is of no importance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the two chairs, not sure of what to expect.  You were hoping for a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm a bit unclear, what is it you want me to do here?\" the manager asks.<br>\r\n\"I want you to service me.\" you say, as your body clears off the junk on the top of the desk and sits on it.<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to be clear.\" the manager says as he unzips his pants.<br>\r\nYou let out a muffled giggle as he walks towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\" your body beckons.<br>\r\n\"Here I come.\" the manager says, trying to start himself up.<br>\r\nThe manager crawls onto the desk with you and starts to land kisses.<br>\r\nYou let out feminine gasps of pleasure, as your vagina starts to get hot.<br>\r\n\"I'M READY!\" you shout as manager works his way down to your skirt and lifts it up.<br>\r\nYour heart is racing, your terrified.  You don't want to be with a guy.  You don't want him to make you his bitch, yet your body is acting like you do.<br>\r\nJust the thought of penetration has you moaning loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an alarm goes off, repetitive buzzing fills the office as a light flashes.<br>\r\n\"Someone is trying to rob me!\" he says as he zips his pants back up and runs out as quick as he can with a stiffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a young woman being detained on camera as the manager grab her.  \"Great, she's going to come back here and ruin the mood.\" you think.  You quickly give yourself a quick brush down to make yourself presentable as you leave the office and sneak out the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second you make it to the back alleyway, you gain full control of your actions again.  \"WHAT WAS THAT!\" you shout at the sky.  Mad about how you lost control of yourself.  You look at the bracelet on your wrist, it clearly has something to do with this.<br>\r\nWhat was the thing that girl said?  Lana's curse?\"  It seems like something you should look up when you get him...home.  When you get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave the alleyway, you see another man looking at you.  He's about a foot taller than you were when you were a man, and his face has more desirable features.  You can already feel the area between your legs start to heat up again, as he raises his eyebrows to acknowledge he sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get off the streets quick, but you don't have a wallet for the cab, although maybe there is another way to pay your fare.  \"STOP IT.\" your brain shouts at itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could make a rush for it home.  In these heels it'd be no easy task.  Or you could run into the women's washroom and take some time to wind down and get your head on straight.  There is a mall a block from here, you could probably hold up in there.</span></div></div>",

At least you hope that you're releasing your bladder, you have no clue how this body works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of girl leaves the seat up?  Why is leaving the toilet seat up even an option in the women's room?\" you think as you struggle to squirm your way out.  Your not strong enough to pull yourself out.<br>\r\n\"Help.

Maybe it didn't lock on you, and now it might swing open revealing yourself to anyone who walks by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel blood rush to your face as the embarrassment hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the washroom door opens, as you hear footsteps enter.  They're heavier footsteps than you thought.  A man's footsteps.

If pulling you up just causes you to stand beside him, you're rather just wait in your position, despite it causing your legs to fall asleep.<br>\r\n\"Then you can squeeze under the stall and get out.\" he explains.  You look at the dried piss on the floor, you don't really want to shuffle around on that, but as you look up at the man's erect member, which is far to close to your face for comfort, you realize that dry piss is probably preferable to fresh pee.</span></div></div>",

You thought you locked your door, but it looks like you were wrong.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Ned says meekly as he peeks his head in the door.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say, from your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed is the guy who lives in the apartment next store.  He's almost thirty and just moved in a year ago.  He has a slim build and wears thick glasses, and you have your suspicions that he plays solitaire in his spare time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" he asks.  It's a good question.  He'd think you're crazy if you revealed who you really were, and if you say the wrong thing, he might call the cops on you.<br>\r\n\"I'm Macy.\" you say as your breast pops out of your top.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asks.<br>\r\nYou haven't taken a good look at yourself in a mirror, but you assume you look like a hot female version of your regular self.<br>\r\n\"I'm John's sister.  I'm visiting him.\" you say as Ned goes behind you and lifts the window up a bit and you slide face-first into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you say as Ned pulls you up off the ground.  \"He's such a gentleman.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" he apologizes, probably because he let you hit the floor, or maybe because he saw your boob pop out.<br>\r\nYou do your best you fit it back in your top.<br>\r\n\"So now you know my name, what's yours?\" you body asks.  It seems to be on autopilot.<br>\r\n\"N--Ned.\" he stammers.<br>\r\n\"Would you like a drink?\" you ask him.  You have this urge to prove it was worth his time saving you.<br>\r\n\"Um...sure, if you don't think John would mind.\" he says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you, this is probably the closest he's ever been to a woman who he wasn't related too.  As a guy you figured no woman could ever see him as a provider.  He was too nerdy and self-absorbed.  But that was before he rescued you, now you're seeing this guy in a whole different light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand him a glass of white whine.<br>\r\n\"I would have been stuck there all day.\" you tell him as you sit down beside him.  He stays quiet.<br>\r\n\"I want you thank you for saving me.\" you say as feel your chest pushing up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed tries to reply but chokes on his wine.  You look down and see a massive bulge coming from his lap.<br>\r\nAs the wine hits you're lips you realize you're already stroking his arm.<br>\r\n\"What am I doing?!\" you suddenly think to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You ignored it as you stared him down with lustful intensity.<br>\r\n\"Why? Where are you going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uhm...It's just that...that I have lots of work back in my own room...thanks for the wine...uhm...I'll just be leaving now.\" he hurriedly turned tail and practically fled from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want you to stay!!\" you shout/pleaded in frustration, running in past Ned to block his exit, cutting off his line of retreat. <br>\r\n\"Look Macy.\" said Nate finding some backbone. \"You've been very nice and I'm very glad I could have helped you out...but...I just really need to go back to my own apartment right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! Yes! Get out of here Ned, you sorry basterd! you shouted from within your mind. Almost paradoxically you wanted to bear-hug Ned for not having put you in a position in which you had absolutely no control over and in which you may find yourself violated or doing something against your will. Only you wished you could have embraced Ned as a guy and not as a sex-starved mindless nymphomaniac bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, horrifyingly, it seemed your curse autopilot alter-ego wasn't about to hand in the towel just yet: \"But...\" you breathed in a most seductive voice and lowered yourself to let your cleavage display from your worn dress, breasts threatening to pop back out of their nestling again. \"...don't you want me to come with you and...help with work...?\" You said this, whilst rolling your tongue, making certain that even the most cardinal imbecile knew exactly what you were implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed's face could best be described as follows: as the blood of shy and conserved embarrassment rushed to his head, his face resembled a translucent jug being filled with red-cooldrink from the bottom up. Cherry-faced, his stuttering resumed in full.<br>\r\n\"N-n-no! Look...you've been very k-k-kind. But...I j-j-just can't-\"<br>\r\n\"Can't what?\" you chided him sexily. \"Spend some....quality time together. The night is so very young-\"<br>\r\n\"Nooo!\" retorted Ned angrily, pushing up his spectacles on his sweating nose trying to reassert some order from this situation in which he had never before been in. \"You're the sister of John, my best friend and neighbour! He'd kill me if I did anything to you!\" Damn right I would! Just get out before this crazy witch makes me do something I will regret! you shouted vainly at Ned in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, or the alter-ego, took Ned by surprise by stepping forward and grabbing his belt-buckle. You made sure as you clutched the belt with your fine fingers that they slowly caressed the stiff rod within his jeans beyond. Ned looked like he was going limp from a tranquilizer, never having experienced such a beautiful woman touch him so closely or deliberately at his crotch before.<br>\r\n\"What John doesn't know, won't hurt him...\" you whispered mischievously at Ned's almost catatonic face. Oh, the irony of poor John not knowing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShut up! Shut up, you bitch! you raged within your head. You didn't know whom you were thought-screaming at. Probably yourself or whomever this split-autopilot-personality was that were controlling your every act. You could do nothing, control nothing. Only watch, see and experience your body move and act of its own accord as if you were nothing but a spectator viewing from a camera room as this alternate-you have its unopposed way with your body. But this was much worse than viewing things from camera, for you could sense everything, feel everything. You cringed as you could even felt Ned' cock being excited by your stroking fingers while your hands held him in place by the belt. This is bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ned came to the rescue; recomposing himself from this unexpected sensual overdose he held both your wrists away from his nether regions: \"STOP!\"<br>\r\nBut you just giggled at him uncontrollably and continued your attempts to undo his belt: \"Don't be so shy. The fun hasn't even started yet! I can't just let my savior go after he so heroically rescued me!\" You looked up at his eyes with barely contained perverted lust; chewing and licking your lips as you spoke. \"Let me 'THANK' you. Reaaaaaly thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" said Ned, trying to re-assert his authority. But you paid him no heed.<br>\r\nIn an almost comical fashion Ned tried to wrestle your relentlessly persistent hands away from his private zone. It proved to be as futile as trying to untangle oneself from the grapllings of an octopus; like trying to pry off tentacles with suckers on them as the horny chick that was you, refused to cease getting into Ned'd pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in desperation, Ned accidentally punched you in the face with his elbow, delivering a knockout blow that sent you reeling backwards onto your back. The blow must have tamed your split-autopilot-personality, because you could suddenly move again of your own accord. You stood back up, gingerly feeling the pinch of a blue-eye forming on your right-eye socket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed was apoplectically apologizing: \"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry; I truly didn't mean it!\"<br>\r\nYou just shook your head, smiling in relief. Never in your live have you been so happy at having been slugged so painfully in the face: \"Nevermind. It doesn't matter. It's my fault.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, Macy. You just wouldn't let go...\"<br>\r\n\"Ned, it's okay. I was drunk.\" you added as an afterthought. Hopefully Ned would take that as a valid excuse for your gross \"misbehaviour\". Ned looked at least satisfied with your unconvincing explanation and nodded knowingly as if he had to deal with intoxicated friends all the time and knew the symptoms, but appeared to be far more concerned at having injured you.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Just...if you would be so kind, I feel like going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed seemed far more relieved than insulted at having been asked away: \"Ah. Then you'll be alright?\"<br>\r\nIt took all of your self control to not bodily toss him from the room, as you feared the autopilot would reclaim control of you at any minute. After coo'ing out Ned whom profusely apologized for hitting you, and convincing him you would would be fine for the night and yes you would call him if anything troubled you further, he mercifully left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door with restraint, you slid down against it until you sat on the floor with your cushion-like rump and sighed long and tiredly. Fatigue ate your very marrow. You weren't physically exhausted, but mentally drained. The evening had been harrowing, horrible.<br>\r\nFinally you could try and figure out the cause of your plight in seclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to go over the events of the last few hours. You became a woman. Men seemed to go insane in your presence and so do you if your alone, as was proven with Ned. You were slow to realize it, but decide it far too dangerous to be isolated in the company of men from now on. But what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to waste a minute longer being stuck like this. Yes! You had an idea: maybe if you called your sister for help; your real sister or perhaps some of your girlfriends to help you, as they would not try to take advantage of you since they were girls as well. Well you hoped they wouldn't try to take advantage of you like men would.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps you should try finding the girl from whom you had gotten the bracelet.</span></div></div>",

You don't want to have to juggle 15 names be the end of the day.  \"Macy.\" you finally say.<br>\r\n\"Well Macy, can I speak to my brother?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou look around for a second, only to remember that you are her brother. \"No?\"<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear you sisters phone hang up.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say calling back, but all you get is another blocked number call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's part of the curse that you're not able to be with other women.

Of course you didn't really want to go in there.

Your body needs food to keep working.<br>\r\nYou look at the kitchen, you don't really want to cook as a woman, it's too stereotypical.  At the same time, you don't have much cash, and you don't trust yourself outside the building.  Who knows what your body will end up eating because of this curse?
