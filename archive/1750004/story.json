            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up the next morning. But something felt off. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but something felt off. I looked around my room and didn't see anything different, until something fell into my line of sight. I brushed it out of my sight and looked at my new, slender and smaller hands. Then down a little to my chest, with the teeshirt I had worn to bed last night stretched to its max. I wobbled a little getting out of my bed due to the new weight of the breasts on my chest. I made my way to the bathroom down the hall, and turned the lights on. I was welcomed by a blinding light for being 6:00 am on a Saturday having accidentally set my alarm. I looked into the mirror, stunned by what I was seeing. I was seeing a beautiful 16 year old girl with brown hair coming down just below her shoulder blades. She had beautiful blue eyes. The more I looked at her, the more I realized she looked like a female version of me. I stared in bewilderment for a few minutes, exploring a little, but not to much. Finally, I left the bathroom and went back to my bedroom. Looking around I saw it was the same as when I went to bed last night. The same grey walls, and sports posters on the walls. I peeked in my closet, to find all the clothes were the same as last night when I was still a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly walked out of my room and down the hall to my sister Sammantha's room. Her door was open and I slowly walked up to her bed and poked her face. In a groggy state of mind she said \"Whoever it is, you'd better have a good reason for being here or I'll kill you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis\" I whispered. \"I think this is a good enough reason\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing my new voice we were both shocked. Looking at me, now fully awake, Sam said \"Who the hell are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really me, Mike\" I insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it. Tell me something only Mike and I know\" she said. \"Something we had promised to never tell anyone under any circumstances\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you were 8 and I was 6, I bet you that you couldn't do anything I could do. So I ate a worm, and so did you. And then for winning I had to let you paint my fingernails so you could decide what color you liked the most\" I said. It was completely true but I had a feeling she still didn't believe me. So I added \"you chose the purple color with sparkles in it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Mike\" she said. \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I went to bed last night a normal 16 year old boy, and woke up a girl. If I had to guess, I'm still 16.\" I said. \"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should tell mom and dad\" Sam explained. \"If we both tell them, well, they should believe us. And you do look enough like me where they should see the similarities and put two and two together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, we did tell our parents. And as expected, they didn't believe us at first. But after a few minutes of protesting and questioning, they eventually did believe us. Mom told us to get dressed and then we would go to the hospital to figure this out. I followed Sam to her room where she supplied me with some underwear. Thankfully it was just a simple, all white, bra and panties set. I proceeded to go to my room, noticing for the first time the bouncing of the unsupported breasts on my chest and sway in my hips as I walked. The underwear Sam gave me was a tad bit big, but it certainly felt better than nothing. I then proceeded to get dressed in a pair of jeans and a teeshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just finished getting dressed when Sam came into my room. \"Not that what your wearing is bad\" she started, \"but I figured I'd help you pick something from my room. It would fit better and look better for the moments when we are in public on the way to the hospital\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed her to her room. She opened her closet, motioned for me to have a look, then sat on her bed. I looked in at the closet in bewilderment. There were so many clothes. And she was already dressed. \"Need some help\" she asked. I shook my head up and down. I didn't know how to dress as a girl (makes sense because I wasn't a girl until this morning). \"Take a seat and I'll find you something\". I sat on Sam's bed as she went through her closet looking for something. The first thing she pulled out were some jeans ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.jcpenney.com/levi-s-roll-cuff-bermuda-shorts/prod.jump?ppId=pp5003760009&amp;catId=cat100250098&amp;deptId=dept20000013&amp;pageSize=96&amp;extDim=true&amp;topDim=Categories&amp;topDimvalue=cargos&amp;dimCombo=Categories%7CSize+Range%7C&amp;dimComboVal=cargos%7Cmisses%7C\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jcpenney.com/levi-s-roll-cuff...</a>\u00a4tDim=Size+Range\u00a4tDimVal=misses&amp;colorizedImg=DP0204201417410930M.ti f&amp;urlState=/women/shop-clothing/shorts-capris/cargos/misses/_/N-1nwuwbZ1c2/cat.j ump )(Salvation), then tossed them to me. As I put them on she continued to look for a shirt. I was just looking up as she tossed me a red shirt. I held it out to examine it ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.jcpenney.com/essentials/jcp-ribbed-tank-top/prod.jump?ppId=pp5003570022&amp;catId=cat100210006&amp;deptId=dept20000013&amp;pageSize=96&amp;extDim=true&amp;topDim=Categories&amp;topDimvalue=tanks+%26+camis&amp;dimCombo=Categories%7CSize+Range%7C&amp;dimComboVal=tanks+%26+camis%7Cmisses%7C\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jcpenney.com/essentials/jcp-r...</a>\u00a4tDim=Size+Range\u00a4tDimVal=misses&amp;urlState=/women/shop-clothing/tops/ tanks-camis/misses/_/N-1noxcjZ1c2/cat.jump ). I looked at her in disbelief that she would think id wear this. \"What? Do you want people thinking something's wrong with you or do you want them thinking your just a regular teenage girl enjoying her summer?\" I thought about it. I really didn't want people looking at me a lot, so it made sense that I'd wear the red tank top she gave me. I just couldn't say she was right, so I put it on without a word. She then picked up some shoes from the floor and held them out for me ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.jcpenney.com/all-comfort-shoes/clarks-mimmey-claire-cork-wedge-sandals/prod.jump?ppId=pp5003550260&amp;catId=cat1003440002&amp;deptId=dept20000018&amp;pageSize=96&amp;topDim=Product+Type&amp;topDimvalue=sandals&amp;dimCombo=Product+Type%7C&amp;dimComboVal=sandals%7C\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jcpenney.com/all-comfort-shoe...</a>\u00a4tDim=Product+Type\u00a4tDimVal=sandals&amp;colorizedImg=DP1107201317022544M .tif&amp;urlState=/shoes/wedges/sandals/_/N-glf79eZ1z14196/cat.jump ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way in hell\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\" she asked, a stupid grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters, I haven't seen you wear those in I don't know how long so why should I wear them\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" she started \"I think I'll wear them today just to prove that I've worn them\". She was trying not to laugh at how I was reacting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\" I said. \"I'll pick my own shoes\". I looked through all the choices of footwear. Sam wasn't a high heel kinda girl, but there were more than running shoes. I eventually decided on a pair of flip flops ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/products/REF159/womens-reef-leather-slap-3/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/prod...</a> ) to keep up with the average girl enjoying the summer look that Sam was giving me. She then sat down behind me and put my now long brown hair into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe headed downstairs for some breakfast after putting our sandals on. While we had been getting dressed, mom and dad made us some eggs, which I tried to pace myself with and was getting full quicker. Once we finished breakfast, I went to the hospital with mom and Sam. My dad volunteered to stay home and do a little research about spontaneously changing genders over night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the hospital they ran some tests and gave them to our family doctor. He said that had they not done the tests, he'd have thought I was like a cousin or something. But the results of the test were so close to tests I'd had done for school sports that it was almost impossible that I was anyone but me. I think he said the similarities were like 99.72% the same. And he said that anything above 95% was essentially a sure thing. But before we left he said he would try and figure out how we could reverse my change, if at all, and would call us if he found out anything important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left the hospital, but when we pulled out of the parking lot, mom made a wrong turn. \"Umm mom\" I said. \"Home is the other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know honey\" mom said. \"But we need to get you some things so you and your sister don't run out super quick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" mom started. \"Underwear for starters. Maybe some shoes, and a few sets of clothes. Probably some stuff you don't wanna talk about until we get home. You could only share for so long, better getting this stuff now than later. Plus we could teach you some things in case this is gonna be a longer than planed situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at the mall and got through buying the  bathroom stuff I'd be needing rather quickly. Like mom said, we could talk about them later. We got through the bras, panties, and socks relatively quickly, but it really picked up speed when we actually found my sizes. Then we moved on to some clothes. We started with shorts and pants. We didn't get a lot according to Sam, but I thought it was more than just a few. We ended up with five pairs of athletic shorts, three pairs of jean shorts like the ones I was already wearing, and two pairs of leggings (only because Sam wouldn't let me not have some). The same was true for the shirts. We ended up buying like ten different shirts, from tank tops to shirts labeled as 3/4 sleeves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We went home. At this point, Dad has been researching for a few hours now. He came over to me and said that this situation is unique, so nobody has ever gone through this other than me. He also said that, unless an antidote is found, I will be referred to as \u201cMichelle\u201d from now on. I was in udder shock! I would have to be a girl for longer, and adjust to a new name. Sam and Mom then pulled me upstairs. Sam told me to give her her clothes back, since I now had some of my own, they left the room and I changed, putting on a T-shirt and a skirt. I gave Sam her clothes back. Mom then called me to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went into the bathroom, and found Mom there with a pad. \u201cNo, No, No, NO! I am NOT going to have periods, am I?!?!\u201d. My Mom came over to me and said that I would. She explained to me how to deal with it and left the room in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then went to my room and saw Sam There waiting for me. I asked her what was going on. \u201cDo you want to try out make-up\u201d, she asked. I said no, and that I found it ugly anyway. She left the room, so I decided that if this was my life now, I might as well get used to it. I took the band out of my hair and tried it out for a few hours. I ended up getting used to it after a few hours, and decided i liked having my hair loose instead of in a ponytail. But I immediately realized my next struggle. I had to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the bathroom and sat down. I went and realized it wasn\u2019t that bad. Afterwards, I thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to do some poses in the mirror. I started simply by putting my hand on my waist. I then practiced for a few hours before I heard Dad call my new name from downstairs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went down and was told that my new self had been enrolled into my school. I was somewhat relieved, but also nervous. What would people think of me now. Dad said I didn\u2019t HAVE to go tomorrow, but I had the option. The only reasons I hadn\u2019t gone today were that I was still adjusting to my new body and that it was a teacher work day. If I went tomorrow, I would have to pretend I was my own cousin from another town that recently moved here. I decided I would sleep on it, but Mom said to wait. She came back a few minutes later with her old nightgown, saying I needed something to sleep in. I nervously took it and went upstairs. Back into my room. I hoped this nightmare would end, but it didn\u2019t. I got up, still a girl, and put on a tank top and skirt. I went downstairs and had breakfast I then realized I needed to make a decision about school.</span></div></div>",

You hardly noticed the hurried footsteps approaching your room as you were in a panic but soon your sister, Sarah and mom entered the room, looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's finally come out of her shock.\" sitting in the bed with you, mom said. she took you into her arms and began to gently stroke your long hair with her hand. \"Easy, Michelle.

You will age and develop normally, eat, use the bathroom...\" she winced before adding, \"however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, what?\" shaken, you asked. \"Why am I little girl!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ten year old girl was the only model they had on hand to transfer your mind into before you died.\" rocking you again, mom replied. \"We explained this to you in the hospital last week when you regained consciousness.\" she paused. \"That was when you fell into a state of shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They released you from the hospital, still in that state, yesterday afternoon.\" softly, Sarah said. \"We've been waiting for you to come out of it since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't go into shock again.\" lightly shaking you, mom pleaded. \"Being a girl is not that bad, Sarah and I will help you to adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silent for a moment before you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom and Sarah seemed much taller now that you were trapped in a small body. But being a little girl had its advantages you think as you enter the car. The car trip takes longer then you first think but little kids see the world a lot slower then older people. You make it to the big elementary school and see many kids on the playground, if you had to guess it was probably 8:15 which would give you some time before school started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to your \"friends\" and realize they aren't as good of friends which leaves you with a few options...</span></div></div>",

Mostly, you're distracted by everything from your neck down: the denim short shorts, the unmarred flesh of your athlete's legs, the aforementioned bosom which impulse leads you to clutch violently, giving a tight squeeze.

You're way too exhausted to freak out, but goosebumps are rising up your flesh. You clearly went to sleep last night in your own bed, and now you're on the road with some stranger, an adult man who's addressing you as honey? Were you drugged and kidnapped? Your head feels funny, but there's nothing to suggest drugs or anything dangerous, except maybe a slight excess of alcohol. You try to lift yourself, but the seatbelt keeps you in a lowered position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... are you...?\" you try to say. Your voice is off. Crackly and light. You look down at your hands and notice something different about them too, like they're thinner, tanner... and the nails are painted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha,\" the man says, tonelessly. \"Funny. We're almost to Rhode Island. Don't worry, babe. I called your parents to let them know we'd be staying at a motel instead of at their place, so you don't have to stress out about telling them. They were disappointed, of course, but I think I handled the conversation pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this is making any sense: the man, the 'going to Rhode Island' or the parents bit, the what looks like cleavage peeking out from the what looks like a dress you're wearing, white with a brown sash, the sort you see some girls at school wear that you can buy from Target, the voice... Your mind is starting to come together, and the details add up to a sensible picture in your head of what has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" you think, which is when the man delivers the singer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, just buckle in.

All you can do is remain with your head propped up on the pillow, unable to pull forward or to slide your legs off the bed while your back is still throbbing from the overexertion. You see your sister standing there in the doorway, still in her pajamas, looking smug with her hands resting on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing, 'Mom'?\" your sister says, suffusing that word with all of the sarcasm available to her. \"I heard you make a sound and I thought you might be in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ari,\" you say from your immobile plank position. \"You've got to listen to me. I'm not really Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are, <i>Mom</i>,\" Ari says with even more sarcasm dripping off her tongue, if that's even possible. \"I mean, you look like her.

Oh, that little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAri throws her head back and cackles. \"Oh, brother,\" she says with a sad smile. \"You were always really slow to pick up on a joke. I know it's you. Of course I do. You don't think I wasn't going to act on my very precisely worded wish from yesterday, did you? When, after all, you know your sister is a lover of all things Wiccan, pagan, and New Age. A neat little cover for my study of the occult, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back right now,\" you say through gritted teeth, which doesn't sound so menacing with your mom's voice (she was never the stern matron type).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Ari says. \"You've always bossed me around, telling me what to do, how to do it, and getting angry if I don't things exactly your way at the speed you would like it. Mom, of course, has to live with that every day. It's her job to do all these things for her children. If she doesn't--if she, heaven forbid, gets angry and refuses to be a responsible parent--then there's always child welfare just a phone call away. I thought that you could benefit from a walk in Mom's shoes... or in her bra, you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" you snarl. \"I don't want to be Mom! Change me back into Michael!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah.\" Ari snaps her fingers and a piece of Duct tape materializes over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph! Mmph! Mmph!\" you sputter, before managing to rip it off and wipe your mouth of phlegm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that be a lesson of what you're in store for,\" Ari says menacingly. \"I could do much worse than a piece of Duct tape, believe me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School's in another half-an-hour. I'd like to have breakfast first, and then you'll be driving me... You know?

Very delicately, you lift yourself out of bed, get onto your feet, and waddle towards the door, having half a mind to catch up with her and knock her upside the head, but you know A) how that would be construed, coming from your mom, and B) Mom is just not athletic enough nor strong enough to land a blow on Ari. You stop dead in your tracks a few steps from the door, leaning over and panting, looking down at your mom's bare feet, bulging with old woman's veins. You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit,\" you think. You shouldn't have said anything yesterday when Ari picked you up from the mall.</span></div></div>",

Despite all of her various physical ailments and growing figure (she was quite the looker, she likes to say, before she had you kids. Won the county beauty pageant and everything), Mom is not that bad-looking. With her short, blonde hair and full, ruddy cheeks, she looks pleasant in a motherly way, and on a good day when the temperature agrees and her bones are cooperative, she can dress up and walk around with the full confidence of her youth. With your mind in control, though, it's hard to muster any sort of posture or facial expression that suggests \"confidence\" or \"beauty.\" You look totally helpless, given the circumstances, and the best your lips can manage is an ugly, upturned grimace of disgust as you take in the woman you've now become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God,\" you think. \"Mom has to look at this every day...\" The thought is horrifying, as is the following thought that you might be seeing this for at least another week, if not more. You shudder, before putting that thought away and getting to work in assembling a workable outfit for the purpose of serving your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to spend too much time fussing over color combinations and matching tops-and-bottoms, you settle for basic black sweatpants and a gray, dust-bunny-flecked undershirt sitting on top of the laundry bin. \"What the hell,\" you think. \"I'm not walking out in public like this. I'm driving my sister to school. Nobody has to see me.\" Thus satisfied,\" you walk out of the bedroom, now getting the full range of your posture back, and manage to walk down the stairs without another back-cracking incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister is waiting at the kitchen table, beaming at you and holding her hands together like the most do-goody daughter in the world. \"Hi, Mom,\" she says. At the sight of your outfit, her nose wrinkles. \"That's what you're going to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pick something else after I drop you off,\" you mutter, before going to the pantry to pull out some toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh,\" Ari says as you set it on the counter by the toaster oven. \"You make such an awesome omelette, Mom. I'd like to have that this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot an incredulous look at her. \"Omelette?\" you say. Ari nods exuberantly. \"But I can't...\" Ari lifts her hand up in a threatening gesture, ready to snap her fingers if provoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"All right,\" you say. \"I'll make your fr... delicious omelette.\"</span></div></div>",
