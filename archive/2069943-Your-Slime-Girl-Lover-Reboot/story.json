You couldn't believe how badly you had lost that bet, but you did learn the biggest lesson of your life: Never make bets off of a Superbowl game. Now you were on a date with a girl you had never even seen before, and when you tried to ask your friends for details about her, they just wouldn't stop snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd arrived a little early, looking over at some of the happy couples in adjacent booths, and wondered what kind of person Chloe was. The most important thing was that you make a good impression, so you abstained from looking at your phone in case she happened to walk in at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you must be (name)...\" a feminine voice sounded. Snapping out of your thoughts, you turned your head to see a girl completely made of slime standing in front of you. \"I'm Chloe, your date.\" She greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat color was she?</span></div></div>",

In fact, every part of her body seemed to consist of slime. Her beautiful pink eyes, her full-looking lips, everything. And what a body on the girl too! She was the definition of 'hourglass figure', and one thing you noticed was that she looked as though she was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely bewildered, never having seen anything like this (in real life) before. You rapidly rubbed your eyes, hoping that they were just playing tricks on you but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you okay?\" Chloe asked with a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to say something, anything to drum up a conversation. \"I... um... uh...\" You stammered, before finally asking \"Are you made of slime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe giggled. \"Yes! Do you want to touch me and see?\" She asked, You nodded slowly, putting a hand on Chloe's shoulder and slowly moving down her arm. Chloe began moaning at your touch. She was warm, smooth and solid. \"That feels nice...\" she mumbled, almost mesmerized by the feeling of you touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you muttered, taking your hand away. \"If you're... um... slime, how are you... like, solid?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can solidify and liquify any part of my body at will.\" Chloe explained, moving to sit down opposite you. \"It gets harder for me to focus when submerged in other liquids though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Okay...\" you muttered. \"Well, I haven't ordered yet, but are you hungry?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe grinned, leaning closer to you. \"Unbelievably! In fact, I'm so hungry I could swallow you whole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?!\" you panicked, hoping that Chloe was just joking.</span></div></div>",

Chloe's arms shot forward, extending far beyond that of human dexterity and grabbed you, covering your mouth with her hands and pushing your face in between her cleavage. \"Mmmph! Mmmph!\" you protested. At first, it felt as if she was just hugging you in an incredibly affectionate way, but slowly and surely, your body began sinking into her own. You felt her run her hands along your back as you were being pulled inside her warm body. She wasn't pulling you in rapidly, she was trying to slowly ease you in to her, as if to make it more comfortable for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weirdly erotic feeling, but you were no doubt getting freaked out by what was going on. Although reddish-pink slime blocked your view, you managed to feel around and put your hands on Chloe's belly in an attempt to force yourself away from Chloe's body. Chloe saw this and sighed. She stopped rubbing your back and forced you into her by absorbing your hands through her stomach, as there was suddenly no resistance, you almost fell right through Chloe, but ended up getting more of your body caught inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome crazy girl made of slime who you had only just met had succeeded in kidnapping you. But what was worse than that was that none of the other patrons in the pizza place, nor the staff, seemed at all put off by Chloe's behavior. No, everyone around you just kept on doing their own thing, as if you were completely invisible to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time before you found yourself in the center of Chloe's body, Chloe reshaping herself around you as you became forced into an awkward seating position. \"Chloe!\" you shouted, pushing, kicking and screaming with all your might but no one from the outside paid any notice. You stopped fighting against Chloe's body after you felt her moving, herself obviously walking somewhere. Her movements were jarred and awkward. \"Let me go!\" you demanded, not wanting to be a part of the crazy night any longer. You assumed that Chloe heard you, because she started to hum to herself as she traced a hand around where your head was. You kept shouting and screaming at her, but little good it all did. By the end of it, you had lost your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Chloe stopped walking. You tried to look out of her, but it was so dark that the night sky, combined with the red tint over everything made it impossible for you to see anything. \"Wh-where are we?\" you asked, now genuinely afraid. You had no idea where Chloe had taken you, and you were well and truly at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new home where we can live together forever.\" Chloe said nonchalantly, walking up a rickety set of steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New... home...?\" By this point, you were too tired to fight back as Chloe walked inside a very old house. You were still not able to see the outside of Chloe very well, but you became forced onto your back as Chloe laid down on a mattress and massaged her full belly just a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, (name).\" Chloe cooed. \"If you are good tonight, I might just let you out. See you in the morning, my boyfriend for life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Chloe call you her 'boyfriend for life' losing yourself in thoughts of insanity before, against all odds, falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

That is, until you attempted to stand up and found that you couldn\u2019t, hitting your head on what felt like a ceiling of latex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeverishly, you looked around, seeing yourself surrounded by an eternal wall of red slime. You then remembered what happened, how you went out on a blind date with a girl made of slime, and she kidnapped you before even spending two minutes with you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe\u2019s slow breathing made you assume that she was asleep, and so you attempted to push your way out of Chloe\u2019s belly, hoping that it would be easier for you to get out with her being asleep. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case, and you pressing against her only served to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)?\" Chloe groaned. \"Why are you trying to escape?\" She asked, almost sounding confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you knew that she was probably referring to the fact it was pointless to try, you decided to point out the facts of reality, snapping at your captor. \"Chloe, you kidnapped me! You didn't even give the date a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gasped, your outburst of anger apparently shocking her. \"I\u2026\" she stammered. \"I didn't want you to run away! I\u2019d heard about you from my friends for a while, and you sounded like a really great person. The fact that you were even willing to go out on a date with me\u2026 I figured you, you know\u2026 the one guy that might actually like me\u2026 I didn't want you to go off with some other girl!\" Chloe sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour expression softened, and you found yourself feeling a little guilty. \"Chloe\u2026 You didn\u2019t have to kidnap me.\" You told her. \"I was perfectly willing to go on a date with you. I didn\u2019t even know you were made of slime, and that truthfully doesn\u2019t matter to me. I mean, apart from the whole kidnapping thing, you seem nice enough, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really (name)? You're the best!\" Chloe cut you off, your minimalistic complement being seemingly all that was needed to raise her spirits. \"Well, you probably want to be cleaned up so\u2026\" Chloe trailed off, edging off the bed and reaching inside herself as she began to feel around for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, what are you doing?\" you asked, Chloe\u2019s hands reaching around your torso as she started pulling at your shirt. It soon became apparent that what she was trying to do was undress you. Still, the way she was going about it left you truly dumbfounded. \"Ch-Chloe! Stop! Please!\" you struggled, trying to keep your clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, (name). I don't want you to run away and get lost!\" Chloe giggled, continuing to take off your clothes. Despite your struggles, you couldn't help but marvel at how Chloe was able to control the different parts of her body so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you were stark naked inside Chloe as she gently folded your clothes on the bed before getting up and walking out the side entrance to the house, opening the door and heading out to the veranda, moving over to a Jacuzzi and fiddling with a few knobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to sink inside Chloe's body as she then began to flow out, and forced you to her, for lack of a better word, surface. You gasped a little, attempting once again to get out of Chloe's body, only to find yourself pulled back in by a pair of hands. You heard a giggling noise, and looked up to see Chloe staring down at you, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm just giving you a bath! I do this with all my friends now and then, they all love it!\" Chloe giggled, grabbing onto your shoulders, and having you sit down. You relaxed, realizing that it actually felt pretty nice inside Chloe. It was nice and warm, you had no trouble breathing, and it was even bubbly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach rumbled a little, as you remembered that you didn\u2019t end up eating anything last night while on your date. Chloe giggled. \"Hungry, are you? Well, let\u2019s rectify that!\" She smiled, before leaning down and pressing her lips tightly against yours in an overly-passionate French kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but moan as Chloe cupped your face with her hands until she gently pried your mouth open wider and you felt some liquid ooze down your throat. It took a while, but you realized that the liquid was Chloe! She was feeding herself to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe tasted a little bit like raspberry Jell-O, which, while a little off-putting given the circumstances, was probably a lot better than other things she could\u2019ve potentially tasted like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still in too much of a daze as Chloe forced some of herself down your throat. You were surprised that you weren't choking on her. She seemed to be very considerate for the most part and obviously wanted you to enjoy the feeling too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you felt yourself getting full, and Chloe pulled away. You were surprised that Chloe had kept the same mass, even though you were sure you had just swallowed a large amount of her. Chloe ended the liplock with another little kiss and patted your now-full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe...\" you sighed as she gently rubbed your cheeks with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe just smiled. \"Sorry, but I don\u2019t really keep any food in the house. I'll keep your body full for a while until I can find you something to eat. Your stomach acids won't hurt me.\" Her smile widened, suddenly chirping.  \"Well, time to start our day! You won't need clothes, since you'll be inside me the whole time!\" Chloe gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe then started to turn back into her \u2018regular\u2019 form, pushing you back up against her cleavage. Your lips pressed against Chloe\u2019s breasts lightly as you sank into them once more, reaching out and hugging your head against her breasts tightly, completely overcome with ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what should we do today?\" Chloe asked out loud, before tapping her body lightly when you were 'safe' inside her. \"Ooh, I know!\" she shouted.</span></div></div>",

Does that sound like fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" you attempted to answer Chloe\u2019s question, but she cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Do I have a choice?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name), you know I'm the one that will pick where we go from now on.\" Chloe stated proudly, tidying up the area around her before moving to lock up the house and head for the Waterpark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that it was day time, you noticed Chloe\u2019s house was actually in a suburb quite a way\u2019s away from your place. Additionally, your eyes widened, remembering that you were naked inside Chloe and sincerely hoping that any onlookers who could see Chloe couldn\u2019t see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Chloe really didn\u2019t talk to you at all during your walk to the Waterpark, which actually gave you plenty of time to think. Chloe had no idea where you lived, so if you managed to escape, you could find your way back home and then confront your so-called 'friends'. So all you really had to do until then was stay on Chloe's good side, which was actually really easy. Besides kidnapping you and holding you inside of her against your will, she was a very nice girl. Even now, the rubbing of her stomach seemed to calm you. She was obviously trying to make you feel more at home inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line to get even get into the Waterpark was absolutely massive, and just like at the pizza restaurant, it was as if you were invisible inside Chloe, which in this circumstance was a very good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, surveying the massive crowds of people all around you as Chloe walked. You realized if you did manage to get out of Chloe's body, it would be extremely easy to lose her in the crowds of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the water slide! Let\u2019s do that one first!\" Chloe gawked, running her hands along where your head was. The water slide that Chloe was staring at towered over everything else and went all the way into a giant pool. Chloe ran towards the line, standing in it for five minutes as the two of you slow neared the top. Every now and then, Chloe rubbed her belly and looked down at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of you got to the top of the slide, the man at top looked over at Chloe and then her giant belly. Without another word, he pointed her to the slide. Chloe jumped down the fifty foot slide screaming all the way down, until Chloe collided with the water in a giant splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chloe's body impacted the water, you begin to feel a little uneasy. You looked down, realizing Chloe\u2019s body was rapidly filling with water from the pool. But you were still trapped inside her. Water began filling your line of vision as you struggled to keep your head above the water. Eventually, you were completely submerged, and no longer able to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought your life was over and you were going to drown, you suddenly fell right through Chloe, dropping through the bottom of her and into the pool itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, regaining momentum as best you could as you began swimming to the edge of the pool. Chloe had been dispersed, temporarily most likely, but the good news was that you were free and you were alive. You got out of the pool, looking back to it and finding that the pool water now had a strong red tint to it, as if Chloe had been assimilated into it. You looked at your reflection for a moment as you once again remembered that Chloe never did give you your clothes back. You were standing butt naked in a water park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly ran to some bushes to hide your shame, peeking out behind them to survey your surroundings. There was a very low fence behind you, and on the other side of that, a parking lot. If you were lucky, you could\u2019ve easily jumped over it and escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, you weren\u2019t that lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the people to have walked past you general area, it had to be the person you wouldn\u2019t have wanted to have seen in a million years: your ex-girlfriend Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say things didn\u2019t end on good terms with her would\u2019ve been a total understatement, what with you finding out she\u2019d been cheating on you. Still, you had been fortunate enough to avoid her entirely since the breakup, and you were hoping to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by her red one-piece you were willing to bet that she\u2019d succeeded in getting the job as Lifeguard at the Waterpark, which was good for her but bad for you. There was no way in Hell you\u2019d let her see you how you were, but if you stuck around inside, you knew that Chloe might reform and then you'd be trapped all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath, stepping out from the bush to make a mad run for the fence.</span></div></div>",

In fact, you didn't really feel any pain from your absorption, just a slight discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as it began, the absorption was finished. Chloe stood opposite you, Kim stuffed into her belly rather uncomfortably. Again, in contrast to you, it seemed Chloe's treatment of you seemed rather generous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, girl. I won't kill you, but you will stay in my belly for a very long time. Like\u2026 Hmmm\u2026\" Chloe pretended to ponder. \"Ooh, I don\u2019t know. How about as long as you live?\" Chloe smiled sweetly. Chloe's belly moved sporadically as Kim tried to break free. Chloe walked over to you. \"Are you okay, (name)?\" she asked, the utmost concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Um...\" you stammered, unsure of what to say.

Chloe came back a few moments later with a towel, happily giving it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly quivered, violently knocking back and forth. Chloe suddenly punched herself in the stomach. \"How about you knock that off?!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Chloe, that\u2019s dangerous!\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry, sweetheart. I\u2019m very durable, and I know my limits.\" Her smile faltered as she looked down at her belly. \"I also know the limits of humans, so I think it\u2019s in your best interest to not bug me or you\u2019ll spend your days inside me as a paraplegic.\" Chloe looked back up at you, her smile returning as she reached a hand around yours. \"Shall we go home, my darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026\" you started.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll come with you, okay?\" Chloe beamed, yourself sighing in defeat. You could argue with her all day if you wanted, but in the end, you couldn\u2019t really do anything to stop her coming with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour decision to go home was pretty much entirely based on the fact that you needed a change of clothes, and unfortunately, Chloe had decided to come with you for whatever reason she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, letting her come with you and basically doing nothing about it wasn't the best idea. Chloe now knew where you lived and could come 'visit' you at any time. Despite her being a generally nice \u2018person\u2019, you were at odds with her behavior. She was possessive, and if what she did to Kim was any indication, violent too. Definitely not someone you\u2019d want to hang around with, human or otherwise, and girlfriend or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026 This is a neat place, (name).\" Chloe chirped, sounding legitimately impressed as the three of you rocked up outside your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\u2026\" you mumbled. \"I\u2019m just gonna head inside and freshen up\u2026 Do you mind waiting out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\u2026\" Chloe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\u2026\" you nodded awkwardly, heading inside to have a shower and put on a fresh change of clothes. You decided calling your friends was the most sensible thing you could do at this point, and it was\u2026 except for the fact that your 'friends' didn't give a damn about anything you told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave them the whole story, how you\u2019d gone out with Chloe like you\u2019d promised, and she ended up kidnapping you, forcing you to stay the night at her place, and then dragging you off to a Waterpark the following day, all while being trapped inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll they did was laugh, even when you told them what happened with Kim. Bummer. At least you knew where you really stood in the eyes of your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed heavily and re-joined the girls outside, hoping that they would\u2019ve gotten along a little, or at the very least, Chloe was treating Kim with dignity. As you came out the front door, you noticed, Chloe had allowed Kim\u2019s head to come out of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good. You two are getting along-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name), I want you to pick one of us to love forever.\" Chloe stated boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true you dated this girl?\" Chloe pried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you admitted. \"Kim and I were in a relationship, but we broke up because\u2026\" you stopped, sighing. \"Because of some altercations. I don't see why you're so jealous.\" you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, you told Kim that you loved her!\" Chloe spat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't love both of us! So you have to choose one of us to love! Pick me so I can put this ex of yours back in my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name), please, I\u2019m so sorry I laughed at you. I made a mistake and I see that now. And I know you want a human girlfriend, so pick me so I can get out of this slime and we can work things out.\" Kim piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took an uneasy step back. You would have never thought you\u2019d have ended up in a situation like this, even with everything else that had been going on. In regular circumstances, you would have chosen the dirt over Kim for how she treated you, but Kim was a human being and deserved a certain amount of respect and dignity. Chloe keeping her hostage inside her was morally not the right thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, Kim basically ripped your heart right out of your chest by cheating on you, and you knew that with or without her in your life that there\u2019d always been an emptiness that could never be filled. Maybe she deserved everything she got\u2026 Maybe you were better off with Chloe\u2026</span></div></div>",

And besides, even if you wanted nothing to do with Kim, it was wrong for Chloe to hold her against her will. Either way, you knew that breaking Chloe\u2019s heart was the only option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Chloe but we only went out on one date. The date didn't even go well. I mean, you kidnapped me and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Chloe asked incredulously. \"You\u2019re breaking up with me? For her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, listen-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don\u2019t want to hear anything you have to say!\" Chloe snapped. With a huff, Chloe made Kim slide out of her vagina and onto your front porch completely naked. As you helped Kim up, Chloe gave you a hurt glare before silently walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought Kim inside to find her some clothes to wear, and then sat down with her to talk about your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly (name), that bitch was crazy! How'd you even meet her?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was a blind date.\" you said. \"Actually, she was set up by my friends as a way for me to get over you after I lost some Superbowl bets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant choice!\" Kim said sarcastically. \"Chloe sucked me into her! Do you have any idea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut Kim off. \"She did the same to me.\" Kim's eyes widened, but you continued. \"Not even five minutes into the date, Chloe absorbed me and took me back to her place. It was her idea to go to the Waterpark. It wasn't like I could turn her down.\" seconds passed, but each one felt like hours. You turned to face Kim directly in her hazel eyes. \"Do you remember why we broke up in the first place?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked visibly saddened by your question. You both knew all too well why you broke up. \"Jed...\" Kim muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could've ended it, you know, if you wanted to.\" you said. \"But you waited until I truly fell for you, and then you cheated on me... with Jed, who was just using you to get back at his ex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... I know this is a couple months too late, but... I'm sorry.\" Kim said, sounding truly sincere as she leaned close you, hesitating for a moment before pressing her lips against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you moaned as you pulled your ex on top of you, the two continuing to make out, spending the rest of the day and night together in unbridled passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you wake up\u2026</span></div></div>",

Sunlight streamed in through the window, as you scrunched your face, feeling Kim breathing on your neck. You turned to her as she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stud\u2026\" Kim purred, her naked body pressing up against yours as she kissed you. \"I forgot how good you are\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Thanks. You\u2019re not so bad yourself!\" you teased. You cleared your throat. \"You workin\u2019 today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Kim smiled. \"I\u2019ve got the day off. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\" You replied, turning over and drawing the bedsheet back as you got up and out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you off to?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna run myself a bath.\" You told her, slowly smiling. \"You\u2019re welcome to join me, if you\u2019d like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Kim hummed, before sighed. \"Why don\u2019t you go ahead and start it, and I\u2019ll come in and join you in a little bit\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You smiled, leaving your bedroom and walking into your bathroom. As you looked at your bathtub, you were reminded of Chloe\u2019s Jacuzzi, and you shook your head quickly, moving to turn the water on. \"I hope Chloe's gotten over yesterday and has moved on\u2026\" you muttered, waiting for the water to warm up. After a few minutes of waiting you got in and relaxed. It was the perfect temperature. \"Hey babe,\" you called. \"The water\u2019s perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first everything was calm and peaceful, but then you saw the water slowly began to change colors. The clear water slowly earned itself a reddish hue, almost as if you\u2019d accidentally cut yourself or poured a bunch of red food coloring in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t either of those things. It was something much worse. You quickly got up out of the bath and tried to run for the door but you were grabbed by a pair of hands and got dragged back in the bath as Chloe\u2019s head popped up in amongst the bathtub full of slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello (name), sweetie.\" Chloe said lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, what are you doing here?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" she giggled. \"I came here to show you our new love nest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, I-\" you were cut off as she planted a light kiss on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you were kidding about choosing that slut Kim over me. My guess is that she made you choose her in order to separate us. But it's okay now, I forgive you and we're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives far away from that slut.\" Chloe said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Chloe!\" You said. \"Kim's not a slut, I chose her over you because although we broke up, we had chemistry. I'm not into you. You need to accept that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Chloe shouted, shaking you roughly above the bath. \"You're lying! That slut's making you say those things!\" Chloe yelled while tears were streaming down her cheeks. \"I'll make you love me one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name), what\u2019s going on in there?\" Kim\u2019s voice sounded. \"Oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim! Help me!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Chloe shouted. \"You tried to take my (name) from me! Well you\u2019re not having him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe pushed your body down onto hers again as you got a face full of slime. You tried to struggle, but she was just too strong. It wasn't long before her whole body liquified and surrounded you. You continued thrashing until you realized that Chloe was growing around you. \"Hey! Stop! MMMPH!!!\" you were cut short as Chloe's head, the only part of her body which hadn't liquified, pressed up against yours as she kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the slime that you had previously received from Chloe rocket out of your stomach through your mouth as it rejoined with Chloe. It was as if the wind was literally pulled out of you. You were completely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surrounded in what was almost a sphere a red slime, Chloe\u2019s head hanging down from the inside and kissing you passionately. \"Let him go!\" Kim shouted, banging on Chloe\u2019s body, but it was no use, you were trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe moaned all the way through the kiss, before the sphere began to change shape, slowly wrapping around you. Chloe\u2019s form was tight enough to make sure you couldn't escape, but also gentle enough to not crush any of your bones or organs. \"Off we go...\" Chloe said in your mouth through the kiss and you felt her form shrinking around you, forcing you back through the tap from where she came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weird sensation. You thought it would be painful, but it wasn't. Chloe seemed to be doing her utmost to shield your body from harm. Chloe completely covered your line of vision and provided you with air through her lips so that you wouldn't pass out or die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went through the pipes with Chloe, your mind was a storm of thoughts. Where was Chloe taking you? How could she fit you through such a small pipe hole without killing you? You guessed that if The Blob could do it, Chloe could do it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like miles, you finally plopped out of Chloe and landed into some dirty sewer water. You thought for sure that this would be your chance to escape, but as you tried to swim away, the glob that was Chloe latched a tendril onto your ankle. With a mighty toss, she threw you out of the water and onto a soggy bed on the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed up a bit of blood from the sheer force of impact. You tried to get up, but you simply collapsed, your head resting back on a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the dirty water, darling.\" Chloe said, apologizing. \"It has been a while since I've used this place so I forgot to turn on the water filter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to say something, but you were too weak. Chloe walked towards a machine near the entrance and turned it on. In a short matter of time, the machine sucked up all of the filth, grime and scum in the water leaving only fresh crystal-clear water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now only clean water can come in here while filtering out all of the filth.\" Chloe stated proudly as she turned back towards you. It was then that she noticed the blood dripping down your mouth and your pained expression. \"(name)! I'm so sorry!\" Chloe said, gently picking you up. \"Say something! Please!\" Chloe pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly wanted to say something, but you couldn't. It wasn't that you didn't want to. Panicky, Chloe gently forced herself down your throat to repair your damaged body tissue with parts of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body struggled to contain Chloe, slowly growing in size as you filled up more and more with Chloe. You entire body expanded, like a fleshy water balloon as Chloe continued, herself not looking as though she was losing any mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body creaked and groaned, yourself slowly growing taller, going from five foot eight to seven foot four within the span of a few minutes. When the last of Chloe eventually ended up inside you, your arms, legs and crotch had all been absorbed into the globe of your body, leaving you completely immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch\u2026 loe\u2026\" you muttered, feeling her travel throughout your body. It wasn't long before Chloe erupted out of your mouth and your body jerked as it deflated and returned to its original form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe reformed beside you and patted your cheek lightly. \"(name), are you alright?\" she asked, tears streaming down her face. You couldn't help but be stunned. Even though you practically broke her heart, or whatever she had in place of one, she still remained utterly devoted to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned a little bit and Chloe sighed with relief. \"Thank goodness! I thought I almost lost you!\" she picked you up and cradled you in her arms like a baby. \"You won't be strong enough to walk for a while. You\u2019ll be okay in a few minutes though, after your body\u2019s adjusted to have me supporting your bones and organs.\" Chloe explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" you asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious, (name)? It's our new home.\" Chloe explained. \"This bunker is in the center of the city's sewage complex system but this place does get sunlight so you don't have worry about living down here like a vampire. The bunker also has everything you would ever need: A bed, a television, a refrigerator, a jet bathtub, a toilet and an air conditioner.\" Chloe listed, sounding pretty pleased with her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't live down here...\" you murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\" Chloe snapped, shaking you around violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got scared. \"Th-there's no food and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll feed myself to you, don't worry!\" she smiled, her sweet demeanor reappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about my friends and family? I have a job, I can't just abandon everybody.\" you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can!\" Chloe teased. \"You don't need anyone else but me! I can provide for you and protect you. Plus if it gets too cold at night, you can stay inside me to keep warm. Something that slut Kim can't do.\" Chloe added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Chloe, please stop calling her a slut. I know you're upset but that gives you no right to insult her.\" you said defending Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not upset!\" Chloe pouted. \"I'm just asking why would you settle for someone like her when you have someone like me.\" Chloe replied as she began to inhale deeply, before swallowing and making her already huge breasts even bigger. \"See?\" she teased, pushing her breasts up against your face. They felt like giant latex balloons. They even smelt a bit like them too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed her right nipple into your mouth and all you could do was suckle as you were too weak to push away. You saw her cheerful smile widen as your eyelids began to droop ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began rubbing the back of your head with her left hand while also keeping your head in place. Then she hummed a soft tune which, at the end of, she gently removed your lips from her nipple and kissed you softly. \"Goodnight, sweetie...\"</span></div></div>",

Chloe was smiling sweetly, and truth be told, if she had been human, she would look plenty cute. But the green slime was slightly off-putting to you--thoughts played in your head of green slime in movies, almost like the girl in front of you was radioactive sludge.  The shock of Chloe being slime wore off quickly, as you forced a smile, deciding to suck it up, endure the date, and go back to your regular routine of daydreaming about Kim. \"Hi, that's me. And you must be... Chloe, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gooey girl beamed as she sat across from you--well, sitting was a stretch.  Her matter seemed to just collapse onto the chair and re-form in place to a humanoid body. \"Yes, I am!  It's so pleasant to finally meet you.  Some of my friends talk about you quite a bit! And I can finally put a face to their stories.\" As skeptical as you had been at the start, as you made small talk it was hard to deny that Chloe was a cheery, pleasant girl. The mutual friends that set up the date kept insisting that there was no one with as bright of an outlook on life as Chloe, she always seemed to find a way to please her friends. They did keep one detail from you, however... Chloe was a bit of the jealous type, and when she became envious of people, she'd find ways to include herself in the affairs of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not really well-versed in slimes, can you actually eat? Can you taste?\" You kept asking questions like this as the pizza arrived at your table, treating Chloe more like a science experiment than a date. Her expression with each question sank a little, although she kept up her cheery tone. She seemed to have already developed an infatuation with you--reaching out to touch your hand, staring into your eyes, but she was starting to see that something was holding you back from really connecting with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of your ex lingered in your mind the whole time. She was a beautiful woman through and through, with shapely legs and hips, a nice set of D-cups, and flowing light brunette hair that framed her adorable face, which grew even cuter when she smiled.  The days and nights spent with her were impossible to let go of.  Kim wasn't nearly as interested in the relationship though, she was about as interested in you as you seemed to be with Chloe. An amusing thought popped into your head, that if Kim had Chloe's personality and infatuation, it'd be the perfect match...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and then that's how I disintegrated into nothingness and vanished off the face of the earth. Are you even listening to me...?\" Chloe frowned, her voice cracking a little as she asked it. You snapped out of your daydream, and turned to meet the slime girl's gaze. \"Oh, uh, sorry. I have to be honest, though. I don't think this is going to work out, I just...\" you trailed off, not wanting to hurt Chloe but not wanting to drag this out either. \"I gotta go. I've already paid for the pizza, you can take it home if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe watched you get up, shuffle to the door, and leave. At first, she sighed dejectedly, losing her humanoid shape briefly as she sank in her seat. <i>I like him but it's like I'm invisible...</i> she thought to herself, before she sprang right back to her feminine form. Suddenly she smiled, filled with determination. She really did like him, and she knew she could make him like her too, somehow! This wasn't over, not by a longshot. A slime like her had plenty of tricks, and all she had to do was follow you back to your apartment and give you a reason to love her. This was one slime that didn't give up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe hurried out of the restaurant, trailing after you from a distance.  She could easily hide and morph, so when she thought you were on to her, she'd slip into a bush or under a car or wherever else, before continuing her pursuit.  She tracked you all the way up to the floor of your apartment, and then after a few moments she slipped under the door, green ooze spreading out and forming a head to look around.  What did she see?</span></div></div>",

How'd you get in here?\" You never expected to see her again--had your ex changed her mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe watched the situation carefully, she was quite adept at reading humans, as it was how she learned to mimic them. She quickly picked up that you were deeply in love with this woman based on your tone of voice, your posture, everything made a lot more sense to her. And Chloe was immediately jealous that a girl like Kim would hold your attention so easily!  Chloe slid under the door further, heading under the corner table to hide and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim just smiled a little, rolling her eyes. She was still playful with you, though it wasn't the sort of greeting you'd hoped for. \"Calm down, tiger. I had a spare key, and I'm returning it now. I just wanted to come over and make sure we're still friends, right? No hard feelings.\"  You only half heard what Kim was saying, as you couldn't help but glance at her cleavage in the white top she was wearing, or at her hips tightly encased on the distressed jeans she wore. She looked so wonderful... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled like an idiot in return. \"Yeah, no, of course. Friends, we'll always be friends. Uh, one moment, I might have some of your things in my room, I'll get them for you. You, uh, want to stay for a drink or something?\" You didn't seem to get the memo, and Kim rolled her eyes again, calling to you as you stepped to your room. \"It's just not gonna happen, tiger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe immediately saw an opportunity. Fueled by envy, she wanted you to look at her the way you looked at Kim, to know what it felt like to have that sort of attention and desire focused on her. She had options now, although she was about to make some rash decisions. But Chloe was determined to make something happen. She began to flow out of her hiding spot, heading towards something that would get you to love her--or at least to have fun with her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Need some help?\" You turn around, and you almost gasp at the sight. Kim was standing there, wearing only her panties and a bra, the rest of her perfectly shaped and lightly tanned body on display as she stood in the doorframe, one arm on her hip as the other propped her up.  She looked so sexy, and that expression on her face was so different than before! No longer a slightly amused but uninterested friend, Kim had an energetic lust in her eyes, her lovely green eyes. ...Wait, weren't her eyes blue? You could swear that Kim's eyes had originally been blue, since you were out ring shopping for her the day before she broke up with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim seemed to be caught off-guard by your scrutinizing gaze for a moment, blinking a few times before she stepped into your room, and stepped up her game. She stepped right up to you, her hand coming to trace along your body, right down to your pants, fingers teasing along your jeans. \"I've got a little surprise for you, to go with that little surprise you've got for me.\" Chloe was doing everything she could to keep up her act, but she didn't really know how the girl she was controlling actually acted, or spoke. When she flowed into Kim's body, she locked her host inside herself, able to see and hear and feel but not able to act, nor communicate. She was manipulating Kim's muscles, almost like she was pushing the girl's body to do what she wanted, but she wasn't a mind-reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all happening so fast, but Chloe read your gaze, and acted upon it.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, it was like you had briefly imagined: Chloe's personality was in Kim's body, and something about that was suddenly exciting. Kim had an incredible body, you could stare at her all day, and here comes along Chloe, who had this slime ability that you didn't even realize. She's head over heels for you, and the fact that she can act upon it as Kim seemed to only further arouse you. You knew it was wrong, though... Kim's in there somewhere! She is trapped, unable to do anything while Chloe was at the helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim smiled, and it looked so different, it was like Chloe's smile at the pizza shop. \"I knew something was bothering you on our date, and now I found a solution! I mean, you like this girl, right?\" Her hands traced up and down that body, like it was feeling it for the first time. \"You can't keep your eyes off of her. I bet you want to have your hands all over her, to be inside her. Now you can, see? I'm a symbiotic slime, so I can share organic bodies and change them inside and out. I could stay as Kim forever, or make her into a plaything for us. I could change her, I could be different girls for you! Maybe slime isn't your thing, I get it, but I'm here and willing to do anything to make this work. And I mean...\" Kim suddenly walked to you, and slid one of her slender hands into your boxers, delicately teasing around your rock hard member, \"...Anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I... I don't know, Chloe. That's like taking her life! I love Kim, but I don't know if I can let you do this.\" Your body betrayed you, however, as you were clearly turned on by the prospect, and Chloe knew she had her hook in you. She kept smiling, and she undid her bra in a swift motion, letting her large breasts bounce out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you something, 'tiger'!\" Chloe grinned, borrowing the nickname Kim used for you along with the rest of her. \"I can change Kim's body to match any desire you might have. Watch!\" Suddenly, Kim's breasts began to grow, jiggling this way and that as they did like they had a life of their own. Three cupsizes later, Kim pressed up against you, those rather huge tits pressing against your own chest. \"One of many tricks! Don't make me leave so soon, please. Let me at least prove to you that I'm more than worth it, and you can have the best of Kim, and the best of me.\"</span></div></div>",

Chloe was almost childlike in her excitement and playfulness, which resulted in some hopping around in Kim's body, exaggerating every part of Kim that could jiggle.  She stopped and turned right back to you, her rented body's mouth curled up into a smile that seemed impossible to alter.  \"Agreed!  Agreed.  One full day and I'll play by your rules.\"  She immediately hugs you, pressing her large breasts right into you.  Chloe was perfectly happy to make use of Kim's body to keep you excited, and it worked like a charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe then put Kim's hands on her hips, posing in front of you.  \"I'm a very talented slime, you know.

You want to see a... a version of me if I were human?  Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing against a chair, Chloe went all-out on her bodily changes, leaving behind any sign of Kim in the features of the body at all.  She adjusted Kim's curves to really exaggerate the legs and hips, features that Chloe seemed to take pride in given that most of the time her slime form didn't generate complete legs at all.  Her waist shrank a bit more as her bust expanded another cup size, taking advantage of her ability to exaggerate the body with ease.  Her breasts strained at the already ill-fitting bra she was wearing, so much that she quickly reached back to unclasp it and free her globes, which jostled all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face saw the most changes, though.  Kim's supermodel-esque facial features had shifted to something that was immediately recognizable as Chloe's cute, youthful face.  Her adorable expressions were compounded by the tiny nose and big, bright eyes.  Her hair shimmered, taking on a sheen of bright green.  Despite it being an unnatural color to see on a human head, somehow when Chloe made the change, it appeared as if the hair was always meant to be like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe eventually stood up again, and when she next spoke, Kim's voice had been replaced by Chloe's unmistakable sing-song pitch.  \"The makeover's complete!  Do I... do I look alright?  It's not too much, is it..?\"  Her hands slid over her body, as she shifted her hips.  It was hard to believe that was still Kim, in some way or another, sitting in the backseat of her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Kim even know about this, what you're doing to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe shook her head.  \"Nope!  Not unless you want me to stop suppressing her mind.  I can switch her mind on, off, feed it thoughts and emotions, tinker with it... for a slime, it's extremely easy, though I can't put it in words.  Why, do you want her to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, and this time your hands come to rest on Chloe's 'normal' body.  This causes her to shiver and close her eyes in response, as your fingers trailed along her waist.  \"You're... impressive, Chloe!  Now...\"</span></div></div>",

The neck disappeared quickly, and then the chin disappeared into the chest as Chloe winked at you.  She didn't seem alarmed, but you couldn't help but panic a little for Kim's sake.  Soon, just the top of Chloe's head was visible, and it was quickly absorbed into the skin, along with all of the hair, leaving a flat, smooth spot where her neck should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe spun around, and then ran her hands along her sides, before stretching them out to a 'ta-da' pose, as if nothing was wrong.  You notice that at the spot where her neck should be, something was growing again, but this time it was translucent and green--in mere moments, Chloe grew out a full slime head, perched atop her borrowed human body.  \"Pretty neat, huh?  I forgot to mention I could replace parts of a body with my own slime, too.  Sometimes, it's nice to be solid in some spots, and slime in others...\"  She grinned, as her arms were pulled into her body next, quickly replaced by slimy green arms at the shoulders.  It almost looked like Chloe was wearing some sort of skin-colored jumpsuit, but you knew better.  It was incredible, if not a bit freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't Kim die if she can't breathe through a mouth?\"  This caused Chloe to giggle.  \"Don't worry!  My slime provides respiration for her.  I can eat, drink, and breathe on her behalf, and I can sustain her for hours if I stay fully inside her and indefinitely with a bit of my slime on the outside like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities were incredible, and you knew this was just getting started.</span></div></div>",

It clearly felt so good for her to use you like this, and she kept moaning and playing with your body and hers as she pushed you into Kim's womb, which stretched to seemingly impossible levels.  Halfway in, and Kim was looking quite round in her stomach, which was accomodating a squirming, wriggling fully sized human! Chloe giggled through her host's mouth, standing up and patting at her stomach as your legs slurped in. She re-formed her vagina back to a normal size, leaving you and Chloe entirely within Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see, but you could feel the slime all around you, as Chloe was seeping under your clothes, touching you over every inch of yourself. She felt cold and slick, which as she swirled around your shaft you realized it felt really good, and you thrashed around. \"Help!  HELP!\" You called out, but it was like it was muffled, like you were underwater. Chloe started to talk to you, from within Kim's belly. \"Hey, don't worry, I can easily keep you alive like this. Nutrients, oxygen, all that I can provide! You're a part of both Kim and me now, you see? So now you don't have to worry about being together with her anymore, you're together alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd never been more scared and aroused at the same time. Chloe was giving you plenty of attention, some sort of suction was latching onto your member and sucking--a slimy blowjob? Whatever the slimejob was, it caused you to thrash about more. On the outside, Kim's hands rested on your large belly, as she somehow had the strength to walk both of you around the apartment on her two legs, strolling back to the bedroom, to lie down and play with Kim's body while Chloe played with you. As you came inside her body, spraying into Chloe's slime, you found yourself growing sleepy, becoming extremely tired. You passed out, as Chloe smiled through Kim, sprawling her borrowed body out.</span></div></div>",

Inside the body, her slime went to work, tugging at your arms and legs, positioning and adjusting your body such that you were oriented the same way as Kim, albeit still in her stretched out stomach. Chloe began to 'flatten' Kim's insides, using her slimy transformation abilities to hollow out Kim without injuring her.  Wherever she did this, though, Kim's body flattened out, like it deflated. Everywhere outside of that bump seemed to deform slightly, until Kim began the second part of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your body oriented correctly, she began to tug your arms into Kim's, followed by your legs. You easily slipped into Kim's rubbery form, since Chloe's green slime made for an excellent lubrication.  Eventually, your head stretched through Kim's neck, and you were fully wearing your brand new Kim suit. Chloe's slime adjusted the proportions of your body, making you fit inside Kim so well that from the outside, no one would know the difference.

Kim didn't know what to do, so she just braced herself for Chloe grabbing you and pulling you in with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a considerable struggle for some time as everything went dark.

And in a stranger twist, you could feel through Kim's skin, as the fabric moved around, causing you to go a bit weak in the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what was THAT!\" Kim said, alarmed.  Apparently she could still move her mouth unimpeded, and her voice came out normally.  You could feel twitches in your arms and legs, like they wanted to move, but were too weak to do so on their own.  Another voice chimed in.  \"We're all together in one body now!  We can go see the movie!  You'll have to do the talking, Kim... oh, and Kim and I are too weak to move the body right now, but that's not a problem now that we have someone in here who has full muscles in three dimensions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the glass display next to you, looking at your reflection.  The dumbfounded look on your face said it all: you didn't know what to make of having Kim's body as yours, almost entirely under your control at that.  She looked no different, no doubt due to Chloe's tricks, as you would normally not be such an ideal fit inside of her.

As she let out little, anxious giggles, she turned ever so slightly, her uncovered eye meeting yours. \u201cI\u2019m...not in the mood for pizza. I\u2019d rather, uh...eat you...\u201d Her eye quickly darted away again, her body twitching with nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was look in bewilderment at the shy slime\u2019s statement. Was she actually being serious? Surely this had to be a joke right? But it couldn\u2019t be a joke, her nervousness was far too real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only ask, \u201cw-why?\u201d She immediately looked to you, still shy and nervous but also shocked you weren\u2019t dismissive . \u201cWell, um...you know what, forget it. I shouldn\u2019t have asked. I...I understand how weird that must sound...\u201d she responded, literally sinking down into the seat, on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly moved around the table, dropping down to her level and resting a hand on her shoulder. You jerked a bit, surprised to feel her gelatinous body compressing a little but taking the weight of your hand. You felt her shutter as her head shot up, her hair moving away to reveal her other eye, the pair staring deep into your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath before you spoke. \u201cChloe, it\u2019s ok. If...you really want to...eat me...then I guess I\u2019m ok with that...as long as you don\u2019t hurt me of course.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but let out a little chuckle at that last part for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, her face showing her obvious nervousness but also a sense of relief. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and sat up, taking your other hand in her own. She had a weak smile as she said, \u201cOf...of course not! This is our first date after all. Are you...sure you\u2019re ok with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a sense of confidence as you stood next to her, giving her an affirming nod. You couldn\u2019t believe you were actually about to let yourself...no, you can\u2019t think too much about this, or else you might not go through with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile grew ever so slightly, giving you a light tug toward her body. She nodded back and very slowly brought your body against her own. As your body began to press against her, you could feel it sinking into it, almost like a bean bag chair. However, it didn\u2019t stop sinking, more and more of your body being wrapped by the thick gel. As you face met her own, you could see just how lovely it was, shyness and all. Your vision was soon blurred as her body wrapped itself tightly around you, pulling you in with such ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as the last of your body sank in, it almost popped right in place, the tightness quickly relieving as you floated inside her. You looked around in awe, much of the outside world distorted in a blue cloud. You could hear and feel her small breaths filling all around you, her body shifting as you got acquainted inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting timidly in her seat all by herself now, Chloe looked around curiously through her own body, watching as your eyes looked around, how you were adjusting so quickly to your new surroundings. Her face turned bright blue again before she whispered. \u201cS-So, um...how is it...in there?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You reply by letting her do that. Suddenly you feel a small string of her slime penetrate your mouth which gives her mutual control of your mouth and digestive system. You both then start talking getting to know each other \u201cshe seems like a very nice person\u201d you say to yourself. Then when the pizza comes, she started gobbling the pizza up. Each bite she takes, she moves it inside of your body until it is near your mouth and you eat it. \u201cMmmmm...\u201d she says after you ate the first bite \u201cthis is the first time in months I am able to taste food again, not since our mutual friend Jake let me use possess his body to eat while I was hanging out with the gang (same as your friends). \u201cWhat! You can possess other people!!??\u201d You ask astonished. \u201cYes I can, I will show you what I can do later if you want\u201d. Even though it seems rude, you had to ask her: \u201chow come you are a... how should I put it...\u201d She cuts you off saying \u201ca slime?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my dad works as a researcher at a factory, and on take your daughter to school day, there was an accident where I lost my human body form and became a slime\u201d she continues \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t hamper our relationship much. Our friends, who knew me way before the accident, wanted me to not get lonely so they told me about you\u201d. <br>\r\nYou feel a bit sad for her losing her body,  but you feel excited to see what is to come with this new relationship. After she finished eating, she she starts changing around you and then releases your from her body. <br>\r\n\u201cThank you for that\u201d she says plating a kiss on your cheek which felt warm. \u201cHow was that experience?\u201d She then asked. <br>\r\n\u201cIt was sooo warm and relaxing, and it felt good once in a while to loose some control of your movements\u201d you reply. You can see her blushing a bit before inviting you to her house and you accept. <br>\r\nAfter you both reached the house, and meeting her father who told you to \u201ctake care of my lovely daughter\u201d you go up to her room. You both sat next to each other on the bed and started chit chatting with each other. You ask her about her abilities and what she can do:<br>\r\n\u201cWatch this\u201d she says. You watch in astonishment as she transformed her head into different people and celebrities. <br>\r\n\u201cThe form I am in most of the time- which is the form you met me in, that is the form of my body before I turned into this slime body\u201d she adds \u201cI can also change into animals\u201d. Then she stands up in front of you, and starts to shrink and morph until she ended up in the shape of a dog about the height of your ankles. All of the sudden, she rushes on and jumps on you and starts licking your face. \u201cGerrof\u201d you started shouting and laughing as she was licking you. Then she starts barking at the door telling you to open it and follow her. She went down the stairs and outside onto the drive way, there she suddenly started expanding until she morphed into a slimy Chevrolet Camaro. \u201cGet in\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice came out of the Camaro while she opened her door. You got in and she started driving around the neighborhood. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was so cool!\u201d You said after you got out and she transformed back into her own slimy self. You both went back to her room and you asked her \u201cyou also said something about possession back at the pizzeria, what was that about?\u201d .<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically... I can possess any living organism and use its body. I used it twice since I turned into this thing: once in the lab while testing, and once on my and your friend Jake to taste food again, before I discovered that I can eat people and use their senses\u201d.  <br>\r\n\u201cCool... but how come you don\u2019t use it more often?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if a lot of people know, they would become afraid from me, and I want to respect people\u2019s lives and privacy by not using their body without their consent, and I don\u2019t have people around me my age to possess\u201c. <br>\r\nYou feel kinda bad for your girlfriend, and you wanted to see how it feels to be possessed. So you tell her:<br>\r\n\u201cPossess me then, I wanna see how it feels\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Really? Who would wanna become possessed?\u201d<br>\r\nAfter you persuade her, she agrees to try it. She tells you to sleep on the bed and to relax and open your mouth. \u201cThis is so exciting!\u201d She says as she then compresses herself and starts pushing herself through your open mouth. \u201cStay calm, and don\u2019t move\u201d you hear coming out of the wall of slime pushing itself down your throat. After all of her enters you, you wait a couple of seconds... nothing... \u201cChloe?\u201d You cry out. Just then, you feel yourself loose control of your limbs and mouth. Your body rises up from the bed, and starts analyzing your hands and then, with difficulty at the beginning, heads up a a mirror hanged on the wall and starts touching your face \u201cI\u2019m... human again\u201d Chloe says with your voice, then she puts your hands on your mouth. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Her voice asks you  from inside of your head \u201cyou can talk to me by trying to speak regularly\u201d she instructs you. \u201cI\u2019m feeling fine\u201d you tell her, not knowing if she heard you or not. \u201cGood, I can actually make you loose consciousness but I will never do that to you\u201d she tells you while flexing your muscles. Then you feel as if control of your body returned to you and you suddenly puke her slimy self out of your mouth. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing, thank you for reminding me of the time I had a body. But I still feel guilty possessing someone else\u201d she tells you with a sad voice. <br>\r\n\u201cNo.. you can possess me whenever you want\u201d you comfort and hug her. <br>\r\n Do you know what, let\u2019s do something together tomorrow while sharing a body, what do you think?\u201d You add while hugging her. <br>\r\n\u201cThat would be something I will never forget\u201d she says. <br>\r\n\u201cLet me show you something\u201d she says while you were both hugging. She starts eating you like before and enveloping you into herself. Then she changes her shape around you until she covers you perfectly. Do you mind me taking off your clothes? She asks \u201cthis will feel great, I like to do it to my friends and they love it\u201d. You hesitate but then agree since she does know what she is doing. She moves her slimy self inside so that there are hands inside of her taking off your shirt and pants leaving you with nothing except your underwear \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I will dry it\u201d she tells you. Then she makes you go to the tub in the bathroom next to her room and turns on the jackuzi mode so hot water starts pouring in. After the tub gets filled with water, she gets in and quickly the water becomes green (her color) and dissolves  into the water with you in it. \u201cWhile in the water, I can control it\u201d the voice comes from the water. You suddenly feel a bunch of hands form in the water and starts massaging every single part of your body.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then go home. <br>\r\nThe next day</span></div></div>",

How on earth did your friends find out about her is a complete mystery! Regardless of who she was, she had a great figure. Her eyes however were a golden yellow, comparing such a contrast just like stars in the night sky. As weird as the situation was, you nodded your head as you slowly began to get lost in your own thoughts. Unfortunately it only left you with more questions about this slimy beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe sat herself down on the seat and spoke up, \"So (your name) rather than trying to answer your own questions, why not ask me instead. I'm sure I got all the answers to your questions about me.\" As she said it a small mischievous smile began to appear on her face. It seems like Chloe already figured out what your were thinking based on the obvious expression you had on your face, snapping you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bit nervous as you looked at Chloe, sure it was a strange and abnormal event, but you were able to collect your thoughts. \"Umm, are you actually made of slime?\" You asked, though it seemed pretty obvious upon first seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am (your name), and as such I am able to change my body into various forms from semi solid to liquid if I so desired.\" She giggled, Chloe seemed to have already expect your question as she was completely straightforward. \"If you want you cam touch me and feel for yourself.\" Still giggling, it seems she's already happy by the fact that you were showing interest unlike other people she has met in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo simply touch this girl's body seemed strange as it was only the first date, but you couldn't help but wonder what she felt like, as you looked at Chloe whose body seemed to glimmer dimly in the light. It was sorta bothering how she had no clothes whatsoever. Curiosity had a strong grip as you tried to reply, \"I mean only if you're-\" but you were cut off as she grabs one of your arms with her rubbery like hands and shoved it into her chest. You were a bit shocked by the sudden action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this satisfy your curiosity?\" She asked in a sly manner smiling, knowing she got just the reaction that she was hoping for. While Chloe was a very nice girl, she seemed like she would be a handful if she continued with her antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahh...errr, yes.\" You were at a loss for words momentarily, she felt odd that was for sure as you pulled your arm away. She felt like a mixture of warm, soft, rubbery yet slimy substance that seemed to stretch out. \"A-anyways, how about we get something to eat?\" You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Chloe began.</span></div></div>",

You didn't mind having toppings, but nothing beats good old fashion cheese pizza. \"Chloe, is there any kind of pizza you would like to have?\" You asked. You didn't want to order without knowing want Chloe wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe gave a small smile and answered, \"How kind of you (your name). Well then, I'd like to have 2 large supreme pizzas.\" You were surprised, well actually you should have seen it coming since she is a slime girl, but more importantly your wallet was going to be hit harder, considering the amount of food required to feed her. Nonetheless you didn't give it a second thought because everyone deserves a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your pizzas are ready and you both began to dig in. Although you decided to not order the cheese pizza and stick with Chloe's pizza. You wished you had some cheese pizza but it wasn't that important right now. You only had 2 large slices as the rest was absorbed by Chloe. You couldn't help but stare as the pizzas she absorbed into her slimy dark body moved from her arm to the core of her body. Then the pizzas began to dissipate slowly as it added more mass to her body, giving smoother and bigger curves on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Chloe giggled as she watched your reaction, she liked to tease you. \"Do you like my new body? Or maybe how I can absorb things into me? Or how I get bigger?\" She kept bombarding questions at you as you attempted to recollect your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well yes\" You couldn't really say much, but it was as simple and straight forward as you could get especially since the teasing was really getting to you. Chloe had a big smile on her face as she stretched her arms across the table to hug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think I found my special someone. Your the only one who is ok with who I am.\" She said full of happiness. Sure she was...different from most people, but regardless she is still a person with a good heart, it didn't matter who or what she was. However you would never have had this opportunity if it wasn't for the fact others rejected her. You felt pretty lucky to end up with Chloe. You wondered how your friends would react to their plan backfiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the date had come to an end after a bit of chattering. It turned out to be wonderful. Chloe then asked, \"(Your name),do you mind if I come over by your place?\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully your house doesn't have carpet flooring, who knows what problems could arise with drenched fabric. Anyways the two of you went on back to your house which you opened up the door and allowed Chloe to enter first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first.\", you said in a playful manner as she giggled and stepped inside. Everything seemed to be operating smoothly for you. Your home wasn't exactly extraordinary or fancy, but it also wasn't shabby either. One could say its ordinary, but home is just home. There really were no words to describe it. It was simply a single story house with several rooms, a kitchen, two bathrooms, closets, and finally a garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat place you got.\" Chloe complimented. You were pretty glad you decided to do a bit of cleaning before your date, which was quite the stroke of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You replied as you decided to take a seat on the sofa. It was not a good idea asking a slime girl to sit down on the sofa as well, but despite the slimy residue that might appear later on, you thought you would handle the problem when the time came. \"Why don't you take a seat?\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, your so kind.\" She replied as she sat next to you. Earlier when you first saw her you didn't feel too awkward about it, but now this time it was different. The beauty made of slime appeared to be naked! This caught your attention as you tried to not pay any mind, though your reaction was written all over your face. Earlier during your date it seemed like she created a layer of slime that would seem like clothing as it would essentially remove the detailed body features, such as her breasts which the nipples were evidently visible right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe then stares at you with her golden eyes and gives a mischievous look noticing your reaction, smiling as she crept toward you slowly. \"Cmon now (your name), why are you so shy. This IS how I usually am when I'm not in public. I'm just trying to relax and yet it seems like your starting to get stiff.\" She cooed in a sly manner. She was obviously enjoying teasing you and taking complete advantage of it. \"Then again you did mention that my body felt nice did you not?\" She continued. \"How about I help you out?\" She said as she laid on across your body, covering you in her thick warm slimy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no words, it did feel nice, but this teasing nature of hers seemed never ending. Rather you started to feel very comfy as you then dozed off as your eyes close, soon falling asleep.</span></div></div>",
