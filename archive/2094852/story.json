Steph wanders up and down the transparent underwater tunnels as she finds herself being hoisted along by a growing crowd that seemed to be gathering and there would be the constant noise of yelling crowds.<br>\r\n\"An eye for an eye, or so they say!\" A deep voice boasted in the laughing crowd of thriving Rats<br>\r\n\"Who wants a spare kidney or two?\" responds a regal voice belonging to an elegant red-haired diva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steph made the rounds slowly, she caught the eye of a blue-eyed Regent, and she appeared to be nervous as she looked down towards the marbled floor.

After weeks of investigations upon receiving this letter it looked like his journey has come at an end. But by judging the way the guardswoman in-front of the entrance winked at him it looked like his journey wasn't over quite yet. Taking his first few steps   out of the entrance, John was not prepared for the massive assault to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright flashing lights, loud bass heavy music, various attractive people is various states of dress..It was just too much. Shielding his eyes, John ran through the club trying to find some sort of relief to the madness. Dodging people though the dimly lit underwater club, John wasn't lucky enough to stay under the radar as he accidentally bumped into someone. Feeling two round globes bounce off him he immediately got back onto his feet to help the woman he ran into back on her feet. Dusting herself off the attractive mysterious woman eyes immediately darted across John's body before she smiled and refocused her deep red eyes back onto John's baby blue's before she spoke..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Overwhelmed in bless, John was unaware of the changes in his pants. Wonderfully ignorant to his balls and what remained of his dick sinking into his body, John came the last drops of his sperm just as his new vagina lips came into existence.  Grinning wildly, Daphne knew the process was complete as she felt John's former cock peek it's head out of her bright red satin panties and her balls start filling with sperm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unaware, John sat down on a nearby chair to recover from his last male orgasm. \"God.. you're an expert lady thanks..\" John said gasping for breath as the remaining drops if sperm trickled down his legs. \"No..thank you dumbass!\" Daphne shrieked as she pushed her new johnson further into John's view. \"Let me know if you need any pads pussy!\" Daphne laughed as she strutted away deeper into the club, her new appendage happily rubbing against her flawless skin as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, John never felt more alone and helpless as he started bawling into his hands. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drawing a free hand to his eyes, tears continued to flow as he sunk back into a ball, his body getting racked by doubt and sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the main foyer into John's unfortunate little side room, Veronica's thoughts turn towards the depressed figure on a futon by a big window looking out into a oddly dark expanse of ocean. Approaching the figure Veronica recognized it has being John. \"John?\" Veronica said approaching the sad figure which briefly looked up in her direction, only to sink further into his ball, adding embarrassment into his repertoire of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a sympathetic hand on John's shoulder, Veronica felt even if she never really spoke to the guy before her sympathy in this situation, whatever it may be felt it was needed.

I've been looking for one!\" Veronica replied excitedly as she began clawing into John's trousers. \"Wait just calm down...\" John started before getting cut of as he gasped at the new feeling of cold air rushing past his now exposed pussy. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo..It is cute John..\" Veronica said winking in his direction as she fished one of her hands past her own waistband into her panties. \"Yours might even be tighter than mine, you lucky bitch..\" Veronica said smiling as she traced a French tip fingernail around her entrance. \"I tell you what.. I'll help you find the woman who stole your manhood if you let me have that cunt..\" Veronica said licking her lips at John's groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how it could get any worse..\" John said somewhat dejectedly upset as he wasn't even feeling any attraction to Veronica, perhaps do to that woman being straight her cunt carried her sexuality.

Feeling the crazy sensitive nipples rubbing the smooth inner layer of her new embroidered bra, she knew she was hitting it rich.  Pulling down the frilly black cups, she stared down at her newly won small rosy red nipples. She couldn't believe she managed to win them, her win streak has been incredible for the past couple weeks. Grinning to herself, she knew she was on her way to Royalty, hell.. maybe even surpassing Slutty Sabrina herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident, she decided to show off a bit more skin than usual today. Peeling down the pink pajamas bottoms clinging to her shapely tan hips, Veronica turned her body around so her ass was on full display in the mirror.

Nothing but the typical jealous Rabble wanting to take a peek in her bra, nothing of interest to her.

As per usual Flo and Susie still had their masculine asses from their bet with a few horny dudes earlier in the week, and Leah still had her gorgeous ass. Biting her lip she knew she had no chance at Leah's round shapely ass, and Leah knew it.. constantly taunting her with the tight leggings day in and day out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her eyes away from Leah's supple behind, Veronica waved goodbye to her friends and quickly bounced her way into a nearby corner.

Throwing her right hand near her crotch, she shoved a couple fingers in causing a loud moan to escape her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling, she managed to gain new eyes from her unusual display,  she continued. Throwing her hips onto the cold metal pole, she started climbing the pole as her sex started dripping down the pole. Louder and louder the applauses and whisting grew in her favour as she began swinging, while continually sliding her crotch on the pole coating It's surface sending the crowd into frantic applause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudience in a wild frenzy, the match was over all too soon as clear winner was obvious, Veronica has claimed victory. Climbing down from their poles, Veronica waved and blew kisses into the crowd as she confidently strutted towards Leah to claim her prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing face to face Leah knew what was about to happen, giving one last stroke of her prized asset behind her, she was ready.  \"Alright do your worst..\"Leah signed as she turned her ass  towards Veronica.  \"Will do!\" Veronica replied as she started concentrating on Leah's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Leah's entire body shook, eyes rolling into her head she felt Veronica's mind invade hers. Drooling onto the ground Leah instinctively reached both hands behind herself to clutch her glutes as Veronica began stripping it away from her. Shaking heavily, Leah felt every cell in her behind reshape themselves. Pushing and pulling, Leah once large, popular backside reshaped itself into Veronica's modest not unusual derri\u00e8re.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at Leah's misfortune, Veronica knew what was next. Palming both sides of her ass she felt a similar sensation as Leah's former cushion vibrated to life between her fingers.

Drawing her watery eyes away from the stained oak flooring underneath her, Leah's eyes wandered around the empty seats until she found the source of the noise approaching her. Smirking, Sabrina whipped her long jet black hair out of her vision and gave a quick bounce of her beautiful tattooed breasts before putting her hands behind her head to greet Leah. \"I saw what happened up there baby girl and I feel bad.. Your ass was something special and its a shame it went to that lesser woman.\" Sabrina said darting her eyes to Leah's new deflated rear while she reached her left hand down to grope her own tender tush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..I can't do shit about it now..\" Leah spat as she attempted to pry her eyes away from the tattooed beauty. Trying to lessen the impact her damn near goddess like naked form had on her arousal, now started to slide down her left inner thigh. \"I wouldn't say that..\" Sabrina's sultry voice replied as her deep brown eyes wandered towards a group of three straggling boys exiting the auditorium having enjoyed the recent show. \"You three! Come over here.\" Sabrina yelled across the auditorium towards the group of high school boys, now in hot pursuit down the low angled slopes of the theater towards Sabrina, tripping over themselves in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh..Yes Ms. Sabrina?\" the three fairly average school boys responded as they lined up in a row to greet the famous femme fatale. \"Good, now I need all three of you to drop your pants, boxers and all for me and my friend.\" Sabrina said pointing at the trio's groins. \"Wha..wha..YES Ms. Sabrina!\" the trio responded in unison blushing heavily as they undid their pants and dragged their boxers to the floor exposing their junk to the women, erections growing as their fantasies seemed to be coming true right before their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm..\" Sabrina said eyeing her candidates before pointing at the boy farthest on the left, specifically targeting the least 'confident' boy. \"You..Come here.. If you can make be cum then I'll give you these..\" Sabrina said motioning her hand to her bare breasts before she spread her legs open to invite the short blond 18 year old in. \"But If you can't..well..we swap crotches.\" Sabrina said at her new suitor before he quickly nodded and inserted himself and began pounding away. Yawning, Sabrina was completely unimpressed as the kids below average balls and shaft emptied into her.

You are of average height, and while your muscles aren't all that big, you do possess a decent amount of strength. You have medium length black hair and do not have any facial hair to speak of. You are currently wearing an unzipped green jacket with a red t-shirt underneath as well as jeans and a pair of sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously looked around at your surroundings as you glanced back and forth through the crowd of people who were patiently waiting in line to enter the BBC club. A lot of them were incredibly attractive, and it was actually making you feel a bit out of place. Earlier you had tried to find a different entrance to the BBC, but you ultimately found that the main entrance was really the only way to go, as all of the other ways inside were only used for evacuation, and even if you had managed to find a way to bypass that someone would certainly see you enter through one of these doors. It was only a matter of time til they then threw you out. You sighed as you turned around to stare back at the start of the line which had only grown since you got there. A small smile formed on your face as you were glad you didn't show up late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to stare at the back of the line you heard a soft voice that was unmistakably from a woman. \"Uh, excuse me, the line is moving again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head to the source of the voice and saw an attractive brunette woman around your age wearing a dark blue t-shirt and a short plaid skirt that had the hem just above her knees. She was carrying a small brown purse over her shoulder and also had some black flats on her feet. Overall she looked really nice, though the clothing seemed a bit odd considering that most of the other people with her level of attractiveness were wearing much skimpier outfits. Perhaps she had scars or something? Still, you were surprised you didn't notice her earlier as she was right behind you the whole time, but you ultimately shrugged it off. It was then that you realized you were still staring at the woman, and so you hastily replied back to her. \"Oh, uh, my bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the woman seemed to giggle and smile at you a bit, and you returned a faint smile back as you walked forward towards the entrance. Honestly you had felt out of place before, but after seeing someone who was both attractive and actually dressed like a normal person, well that made you feel a little less insecure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later and you had finally reached the entrance of the BBC. This is the part where things would be tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly climbed the stairs to the doorway you tried to slip past the guards but one of them saw you and pulled you aside. \"You seem rather out of place with that get-up, just who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't exactly prepared for this, and spouted the first thing that came to mind. \"I'm the archduke Vermillion Stranz.\" As you said this you mentally wanted to kick yourself for saying something so unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked over at you curiously before finally grabbing you forcefully and pulling you inside the door. While you knew you could probably take him in a fight, there were a ton of people around, and violence wouldn't solve anything at this point. You'd just need to be compliant and see how this plays out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the main room of the BBC you could see a whole manner of people, all of them wildly dancing in tune to the loud music as they raved along to the beat and flaunted their bodies. The smell of sex and sweat permeated your nostrils and the whole place seemed especially strange to you. The guard however ignored the crowd and pushed his way through a door and into a hallway. The pounding music slowly dissipated as you walked along throughout the various hallways before finally stopping at a room.</span></div></div>",

The woman actually seemed to be a bit younger than you, just barely. On top of the table was a white decorative pitcher of tea, as well as a matching small cup and plate which the woman drank from. She herself was wearing a white see-through dress, which allowed you to see every curve of her body, as well as allowing you to make out most of what she looked like underneath her dress. The dress itself was also a little frilly, and the bottom ended in a skirt-like structure, only the hem of the skirt was a lot shorter in the front, allowing you to see her legs clearly, yet not so short that you could actually see her genitalia without it being slightly obstructed. Standing next to her was a muscular shirtless man wearing nothing but a small bow-tie and a small pair of shorts which barely contained the bulge in his crotch. You figured that he was some type of servant or butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard pulled your arm tightly before roughly throwing you to the ground. \"I found a rat at the entrance my lady\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman seemed to ignore the guard as she simply grabbed her cup of tea and slowly began to drink from it in a rather refined manner. \"My lady, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that any reason to interrupt my relaxation time? Didn't I warn you and the others not to bother me?\" The guard now appeared visibly shaken as the woman eyed him. \"B...but my lady, this is a serious matter. We can't allow the common man to enter this club, as it is reserved for only those that are rich or attractive. Can't you see how serious this is Frankli-\" The guard suddenly realized what he was saying and stopped himself. \"Lady Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at the guard stunned before she finally clenched her teeth in anger and seemed to grow visibly agitated. \"Oh? If that's the case, you should get out of here you worthless ugly dog of a servant.\" Her words carried copious amounts of venom as she gracefully waved her hand in a \"shoo shoo\" manner. The muscular butler saw this and in a split second dashed forward within an instant and knocked out the guard with one swift punch before grabbing his unconscious body and hauling him out of the room to who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment before you got up and quickly readjusted your jacket. \"Uh, I guess I'll get going then.\" You said rather nervously as you turned to leave for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just where do you think you're going?\" Said the woman as she slowly took another sip from her tea. \"Come back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you turned around expecting the worst. \"Yes?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down.\" Said the woman as she motioned for you to take the seat opposite from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obliged and sat down next to her, not entirely sure what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably wondering who I am, and why I'm even talking to you, right?\" Asked the woman as you slowly nodded in response to her question. \"Well my name is Claire, and let's just say I hold a large stake in the BBC.\" Taking another sip of tea she eyed you carefully before her eyes suddenly went wide. \"Oh, I'm sorry, would you like some tea? How rude of me to not ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's completely fine.\" You responded, still not sure how to exactly respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyhow, why exactly did you try to sneak into the BBC? Didn't you realize it wouldn't be so easy to sneak past the guards? Only a handful of lucky individuals have ever managed to get access to the BBC without getting caught. Are you so naive that you thought you could be one of the lucky few?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I'm in a lot of debt and work for a casino. I'm a gambler at heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled at this. \"Haha, well I hope the gambling isn't the source of your debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was actually a loan shark, lady, err, my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Claire. You don't work for me so there's not much need to be formal. Anyhow you're an interesting character, Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just call me Jeff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jeff, you took a gamble by even coming here, and since you got this far and are interesting enough, I'll let you stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!?\" You asked ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're free to stay here. You have a good enough body that you could probably bet your way up and make some cash. If you do well enough out there, maybe I'll even let you challenge me.\" She said as she happily smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumping your fist in the air you headed out towards the door, only to realize you didn't even know how to get back to the main gambling lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hold on a minute.\" Said Claire as she quickly pulled out a walkie talkie and called for some assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before a man dressed as a butler came into the room. \"Yes my lady, did you need something? Do you need me to remove this man from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire waved her hand dismissively. \"No, nothing like that, well actually in a way I suppose it's true. I need you to escort this man back to the main lounge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant bowed before he opened the door for you to step through. Just as you were about to leave though, you heard Claire's voice from behind you. \"There is a catch to this arrangement Jeff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? And what's that?\" You asked as you turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire poured herself another cup of tea and ignored you as she took another sip. It was obvious she wouldn't let you in on whatever secret plan she had in store for you. Still, you felt pretty confident as you were now inside the BBC. All you had to do was win a couple of gambles and make enough cash to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of walking later and you were finally just a few steps away from the door to the main lounge. Strangely enough however, the pounding music from earlier seemed to be absent. Hesitantly you opened the door to see everyone inside focused solely on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a rat!\" \"A rat!\" \"How did a rat get inside?\" \"Why would they let a rat in?\" The people inside the lounge began to mutter incessantly about you causing you to grow increasingly more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, none of them will harm you as you're a guest.\" Said the servant, though that really didn't ease your mind very much.

You were about to dodge the bottle when the servant beside you surprisingly stepped in front of the flying object and blocked it with his body, his clothes becoming soaked with water in the process. The servant didn't even flinch as the water dripped down his pant leg and instead just adjusted his glasses as if it were a mere annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Said someone from the background, and you likely figured that it was whoever threw the water, though of course you didn't quite know who that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up everyone! This is our esteemed guest, and any intolerance towards him will be treated as if you are intolerant towards Lady Claire herself. Do I make myself clear, or would you prefer me to notify Lady Claire about this and interrupt her relaxation time?\" Said the servant as he spoke loudly and clearly, smirking slightly all the while. From the look on the servants face, he seemed rather serious, though a part of you felt like he was acting this way if only because he could now freely yell at the members of the B.B.C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was a nice looking place on the outside, the environment and personality of the various bettors leaved a lot to be desired, and it wasn't hard to imagine that some of the servants may be abused in some way. The servants actions could merely be a way for him to vent out his true thoughts and feelings, something you doubted he got much of a chance to do, if ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of this thought, you still felt the need to go to the bathroom, as you didn't want to jump into any gambles just yet, at least not with everyone's eyes watching you. That and you actually did sort of need to use the restroom. Leaning over to the servant you began to ask \"Where exactly is the bathroom located?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant took a brief glance at you before turning away and pointing towards a door at the far end of the room, opposite from where you were standing. \"Go into that hallway, and it should be the third door on the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much.\" you replied which caused the servant to smile. \"Don't mention it.\" He said as he began to walk off to who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way to the restroom you pushed your way through the crowd as a deathly silence filled the room. A little over half-way there, you could start to here a few mumbling voices, though you couldn't make out much of anything other than the word 'rat' getting thrown around a lot. As you continued to make your way down to the doorway, a large man wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and a pair of sandals bumped into your shoulder hard. \"Watch where you're going rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a second, gripping your shoulder before moving on as you ignored the man. This seemed to only egg on a few more members as a pretty woman wearing nothing but lingerie moved in your path and scoffed. \"I don't know what the hell Claire is thinking by letting you in. Consider yourself lucky you weren't forcibly stripped of your parts to the highest bidder.\" Said the woman as you sensed a bit of anger and disgust in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, poor guy won't even last 10 seconds in a gamble. Why don't you just give me your parts right now and I'll give you 1% of the profits. A couple of dollars should more than double your worth right?\" Said another man who then began to laugh at his own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want the parts of a rat?\" Spoke another woman.  \"I'm pretty sure none of the rejected would even bid on parts of such low quality like his. They're probably better off as they are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you were starting to feel extremely agitated, of course you knew you couldn't cause a scene. Even if you did you wouldn't be able to do much of anything, and you didn't really want to get kicked out of this place so soon when you didn't even make any money to relieve yourself of your debt. Finally you reached the door, and after hastily opening it and stepping inside the hallway you began to look for the bathroom. \"Third door on the left.\" you muttered as you continued forward. A few moments later you had found the restroom, though curiously the bathroom appeared to be mixed. The thought was a bit strange to you, but after thinking about how often people probably trade parts and even genders, it really didn't seem all that strange. You opened the restroom, only to hear the loud music from the main lounge spring back to life as the hypnotic rhythm reverberated in your eardrums. \"They'll probably forget about me soon enough\" You muttered as you stepped into the restroom and turned the corner of the small path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat awaited you in that bathroom, shook you to your very core. Inside a ton of people, all of them downcast and reeking of failure and desperation. Most of them were huddled on the ground crying their eyes out, however there were a few others standing by the sink or inside of the stalls. \"Dammit! I was so close to winning. If only I played the right card! Now I have nothing!\" Yelled a man as he began to sulk on the counter of the sink. Another man was punching the wall in anger over and over again, his fists bloodied and bruised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how could this happen to me?\" Asked the man as he took another swing at the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly bypassed him and made your way to one of the unoccupied stalls. \"I'm so ugly! I'm a hideous monster. I need to start all over again!\" Said a female, from within a stall as you heard her break down and cry. You walked past the stall and paid her no mind as you continued towards one of the unoccupied stalls to relieve yourself. This place was a pit of despair, and you knew you couldn't stay here for too long or it would suck away all of your confidence, similar to how a black hole swallows everything in it's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing your business you exited the stall and made your way over to the sinks to wash your hands as you prepared to get out of this dreadful place once and for all. Listening to the poor tortured souls that inhabited this room any longer would drive you mad. However, just as you were about to leave you noticed someone familiar in the corner of your eye. There standing in the corner near the exit was a young woman wearing a blue t-shirt and a plaid skirt, the same woman who stood behind you in line before you entered this club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you felt as though there was no need for you to intervene. After all she had lost a gamble of her own accord. Yet, something inside of your stomach was urging you to go and talk to her anyways. You slowly approached the woman and unsure of what to say, said the only thing you could think of. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman continued to cry, but calmed down a little bit as she turned around to see you. \"No, I'm not fine at all, but there's nothing I can do about it. I screwed up. I screwed up horribly.\" She said as she began to sulk even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened exactly?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned around and faced you as tears began to form in her eyes once more before flowing down her face and dropping onto her her shirt. \"I had recently come into some money after a family member died and left me some inheritance money. The only problem is that my family has been struggling really hard for the past few years, and recently both of my parents got sick and can't work anymore. I was invited to join this place a few years ago. I vowed never to come here, but now I don't have any choice. I don't want my family to eat meager crumbs, and I need to help pay for their medical bills before I run out of money entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the woman could continue any further you gave her a quick hug which caused her to cling to you tightly as she bawled even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to say anymore for me to understand. You came here to help your family, and now you've lost a gamble and have to lose some of your body parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman continued to cry, only to pause for a moment as she meekly said \"No, it's worse than that, I lost my entire body. I'm so scared, and I just don't know what to do. What's going to happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news shocked you, and you curiously asked for more information. \"Wait, did you lose a string of bets then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head at your question. \"No, I stupidly bet my entire body all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way? You really did that?\" You asked. The woman didn't respond, but from the way she was averting her gaze you could tell she wasn't lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman let go of you as she pulled out a tissue from her purse to wipe her eyes. 'I should get going now. I was only given a couple of minutes to say goodbye to this body. Thanks for the hug stranger, I really needed that.\" She quickly wiped away another tear before turning around to head back into the main lounge of the B.B.C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew this was none of your business, and yet you felt really bad for this girl, so much so that you wanted to help her get her body back. However a part of you also realized that this was a bad decision. Helping her might be morally right, but morals don't help you win a game of gambling. You had seen this first hand from working in the casino where many nice men and women had fallen to their knees in poverty by staking everything they had on resolving some sob story. You wouldn't be like them. You would rise the ranks and win with wit and skill. You had no time to help the downtrodden. And yet, despite these feelings, you still felt conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You called out as you ran out of the restroom. \"Hey!\" You repeated once more, before the woman finally turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded with...</span></div></div>",

Though, you still felt a bit concerned as you didn't even have any money to start over if you did lose your body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll help you.\" You said, rather unenthusiastically. The woman didn\u2019t notice this of course, and instead smiled brightly and ran up to give you a big hug, thanking you profusely all the while. You gave her a hug back, but ultimately didn't want to dally around for too long. \"So can you lead me to the one you lost to?\" You asked, figuring it was best to get this over with as quick as possible.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe woman let go of her embrace and nodded her head. \"Sure thing! By the way, my name\u2019s Sarah.\" She said before digging into her purse to pull out a tissue to blow her nose.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sarah huh? Well it's nice to meet you my name is Jeff.\" You replied as you flashed a small smile.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Sarah said as she turned around towards a nearby trashcan to throw the tissue away. \"Let's head out then.\" She said as she rubbed her eyes before grabbing your hand and walking towards the door. You weren't quite expecting her to grab your hand, and while you weren't opposed to it, holding hands with a pretty woman was a foreign concept to you. Sarah seemed to pick up on this, as she slowed down a little and turned her head back towards you. \"Sorry if this seems a bit strange. I just don't want to lose you in the crowd. After all you\u2019re my only hope Jeff.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem at all.\" You said as you continued to follow closely behind her before finally making your way to the main lounge door. Opening the door you were once again greeted by the loud rhythm of the music as fellow members of the Body Bettors Club danced to the hypnotic beat. A few of the people there seemed to eye you briefly, but most of them ignored you after a few seconds, seemingly uninterested in anything you had to offer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"He's right there, the one sitting at the table,\" said Sarah, as she pointed with her free hand towards an athletic looking man who was busy shuffling a deck of cards. Standing right next to him was a beautiful woman with long wavy black hair wearing French maid attire. While you had been in the club for a bit of time, the woman's attire seemed a bit strange for this area, as you were sure that the normal servants at the B.B.C. were all wearing uniforms that were more akin to that of a fancy waiter or waitress. Was she even a servant in the first place? Maybe this was some sort of perk of being a member of the B.B.C.?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh I see, you\u2019re back Sarah.\u201d The man said as his eyes wandered over Sarah\u2019s body, examining every inch and curve. A few moments passed before the man finally took notice of you, and began to raise his eyebrow. \"Oh, and what is this rat doing here? I won your body fair and square Sarah, you can't just back out by giving me someone else's body in exchange. Things don't work that way, though I honestly can't say I'm surprised. You probably promised this rat sex so you could keep your body. Well I'm sorry, but this isn't college, you can't just go around giving people 'favors' to get what you want.\" The man said, putting a very heavy emphasis on the word favors.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No you have it wrong, I'm not that kind of girl at all. I would never do something like that. Jeff here just offered to help me himse-\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ha, as if I believe that you little slut,\" interrupted the man as he started to laugh harder and harder at the whole thing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe way this man was acting was extremely uncalled for, and he was actually starting to piss you off. Moving up towards the table you sat opposite from the man. \"Listen jackass, I'm here to win this woman's body back. She didn't promise me anything at all, I'm doing this of my own free will. So cut the crap and put your body parts where your mouth is.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you said this the man stopped laughing as he stared at you coldly. \"Heh, I'm not scared of you at all. Don't think for a second I'll turn your offer down. You could really learn some manners, and without a body to control I\u2019m sure it will be easy enough for you to learn,\u201d said the man as he slowly looked over towards the woman in the maid's costume. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right Naomi?\u201d He asked smugly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, master, that is correct,\" replied the woman as she flashed the man a smile.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Anyhow, let's play a game shall we?\" Said the man as he turned back to you before motioning to a deck of cards resting on the table. \"How about a game of blackjack? Is that alright with you?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That's fine by me.\" You said as you scooted your chair up a bit. \"Let the games begin!\"</span></div></div>",

Last I checked we\u2019re about the same age. Besides, isn\u2019t it rude anyhow to not introduce yourself first?\u201d You retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I would introduce myself first if you weren\u2019t a piece of vermin gutter trash, but since you asked my name is Steve Hartner. So now that I\u2019ve answered your question, what\u2019s your name, vermin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually started to anger you a bit, as you slammed your hands down on the table and leaned forward. \u201cThe name of the man who will beat you is known as Jeff.\u201d You said, smirking back at the man, though he didn\u2019t seem to care at all. He seemed to not be taking you very seriously. It was then you realized that this man was trying on purpose to rile you up so you wouldn\u2019t be able to think properly. After realizing this you calmed yourself down a little just in time for Naomi to arrive with one of the servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you all need a dealer then? I\u2019d be happy to assist.\u201d The servant then quickly pulled out a Body Bettors Club Staff ID to show that he was a legitimate dealer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be playing blackjack this time.\u201d Said Steve as he handed the servant the deck of cards. \u201cNow shuffle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the servant began to shuffle the cards at a rapid pace. Honestly watching him in the process was unlike anything you had ever seen before. You were pretty good at shuffling cards back at the casino, but this guy was on a whole other level. It was rather impressive actually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then Jeff the rat, what will you be betting today? An arm, a leg, maybe your torso?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I\u2019d like to bet the lower half of my body if that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Eager to lose are we? Very well, the lower body it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more moments passed before the servant then dispatched two cards to both you and Steve, one card face up, while the other card was face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully looked over your cards, to find a King of spades, and a face up 8 of hearts. It wasn\u2019t the best hand in the world, but it was fairly decent. Steve on the other hand had a 9, and some other card that was face down. Best to play this safely and just stand. You didn\u2019t want to go bust that early after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant turned towards you. \u201cStand or hit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI stand as well.\u201d Said Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that round one was over. You both reached for your face down card and flipped it over to reveal that your final total was 18 while Steve\u2019s was a 19!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt your legs go limp and lifeless. Try as you might you couldn\u2019t move them at all. \u201cHey my legs won\u2019t move! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d You asked as you struggled in vain to get them to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving trouble moving our legs are we? Let\u2019s see if I can help you out. Go ahead and stand vermin!\u201d All of a sudden you popped out of your chair against your own free will. \u201cOh? It seems like you can move your legs just fine? Maybe you should try walking around a little before we continue though? Really keep that blood flowing.\u201d Still without control your legs began to move, causing you to walk around in small circles before plopping you back down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou! You\u2019re doing this aren\u2019t you?\u201d You yelled, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough to figure it out huh? Those legs are mine now, and I can control them all I want. The only way you\u2019ll ever be able to control your legs again is if I let you control them, you win your legs back, or your life is in danger, and ss far as I\u2019m concerned, you should just forfeit now and relinquish your whole body to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you knew this wasn\u2019t a valid choice at all. You had to keep playing or else you wouldn\u2019t be able to pay off your debt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naomi, get me another drink would you? I\u2019m all out of iced tea.\u201d Steve requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing master,\u201d and with that the cute maid ran off to grab another cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then vermin, what exactly will you be wagering against me this time? An arm? Your head? Your-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to wager my whole upper body for my lower body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re risking everything on some final shot huh? You must either be very eager to lose that body, or you\u2019re very stupid. Of course it really doesn\u2019t matter in the end. You were destined to lose your body in this club. If not to me, then to someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m certainly not going to lose to you. Come on, let\u2019s play another match shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo be it. Shuffle the cards again and deal the cards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant picked up the cards and shuffled the deck once more before dealing the cards to both of you. As luck would have it, you managed to get lucky and get a perfect 21 with just two cards. Steve on the other hand ended up with an 18 and ended up losing the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I won!\u201d You proclaimed victoriously, as you realized you could now move your legs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve on the other hand didn\u2019t seem very concerned with your win, and instead had a smug look on his face, as if he was still in control. \u201cYou just got lucky. You should quit now while you're ahead.\"</span></div></div>",

As a means to establish some form of hierarchy within themselves, the world's wealthiest families created on under water gambling ring to compete amongst themselves. Seeing the most desirable things of the world could easily be bought, the founders sought to bet something money could not buy true beauty. Now many years later, the next generation has created a massive network, linking every country of the world into the practice. New members, old members the <b>B.B.C</b> or <b>Body Bettors Club</b> has created their own hierarchy for the worlds rich. Hotter the better, the men,women, and everything in-between run this club and everyone wants in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">------------</span><br>\r\n<b>Setting</b><br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">------------</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low lit, massive fully transparent <span class=\"cindigo\">underwater</span> facility filled with every game and sport conceivable. Lounges and colorful bright lights are abundant, Flashing and strobing to the beat of high energy almost night club like music, it screams sex and life. Club members can be seen commuting back and forth through massive transparent underwater tunnels. The club is often visited by poor onlookers from nearby underwater metropolises, constantly looking from the outside in on the elite engaging in the sexist rituals they've ever witnessed.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">-----------------------------------------------</span><br>\r\n<b>Hierarchy and Universe Laws</b><br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">-----------------------------------------------</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMembers of the <b>B.B.C</b> are separated into three distinct ranks based on a individual's win streak,attractiveness,and time inside the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Rat:</span> the lowest demeanor, common, broke people completely looked down upon by all ranks, entirely unwelcomed in the BBC.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">Rabble</span>: The second lowest demeanor, usually includes people of new wealth, (I.e. lottery winners etc) or poor people that managed to blend in well enough to go unnoticed. Mainly preyed upon by Regents, most Rabble are very average or below average looking people either having all their original body parts or the leftovers from people of higher ranking. Most Rabble can be seen either masturbating or having sex in many areas. At a certain win streak Rabble rank up after gaining the knowledge to do mental swaps. Rabble can ONLY place body part bets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">Regents</span>: The most populous rank, usually includes fairly attractive people with decent win streaks. Most Regents compete amungst themselves, taking heavy pride in their winnings. The higher the win streak the less clothing they tend to wear. Regents can be seen wearing skimpy clothing and gather amongst themselves. At a certain win streak a Regent can rank up after gaining the knowledge to swap or take any aspect of someone else. Regents can place body part bets AND mental swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">Royals</span>: The least populous rank, includes long time club members with long and very impressive win streaks. Royals can be easily noticed by there highly attractive bodies which they show off 24/7 when they walk around completely naked. Usually fairly snobby they look down upon any who can match their level of attractiveness. After a certain point long time some Royals grow bored and swap their entire body with a Rabble individual and start over. Some Royals even have multiple bodies! Royals have access to swap OR take any aspect of someone else after winning a bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe B.B.C is only open to the rich by invitations from existing club members, although on a very rare occasion a stray poverty ridden individual sneaks in and goes unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a person losses their entire body they are reduced to a soul to inhabit unoccupied bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">---------</span><br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">---------</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly human to human swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLonger the chapter the more GPs awarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew characters are welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwaps can occur in any you see fit, but try keep the method consistent throughout each story path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin color automatically adjusts per swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotter the chapter the more gift points awarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-mail me if you have any further questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">-----------------</span><br>\r\n<b>Characters</b><br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">-----------------</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stephanie</b>: Rank: <span class=\"ctan\">Rabble</span>, 18, female straight, white, 5'6 with short black hair and B-Cup breasts. She was in her last year of high school when she discover a mysterious letter inviting her to the B.B.C. Although her family themselves are not overly wealthy, she is friends with a multitude of wealthy students in her school. Smart but somewhat oblivious, she is a very polite girl who grew in a very conservative household, having never been with a boy nor has ever seen a male naked, she is completely ignorant to the male anatomy, only knowing what her friends describe from their adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>John</b>: Rank: <span class=\"ctan\">Rabble</span>, 19, male, straight, white, 5'10 with short dark brown hair and fairly athletic build. Oldest son of one of the richest families in London, he recently was allowed to join the club after over hearing a group of girls in his morning college classes talk about their experience. Cocky, brash, and arrogant he looks at the B.B.C as just another challenge he can conquer. Has a crush on Veronica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Veronica</b>: Rank <span class=\"clteal\">Regent</span>, 22, female, bisexual, mixed asian, 5'6 with long black hair and D-Cup breasts. One of the hottest girls on John's college campus, she is a fairly seasoned veteran of the B.B.C. Not an overly curvy girl, she makes up for her short comings with her newly won perfectly round breasts, which she's be flaunting for weeks now. Feisty and competitive, she rarely loses a bet and cherishes her original God givin glories. Has a fierce rivalry with Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Leah</b>: Rank: <span class=\"clteal\">Regent</span>, 25, female, bisexual, white, 5'5 with short blond hair and C-Cup breasts. Previously the fairly nerdy and eccentric best friend of John, Liam, he has been completely absorbed into the B.B.C. Having never seen him in weeks, John has no clue of how far Liam has gone. Winning bet after bet, Leah has one of the largest winning streaks amoungest Regents. After trading her previous personality and memories with Casey, Leah is now a hot spunky young woman with no memories of her previous life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Zhu</b>: Rank: <span class=\"clteal\">Regent</span>, 20, male, straight, asian, 5'9, with a somewhat below average build. Having kept his involvement in the B.B C a secret from his friends, Zhu has one of the worst losing streaks amoungest Regents, having only gained his rank from time alone. Winning and losing, Zhu looks mostly the same when John reconnects with him in the club. Horrible at almost everything, it doesn't damper on his mood at all. Easygoing and fun loving, even if he knows he isn't going to win that doesn't stop him from challenging any hot female Royal he can find, just for a shot at getting his hands on some breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Casey</b>: Rank: <span class=\"clteal\">Regent</span>, 34, female, gay, white, 5'5, with perky E-Cup breasts. A very curvy woman, she is one of the oldest Regents. Previously having a long winning streak as a Rabble member, she had been on a downhill spiral for years. Losing bet after bet she somehow still managed to maintain her very attractive figure and innocent smile. After losing a recent bet with Leah, Casey has the mind and memories of John's best friend Liam. Loud and perverted she acts nothing like the hot trophy wife she appears as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Reginald</b>: Rank: <span class=\"cgrape\">Royal</span>, 25, male, straight, Black, with a Olympic God like figure. Pompous and cocky he sports the longest winning streak in the club. A borderline mystery, he is always seen walking around naked while being followed by a large crowd of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sabrina</b>: Rank: <span class=\"cgrape\">Royal</span>, 20, female, straight, white, with DD-Cup breasts. Rarely seen not having sex with someone, she has no qualms whatsoever about showing off her body to any onlookers. Open and very outspoken, she struts her tattooed covered body around completely naked. She is seen as the poster child for anyone seeking the perfect female body in the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </td>",
