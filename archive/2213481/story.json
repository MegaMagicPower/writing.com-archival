The blue coffee mug, which had a large \"GET UP\" logo on it as a reference to the program he hosts on ESPN, was now huge compared to you. As you placed your tiny hands on the coffee mug and peeked your head out from behind your hiding spot, you could feel the burning hot coffee inside the mug. From your position, you could see the gigantic Mike Greenberg in a blue checkered suit and crisp white dress shirt attentively shuffling through some papers on his desk. It looked like he was reviewing his notes for the TV show that would be going live soon. He was also browsing some sports websites on his tablet, which was just to his left. You were quite shocked when you noticed he was looking at pictures of nude women on the tablet too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure about what to do next. You were hesitant about getting the giant's attention, and you quickly retreated behind the coffee mug when Mike's eyes shifted in your direction. Luckily he didn't see you, although it was a close call. It was incredibly quiet all of a sudden, and you were afraid to move for fear of giving up your hiding spot. Just when you thought you were safe, you felt a cold gust of air. Looking up, you saw a bright white dress shirt cuff sticking out from the sleeve of a jacket. It then occurred to you that Mike's huge hand was reaching for his coffee mug. The coffee mug was lifted off the desk and you collapsed to your knees as Mike brought it to his mouth and took a sip, still oblivious to your presence. You felt extremely vulnerable and were nervously awaiting the moment Mike would set his eyes on you, but he remained unaware of you. The Get Up! anchor was focused on his tablet as he lowered the coffee mug. You had to stealthily roll out of the way as the mug came crashing down on the desk, or else you would have certainly been crushed beneath the large mug. As you moved out of the way, Mike was inclined to turn his head. It was at that point the giant noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is this? Is this really a tiny man or am I dreaming?\" Mike stated as his huge face leaned in above the desk to get a better look at you. You watched the giant squint and frown as he tried to comprehend how you got so small. You immediately got up, contemplating running away, but the next thing you saw was Mike's massive hand coming towards you at an accelerated rate. \"Come here you,\" he said dryly as he wrapped his warm hand around your body and lifted you off the desk, only your head sticking out from the top of Mike's fist. \"I didn't expect this coming into work today, that's for sure!\" he stated in an enthusiastic and exaggerated manner as his eyes remained fixated on you. \"Were you watching me this whole time? You probably saw the photos of nude women I was looking at,\u201d he added casually and unashamedly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, but I still think I should flick that memory out of your brain!\" Mike eagerly nodded his head. You then saw Mike's other hand approaching, only for him to bounce his middle finger off of his thumb to flick you in the face three times. \"POW! POW! POW!\" he shouted with each violent flick to your face. The ESPN anchor couldn't stop chuckling as he watched you get beaten hard by his solid finger, his rigid, perfectly trimmed nail slamming into your face. After he was done flicking you, you were left with a few cuts on your face. \"I could definitely have some fun with you!\" the giant announced loudly, his eyes growing wide and maniacal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already getting abused, and this was just the beginning as Mike decided to...</span></div></div>",

The TV host then opened his fist, allowing you to drop onto the large circular desk, where you landed somewhat painfully on your stomach, on the glass surface. Almost immediately afterwards, you felt Mike jab his powerful index finger into the middle of your back, keeping you pinned down despite your frantic movements. \u201cOoh, I like this position you\u2019re in,\u201d Mike teased. \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep you like this.\u201d Holding you down with his finger, Mike used his free hand to cut a piece of tape from the tape dispenser nearby. You cringed when you heard the sharp sound of the piece of tape being ripped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was eerily silent as Mike carefully draped the huge transparent strip of tape over your back, rubbing it back and forth, and then firmly rubbing the extremities into the glass surface on either side of you with his forefinger. The tip of Mike\u2019s tongue stuck out of his mouth as he concentrated on taping you down properly. Mike\u2019s calm demeanour juxtaposed your frenetic struggles; in fact, Mike was humming a pleasant tune to himself during the process. The sensation of the tape on your back was very uncomfortable and unnatural; you definitely felt trapped now. You kept moving your arms and legs around in protest, but Mike was fast and efficient in taping down each of your arms and legs so that you could not move at all. Mike took a moment to admire the sight of your tiny body stuck on the desk, your entire backside exposed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re nice and stuck now.\u201d Mike lowered his hand onto you, covering your entire body, and pressed down on you. You groaned as the pressure from the giant hand was intense. Mike\u2019s demented laughter echoed around you as your body was essentially smooshed against the glass desk, his hand easily overwhelming and dwarfing you. The TV host eventually lifted his hand off of you and you were relieved, if only for a short while. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cute little ass I\u2019d like to play with!\u201d Mike exclaimed. You could only look ahead and brace yourself as Mike\u2019s large index finger came down with incredible force and smacked your ass cheeks. \u201cHow do you like that? Huh?\u201d The giant then smacked your ass with his huge finger multiple times, and each time you responded by screaming and jerking your ass up from the surprising strikes. \u201cYou naughty little boy! I love the way your butt cheeks jiggle like Jell-O when I smack \u2018em!\u201d You tried to lift yourself up to hopefully unstick the tape that was keeping you down, to no avail. Your face and your butt cheeks turned bright red, and you started to sweat from the intense pain. When Mike stopped striking your little ass, he moved on to...</span></div></div>",

You looked around and noticed that you were on a news set. NBC12 news anchor Brent Solomon soon walked into the studio wearing a solid black suit with a white dress shirt and silver tie. A bright red pocket square was tucked into his breast pocket, adding a pop of color to the news anchor's otherwise traditional outfit. The giant spotted you from afar, and you watched in a state of fear as his thunderous footsteps approached you, his shoes slamming against the shiny tile floor. You were too shaken to make a run for it. A few large steps later, Brent stopped right before you and bent down, his huge body casting a shadow over you and blocking out the news studio's lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is an interesting discovery,\" he said in his distinct, baritone voice. \"Come to papa...\" You let out a pathetic, mousy squeak as the newsman reached out and grabbed the back of your T-shirt collar. He began lifting you off the floor as he stood back up to his full height. You kicked your tiny legs around in a panicked state as the news anchor's position shifted. You found yourself being raised higher and higher between the sturdy grip of Brent's index finger and thumb. You looked down with wide eyes, a feeling of danger and uncertainty filling the pit of your stomach as you were lifted farther from the floor. You were incredibly uncomfortable as you felt your T-shirt sliding up your body due to Brent's tight grip on the collar. You caught a quick glimpse of Brent's characteristic larger-than-life smile as he brought you to face-level, his huge white teeth shimmering under the NBC12 studio's bright fluorescent lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you suddenly felt yourself drop from his grip as your head came loose from your T-shirt collar, causing your bare-chested body to clumsily free fall. It happened so fast, and the experience was quite terrifying; you thought you were going to land on the floor and meet your end in an instant. Brent's deep laughter echoed in your surroundings while he watched you helplessly fall through the air. He did not intend for your T-shirt to come off, but he still found the situation amusing. Brent placed his left hand beneath you, ultimately stopping your fall. You emitted a grunt as you landed abruptly on your back onto Brent's open hand. Of course, you were relieved that you did not hit the floor, but you were still stuck with this giant news anchor whose intentions were unclear and potentially malicious. Brent stationed himself right behind the news anchor desk and raised his hand to his face to get a better look at you. You stared into his globe-like eyes, the pupils a dark brown color on the pure white eyeballs. His chocolate face looked flawless and glossy, almost airbrushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, that was a close one, little man,\" he stated, his foul-smelling breath blowing over your body. You knew that you would not be getting your T-shirt back anytime soon, although this should have been the least of your worries. You could see from the corner of your eye that Brent Solomon was rubbing your tiny T-shirt between his right index finger and thumb, enjoying the sensation of the soft cotton as it flattened out between his lively fingers. Brent noticed you watching him aggressively caress your T-shirt between his fingers, and he finally let go of the T-shirt, allowing the tiny piece of clothing to slowly fall towards the floor. \"You won't be needing your T-shirt anymore,\" he stated confidently, followed by a laugh. \"Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not into dudes,\" the news anchor continued, feeling it was necessary to assert his sexuality in this moment. \"So don't get any ideas, little man,\" he said with a more stern voice, wagging his index finger at you. \"Count yourself lucky I'm letting you keep your shorts on. Although, I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious to know what tiny thing you are hiding under there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's tone was deep and serious as he purposefully snaked his skinny index finger into the leg of your shorts. You were simultaneously horrified and mesmerized as you watched the giant's black finger digging into the leg of your shorts, in order to get to your hardening dick. Your shorts fabric was being stretched to maximum capacity to accommodate Brent\u2019s huge forefinger, the material crinkling and cracking as the news personality actively shifted his finger about. You felt Brent's cold forefinger brushing against your inner thigh as he moved the invasive finger around. You hated to admit that the direct contact on your skin was both foreign and undeniably arousing. Brent stubbornly kept trying to force his huge finger upwards, attempting to push more of his finger into the leg of your shorts, your entire body starting to move upwards as a result of the forceful act. You didn\u2019t bother to struggle for you knew your efforts against the giant would be futile, and strangely enough you were beginning to enjoy yourself a bit. Brent finally gave up on his little game though, and you were left somewhat disappointed as he removed his finger from the bottom of your shorts. You secretly wanted Brent to take your shorts off once and for all, since your cock was quite hard by now due to the teasing event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of that,\" Brent said, eyeing you over carefully. \"What can I do with you?\" He rubbed his bearded chin several times in a pensive fashion as he thought about what he wanted to do next with his tiny find.</span></div></div>",

As you were trying to wrap your head around your situation, you were interrupted by the sound of footsteps outside the room you were in. You knew someone was standing in front of the door because a harsh yet incomprehensible voice startled you. The door then opened and you jumped nervously when you saw Stefan G\u00f6dde walk in, now massive compared to you. It occurred to you that this was his private lounge room. Your eyes were glued to the stunning titan, who was wearing a shiny silver suit. He walked over to a table which had a jug of water on it, and he poured himself a glass, filling it up almost to the rim. For some odd reason, you gained great pleasure in watching him down the water. Stefan\u2019s thirsty, exaggerated gulps actually amused you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly snapped out of your staring tendency when you noticed that the television host was moving towards you. In fact, he was going to sit on the couch that was next to the side table. As Stefan approached, the glass table beneath you rattled due to his footsteps. At this point there was nowhere to hide; you were fully exposed and you panicked when the giant\u2019s eyes briefly locked onto you. Before you knew it, Stefan was towering over the table with a grin. You looked around, trying to decide if jumping off the table was a smart decision. Stefan placed his glass of water on the table, dangerously close to you, and you gasped when it came crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d Stefan announced, his powerful and decisive voice reverberating in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Galileo TV presenter\u2019s huge hand came towards you and all you saw next was a wall of peachy flesh which totally engulfed your body. You squirmed relentlessly in Stefan\u2019s tight fist as he sat down on the luxurious leather couch. He brought his fist to his face and attentively observed it with a sort of maniacal look. He felt your violent struggles and thoroughly enjoyed having a little man in his fist. He gave you a good squeeze which caused you to groan pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan finally opened his fist, and you were thankful for the light and fresh air. Your entire body was aching from the pressure of Stefan\u2019s grip, your hair was messed up, and you were sweating profusely due to the sauna-like conditions in Stefan\u2019s fist. You looked up at the TV host with resentment as your two-inch body was cupped in his left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are the chances? I can\u2019t believe my fortune, of finding a tiny person here. It\u2019s as if you\u2019ve been delivered just for me,\u201d Stefan said excitedly. \u201cNow, tell me your name,\u201d he demanded. Stefan waited for a response. You told him your name but he could not hear you at your tiny size. \u201cHa! That\u2019s very pathetic! I didn\u2019t even catch your name. Can\u2019t hear your little mouse voice. But, I can assure you I don\u2019t really care what your name is or how this happened to you. What I can say is that this will be interesting, won\u2019t it?\u201d The charming Stefan surveyed you with a grimace which seriously unsettled you. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of time to spare before being called for my presenting duties too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The way Stefan was speaking to you made you feel so helpless. Despite your current situation, you started to develop a slight erection. You tried to casually hide your growing excitement from Stefan by covering your cock with both of your hands. Of course, the German giant noticed your arousal and planned to take advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm. I see what\u2019s going on there,\u201d Stefan noted almost scientifically, referring to your erection. You were embarrassed to say the least as Stefan commented on your strange and sudden surge of pleasure. \u201cCome on, get those hands outta the way and let me see what you\u2019re hiding,\u201d the television presenter chided while forcefully pushing your arms to the side with his outstretched index finger. \u201cOh,\u201d Stefan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cute little dick,\u201d he remarked, clearly enjoying the situation. You blushed profusely as the tip of his index finger met your cock. He carelessly flicked your cock about with the massive finger, pushing it left and right, up and down several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... please... stop,\u201d you cried, gripping onto the giant\u2019s stone-hard finger and twisting your body about in a defiant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously nowhere near the size of my cock,\u201d he stated with a twinkle in his eye, emitting a slight chuckle and ignoring your desperate struggles. The TV host\u2019s persistent yet haphazard motions, as well as the teasing words, made your cock come to life even more. Stefan pressed the tip of his finger against your cock head, feeling the thin flow of precum emerge from the slit. He then spread the precum that was on the tip of his finger onto your little chest. When Stefan unexpectedly squeezed your dick between his huge index finger and thumb, you naturally dug your body into his rough palm. His fingers completely overwhelmed your cock for how small it was. \u201cYes. That\u2019s it,\u201d Stefan cooed, his giant, cold fingers pumping your cock at a steady pace. \u201cRelax and enjoy this, little man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan\u2019s soothing voice sent shivers down your spine and your squirming gradually subsided. You closed your eyes momentarily, giving in to Stefan as you focused on the intense experience. You felt like you were close to cumming already, but you really didn\u2019t want to give Stefan that satisfaction. You knew you were about to cum though when your body started to shake and your face was burning up. Stefan lifted you closer to his face, bringing his hand right below his chin. You opened your eyes when you felt the increase in elevation, and you were surprised to be confronted by Stefan\u2019s big face in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hungry eyes watched your body closely as he handled your little cock between his marshmallow soft fingers. Stefan was amazed at how he could feel your foreskin stretching up and then retracting with each fervent stroke he carried out. Stefan was breathing quite heavily now; you could feel the warm blasts over your body. His own excitement was apparent as a large bulge formed in his silver dress pants. You were completely flustered watching the massive fingers jerk you off in such an abusive fashion, your cock barely visible between the large, powerful digits which flattened and squeezed the erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm, you\u2019re close,\u201d the TV presenter remarked, effectively increasing the speed of his stroking motions. \u201cI can feel it. Soon enough you\u2019ll be cumming. You don\u2019t have to be so oppositional, little one,\u201d he continued, clearly egging you on as you got closer to losing control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, the moment arrived. Your legs tensed up and you let out what felt like an endless stream of warm cum between Stefan\u2019s fingers. As you did so, your gaze was fixed on the giant\u2019s face, and you emitted a satisfied sigh which elicited a smile from Stefan. You lazily jerked your head forward several times in an exasperated, dazed state, your mouth agape and your body still trembling following the big release. Stefan continued to pump your throbbing, red cock as the last bit of cum coated his fingers. You were secretly disappointed that it all ended so quickly, less than two minutes in. Stefan let go of your cock and you watched as thin strings of cum were attached from your sore cockhead to the news presenter's index finger and thumb. He enthusiastically rubbed his huge fingers together, as if to spread your cum all over both fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was quite nice, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Stefan asked, still rubbing the wet substance around between his excited fingers. You were too exhausted to even move, let alone say anything as your orgasm gradually subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Some of your cum left a wet trace on his nose. \"Hmmmmmm, it has a very strong smell,\" the TV personality remarked, only to lower his large index finger towards you. \"Smell your cum,\" he said in a stern voice, pushing his supple fingertip into your face until the back of your head was firmly pinned down against the palm of his hand. Your face immediately got wet from the cum-soaked fingertip, and you had no choice but to inhale the powerful odor of cum that invaded your senses. It was incredibly difficult to breathe and you thought you were going to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard the next command as Stefan raised his finger slightly, inviting a breeze of cool air. \"You smelled the mess you made and now you're going to lick it off my finger,\" he said, placing the imposing index finger onto your face with a bit less force. You were initially troubled by the giant's demand but not wanting to upset him, you reluctantly stuck out your tongue and began to lick up your cum. You swept your tiny tongue along the vast expanse of Stefan's soggy fingertip, collecting the salty liquid between gagging fits. Stefan moved his finger up and down so that you could lick up the entire surface of cum-soaked flesh. You could hear the giant man humming in satisfaction. \"Yes, that's a good boy,\" Stefan added cruelly, finding your torment rather amusing. The news presenter started to laugh as your little tongue tickled his fingertip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had licked the puddle of cum off the giant's forefinger, Stefan lifted his index finger away from your face. You witnessed his huge thumb descend from above, only for it to be planted onto your face. You immediately knew what had to be done, and you begrudgingly licked up your love liquid from his giant thumb. \"How does it taste?\" Stefan playfully rubbed his thumb around in a circular motion, spreading some of your cum onto your small face. By the time you completed the humiliating task, you felt sick to your stomach. You were unable to get the taste of cum off your lips, and the wet cum that Stefan eagerly spread on your face started to dry up and harden. Stefan simply watched you in your miserable state with a smile on his face. You were feeling somewhat courageous now and were desperate to escape from the giant. The TV personality was intrigued as you slowly got to your feet. Much to the giant's surprise, you pulled a quick one on him and darted...</span></div></div>",
